Sinnott - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Today's call will include prepared remarks by Steve Mollenkopf and George Davis. In addition, Christiano Amon, Alex Rogers, and Don Rosenberg will join the question-and-answer session. You can access our earnings release and a slide presentation that accompany this call on our Investor Relations website.

Mollenkopf - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Thank you, John, good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report better-than-expected results in our fourth fiscal quarter, completing a year where we saw strong performance across our chip businesses, healthy global demand growth for 3G\/4G devices, and we expanded on Qualcomm's fundamental leadership in 5G technologies.","I am particularly pleased with the actions our teams have taken this year to advance the strategic objectives we set for the company. Almost two years ago, we set an ambitious target to significantly grow our serviceable available market by 2020. This past year saw substantial progress in the most critical new opportunities for the company.","First, the announced acquisition of NXP provides important capabilities to grow our footprint in automotive, IoT and security. Second, we closed the RF front-end joint venture providing us with the remaining products and capabilities to fully compete in this growing area. Third, we announced the partnership with Microsoft to bring the advantages of low-power, high-performance computing to the mobile PC market.","In QCT, product demand and mix trends continue to be favorable and profitability improved again this quarter; now six quarters in a row of year-over-year growth in EBT and EBT margin expansion. For fiscal 2017, QCT EBT dollars grew more than 50% year-over-year driven by our strong product portfolio, favorable product mix, and growth in China and adjacent areas.","QCT revenues outside smartphones in adjacent areas were more than $3 billion in fiscal 2017, up more than 25% year-over-year driven by better-than-expected growth in auto, networking and IoT, as we continue to successfully execute on our strategy to extend our mobile technologies into these new growth areas.","We continue to see good trends in our business in China. We increased our share in fiscal 2017 with approximately 25% year-over-year growth in both QCT revenues and MSM chip shipments to Chinese OEMs. And looking ahead, we are pleased to see 5G momentum there, including our 5G NR trial with China Mobile.","In QTL, the second half of fiscal 2017 results were impacted by disputes with Apple and its contract manufacturers, as well as one other licensee. And we remain focused on defending our business and the value of our patented inventions for the long-term.","3G\/4G trends around the world are very positive. We are pleased to see that global shipments of 3G\/4G devices remain strong, and we continue to forecast calendar 2017 device shipments to grow 6% year-over-year at the midpoint.","Looking ahead to calendar 2018, we forecast stronger growth with 3G\/4G device shipments expected to grow approximately 8% year-over-year at the midpoint, reflecting continued handset shipment growth, as well as stronger year-over-year growth in non-handsets.","In addition, estimated global 3G\/4G device ASPs are trending better-than-expected with ASPs in fiscal 2017 flat versus fiscal 2016. The favorable end market trends for 3G\/4G, the accelerating commercial timing for 5G, as well as the adoption of wireless technologies into new industries continues to be very positive for us. And our global scale, combined with our technology and product road map, are leading the industry.","We are very excited about the increased momentum in 5G around the world. We are leading the industry and are accelerating the commercial launch of 5G across millimeter wave and sub-6 gigahertz in early 2019. We recently announced the world's first 5G data connection achieved on the Snapdragon X50 modem chip set, and our leading 5G 3GPP standards development, ongoing prototype efforts and are supporting global 5G new radio trials.","In September, we announced our 5G new radio millimeter wave prototype that will be used for interoperability testing with our infrastructure vendor partners along with our previously announced sub-6 gigahertz prototype. With 5G commercial devices shipping in 2019, we expect to further expand our product and technology leadership position in modems.","Gigabit LTE is the first step in network operator's transition to 5G, and there are now 41 operators in 24 countries supporting Gigabit LTE. We have demonstrated download speeds of greater than 1 gigabits using our X20 LTE modem in the U.S. with both Ericsson and Verizon, as well as Nokia and T-Mobile. Most leading device-makers are rapidly adopting Gigabit LTE into their device portfolios.","In the premium tier, our gigabit-enabled Snapdragon 835 now has more than 120 designs launched and in development, including recent flagship devices like the Samsung Galaxy Note 8, Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, LG V30, and the Xiaomi Mi MIX 2. We have also introduced new high-tier and mid-tier Snapdragon products to further expand our competitive position in China across all tiers.","Turning to our pending acquisition of NXP. We remain focused on the last few regulatory approvals. We believe this acquisition will provide us with greater scale in automotive, IoT, security and networking, with their highly complementary products and world-class sales channel, serving a long tail of customers that are driving growth.","Of the nine jurisdictions reviewing, we have approvals from five, including here in the U.S. and Taiwan with China and the EU the largest remaining. We are constructively working with each remaining regulator. And while the clock is stopped in Europe, there is nothing unexpected or surprising in that process for an acquisition of this size.","Significant effort was expended throughout the year on integration planning with NXP. Along with NXP, we continue to see this as an attractive deal for both our stockholders and NXP stockholders at $110 per share, as the combination brings together a comprehensive set of capabilities to address next generation auto and IoT devices. We continue to focus on closing the acquisition by the end of calendar 2017 with a potential for the close to slip into 2018 based on the current status of approvals.","On the regulatory matters, we are pursuing appeals and resolutions and are confident in the pro-competitive nature of our business. We will continue to appeal the KFTC ruling and look forward to presenting our case in the U.S. FTC matter in early 2019.","In Taiwan, we strongly disagree with the recently announced decision and have significant objections concerning the lack of due process that led to the decision. We will appeal and seek to stay the decision. The TFTC ruling was not by consensus. We understand there was dissent among the commissioners resulting in a split decision. We were also pleased to see the Taiwanese Ministry of Economic affairs publicly question the TFTC process and decision.","Finally, I would like to thank our employees for their hard work and focused execution throughout this past year. The team reported strong results in the product business validating both our strategy and the strength of our product portfolio. We will maintain our strong commitment to and focus on technology and product leadership as we drive innovation into new opportunities and toward the path of 5G.","I would now like to turn the call over to George.","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I will begin with comments on our fiscal fourth quarter and 2017 results, followed by our fiscal first quarter of 2018 guidance and some additional perspective on 2018 overall.","In our fiscal fourth quarter, we delivered non-GAAP revenues of $6 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.92. Performance was strong in our operating businesses relative to expectations, particularly in QCT. Non-GAAP EPS results exceeded the high end of our prior guidance range by $0.07 with the majority of that outperformance coming from QCT with the balance from QTL and better-than-expected performance in our investment portfolio.","QCT delivered strong results with revenues of $4.7 billion, reflecting MSM shipments above the midpoint of expectations. QCT EBT margin was 21%, above the high end of expectations on the higher unit volume, improved product mix, and product cost initiatives. QCT earnings before tax was up 42% year-over-year in the quarter.","In QTL, revenues were $1.2 billion and EBT margin was 68%, both above the midpoint of expectations, driven primarily by better-than-expected 3G\/4G device ASPs due to a favorable mix of premium tier devices, as well as strong ASPs from Chinese OEMs in the quarter.","Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses were up 3% sequentially, at the high end of expectations on increased 5G investment and litigation expenses as we continue to defend our business model on several fronts. Investment income in the quarter came in ahead of expectations due to market favorability as we nearly completed the liquidation of our RISC (11:42) portfolio in advance of the NXP deal close.","Our non-GAAP tax rate was 18% in the quarter, and our GAAP rate at 61% reflected the impact of the non deductible TFTC fine.","Now, turning to fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP revenues for the year were $23.2 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share were $4.28. Non-GAAP gross margin at 60% of revenues was a good story for the company in 2017 as strong gross margin performance in QCT nearly offset the impact of the licensing disputes.","Non-GAAP free cash flow was approximately $6.1 billion, down 15% year-over-year. We returned $4.6 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2017, including approximately $3.3 billion of cash dividends paid, an increase of 9% year-over-year; and $1.3 billion in share repurchases.","Turning to 3G\/4G devices. The trends were strong in fiscal 2017 with estimated global 3G\/4G device sales growing at a mid-single digit percentage year-over-year, consistent with prior expectations. Underpinning this growth was a flat ASP for global 3G\/4G devices versus fiscal 2016 despite some FX headwinds.","For calendar year 2017, we continue to forecast approximately 1.75 billion to 1.85 billion 3G\/4G device shipments, which projects growth of approximately 6% year-over-year at the midpoint, consistent with our prior estimates.","In QCT, we saw strong performance in fiscal 2017 with 52% year-over-year growth in earnings before tax dollars and EBT margin expansion of approximately 500 basis points to 17%. The business delivered these strong results despite the full year impact of the second source decision at Apple.","Three elements were the key drivers of the strength in QCT. First, we had a strong year-over-year growth in MSM shipments to OEMs based in China. Second, QCT revenues from adjacent areas, which includes auto, IoT, networking and mobile compute, grew more than 25% year-over-year and now provide revenues of just over $3 billion. Finally, QCT results also benefited from seven months of our RF360 joint venture, which closed in February; a very strong year overall for QCT.","In QTL, results in fiscal 2017 were impacted by the disputes with Apple and another licensee, primarily in the second half of the year, as well as by the increased cost of litigation and spending on brand defense. Absent these disputes, we believe revenue would've shown healthy year-over-year growth, in line with the strength of the underlying markets.","Let's now turn to our financial outlook for the first fiscal quarter of 2018. We estimate fiscal first quarter revenues to be in the range of approximately $5.5 billion to $6.3 billion, roughly flat sequentially at the midpoint.","We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $0.85 to $0.95 per share, down 2% sequentially at the midpoint. We anticipate first quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses to be down approximately 1% to 3% sequentially, on both seasonal and operating cost savings.","In QTL, we expect revenues of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion in the fiscal first quarter, approximately flat sequentially at the midpoint. We expect fiscal first quarter QTL EBT margin to be approximately 68% to 72%, flat to slightly up sequentially.","In QCT, we expect approximately 220 million to 240 million MSM chip shipments for the fiscal first quarter, up 5% sequentially at the midpoint, reflecting typical seasonality trend and strength in our product portfolio.","There's potential upside to these estimates on indications of a possible build ahead on a customer's flagship launch. We expect QCT's fiscal first quarter EBT margin to be approximately 18% to 20%, down slightly sequentially on product mix.","As a reminder, the fiscal first quarter is the seasonally strong fourth quarter for QCT and we expect the fiscal second quarter to reflect normal seasonal trends with lower demand for units impacting margins.","We estimate our non-GAAP fiscal first quarter 2018 tax rate to be approximately 7%, reflecting the lower mix of licensing revenues in our business at this time. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $60 million to $75 million in the fiscal first quarter. Net expense is up nearly $175 million on the effects of lower realized gains on sales of marketable securities and lower investment returns now that we have substantially completed the liquidation of our longer term investment portfolio and our holding assets in short-term liquid investments.","Turning to 2018. Consistent with last year, we're providing selective guidance points for the year. For calendar year 2018, 3G\/4G device shipments, we are estimating approximately 1.9 billion to 2 billion units, up approximately 8% at the midpoint, reflecting strong growth of 3G\/4G handsets in India and other emerging regions, as well as above-average growth in 3G\/4G non-handsets, primarily in IoT.","In fiscal 2018, we expect mid-single digit percentage growth in global 3G\/4G device sales year-over-year, and estimate that the global 3G\/4G device ASP will decline at a low-single digit percentage year-over-year, primarily from strong unit growth in the non-handset category at lower ASPs. This includes our estimate that global 3G\/4G handset ASPs will be roughly flat year-over-year with continued ASP growth for Chinese OEMs (18:33) premium tier handsets, offset by increasing shipments into lower ASP emerging regions.","We estimate our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 7%, lower versus fiscal 2016, reflecting a full year assumed impact of lower licensing revenues resulting from the licensing disputes with Apple and the other licensee.","That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to John.","John T. Sinnott - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Thank you, George. Operator, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Tal Liani from Bank of America, please go ahead with your question. And, Tal Liani, your line is open. There is no response from that line. And Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity, please go ahead with your question.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","This is Matt Ramsay on for the team and Mike. Steve, you might have seen there has been some sort of questions about the position of your chipset business with premium tier OEMs going forward. And it occurred to us that with 5G trials coming online and lots of work being done both with carriers and with those premium OEMs as the industry moves toward 5G, you guys might be well-positioned to retain and maybe even expand some of those positions. So maybe you could talk a little bit about the competitive position of your QCT business for 5G and the engagements that you have on the OEM and with the carriers as we move forward in those trials? Thank you.","Steven M. Mollenkopf - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Hi, Mike (sic) [Matt] (20:39), it's Steve. I didn't hear the front part of that. And also, it's kind of hard for me to talk about rumors or any particular, let's say, media report. I will say that our road map and the positioning of, in particular, our modem road map, we feel very good about. Not only the ones that are already launched, but if you look at the upgrades that are going to occur to LTE upstream of 5G and then when you get to 5G, I think we're going to be \u2013 we feel very good about that positioning. We can go into that in some detail. But I would say, the overall sense of the competitive dynamic, we feel quite good about.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","James Faucette from Morgan Stanley, please go ahead with your question.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much. Wanted to ask quickly on the NXPI process. I think, Steve indicated that you're making good progress with the regulators even though that deal might slip into next year. How are you feeling about your part of the process, et cetera, and whether if you feel like you're on the same page with regulators as to the things they may need to ask for?","And then, my second question is, in the past you've talked about a non-Apple licensee that there were some collection issues with. Can you give us an update on any progress there? Thank you.","Donald J. Rosenberg - QUALCOMM, Inc.","James, this is Don Rosenberg. I'll take the first part of that. On the regulators, we are, as we said before, working with the rest of the regulators that haven't yet cleared. As you recall, we have five regulators who have cleared already. We are deeply engaged with the others and we are making progress. It's a little slower than we'd like to make, but that's more the process than anything else. And we are feeling good about our engagement and that we were going to get to the end as quickly as we can with them.","Alexander Rogers - QUALCOMM, Inc.","James, this is Alex. On the other part of your question regarding the non-Apple licensee, the short answer is we're still in negotiations with that licensee. Other than that there's really no other news.","Operator","Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research, please go ahead with your question.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. For my first question, I wanted to ask about the licensing results and the guidance. I know last quarter there had been some, I think you've characterized it as substantial catch-up in the quarter and that was the reason for the flat guide on revenues into Q4. Was there any catch-up or anything unusual or otherwise one-time that impacted either the Q4 licensing results or the Q1 guidance? And if so, what was it?","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Yes. Stacy, this is George. The Q4 results had a very small amount of, what I would call, out-of-period or catch-up dollars in it. So no material effect. Really, the improvement was driven by the strength of the market relative to our expectations in the guide. If you look at our Q1 guide, I would say we probably would be up a little bit more if we had out-of-period amounts similar to what we had in Q4. So it's having a little bit of impact Q4 to Q1, but we're still showing the strong guide.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you. For my second question, I wanted to ask a little bit about the linkages or lack thereof between the various disputes. I know, again, on the last earnings call, I think, Derek had made some statements that sort of essentially dismissed any linkage or contagion worries. Your attorneys in court told Judge Curiel the opposite, and I think the injunction was denied partially on the basis of that discrepancy.","Can you give us a little more color, like which one of those statements is more valid in terms of the linkage between Apple and any of the other disagreements that seem to be developing at this point? And how can investors kind of get a little more comfort that going forward the disputes that exist as they are today don't continue to give rise to more?","Donald J. Rosenberg - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Stacy, I'll take the first part of it. It's Don. First of all, there is really no contradiction to be cleared between our arguments in court and statements that, as you indicate, Derek and others made. And I think we'll get into the second part of your question in a minute.","What we argued in court, under the court standard, which as we've said is a very strict standard, which is very hard to meet in the context of a contract case. We thought we had a pretty strong argument. And, unfortunately, the judge didn't ultimately agree with that. But the court arguments were not inconsistent with what we've said. If you're thinking about the notion of irreparable harm versus, as you describe it, kind of linkage to others, it's a different concept. And I think we were pretty clear in how we argued that position.","Operator","Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets, please go ahead with your question.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. Maybe just two, if I could as well. I guess, it seems like you didn't give out the standard. You gave the industry view of units and ASP. I'm just curious if we can get any color on kind of what was paying it and what was paying units ASPs implied royalty rate in the quarter. And is that, going forward, going to not be given or is that just because of the disputes?","And then, separately, be interested to hear on the chip business. Obviously, doing great with the Chinese OEMs and the adjacencies. Just any color you can give us on what the mix of those businesses would mean to the margin profile of that business. Margins seem to be going up with them, so is that a trend that we should expect to continue? Thank you.","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Hey, Tim. It's George. On the TRDS, we took a look at whether or not once we had the two disputes, whether the TRDS number that we used to give out really had any information in it. And we felt it was actually just confusing and we find ourselves reconciling a bunch of numbers. So we went straight from Point A to Point B and just guided revenue, which we think gives a lot of visibility into what we think is happening in the business.","We do think the underlying trends are actually quite strong. And you're seeing the benefit of that both in growth of the licensable market even if we're not fully participating in it. We've seen good growth in device sales globally. And it's being driven by strong ASPs, which is also having a positive impact in the mix and the performance of the company, where we're very well-positioned in the markets where we're seeing the largest impact and, in particular, China.","So I think we're sensitive to your concern. And if we can find a way to get out more information that is actually helpful and gives insight into the business on TRDS, we will. But in the meantime, we feel like guiding revenue is perhaps the best alternative.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay.","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Maybe, Cristiano, you want to start off on the adjacents and I can jump in if you want.","Cristiano R. Amon - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Hi, Tim. This is Cristiano. You had a question on China and adjacencies. China has been a good story for us. I think China is the world's most competitive market, and our product road map has done well for us in China. We remain confident in maintaining our position there as a market leader. And the trends have been very good. We saw, in China, when we look at fiscal 2017, we saw 25% year-over-year growth in our China business. When we think about that market going forward, we saw good transitions on modem technologies to 4G+. And I think a lot of the activity towards an early 5G in China as well is positive for us.","One other comment to note, just a commentary on China. One of the data points in 2017 was consistent with the trends we have talked over the year. We start to see an increase in exports of the Chinese OEMs as they become a larger percent of the global market. And the adjacent business, we saw growth across multiple segments, automotive, IoT, networking. And we can leverage mobile technology, so they have been providing a good margin story for QCT.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank, please go ahead with your question.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys, Thanks for letting me ask a question. The first one is on the Apple litigation. It seems like whether it's in press reports mainly or otherwise, that it's escalating, not actually getting closer to resolution. So maybe, Don, if you could provide us a timeline in the upcoming court cases if we're going to come to the conclusion that this probably will be decided in the courts or at least have to get a lot closer to these court cases before any resolution comes to pass?","Donald J. Rosenberg - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Yes, it's Don. It's important to keep in mind that litigation of this size and magnitude takes a while, and you can't focus on any particular event in the short-term. As you know, there are multiple cases that have been brought by Apple and multiple cases that have been brought by us, and we're going through a process. There'll be some motion practice; there'll be some discovery disputes. But that process is going to proceed under the court's schedule.","I would say that, as you know, we brought a couple of patent cases against Apple in the ITC and district court here in the United States, in Germany, and in China. And those tend to move a little faster in the ITC, Germany and China, than litigation generally. And so, I would say that those will be on somewhat faster track, including potentially Germany by some time mid to end of 2018.","And China, too, we expect to be on a fairly fast track. And as you know, the ITC action will move forward rather quickly. But until then, I don't think you're going to see much that's going to be of any particular consequence in terms of the ultimate outcome. And it'll play out the way a lot of this kind of complex litigation plays out generally.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I think as a quick follow-up on that litigation side of things. The unnamed dispute that you have, seems like that's been coming up on a year's time. I know you're still in negotiations. You're not really going to comment on the name of the party, et cetera. But is that duration typical for one year? And what's the trigger point that changes it from an informal to a formal dispute where we can get more information?","Alexander Rogers - QUALCOMM, Inc.","This is Alex. So it's a fairly lengthy discussion, but I don't think that that's atypical. There are a lot of issues involved to work the way through. I think when it changes over to some formal litigation, obviously, that's when we'll go ahead and disclose that.","Operator","David Wong from Wells Fargo, please go ahead with your question.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Following up from the earlier question, we can see what's happening between you and Apple publicly in terms of the filings and the counter filings. But can you give us any feel as to whether there is direct dialogue between you and Apple outside of what we can see publicly?","Steven M. Mollenkopf - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Hi, this is Steve. I would echo what Don said earlier. It's very difficult to look at any one particular data point, whether it's true or not and kind of come to a conclusion. I think it's also important for investors to understand, we really try to compartmentalize our engagement with Apple. We have a product engagement and we have a dispute over, really, the price of IP. And I think if you net that all together, we do have a lot of engagement with the company and we do speak and are engaged on a daily basis with them across multiple areas that I've mentioned.","But we try to compartmentalize those two discussions. And as I've said many times before, I think there are a lot of levers between the company to figure out things. I just think we're not at a point where we're announcing anything different, and I think we want to be upfront that this could take some time to resolve. But we're working very hard on the product side to make sure that we continue to be a good supplier and a good showcase for our innovation products.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho, please go ahead with your question.","Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Hi, guys. Just one thing on NXPI. Do you still expect it to close in the year, in 2017?","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Yes. We've said that we're still working towards closing in the year. But, clearly, we have some activities going on at regulators that are taking a bit longer than we thought. So we could see it slip into early 2018, but we're confident it's on track to close and are still working to close it in the year.","Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Got it. And on the second IT litigation, I know you guys haven't given a lot of color there. But do you expect it to get resolved at the same time as the Apple IP? Or do you think that's more of a mutual discussion that you're having outside court, and so that should see a faster resolution there? Thanks.","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Yes. The second licensee, the facts and circumstances around that actually started before the other dispute and have issues that are unique to that licensee. And that will go play at its own pace and will be unrelated to \u2013 unless it's coincidentally resolved at the same time as the Apple dispute.","Operator","Chris Danely with Citigroup, please go ahead with your question.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. Thanks, guys. I guess, another question on NXP, why not? So if we get through all the approvals, but the tender doesn't go through or is rejected, can you talk about what would cause you to walk away versus just raise the price? What would be the circumstances there?","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Yes. Right now, we're really just focused on the regulatory close. We think $110 is a very full price. And I think as you saw on NXP's earnings release, the management team there is also reinforcing that $110 is an attractive price for their stockholders as well. So, right now, we'll stay focused on just getting this thing to the finish line.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Romit Shah from Nomura Instinet, please go ahead with your question.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is Kristen Sharp in (36:53) for Romit. Thanks for taking my question. I apologize if this was asked earlier in the call, I'm juggling two concurrent calls right now. But going to QCT operating margins, I know you did very well in this quarter on that. Can you give any directional, I guess, guidance as for the trajectory for fiscal 2018 for operating margins in QCT?","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","We are not putting out full year guidance, but we did give an indication of Q1, which again continues the strength in margins in QCT. 2017 was a very, very strong year. You saw EBT up over 50% and six straight quarters of margin expansion. So we think that the fundamentals of strong markets, strong products, growth in the adjacencies, are all factors that will continue into 2018 and help margins.","Operator","Brett Simpson with Arete Research, please go ahead with your question.","Brett Simpson - Arete Research Services LLP","Yes. Thanks very much. Just a question on the business structure at Qualcomm. I mean, when you consider the antitrust that's underway with regulators and the litigation with Apple now that's impacting your chip market share and the issues with your other licensee, can you perhaps talk about the benefits that QTL, being combined with QCT, particularly after you close NXP, to become much more diversified chip business. What's the real benefit, do you think, of having the combined businesses there together? And is there scope for a fresh review into a potential split between QTL and the enlarged QTC?","Steven M. Mollenkopf - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Brett, hi, it's Steve. I would say it's something that we look at all the time. We have, as you know, over the course of the company's history, looked at this in I think a formal way a number of times. But it's something that we always look at. And, however, I think I would just remind folks that we're now sitting here \u2013 if you look at what most people are working on in the company, we're trying to drive 5G and we're very excited about that. And I think that's good for both businesses and it's something that we think is going to have a long-term payoff for the company.","And I think as you could tell from our actions, we really view the ability to drive both innovation ahead of the market and have a channel to move that into the market is very important. So that continues to be something we think contributes to long-term growth, but it's also an area or it's a topic that we look at all the time to make sure that we are driving shareholder value as best we can. But nothing really to talk about here other than, I would say, the primary focus on driving 5G and what that means really to our business structure is very important at the moment for us.","Brett Simpson - Arete Research Services LLP","And maybe just a quick follow-up for George. In the QTL business, you booked $95 million of additional revenue in non-GAAP for QTL for licensing that wasn't in GAAP sales. Can you perhaps just talk about that and give us a sense for why QCT margins are falling sequentially at 18% midpoint for December quarter? Thank you.","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Yes. We had a dispute settlement. And because the dispute settlement was with a customer, it has to be taken as counter revenue. So that was the difference between the GAAP and the non-GAAP revenue.","Operator","John Pitzer from Credit Suisse, please go ahead with your question.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Steve, just on the 5G front, you've been perhaps a little bit more aggressive than some others in the ecosystem talking about timeline. And, clearly, trials are coming up and you guys will have to be an integral part of those trials. I'm just kind of curious, how do you think about the timeline for 5G to be meaningful volume to the chipset business? And, I guess, equally important, to the extent that that might be 2020 or beyond, what can you do around the feature set and\/or cost in 4G to kind of keep or maintain or even widen perhaps sort of (41:19) your dominant lead there?","Steven M. Mollenkopf - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Okay. I'll give you my perspective on it, which I think is, we're already in the position in the industry where the impact of 5G coming in 2019 is impacting the feature set even in 4G. So if you look at 4G, the push to Gigabit LTE \u2013 and actually there's even another update before we get to 5G that you'll see roll out into the networks.","So I would say, we're already in the early stages where it's very important to have that road map, not only to deliver products into 2019, but I think to be meaningful in the networks that lead up to that 2019 transition.","And so, if you're getting the sense that we are more aggressively pushing 5G and the higher tier feature set of 4G, I think that will be an accurate read. I would also say that it's not just us, our OEM customers and, in particular, I would say leading tier, high tier Android OEMs are taking that modem feature set aggressively as well.","So we think that's a good strategic position to be in. We are driving it hard. And I think we're all going to be pleased with the initial ramps and the speed by which people are going to go to 5G, and we're certainly going to try to make that happen.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","That concludes today's answer-and-question session. Mr. Mollenkopf, do you have anything further to add before adjourning the call?","Steven M. Mollenkopf - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Well, thank you. I just wanted to again thank the Qualcomm employees for a very strong year of execution and, in particular, I would say the broad-based delivery of products and earnings growth in QCT.

We\u2019re pleased to report another strong quarter, with record revenues, up 24% versus a year ago, driven by broad based demand for smartphones and strong semiconductor volumes.","In recognition of our strong financial position and the continued growth in our business, we recently announced a 40% increase in our dividend and a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization.","In QCT, we continue to drive technology and product leadership.  We saw the first product announcements by our customers on our new Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 and 800 processors.  We launched our new Qualcomm RF360 front-end solution, and we extended our support of the industry\u2019s widest range of operating systems to include Mozilla\u2019s web-based Firefox OS and innovations such as Facebook Home.  Qualcomm is now ranked by revenues as the third-largest semiconductor provider in the world, up from sixth last year and ninth the year before, according to IHS.","Turning to QTL, total reported device sales came in towards the high end of our prior guidance range, reflecting continued global adoption of smartphone, particularly in emerging regions.  This marks another record quarter of total reported device sales and QTL revenues.","We also continue to growth rate of our licensee base, and now have over 230 CDMA licensees and more than 50 single mode OFDMA licensees.  Looking forward, we believe our long term growth drivers remain intact and are increasing our calendar year 2013 3G\/4G device forecast in line with this view.","Smartphone adoption continues at a rapid pace.  Gartner estimates that approximately 700 million smartphones were sold in calendar 2012, up 44% year over year.  Further, they estimate that in 2017 more than 1.7 billion smartphones will be sold, representing an approximate 20% compound annual growth rate versus a 2012 base.","Smartphones have become more than just a technology product, empowering people to connect and interact with the world like never before.  And we\u2019re working to deliver continuous improvements to this user experience through our investments in industry leading innovations in smartphone technologies, including the CPU, the GPU, multimedia subsystem sensors, displays, connectivity, and of course last but not least the modem.","Emerging regions are experiencing the fastest growth for 3G as 3G networks mature and the breadth of affordable smartphones expands.  Wireless Intelligence reports that at the end of the first calendar quarter of 2013, 3G connections including CDMA 1X, in emerging regions, increased 34% year over year to approximately 1.1 billion.","According to analysts, 3G connections are now more than three times the number of fixed internet connections in emerging regions, making mobile the leading and in some cases the only platform for computing and internet access.  Let\u2019s take China as an example.  Wireless Intelligence reports that there are now more than 1.1 billion wireless connections, of which only approximately one-third are 3G, including 1X.  There is a large remaining opportunity as consumers migrate from 2G to 3G and 3G\/4G multimode.","SINO MR reports that more than six times the number of sub-1000 RMB smartphone models were launched in 2012 versus 2011.  By the way, RMB1000 is approximately $160.  All three carriers in China reported increased data traffic and revenue, with China Telecom reporting a 47% year over year increase in data revenue for 2012.","And beyond the phone, it\u2019s important to remember that we\u2019re pursing multiple incremental growth opportunities including mobile computing and what we refer to as the internet of everything.","We\u2019re still in the early stages of mobile computing, but we believe the fundamental benefits of always-on, always-connected and sleek form factors will create a more compelling user experience than traditional computing devices.  We\u2019re encouraged to see a diverse set of vendors experiment with different form factors and multiple operating systems as they look to address the evolving computing environment.","Further, as it relates to the internet of everything, we\u2019re leveraging our core technologies to support a range of applications for a diverse set of vertical industries such as automotive, smart energy, security, healthcare, and the connected home.","As an example of momentum in that space, General Motors recently announced an intent to put LTE connectivity into its entire fleet of 2015 Buicks, Cadillacs, Chevrolets, and GMCs, and that\u2019s following similar announcements from BMW and Audi.","We\u2019re investing in a variety of solutions to help meet the rapidly increasing data traffic demands that these opportunities are creating.  We refer to this as the 1000X Data Challenge.  We\u2019re making good progress with technologies such as carrier aggregation, LTE broadcast, and new small cell deployment models.","Further, advances in 3G network technologies such as HSPA+ and new overlay LTE networks are being deployed at significant rates, and according to GSA, there are now over 160 commercial LTE networks globally.","China Mobile announced plans to expand its LTE TDD trial network to include 200,000 base stations by the end of 2013, and Snapdragon and Gobi enabled LTE TDD devices are starting to achieve China Mobile\u2019s network certification.","As you obviously know, George Davis has joined Qualcomm as our chief financial officer, and I\u2019d like to welcome him to his first Qualcomm earnings call.  We\u2019re off to a great start, and I\u2019m looking forward to working with George in the months and years to come.","So to conclude, we\u2019ve just completed another strong quarter at Qualcomm, and we\u2019re pleased to be increasing our fiscal 2013 guidance.  We\u2019re continuing to execute against our strategic priorities, and look forward to addressing the growing set of opportunities ahead.  Thank you, and I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Steve Mollenkopf .","Steven Mollenkopf ","Thank you Paul, and good afternoon, everyone.  Our QCT business had another excellent quarter, with revenues and earnings before tax increasing 28% and 14% year over year respectively.  We shipped 173 million MSM chipsets, up 14% year over year, and at the high end of our prior guidance range, reflecting strong demand across our portfolio, including our Qualcomm reference design solutions.","Looking forward, we are expecting another record year for QCT, growing revenue and earnings before tax on a strong double digit basis year over year.  This growth is in excess of the rate of growth of estimated industry 3G\/4G device unit shipments and the year over year percentage increase of our expected operating expenses.","Further, the year is unfolding better than we initially expected, and we are successfully increasing our share and our share of content in devices.  This strategy is delivering strong revenue and per-unit dollar margin growth year over year, albeit with downward pressure on the QCT gross margin on a percentage basis, as expected.","In total, we are pleased to be raising the company guidance, in large part due to the strength of our chip business.  Flagship devices announced this quarter that contain our chipsets include the Samsung Galaxy S IV, the HTC One, the LG Optimus G Pro, the Blackberry Z10, and the Sony Xperia Z smartphone and tablet.","Our strategy of pursuing a diversified customer base, including all the major OEMs and across all major operating systems, uniquely positions us within the industry.  We also continue to grow devices targeted at mass market pricing in emerging regions.  Our Qualcomm reference design program continues to build momentum with OEMs now shipping handsets based on our MSM 8x25Q Quad Core chipset and a developing pipeline for our LTE chipsets, which will support the anticipated rollout of LTE in China.","In total, there are now more than 850 Snapdragon enabled devices launched or announced, including approximately 200 devices based on our Qualcomm reference designs.  The pipeline of future Snapdragon enabled devices also continues to grow, and there are more than 475 additional Snapdragon enabled designs in development.  Devices based on the Snapdragon 600 chipsets are launching now, and we expect commercial devices based on the Snapdragon 800 chipset to launch on schedule in the middle of this year.","Carrier requirements that support the demand for growing network capacity will increase the complexity and requirements for modem and connectivity technology and represent a sizable opportunity that aligns with our key strengths.  Our family of 3G\/4G multimode chipsets leads the competition in mode and band support as well as the integration of the latest wifi 802.11 AC.","We are already on our third generation of LTE modems, and with the MDM 9X25 and Snapdragon 800 chipsets, while others are still working on their first generation.  This quarter we announced our new Qualcomm RF360 product, which addresses the next challenge with global LTE: OEMs SKU proliferation coming from RF complexity and LTE brand fragmentation.","We continue to execute on the strategy which we outlined for you in the past.  We innovate across multiple technology vectors, CPU, graphics, modem, and connectivity, optimize the design point for the unique requirements of mobile, integrate these technologies into a tiered chipset roadmap, and deliver these chipsets at scale across multiple customers and OSs.","These technology investments enable superior performance, lower power consumption, faster time to market, and continually raise the bar for competition.  The success of this strategy is reflected in our growing share and the many OEM flagship devices already announced based on the Snapdragon 600 chipset and the increasing device pipeline of more than 200 Snapdragon 600 and 800 chipset enabled devices.  We believe it continues to position us well in the smartphone space, but also in the growing opportunities of mobile computing, the internet of everything, and the connected home.","That concludes my remarks.  I will now turn the call over to George Davis.","George Davis ","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone.  I am delighted to have joined the Qualcomm team, and look forward to working closely with the investor and analyst community in my new role.  We are pleased to be reporting strong financial results today, and to be increasing our financial outlook for fiscal 2013.","Fiscal second quarter revenues were a record $6.1 billion, up 24% year over year and 2% sequentially.  Non-GAAP operating income of $2.2 billion was up 18% year over year, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.17 was up 16% year over year.  Sequentially, non-GAAP earnings per share were down $0.09, reflecting seasonally lower QCT shipments and higher operating expenses, partially offset by 17% revenue growth in QTL.","As a reminder, this quarter reflects two very different seasonal periods for our main business segments.  For QCT, our March quarter is a period of seasonally lower demand following the retail intensive December quarter.","Because QTL records royalty on subscriber device sales on a quarter lag, our fiscal second quarter results for QTL reflect the strong demand period of the December quarter.  QTL reported strong growth in 3G\/4G device shipments by its licensees, driven particularly by smartphones in both developed and emerging regions.","Total reported device sales rose to a record $61.1 billion, up 15% sequentially and 18% year over year.  Devices shipped by our licensees in the December quarter were estimated at 279 to 283 million units, with an estimated average selling price of $214 to $220.","QCT shipped 173 million MSM chips, at the high end of our prior guidance range, driven by strong demand across our portfolio, including QRD chipsets for emerging accounts.  Revenue per MSM was relatively flat sequentially and QCT operating margin was in line with expectations at approximately 17%.","Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses grew 14% sequentially, exceeding the high end of expectations due to increased patent, legal, and employee related expenses in the quarter.  Operating cash flow was strong at $2.2 billion, up 17% year over year and 36% of revenues.  During the quarter, we returned $431 million of cash dividends to stockholders.","Let me now spend a few minutes on our outlook for the fiscal year and our fiscal third quarter.  We are raising our guidance for fiscal 2013.  We now estimate our fiscal 2013 revenues will be approximately $24 billion to $25 billion, up 28% year over year at the midpoint and up $600 million from our previous guidance.","We estimate our fiscal 2013 non-GAAP earnings per share will be between $4.40 and $4.55, up approximately 21% year over year at the midpoint, and up $0.13 relative to the midpoint of our previous guidance.  Our fiscal 2013 operating margin percentage estimates for QCT and QTL are unchanged.","We expect combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses for fiscal 2013 to grow approximately 21% to 23% year over year.  This is a modest increase over our prior estimate, primarily due to increased patent and legal expenses and variable employee costs.","Let me spend a moment on calendar year 3G\/4G device estimates and fiscal year device ASPs.  As a baseline, we have updated our estimate of 3G\/4G devices shipped in calendar year 2012 upward to a range of 928 million to 945 million devices.  This represents an increase of approximately 18% year over year at the midpoint.  This is somewhat higher than our prior estimate, led by emerging region demand and provides a strong base for the growth we expect in calendar 2013.","For calendar year 2013 3G\/4G device shipments we now estimate between 1.015 million and 1.085 billion devices will be shipped by our licensees, driven by strong global smartphone demand.  At the midpoints of our calendar 2013 guidance and the revised calendar 2012 range, we estimate 3G\/4G device growth will be 12% year over year.","We estimate that the average selling price of 3G\/4G devices for fiscal 2013 will be between $216 and $224, consistent with the midpoint of our prior forecast.  We estimate our non-GAAP annual tax rate to be approximately 17-18% for fiscal 2013, consistent with our prior expectations.","Now, turning to the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we estimate revenues will be in the range of approximately $5.8 billion to $6.3 billion, up approximately 31% year over year at the midpoint.  We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share for the third fiscal quarter to be between $0.97 and $1.05, up approximately 19% year over year at the midpoint.","We anticipate that fiscal third quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will increase sequentially approximately 2-4%.  In QTL, we estimate that our subscriber licensees will report total reported device sales of approximately $51 billion to $56 billion in the June quarter, for shipments made in the March quarter.  At the midpoint of that range, we expect total reported device sales to be up approximately 12% year over year and down approximately 12% sequentially, reflecting post-holiday seasonality.","In QCT, we expect to ship between 163 million and 173 million MSM chipsets during the June quarter.  We expect a stronger mix of chipsets targeted for high tier smartphones to drive revenue per MSM higher, resulting in sequential QCT revenue growth of more than 5%, despite the reduction in expected volumes.  We expect QCT operating margin percentage to be relatively flat quarter over quarter at approximately 17%.","That concludes my comments.  I will now turn the call back to Warren.","Warren Kneeshaw","Thank you, George.  Operator, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.]  Mike Walkley, from Canaccord Genuity, please go ahead with your question.","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity","I was wondering if you could discuss the ASP trends for the total device market.  It seems there was a lack of high end product introductions during the March quarter, but there\u2019s a lot of high end flagship devices ramping into the market during the June quarter.  Could we expect QTL ASPs maybe to increase exiting the fiscal year relative to your guidance?  And am I calculating it right that your guidance also implies an uptick in ASPs for the June quarter?","Derek Aberle","I\u2019ll take that one.  I think we saw a little bit of a downward trend in ASPs in Q2, although that was in line with what we expected.  As we look back historically the last couple of years, we\u2019ve seen actually ASPs kind of trend down in Q2.  But then they\u2019ve tended to trend up in Q3 and Q4.  And so as we look out at the back half of the year, we are expecting kind of a rebound in ASPs as compared to the Q2 ASP, and that\u2019s including offsetting effect from FX.  So I do think both in the March and the June quarter, we should see some improvement in the ASP compared to Q2.","Warren Kneeshaw","As a reminder, our range for the full year is still, we\u2019ve narrowed it a little bit, but it still has a midpoint at 220.","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity ","And then Derek, just on the FX, was there any impact to FX in the short term, or any impact from the yen in particular.  And then just longer term, with the stronger mix from low end markets, do you see the ASP trends as still kind of single digit annual decline is a good way to think about it?","George Davis","I\u2019ll cover the near term impact and maybe Derek you can cover your views on the longer term impact.  Actually, we did experience some impact from the yen in the second quarter, and really for the full year.  But in both Q2 and Q3, the net effect has been minimal in Q2 in particular, because of the favorable impact from other currencies.  So for the full year, we see FX being about $1 impact on ASPs.  So not much of an impact and virtually no impact in Q2.","Derek Aberle ","So back on the longer term trends, I think really the trend set we\u2019ve been seeing and that we highlighted back at the analyst day in November.  Two quarters in are really holding, and we see them remaining intact.  In particular, in the emerging regions, the ASPs have continued to increase and in fact when we talked about sort of the tiers, the interesting thing is although the volume is continuing to grow there, the percentage of the units coming from the mid and high tier has kind of been holding.  And so I think both of those trends are consistent with what we expected at the beginning of the year and will continue.  But as you said, over the long term as more volume shifts to emerging regions, in terms of our internal plans, we\u2019ve got baked in assumptions that there will be single digit declines in ASPs over the longer term.","Operator","Tim Long, from BMO Capital Markets, please go ahead with your question.","Tim Long - BMO Capital Markets ","I just wanted to go a little further into the detail on the QCT gross margin.  Steve, you mentioned it down as expected.  I just want to put that together with a few things.  First, last quarter Bill had mentioned a positive contribution to gross margin from QCT, so I think it went up two or three points, doing the math, looking like it went down about six points or so this quarter, into March.  So it seems like a little bit of a reversal there, and you\u2019re saying as expected.  I\u2019m curious what that means.","And what do we think about from the market drivers for this change in gross margin, meaning is it QRD and media tech competition?  Is it new LTE devices from competitors finally starting to hit the market?  And at some point, do we start to see a floor in this gross margin number for QCT?","Steven Mollenkopf ","In Q2, from Q1, a couple of things happened.  One, if you get the normal calendar year price reset, which hits in this quarter, we also had a bit of a weaker mix from the perspective of more units coming in from emerging markets versus developed markets.  The December quarter tends to be pretty heavy in terms of buildup in the developed world.  So you probably saw a little regional mix move away from the developed world.","We also mentioned on the last call that we also think about how we do our pricing strategy, which I think comprehends not just short term but also long term views of the competitive landscape.  One thing that I should mention, we really are not seeing significant competitive threat in the LTE area, as you mentioned.  I think it\u2019s just more of a mix issue and some of the calendar items that you\u2019ve probably seen over the past few years as well.","Tim Long - BMO Capital Markets ","Forgive me, but I thought the ASP looked pretty much flat December to March.  So the mix couldn\u2019t have been that bad.","Steven Mollenkopf ","You probably saw a little bit less mix from the high end, and a little bit more from the emerging market area versus the quarter before.","George Davis ","I would just add when we look at Q2, even though the volumes of MSMs were up relative to our expectations, the mix issue did have an impact of kind of neutralizing the benefit of those higher volumes and so the outperformance in Q2 was more of a QTL story.","Operator","Simona Jankowski from Goldman Sachs, please go ahead with your question.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs","I just had a question on the chipset side, and then one on the royalty side.  Starting with chipsets, can you just kind of go over the puts and takes on the volumes expected in the June quarter, considering there are some significant major launches that you\u2019re participating in the June quarter.  I would have thought you\u2019d see some better sequential performance there than what you\u2019re guiding for.","Steven Mollenkopf ","I try not to get into the mix of different customers.  The one thing that I would say is that throughout the year we\u2019re probably a little bit diversified from big changes in the customer base, and we are seeing kind of a customer mix change move around.  You see that in our numbers and probably in our mix a little bit.  But I don\u2019t think that quarter has traditionally been the strongest quarter relative to some of the other ones that we\u2019ve had.  I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything ominous in there that you should be able to pick up or think about picking up.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs ","So you\u2019re not assuming it\u2019s any kind of inventory correction or anything like that?","Steven Mollenkopf ","No, if anything, I think you probably see a little bit of an increase in our inventories, which probably you should think of as confidence in shipping some of the higher end chipsets into the market.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs ","Then on the royalty side, a question there.  So your ASPs declined about 4% sequentially and that\u2019s despite the fact that in the December quarter volumes in North America and other mature markets were actually quite strong.  And I would have thought that with that being the higher ASP region, that would have helped the mix for QTL.","And then conversely, we\u2019re now seeing, and it was also reported by AT&T and Verizon and others that North America volumes have really come down quite significantly in the March quarter, which is being offset by substantial growth in emerging markets around the lunar new year and so forth.  And that would have suggested to me that the mix actually would get better and benefit your ASPs in the royalty segment in the March quarter  for you to report in June.  So could you just kind of dig a little bit more into why that logic is not playing out?","Derek Aberle ","As I was trying to explain before, we have seen actually more volatility, I would say, in the quarterly ASPs with more iconic high end devices and the timing of the launches.  What we\u2019ve seen is actually the ASPs moving around quite a bit.  Like if you look last year we were slightly down in Q2 but then ASPs jumped up by like $15 in Q3.  So we are seeing more volatility.","I think the December quarter is obviously a very competitive dynamic.  A lot of things going on in pricing.  And it\u2019s a quarter where we have less volume coming from some of the higher ASP regions like Japan.  But as I said, as we look out and we have a certain amount of information already from our licensees and then based on publicly available data, we do expect ASPs to increase in Q3.  And then as you suggested, there are a number of new higher end products launching that should have a positive impact on the Q4 ASP as well.","Operator","Brian Modoff, from Deutsche Bank, please go ahead with your question.","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank","A couple of questions.  One on the QCT margins.  Kind of guiding again at 17% in the quarter.  Can you kind of walk through a little bit of that?  I know obviously volumes aren\u2019t as good, but you\u2019ve had some of your expenses you typically incur in Q1 done.  Or are there incremental expenses, take outs, etc.?","And then can you also talk about, you mentioned it a couple of times, higher legal expenses?  Can you talk about has there been a shift in litigation, or is there something that\u2019s occurring that\u2019s outside of perhaps that smaller case in Florida that you\u2019re dealing with?","And then last question, just around S800.  You were talking about launch midyear.  How is the design traction on that going?  And how do you see that affecting your overall mix in ASP in QCT?","George Davis ","The QCT margins, we said for the full year, as you may recall, that we saw 18.5% to 20.5% margins for QCT throughout the year.  We are seeing spending increase into the last half of the year so 17% at Q3 is still going to be consistent with that outlook.  And in fact, we recommitted to the margin outlook.","So I don\u2019t think we really changed our view at all.  I do think we\u2019re certainly seeing strength in ASPs for QCT in the second half of the year.  That will help.  But we\u2019re also seeing some ramping in spending.","Steven Mollenkopf ","A little bit on the 800 status.  It\u2019s actually doing well if you look at the uptick in the second half.  And the second half does look quite a bit better than what we would have thought in the January timeframe.  A lot of that is this higher mix product that we\u2019ve been investing in for some time.  And I think you\u2019re going to see good growth year over year and I think some accretion to the business as a result of those higher end products coming in.  And I think that\u2019s really responsible for some of the guidance movement.","George Davis ","And just back to your second question, on legal expenses and other items.  That really was to explain the delta from our forecast of up 10-12-14, to the 14% growth that we saw in Q2.  Litigation and patent are both up in the quarter.  Some on settlements, some of the patents.","Obviously there was the adoption of the first to file rule and so there was a lot of accelerated spending on patent filings in the quarter as well.  So it\u2019s more of an increase.  Obviously the big increases year over year and also on an absolute basis, the increase in spending is still coming out of the core business.","Operator","Kulbinder Garcha, from Credit Suisse, please go ahead with your question.","Kulbinder Garcha - Credit Suisse","A couple of questions.  I just want to revisit the QCT margin question again.  And maybe more for the full year, for Steve.  With the growth that you\u2019re seeing and the market share that you\u2019re gaining, and the mix improvement we\u2019re seeing in LTE, I\u2019m just surprised that there\u2019s not more leverage in that business, especially this year of all years.  And even in the near term you\u2019re seeing a higher mix of higher end chips going into the next quarter, but margins aren\u2019t going up.  So is something just competitive that you\u2019re trying to do, are you\u2019re thinking to try and block sockets for long term?  Can you speak about why there isn\u2019t more leverage just period this year?","And then for Derek, one of the debates that we\u2019ve had of the [unintelligible] is about your vertical license, the significant 3G market, smartphone market, that\u2019s developing out of the media tech world, if you like.  Is the increase to this year\u2019s addressable market number you\u2019re seeing now any function of your confidence in your ability to license phones there, or is it mainly demand driven?","George Davis","Let me just give some perspective on the full year on the margin.  Because I think it\u2019s hard to see it for a couple of reasons.  Number one, the margin performance for QCT [unintelligible] loaded in the second half of the year and so you\u2019ll see more of that impact in Q3 and Q4, and we already talked about the fact that even on falling volume you\u2019re going to see revenue and operating margin up and our expectation in Q3.","But if you just step back and look year over year, QCT revenue will be up more than 35% year over year.  Operating margin we think will be up more than 40% and again, it\u2019s driving the opex growth of the company year over year, but it\u2019s still at a lower percentage than its revenue growth rate.  So we are seeing some leverage in the margin.","Derek Aberle ","Really the short answer is it\u2019s end demand driven.  As I\u2019ve explained in the past, we\u2019re continuing to grow our licensee base in China, and our license agreements require payment of royalties irrespective of whose chip is included in the device.  And I think I\u2019ve taken folks through a few times the robust process we have in place of monitoring the market in China and really trying to drive compliance with our agreements.  So no change there.  Really a demand driven story.","Operator","Ehud Gelblum, from Morgan Stanley, please go ahead with your question.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley","I\u2019m going to revisit a couple of the issues that we went over already.  I may have missed some things.  I apologize if I\u2019m rehashing some concepts.  But on the QCT gross margin, around 17+%, it\u2019s where you had guided it last quarter.  Can you give us a sense as to how much of that decline from last quarter\u2019s 26% was gross margin related and how much was opex?","And to the extent there was any gross margin decline in the business, how does that make sense to help us get our arms around it given that the shipment ASP was flat?  So maybe there was no gross margin decline and it was all opex.  Just want to understand that.  And going back to the previous question, if it is all opex, why wouldn\u2019t that improve as you get through the year?  But just to understand that mix.","And then on the QCT ASP, itself, I think you had mentioned that it was flat because of the mix, offsetting the higher end chips that we know you shipped last quarter?  There were also a bunch of lower end ones that kind of kept it in step.  I think in the last conference call Bill had mentioned that he expected it to be up.","So I guess what I\u2019m asking is vis-\u00e0-vis your expectations, what geographically happened?  Was the U.S. not as strong as you had expected it to be versus your expectations, and China just stronger?  And if that\u2019s the case, are you gaining more share in China that you thought you were going to?","George Davis ","On the gross margin and opex, we don\u2019t guide that at the segment level.  But I will say they\u2019re in line with Steve\u2019s comments about the mix of business.  There was some both gross margin and opex impact to get to that 17% number.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley ","I\u2019m not asking for guidance, but can you just us a reflection from last quarter if the ASPs of the chips were actually the same, how would gross margin have gotten impacted?","George Davis ","It\u2019s a dilutive effect of the additional volumes.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley ","So additional volumes is bad for gross margin?","George Davis ","Those additional volumes were bad for gross margin.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley ","Okay, so your lower end chips have lower gross margins than your higher end ones do?","Steven Mollenkopf  ","Yes, that\u2019s correct.  In fact, I think what you saw between what we would have guided at the beginning of the quarter and the end of the quarter is probably a little bit stronger units and more units coming out of the developing regions versus the developed regions.  And so I think that those things do move around.  We\u2019ve talked about it ebbing and flowing between developed world and emerging world, and this is one that is probably a little heavy on the emerging world side.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley ","Okay, and then finally, do you expect that when you model going forward and you\u2019re looking especially at the royalty side as well as the chip side, with China going very soon, heading to LTE and ramping on the 3G side, I would have expected more higher end than lower end coming out of China.  But is that relative to what is going on?  Are you seeing a stagnation, perhaps in the developed world as China gets going?  Is that kind of the story we\u2019re looking at going forward?","Steven Mollenkopf ","I\u2019ll give my view on it, which I don\u2019t think you\u2019re seeing anything in terms of stagnation.  You\u2019re probably a little early in the ramp of LTE TDD and you\u2019re still seeing, I think, significant transitions from 2G to 3G, which we\u2019re seeing in the low end chipsets.  The developed world tends to be [peaky], meaning that it\u2019s dominated in many cases by flagship models and concentrated volumes in particular quarters.  I don\u2019t know if Derek or anyone else has any other view.","Operator","Rod Hall from JPMorgan, please go ahead with your question.","Rod Hall \u2013 JPMorgan","I just want to ask one question, Steve, on the ASPs.  I know there\u2019s been a bunch.  But you talked about ASP volatility increasing, which has obviously been the case.  And we know that that\u2019s due to a bunch of other different things going on in the mix, upgrades from feature phones to smartphones, etc.  What I noticed is your range of guidance on the ASP, it\u2019s not changed that much.  It hasn\u2019t widened up that much since a year ago, even though the volatility seems like it is increasing.  So can you talk about whether you think the current range of guidance is appropriate given its increased volatility?","And also, maybe talk a little bit about things like tablets, how they affect that?  Just how predictable do you think that ASP is at this point.  And then the other thing that I wanted to ask you guys, this RF360 chip, you know, pretty interesting product.  Can you give us an update on where we are with designs and shipments on products, just what the timeline is looking like on that?  Has it changed at all since you guys announced the product?","Steven Mollenkopf ","I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re referring to the licensing business guidance versus the chip guidance, is that correct?","Rod Hall - JPMorgan ","I\u2019m sorry, Steve.  Yeah, I am referring to that.","Derek Aberle ","Let me take a crack at that.  We\u2019ll see if anybody else wants to chime in.  Obviously trying to estimate ASPs is a difficult process, although we get probably more information than most to help us in that process.  I think you know our feeling is that the range that we have set out is an appropriate range, and when we think about the fiscal year ASP we usually start out at the beginning of the year, like some of our other guidance, with a wider range, and then as we go through the year and get closer to the end of the year, we\u2019ll tend to narrow it up a little bit because we feel like some of the year\u2019s already under the belt, so we have less to forecast.","But again, I think we feel like we have a robust process in place and we\u2019re doing a pretty good job.  For instance, this quarter we had a relatively significant drop in ASP quarter over quarter.  Yet it was in line with what we expected and consistent with the full year 220 midpoint that we had last quarter, and we still see that as consistent with the guidance for the year.  So I\u2019m pretty comfortable with the process that we have in place.","Rod Hall - JPMorgan "," ","And [unintelligible] is increasing, Derek?","Derek Aberle ","I think quarterly volatility has been increasing, partially for the reason Steve mentioned, which is as we get more of these iconic devices launching, and they\u2019re launching at sort of peaky times throughout the year.  It has the effect of moving the ASP around more than it did in the past.","Steven Mollenkopf ","And then on RF360, we\u2019re pretty pleased with it.  It\u2019s something that you should see in the second half of this year.  I would say, as I said before, expect us to sort of walk before we run in this product area.  This is a new product area for us.  And I think we probably have a lot to learn in terms of ramping a bunch of customers very rapidly.  And of course we have very large volumes now, so we\u2019ll probably take that one slow in terms of how we ramp it.  But we\u2019re pleased with how it\u2019s going so far.","Operator","Stacy Rasgon, from Sanford Bernstein, please go ahead with your question.","Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein","I had a question on the opex.  The annual guide going forward from this point, you took it up about $160 million on a pro forma basis versus where you were last quarter.  It sounded from your description that a lot of it is not R&D.  It\u2019s legal and some of this other stuff.  Can you give us some sort of an idea of how much of a split of this opex increase is actually coming from the SG&A and legal side versus the R&D?  And can we consider and think about those increases on the legal front and patents and everything else as more one-time, or are those recurring?","Don Rosenberg","On the legal side, as George said earlier, one of those is a settlement, which is not material, but the settlement is one-time.  And as George accurately described before, as you know, with the new America Invents Act, which was the modification to our patent laws, there was a first to file modification put in.  And some companies took advantage of making sure that they filed a lot of applications in a timely way due to certain timing issues associated with that.  We did a very good job, as always, of filing patents so that we could get the kind of protection we want, and that was a one-time event in order to meet those deadlines.","Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein ","And how much was that?  I\u2019m trying to get some feeling for how much of this increase is, I guess, an increase in core investment in the company versus comp increases versus one-time charges.","George Davis ","In terms of the increase, you still have a meaningful piece of that that is in the core business.  And maybe it\u2019s easier just to step back and look at the full year over year.  Still, when you think about a 21-23% increase year over year, about 95% of that, not to be too specific, in that area, is really related to spending increases in QCT and QTL.  So this is really about investment in the core business.","Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein ","And I guess given the amount of revenue upside you\u2019re showing, you\u2019re really not showing the kind of EPS leverage that one would expect, or at least we would expect, from the kind of revenue [upset] they\u2019re showing in the [opex].  This is probably $0.07 or $0.08 of that EPS that\u2019s going away.  So again, I\u2019m just trying to get some feeling for how much of this is recurring, and how much actually is going forward from here that they can actually drive further growth beyond the 35% or 40% we\u2019re seeing this year, trying to look in terms of what it can drive into next year and beyond.","George Davis ","The nonrecurring piece would not be a material impact on the year over year.","Operator","James Faucette from Pacific Crest Securities, please go ahead with your question.","James Faucette - Pacific Crest Securities","I wanted to go back to the question on licensing in China.  There had been mention of faster growth in the market there and some of the other emerging markets.  But I\u2019m wondering if we can get a sense from you Derek as far as where we feel like the coverage is on collecting royalties from producers in that region in particular.  And I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for potential upside in growth as you improve the coverage there and add more licensees.","The second question is for Steve. As we look over the medium to long term, I think we\u2019ve talked a lot about how there\u2019s some mix that has impacted margins, but yet the ASP has been relatively stable.  How should we think about the ASP development on the chipsets over the long run, particularly as you start to roll in some RF component, etc.?  Can we remain stable, or should we expect those chipset ASPs to decline at about the same rate that the handset ASPs are anticipated to?","Derek Aberle ","On China licensing, I think I can probably break it into two parts.  I think generally we feel very good, as I said, that we\u2019re continuing to add licensees to the base and grow the number of licensees in China.  I feel very good about the compliance efforts we have there.  So I think we are confident we\u2019re collecting reasonably well on the sales there.","The one exception that\u2019s pretty well understood, I think, is we have had some struggles with local Chinese companies necessarily paying all the royalties they owe on TDS CDMA units.  And although we have a large number of company [unintelligible] for TDS CDMA given the political sensitivities there, that continues to be an issue for us.","And we\u2019ve got a number of strategies in place to try to address it, but at the TDS CDMA volumes grow at China Mobile, there will be a gap, to some extent, between what we\u2019re collecting on and maybe some of the numbers you\u2019re seeing come out of China, unless and until we\u2019re able to resolve the situation.","Having said that, I think there are some trends that should help reduce the size of the issue.  One of them is we do believe that the higher end of the portfolio is going to have a combination of UMTS and LTE or at least UMTS for global roaming in other regions.  So as to products that include those technologies in addition to TDS CDMA, we don\u2019t anticipate having the same issues that we\u2019re experiencing on TDS CDMA.","So again, this has shifted over time, I think, where the volumes are quite a bit smaller historically, and the mix of the supply base in China has also shifted over time to probably favor more of the local Chinese companies that have been a bit of a struggle.  But we\u2019re going to continue to work hard to see what we can do to solve it.","Steven Mollenkopf ","On your question about growing content and what\u2019s the trajectory look like, if you step back and look at the business, what I think you\u2019re seeing is kind of as the historical mix in our business has been very modem-centric, and it\u2019s had a particular gross margin associated with it.","As we go into getting more and more content on the phone, which is first coming in the form of application processor, and adding in that functionality, what you\u2019re seeing is, I think, a growth in the raw dollars and the gross margin per MSM, but a reduction in the traditional gross margin percentage.","Now, we\u2019re still seeing significant growth as a result, and clearly it\u2019s been an accretive thing for the company as you look back.  But I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing, and I think that\u2019s what people are trying to figure out.  And as a particular quarter has a mix between modem and application processor or different geographies such as the last quarter, you tend to see that move around a little bit.  And that\u2019s probably what you\u2019re seeing.","Now, our view is this is actually a very good business for us.  We\u2019re able to produce a business that grows faster than the market and now that it\u2019s at scale, it\u2019s growing faster than our rate of growth of the operating expenses.  So we think that\u2019s a very good business.","It also, I think, provides the springboard to go into some additional markets such as the tablet market, which we really have not participated in in a great way, primarily because the OS that we put our biggest bet on has yet to sort of develop.  But we think it will.","So we look at this as a build scale in the smartphone space, and use that to go into some adjacent markets as well.  We also think to be successful you have to have the scale.  So that\u2019s what you\u2019re really seeing in the business, a bit of an investment period, but we\u2019re still introducing growth during that investment period.","Operator","Tal Liani from Bank of America, please go ahead with your question.","Tal Liani - Bank of America","Just one clarification and a question.  TDS CDMA, you don\u2019t get paid on single mode, but what about TD LTE?  Has this been decided already?  Or do you still argue with the locals?  Second question is to understand the transition to the next node.  First, what are your plans when it comes to the next node, whether it\u2019s 29 or 16 nano?  How do you manage the transition, both on capacity and margin?  And do you expect the same margin declines when you transition similar to what you had with 28 nano?","Derek Aberle ","On the follow up on China, just to clarify, I think we have agreements in place with a number of companies and it\u2019s really just trying to work some of the issues and trying to get compliance.  We\u2019re also getting still paid some royalties from companies outside of China.  So I think that\u2019s a little bit of a dynamic.  Can\u2019t quite say we\u2019re not getting anything on TDS CDMA, and that\u2019s shifting over time.","Our current expectation is we\u2019ve got more than 50 companies licensed now for LTE, including both TDD and FTD modes of LTE.  And a significant number of those companies are Chinese companies, including ZTE.  So currently our expectation is that we will not have the same type of challenges around LTE that we\u2019ve experienced in China on TDS CDMA.  And on top of that, we do think many of the devices at China Mobile at least in the near term that include LTE will also include [unintelligible] and for that reason would also be a trigger for royalty payments under our agreements.","Steven Mollenkopf ","On the node transitions, you\u2019re going to see us, consistent with earlier comments and our opex profile, really try to move through the nodes as rapidly as we can.  Our view is that that puts us in the best position to drive technology and to really set the design point more than folks who can\u2019t do that.","Now, I don\u2019t know if I would make a conclusion that a new node or the 28 nanometer node in particular was associated with the lower gross margin.  It\u2019s probably more the mix of products versus anything else.  Today, I think the general view is that the 28 nanometer node is likely to be the node that exists for a long time, and will probably sort of the mass market node for some time.  We kind of felt that we got on that earlier than anybody else.","That being said, you\u2019ve probably heard some timing in the market about when companies will go to 20 nanometer, and our product roadmap is consistent with that timing.  We\u2019re going to be moving rapidly through nodes, and across different nodes, at the same time, as we\u2019ve done in the past.  So our general strategy is to make sure that at the low end we might use the most cost-effective node, and at the high end, performance tier, we\u2019re going to use the leading edge.","Operator","Mark Sue from RBC Capital Markets, please go ahead with your question.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets ","Derek, just a clarification.  Much, much longer term, if we go into the world of single mode LTE, just get your thoughts on the impact on the royalties.  And also, on tablets, is that something that we revisit in terms of the royalty rates as they stand today?  Anything that you can proactively do to take it out including the attachment rates there?","Derek Aberle ","The first question on sort of longer term impacts on single mode LTE, obviously there\u2019s been a certain amount of chatter around the industry about the timing of some of the early launches of single mode LTE devices and I think there\u2019s some room for debate on that.  But we still believe that that, in terms of meaningful volume, is shifted out a ways.","You may recall that we made a public statement several years ago at the time, based on sort of our current patent position, which frankly I think has improved over time, that we expected to charge about 3.25% for single mode LTE, just for the essential patent portfolio.  And as you know, we generally license generally our whole portfolio, not just the essential portfolio.  So that 3.25% was just for the essential patents.","So while it\u2019s possible over time, we can see a bit of a step down in the rate as we transition to more single mode LTE.  I think we feel very good about the position that we\u2019re in in terms of the agreements we\u2019ve signed and the potential impact of that.  There\u2019s obviously other things in the agreements that could have somewhat of an offsetting effect in that as well in terms of the total royalties paid, but we\u2019ll have to see how that plays out over time.","But sort of the big picture is we still believe it\u2019s out in time a ways, and we feel good that we\u2019re establishing a value for the portfolio that everybody should be pretty happy with.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets ","And your thoughts on tablets?  Anything that would [unintelligible] there?","Derek Aberle ","On tablets, I think I mentioned on the last call that the attach rates obviously have been not as high as we had expected.  They\u2019ve been trending down a little bit over time.  I do think we\u2019re seeing some signs that the trend could be starting to reverse itself going forward.  And in particular, as we start seeing more volume in some of the smaller screen form factors, like a 7- or 8-inch, that people will end up carrying with them more often, I think there\u2019s more desire to have the ubiquitous coverage of cellular.","Also, I think recently I\u2019ve seen some more subsidies coming in from the operator channel on the tablet products, which really they haven\u2019t been pushing too much in the past.  And then of course I think in the last six months or so, we have seen many of the operators around the world make moves on their pricing plans that are more conducive to driving adoption.","So I think some things are coming together, which we hope will start to improve the picture.  From a royalty standpoint, at this point we think we\u2019ve done our part and there\u2019s not really a need for additional changes there to help stimulate the market.","Operator","Ian Ing from Lazard Capital Markets, please go ahead with your question.","Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets","In terms of these questions on Q2 margins and some spending increases, is there any product roadmap adjustments driving that?  Inter-quarter, we did see [unintelligible] pull in their schedule on 16 nanometer [pin] sets, which is a lower power process, and obviously you might have had some hand in driving that.","Steven Mollenkopf ","You saw us come out with the RF360 during the quarter, and we continue to invest heavily both in the modem and in the GPU\/CPU on the [unintelligible].  But we think we\u2019re one of the folks driving [pin] set into the mobile space.  So that\u2019s pretty consistent with our current plan and our previous statements.","Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets ","And then Steve, maybe you could highlight for the Snapdragon family how you\u2019re going to differentiate low tier versus high tier.  If you look at the low tier, there\u2019s offerings out there from [unintelligible], dual core, quad core, etc.  Would it be graphics where you differentiate at the high end?  Or some other areas?","Steven Mollenkopf ","The low tier is pretty difficult to differentiate in many cases, with the exception of two areas.  One is you need to have the customer scale, essentially, to be able to engage with a number of different customers.  And what we\u2019ve been building over the last year or two years or so is the ability to engage with a nontraditional customer.","Nontraditional in this sense means a customer that needs a bit more of a complete solution.  That means that from the product side, you need to create something like the reference design that we\u2019ve talked about, but you also need to expand, in the region, the sales activity.  So for us in China, what you\u2019re seeing is we\u2019re building the sales activity to sell into a customer that is not, let\u2019s say, the traditional multinational customer that we\u2019ve serviced.  And it takes a while to build that alternative channel.  We also think, over time, that our IP roadmap from the top tier tends to be meaningful in the low tier as well.","And you can see that in customers that try to differentiate from their low tier competitors by producing a high tier phone and trying to offset their brand.  You see that, and that tiered roadmap we think is important long term.","The other aspect that\u2019s happening here, we think, over the next several quarters, is as China transitions to multimode 4G, that you get a real turnover in the modem feature set, which we think plays toward our traditional strength.  So long winded answer, but essentially I think you have to have customer scale, and you can use, we think, the IP roadmap from the top in order to differentiate long term, but there are a lot of people who are competing on price right now, and that needs to settle out.","Operator","This concludes the question and answer session.  Dr. Jacobs, you may proceed with closing remarks.","Paul Jacobs ","Thanks everybody for joining us this afternoon.  Obviously we\u2019re really pleased with the record revenues.  And our growth really is continuing strongly with the increased guidance we put out for the year.  If you go back and look at fiscal 10 through fiscal 13, we\u2019ve gone from $11 billion to $15 billion, to $19 billion and then we\u2019re guiding midpoint $24.5 billion for this fiscal year.","And that really strong growth is due to our ability to drive the market with new technologies and that\u2019s based on our past R&D investments that really capitalize on the opportunities that we see.  And we are going to continue doing that.  And we\u2019ll do that also in a very profitable way.  Look forward to the guidance next quarter.  In one of the generally seasonally softer quarters we\u2019re projecting 31% year over year revenue growth.  So we feel pretty good about that.","We\u2019re able to do that because we\u2019re putting our competitors farther and farther behind, and it\u2019s not just the modem, although everybody\u2019s quite focused on that.  But it\u2019s also we\u2019re putting them behind on other areas, graphics, microprocessor design.  And that is evidenced by the number of design wins we\u2019ve had, 850 designs launched or announced.  475 more currently in design, as Steve said.","We\u2019ve got some great products coming from our partners.  We have some great products that we\u2019re developing.  Great technologies to come, and a lot of opportunity ahead.  So we expect to be able to continue the kind of growth that we\u2019ve had.

Jacobs","Thank you, Warren and good afternoon everyone. I\u2019m very pleased with Qualcomm\u2019s performance this past fiscal year. We delivered record revenues of $25 billion up 30% versus last year. Earnings, total reported device sales and MSM chipset shipments also set records, as our technologies continued to underpin the global growth of wireless data and our semiconductor solutions are used across the industries flagship smartphones.","We increased our dividend for the 11th consecutive year and returned approximately $6.7 billion to the stockholders in the form of buybacks and cash dividends in fiscal year 2013.","Looking at the fourth fiscal quarter, we also delivered record revenues which came in near the high-end of our guidance due to strength in both our licensing and semiconductor businesses.","Earnings would have been well ahead of guidance if not for a legal charge we recorded in the fourth quarter. We are pursuing post trial motions in the district court and we will pursue all options on appeal as necessary and remain confident in our positions.","We made excellent strategic and operational progress this year. We delivered our industry leading third generation 3G\/LTE multi-mode modem, grew our share of semiconductor content in a wide array of devices, and expanded our licensing program. Further, our strategy to support the LTE TDD migration path for the wireless operators in India was successfully executed. We just completed the final step in transferring full ownership of the Indian BWA entity that holds to the 4G spectrum we won in the 2010 spectrum auction to Bharti.","We also announced the planned divestiture of OmniTRACS. As you know OmniTRACS was one of our first businesses and help fund our investment in CDMA.","Now I\u2019d really like to thank all the employees, suppliers, and customers who contributed to the more than 25 year success of the business. We really look forward to hearing about your future accomplishments.","We expect that transaction to be completed during our first fiscal quarter of 2014, but we haven\u2019t included the estimated $0.22 to $0.25 per share gain on the sale in either our first fiscal quarter or annual guidance.","Looking at fiscal 2014, we\u2019re expecting solid growth, but at a lower rate than what we delivered in the last two years. This is partially due to the exceptionally strong year we just completed which included share gains and content share gains in QCT.","In fiscal 2014, we\u2019re facing some mix and demand factor which we currently expect will moderate our QCT growth. In light of this, we are taking near-term actions company wise to prioritize investments, stay focused on growth, but also control expenses in order to deliver operating profit growth in excess of revenue growth.","Fundamentally, we believe our long term growth drivers remain very much intact and we are aligning our resources to continue to capture those opportunities. We continue to see smartphone adoption grow at a rapid pace across the globe.","According to Gartner, approximately 225 million smartphones were shipped in the second quarter of calendar 2013, representing 47% year-over-year increase. This is especially true in emerging regions where smartphone demand is being driven impart by the migration from 2G to 3G. Looking forward, Gartner is now expecting 1.8 billion smartphones will be shipped in 2017.","In the September quarter, we saw the launch of new devices with expanded capabilities based on QUALCOMM products. Some of these new capabilities include the launch of ultra HD video, LTE carrier aggregation and support for additional frequency bands for global roaming.","We will continue to focus on expanding our share of content and devices. We are making good progress with our WiFi and RF front end solutions. We see multimode 3G LTE as a catalyst for growth in network enhancements and smartphone demand.","According to GSMA Intelligence, approximately 100 million new LTE connections are expected to be added in calendar year 2013, representing a 57% year-over-year increase from 2012 and it\u2019s approximately 22% of total net new connections. China remains an important opportunity for smartphones. With the upcoming launch of LTE, we expect increased demand for smartphones across many tiers of the license. It's not just about smartphones, impact of mobile on other industries cannot be overstated. The mobile ecosystem is driving innovations in healthcare, automotive, education and of course computing, which is creating new opportunities for QUALCOMM from both a chipset and the licensing perspective.","Smartphone experiences are driving tablet designs as evidenced by the increased innovation and demand for 7-inch including Snapdragon based tablets Google and Amazon announced this quarter. In addition, several operators have recently introduced new data plans that could be a positive catalyst for 3G, 4G adoption in tablets and other consumer electronics devices.","Now all these trends are helping to drive better demand globally. And in order to address the growth in data, operators continue to revolve their 3G networks, upgrade to LTE, evaluate new spectrum opportunities and evolve network topologies to include the introduction of small cells. This past June we announced our FSM solution that integrates our 3G and 4G technologies with advanced 802.1ac in WiFi to enable fully featured low-cost model smart cells that are designed to provide superior performance with greater power efficiency.","We will discuss the many growth opportunities we see ahead and the strategies and actions we\u2019re pursuing to capitalize on them during our upcoming New York Analyst Event. I look forward to seeing many of you there.","So to wrap up we\u2019ve completed another outstanding year at QUALCOMM. I'd once again like to thank all of our employees and partners for their commitment, innovation and leadership. We have tremendous opportunities ahead and we are positioning the company to capitalize on these while carefully managing our cost structure.","And overall QUALCOMM remains well positioned for continued growth. We have grown revenues at a compound annual rate of more than 30% over the last three years and building after this very strong fiscal 2013 days here, going forward for the next five years, we expect that revenues and earnings per share will grow at double-digit compound annual growth rates. We expect to return significant amounts of capital to stockholders consistent with this outlook.","I will now turn the call over to QUALCOMM'S President and Chief Operating Officer Steve Mollenkopf.","Steve Mollenkopf","Thanks Paul and good afternoon everyone. I will provide some comments on both QTL and QCT businesses. In fiscal 2013, QTL delivered record revenues and earnings up 19% and 18% year-over-year respectively driven by greater than expected 3G, 4G device shipments and increased ASPs reported by our license fees. We now have over 250 royalty bearing 3G licenses.","Over 90 single-mode OFDM licenses and we believe our 3G and 4G portfolios are the most widely licensed in the industry. Through our broad licensing program we continue to foster innovation and enable a large and growing ecosystem that benefits wireless consumers worldwide.","QCT also grew significantly in fiscal 2013 delivering record revenues and earnings up 38% and 39% year-over-year respectively, driven by successful share in content gains. During the year we continue to lead in LTE with our integrated modem solutions and delivered significant product enhancements across all key technology vectors including the modem, processor, graphics and connectivity with unmatched world-class integration.","For 2014, we are forecasting another year of strong growth in QTL. We expect 3G, 4G device shipments by our licensees to grow 15% at the midpoint in calendar 2014 and our fiscal 2014 3G, 4G device ASPs are estimated to be between $216 and $230 down slightly by $3 or 1% year-over-year at the midpoint.","Turning to QCT, our outlook for fiscal 2014 builds of significant successes of fiscal 2013. Our leadership across key technologies required for modems and SoC\u2019s for smartphones and mobile computing continues to position us well across flagship designs and key customers. We expect fiscal 2014 QCT year-over-year growth to moderate somewhat compared to recent years, including the very strong growth we delivered in fiscal 2013.","Our position as the high-tier and with the OEMs that\u2019s strong driven by modem and application processor leadership and is expected to remain strong through 2014. The high-tier continues to be increasingly concentrated however which impacts our product mix, as well as our revenue and related operating margins.","We also expect strong growth in the low and mid-tiers driven by emerging regions including the anticipated launch of LTE in China in the second half of the fiscal year. We continue to see growth in China across all smartphone tiers and what we refer to as our EA or Emerging Accounts exceeded $1 billion in revenue in fiscal 2013. Our participation in the RMB 1,500 and above smartphone tier is strong, enabled by both Chinese and multinational OEMs.","Fiscal 2014 is shaping up to be another favorable year with Chinese OEMs as we build on our strength in the high-tier, enabling OEMs to drive LTE solutions in the mid and low tiers during 2014 in China and other emerging regions. We expect the launch of LTE in China to change the dynamics there as international OEMs leverage there worldwide LTE leadership to increase their positions and Chinese domestic OEMs move up tier and leverage their LTE position in China to export internationally.","Both of these expected trends are beneficial to QCT\u2019s positioned as all of our LTE chipsets include both the FDD and the TDD mode. We are currently shipping integrated chipsets across multiple tiers to support initial volume expected to start around the Chinese New Year.","In light of our near-term outlook moderating following a strong 2013, we are slowing the growth rate of our spending. We believe we are now operating the QCT business at scale and with our expense management initiative this year we forecast that we will exit fiscal 2014 at a lower operating expense run rate than we exited fiscal 2013.","In addition to operating expense initiatives, we have projects underway to improve product costs within QCT including driving supply-chain efficiencies and designing cost optimized solutions for the very price competitive low tier.","It is important to note that we expect 2014 quarterly QCT operating margins to trend differently this year as compared to previous years and in particular we expect them to strengthen in the second half of fiscal 2014. This reflects the quarterly demand profile and product mix we expect including the growth of LTE in China, as well as the anticipated customer device launches throughout the year.","In addition, the cumulative effect of the product cost and operating expense initiatives we are undertaking improved the margin profile over time. Accordingly, we expect to exit the fiscal year at a high point, above 20% operating margin instead of peeking in the first fiscal quarter as in prior years.","Looking ahead, we believe we continue to be well-positioned versus our competition. In fiscal year 2013, we delivered our third-generation LTE solution well ahead of the competition. It features LTE carrier aggregation with Category 4, supports all major standards in voice and data mobility scenarios and is available on a standalone or integrated basis.","Our LTE solutions now span the high-end to the volume tier and are well-positioned globally across FDD and TDD opportunities. The LTE feature sets required to be successful will continue to evolve at a fast pace, driven by competitive dynamics in the United States and Asia, compounded by the number of RF bands required to deliver the higher data rates and capacity to the consumers.","We continue to lead in mobile optimized application processors and this continues to be an area of investment for us as in the past. We have successfully grown our tablet design pipeline including such notable designs as the Amazon Kindle HDX, the Google Nexus 7, the LG G Pad, Sony Xperia Z and multiple tablets with Samsung and Nokia.","We see strong traction and a broad design pipeline for RF360 Front End products, which include the envelope tracker and antenna tuner, PA with integrated switch and RF POP. The envelope tracker has shipped commercially in handsets in September and the remainder of the solutions are scheduled to launch as expected throughout the fiscal year.","We also continue to make great progress with our mobile Wi-Fi and connectivity solutions building off our successful acquisition of Atheros. Our 802.11ac product continues to have strong design traction with over 150 smartphone design wins including many with top-tier OEMs. Overall, our Wi-Fi attach rate on a unit basis is over 50% and we expect it to continue to growth throughout fiscal 2014.","To conclude, we see significant growth opportunities ahead for our business and we are managing our resources to maintain our technology leadership and best position ourselves for the future. I look forward to discussing this with many of you at the upcoming Analyst Day.","And I\u2019ll turn the call now over to George.","George S. Davis","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to be reporting strong financial results for both this quarter and the full fiscal year. Fiscal fourth quarter revenues were a record, up 32% year-over-year and non-GAAP operating income was up 20% year-over-year.","Non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.05 was up 18% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP result this quarter included $173 million or $0.10 per share litigation expense related to the recent ParkerVision verdict, which was not included in our fiscal fourth quarter guidance. Excluding this $0.10 charge our non-GAAP EPS would have been $1.15 per share or $0.09 above the midpoint of our prior guidance range and up 29% year-over-year.","In addition to strong operating results the impact of certain tax items, share repurchases and investment portfolio performance accounted for approximately $0.06 per share in the quarter.","QTL, total reported device sales by our licensees were $60.2 billion, just above the high-end of our guidance range with the average selling price in line with last quarter consistent with our expectations.","QCT had record revenues and MSMs in the quarter and implied revenue per MSM was down sequentially, reflecting increased low-tier shipments relative to expectations. QCT operating margin was 16% at the low end of our guidance, also reflecting the low-tier product mix. Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses grew 6% sequentially consistent with expectations.","During the fourth fiscal quarter we returned approximately $3.9 billion to stockholders including approximately $600 million of dividends paid and $3.3 billion in stock repurchases. As of the end of fiscal 2013 we had used $150 million of our new $5 billion stock repurchase program announced in September.","Cash flow from operations was very strong at 39% of revenues, reflecting solid working capital performance, particularly inventory drawdown. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $29.4 billion. Our fiscal fourth quarter non-GAAP tax rate was 16%.","Turning to our results for fiscal year 2013, revenues were a record, up 30% from last year on strengthening QCT share at the high-tier, strong 3G\/4G device growth and increasing ASPs in the QTL business. Non-GAAP operating income was a record $8.66 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share were a record $4.51, both up 22% year-over-year.","QTL\u2019s 2013 revenues were a record, up 19% year-over-year with operating margin of 87% towards the high end of our prior guidance range. We estimate that the fiscal 2013 3G\/4G device average selling price was $226 at the midpoint, up $7 or 3% year-over-year.","QCT\u2019s fiscal 2013 revenues were also a record, up 38% year-over-year. Earnings before tax was up 39% year-over-year and operating margin was 19% for QCT, in line with our full-year guidance.","Fiscal 2013 cash flow from operations was $8.8 billion at 35% of revenues. We returned approximately $6.7 billion or 86% of free cash flow to stockholders during fiscal 2013, paying $2.1 billion of cash dividends and repurchasing $4.6 billion of our shares.","We are increasing our forecast for 3G\/4G device shipments in calendar 2013 to between 1.075 billion to 1.125 billion units, up 15% to 20% year-over-year, driven by strength in emerging regions, particularly China.","Now turning to our guidance for fiscal 2014, we estimate fiscal 2014 revenues to be in the range of approximately $26 billion to $27.5 billion, up 5% to 11% year-over-year. We expect QTL top and bottom line growth to remain strong, driven by continued strength in 3G\/4G, device demand, stable replacement rates and ASPs in developed regions, 2G to 3G migration in emerging regions as well as LTE deployments in China and elsewhere.","We are forecasting a modest ASP decline in fiscal 2014, down $3 at the midpoint or 1% to $223. We expect QCT to continue to benefit from technology leadership and modems and our Snapdragon family of products. We expect QCT growth in fiscal 2014 to reflect strong end-market demand somewhat mitigated by the effects of OEM concentration at the high-tier.","QCT has successfully established strong positions across all of the key top-tier OEMs and much of the medium-tier smartphone accounts. QCT growth in fiscal 2014 is aligned with the growth trends in these tiers. In addition, we are seeing continued high OEM share concentration particularly at the high-tier and this impacts our product mix as well as our revenues and related operating margin.","We are also seeing a tiering of products by these large customers that is leading to a higher utilization of previous-generation MSM in their overall mix of products. We see this effect mostly limited to QCT\u2019s product mix in the first half of fiscal 2014.","As Steve mentioned, we forecast improving trends in the second half of our fiscal year versus the first half. We expect higher device ASPs for QTL and a better mix of leading parts in QCT, including the impact of LTE in China. We also forecast lower operating expenses and product costs, contributing to a stronger second half.","We expect fiscal 2014 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $4.95 to $5.15, up approximately 12% year-over-year at the midpoint. As Paul mentioned, we have not included the estimated gain on the sale of Omnitracs in our guidance, if this gain was included our fiscal 2014 non-GAAP earnings per share estimate would be up 17% year-over-year at the midpoint.","For calendar 2014 global 3G\/4G based device shipments, we estimate that between 1.22 billion and 1.3 billion devices will be shipped by our licensees, up approximately a 11% to 18% year-over-year, reflecting increased shipments around the world, particularly in emerging regions. We estimate fiscal 2014 QTL operating margins will be 87% to 89% and QCT operating margins will be 18% to 20%, both stable year-over-year. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 17% to 19% from fiscal 2014.","As Paul and Steve noted, we are slowing our level of operating expense growth in fiscal 2014. We expect combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to grow approximately 5% to 7% year-over-year in contrast to more than 20% annual growth over the past three years.","We are reducing a number of R&D process expenses in order to operate more efficiently and focus more fully on growing our investments in key areas including modem technology, low cost chip designs, CPU and VPU, RF360, connectivity and integrated SoCs as well as longer term initiatives like displays, small cells and enterprise products.","This reduced expense growth is well below recent years and aligns with the expected top line growth and our requirements to drive the critical elements of our roadmap and new technology initiatives.","We also expect to continue at an accelerated pace of return of capital to our shareholders. In fiscal 2014, we currently expect to repurchase a minimum of $4 billion of stock and we have included this repurchase activity in our guidance. We will provide further details of our capital return metrics at our New York Analyst Day in two weeks.","For the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $6.3 billion to $6.9 billion, up approximately 10% year-over-year at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share in our first fiscal quarter to be approximately $1.10 to $1.20 per share, down 9% year-over-year at the midpoint.","Versus the year ago quarter, we are expecting increased shipments of thin modems and low and mid-tier products in QCT as well as the impact to longer term pricing initiatives that were not in place in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and the impact of higher operating expenses.","As you will recall, our first quarter results in fiscal 2013 were very strong with the resolution of our 28-nanometer supply constraints, favorable product cost and low relative operating expenses.","We anticipate first quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be flat sequentially with modest growth in R&D, offset by lower spending in SG&A.","In QTL, we estimate that total reported device sales of $57.5 billion to $63.5 billion will be reported by our licensees in the December quarter for shipments they made in the September quarter for approximately 14% year-over-year at the midpoint. We estimate the QTL ASP to be down in our first fiscal quarter versus the prior quarter consistent with the increased quarterly fluctuations we have seen during the last couple of years related to regional, OEM and product mix. We expect the ASP for our fiscal second quarter to be flat to up quarter-over-quarter.","In QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 195 million to 210 million units during the December quarter, up approximately 11% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect revenue for MSM to be lower quarter-over-quarter reflecting a greater mix of lower-priced modems. We expect QCT operating margin to be up sequentially and in the range of 17% to 19%.","We see the first fiscal quarter trend is being reflective of the first half of fiscal 2014 overall. We expect more favorable top line trends as well as cost and expense improvements in the second half of the fiscal year.","That concludes my comments. I look forward to seeing many of you at our Analyst Day on the 20th in New York, where we will provide further details and guidance points supporting our financial outlook for fiscal 2014 and beyond.","I will now turn the call back to Warren.","Warren Kneeshaw","Thank you, George. Operator we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead with your question.","Mike Walkley \u2013 Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great, thanks. Steve, just looking into the QCT, I calculate the guidance implies may be a 5% to 10% drop for the Q1 in terms of revenue per MSM. How should we think about that both sequentially and then on a full-year basis, would you expect your revenue per MSM given what sounds like a more mid to low end to be down relative to fiscal 2013 levels. Thank you.","Steven R. Altman","Mike, yes, I don't know if you're going to see a huge difference. It doesn't move around all that much actually. We are seeing a weaker mix, I would think relative to what you would normally see in a quarter like yes, certainly relative to what you would have seen last year. But it still remains I think reasonably strong throughout the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Simona K. Jankowski \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, thank you. I just had a clarification first, which is, does the 16% operating margin in QCT include the litigation charge, and if you back that out what would be the margin. And then the question I had was it looks like the implied royalty rate declined to about 3.1% in the quarter? Can you just go over some of the reasons for that and how we should think about that going forward?","George S. Davis","Simona, hi this is George. The 16% did not include the litigation expense, which was taken in corporate and other. It was shown on the other line in OpEx.","Derek Aberle","This is Derek. So on the implied royalty rate as you know this thing tends to bounce around quarterly and there is a number of moving parts in here. Probably some of the factors that affected the decline from Q3 to Q4 included OEM mix shifts. Also, we had an increasing TRDS, the market as well as lower infrastructure royalties. And so the fixed licensing fee tend to be a bit of a drag on the rate when that happens. And we also had, actually the ASPs in the high-tier during this quarter increased and so those are the types of devices at that point that would be subject to caps.","And then finally, we had a couple of kind of one-time items including overpayment claim that came in the quarter and then some timing related to cash-based revenue recognized licensee payments.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Brian Modoff \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. A couple of questions. So Steve, if were to walk through what you\u2019re saying regarding your mix improvement through the fiscal 2014, especially into the back half, what percent of that\u2019s coming from your overall savings from mix getting better perhaps if you say, with TDD LTE shipments in the back half of the year. And how much of this is coming from just simply cost savings? And in the comment you made earlier about $1 billion of revenue from China in fiscal 2013. Can you give us an idea of what that rate of change was from 2012? Thank you.","Paul E. Jacobs,","George, why don\u2019t you start on the first one, I\u2019ll probably add a little color to it.","George S. Davis","Sure. Hi, Brian. I would say that the operating expense improvement, it certainly helps, but I think it\u2019s the \u2013 I would put a little bit more weight on the product cost improvement. Certainly, China LTE coming in actually helps from a mix standpoint as well, and we also see a little bit less the kind of N minus 1 part issue that we\u2019re seeing in the first half of the year.","Steve Mollenkopf","And that issue \u2013 just for clarity, what that essentially means is you\u2019re seeing some customers right now, I would say, downshifting to a lower tier product, although still a high tier product from the perspective of how QTL would see it, but maybe a smaller, a lower product, still a low, high-tier product from the perspective of QCT. So you\u2019re seeing that. We think that reversed a bit going into the second half of the year.","With respect to the $1 billion in China, the way to think about that is, take our business in China really in the new channel. So remove Huawei and ZTE kind of the international existing business. It just takes the new channel that we have been developing and take away some of the higher tier premium devices. Just take a look at that new kind of QRD channel and what I would call the lower tier channel. We\u2019ve grown that really from nothing over the last several years to now north of $1 billion. Last year it\u2019s probably doubled, I would say, over the year, I have to check, but it\u2019s pretty significant growth.","We are expecting in China the move toward LTE to be a good trend for us. So we think that channel is now working and set up hopefully we can move it to LTE, which would be better for us even further.","Brian Modoff \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Pacific Crest. Please go ahead with your question.","James E. Faucette \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities LLC","Thank you. Sorry. Just a quick couple of questions from me. First, looking at your long-term outlook, you\u2019ve expanded your double-digit revenue in earnings growth again this year. I\u2019m wondering, Paul, if you can talk a little bit about what you see as substantial long-term drivers at the longer end of that period from an end market perspective and how we should think about that. And then just a point of clarification, did I understand correctly, George that we could expect to exit fiscal 2014 at a low than we exited\u2026?","Paul E. Jacobs","Okay. Let me start. So obviously we\u2019re still spending quite a bit in research and development. So we have spent $5 billion in fiscal 2013. We have moderated the growth of that, but it\u2019s still growing and so there is plenty of effort on new technologies, new products. Obviously the basic one, a 2G to 3G and 4G migration especially in emerging markets that\u2019s pretty fundamental for our growth.","LTE is spreading more particularly China as we say and we are really looking forward to that towards the end of the year, tap woods and other kinds of computing Steve mentioned the traction that we are getting on design wins on the tablet side. We talked a lot about small cells and that opportunity going forward more content going into the devices, talking already about RF front ends, Wi-Fi but also display sensor, integration other kinds of things. Clearly wearable, machine-to-machine these are new growth areas for us. Other growth is just more devices per person whether it\u2019s in computer or in their car, in their home, machine to machine so all these kinds of things are very significant growth opportunities for us going forward. So we are investing into those growth opportunities and a few others that we haven\u2019t yet talk to you about.","Steve Mollenkopf","And on the \u2013 I think your question, you broke up a little bit but the question I believe was will we exit the year fiscal 2014 at a lower run rate on OpEx than we entered in and that was the point Steve was making, we get through the kind of what we\u2019ve been describing as a bubble of spending in the first half of this year, and we will be exiting the year at a lower run rate than we entered.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Tim Long \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Thank you. Just wanted to get back to the chip margins here, I am calculating another decline in the gross margins on the QCT side after going up a little bit last quarter, just curious I know this is probably a mix effect there, but are we starting to see more pressure from some of the larger tier-1 vendors impacting that gross margin and related to it from an absolute level, we are probably on line with MediaTek\u2019s gross margins now in that business. Just curious if you think we are bouncing along the bottom of an acceptable gross margin for QCT. Thank you.","Steve Mollenkopf","Tim this is Steve. I think you\u2019re seeing a couple of effects, one is you\u2019re seeing a mix shift which obviously comes at a different margin. You are seeing the effect of concentration in the industry where clearly people have a stronger buying power the more concentrated the industry is. Kind of moving forward although we don\u2019t give gross margin guidance I would say that those things we expect to be improving over time moving forward both from a mix perspective but also I mention some work that we are doing to improve product cost both at the supplier level as well as at the design level. So I think you\u2019re probably looking at a relative minimum right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Rod Hall \u2013 JPMorgan Securities","Yes, hi, guys thanks for taking my question, I just wanted to getting beat into that but I wanted to come back to the QCT chip margins and just trying to understand it feels like the high end shipments here in the end of the calendar you think your Q4, Q1 are probably lower than would have been anticipated and I just wanted to double check Steve that is in fact the case and that\u2019s \u2013 what \u2013 is it part of the reason that the guidance in fiscal Q1 and maybe a little weaker than we would have anticipated. And I just wonder the other question I\u2019ve gone as it shouldn\u2019t some of that volume come back to us in the beginning of the year. Do you guys just think it\u2019s lost forever or are we just completely misinterpreting, I mean it\u2019s not really a mixed related issue at all in those chip margins.","Paul E. Jacobs","First of all, we still think that tier is growing. I think an important point we think it\u2019s going to continue to grow. Relative to what we would have thought a couple of months ago or even more than a quarter ago, it's probably a little bit softer in some OEMs relative to what we would have thought. And that impacted the mix and I would say the concentration of more thin modem relative to some larger Snapdragon products or probably you are seeing in the mix as well.","Moving forward there are couple of things that we mentioned, but I think one of the more important ones is that we think the move to LTE in China is an important move for us. And I would say, if you look at our unit guidance for the year, our unit plan delivering on all of the operating metrics that we talked about, we are not really expecting a massive uptick in terms of unit volume. We will continue to have strong units, but I think the plan is pretty balanced there, I just comment on it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. I want to drill into the \u2013 I guess the China LTE for a moment. You\u2019ve got unit growth of about 15%, which is not really a huge acceleration versus where we are today. And do you have LTE starting I guess sometime second half of next year, how much of this is do you foresee is current I guess single-mode TD-SCDMA players who are making the migration from single-mode TD to multimode TD-SCDMA and LTE. And is that incorporated into your unit guidance or if it\u2019s not do you expect to see any of that in 2014. Is that more of a 2015 horizon or longer?","Steve Mollenkopf","Stacy this is Steve. I think that we do consistent really even with prior year is, we tend not to take a very aggressive view on the beginning of launches. So we are assuming that we will see really some international OEMs move into the LTE market in China, more consistent with I would say a new up-tier product. Obviously new for us because we don't really get any volume today out of China Mobile even though it is the largest in the world. And we expect that transition down into the lower tiers at some point. But really our plan right now is that it\u2019d probably be a higher tier product at first versus a replacement for the tier that I think you asked about.","Now I want to be clear we are pushing through our chipset offerings, a tiered roadmap into the market, so that could happen. But we have always been a little bit cautious in terms of the front-end of any technology migration, but no, the real work is happening right now. And you're going to see from us a multitiered strategy to push products worldwide in this technology.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Gauna with JMP Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","Alex D. Gauna \u2013 JMP Securities LLC","Thanks very much for taking my question. Steve, I wanted to follow-up with exactly what can you tell us about plans from China Mobile in terms of the readiness of the network, when we will actually start getting deployments. And then I want to clarify, it sounded like in your 2014 forecast you\u2019re basing your view on mid-tier and high-tier growth, but you have also mentioned some of the entry levels in newer emerging SKUs being important. Can you reconcile those two statements as the low end or penetration to low end upside of your guidance, thank you.","Steve Mollenkopf","Sure, Alex, so on the China question it is difficult for me to talk about in the plans of any particular carrier \u2013 in this case multiple carriers. I will say that we are engaged actively as our others to help the launch occur as quickly as we can. But I think the decision of when really falls upside of our hands. We are working with some lead OEMs to support the timing that I mentioned in my script, which essentially is the Chinese New Year timing. And that does seems consistent with the quality of the technical work that we see.","With respect to low-end and high-end I guess the point we want to make is, the number one, the high end continues to grow. We are doing well there. We continue to expect that it will continue to grow and we will continue to have share position there. Now as a low-tier I think we are growing into that market as well as improving our cost structure into that market. However, the number of dollars per device is pretty different, than in the first category that I mentioned.","And as those mixes change it does impact our profitability and you are probably seeing that more in the near term. That\u2019s really what\u2019s you see. I think we are pleased to consider ourselves to be strong in both areas. In the lower tier we tend to be lower in unit but probably higher in terms of gross margin dollars per unit than our competitors. And I think we are probably a little bit better positioned going into LTE than what we expect to see from other people.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Kulbinder S. Garcha \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Thanks for the questions. I just want to clarify one thing Steve, sorry a couple of things. The first thing is just on the high-end of the business. If I just want to \u2013 is what you are seeing that high-end demand in smartphones is \u2013 the market is still growing unlike some people see it. But some of those high-end customers are just buying lower ASP devices so there is a mix shift within them. So that hurts your QCT level of profitability in the near term, but it doesn't impact Licensing, is that the right way of thinking of it? That's my first clarification.","Then the second thing is that, if there is this increased buying power in the high-end which is obvious has been there now for at least a year I would argue, what is it that is now causing them to exert this pressure on you and why isn't this a multi-quarter or even multi-year issue because frankly I don't think those high end vendors are going to lose share any time soon. I don't think anybody else thinks that either. So is there risk when we get to six or nine months\u2019 time that maybe China LTE doesn't improve your mix in that segment of the business. But you have got this almost consistent pressure on QCT, so the day that QCT actually shows any leverage keeps getting pushed out. Can you just comment on those two that would be very helpful?","Steve Mollenkopf","Maybe I\u2019ll start with the last one first, which is our plan and even Paul\u2019s comments on the double-digit actually assume continued concentration in the industry, and one of the reason why we are comfortable in that beside growing the content in the device as Paul mentioned as well as in some of the adjacent markets that we talked about. Is that we believe that our investments that we made over the last several years and we are going to continue to make in key areas are protecting us in this area.","Now one of things that happened over the last several years that has masked this effect a bit is that we\u2019ve been growing really into a growing market and growing share. Now we are at a point where I think the business is very much at scale. We are continuing to grow at the high-tier but now we are moderating I think the size of our investments to really show leverage in the business.","And you will start to see that I think more in the second half of the fiscal year as we work through this bubble that George mentioned in terms of operating expenses. Maybe I\u2019ll let Derek comment on the impact of licensing. He probably can cover that better than I could.","Derek Aberle","It\u2019s Derek. So I think, as Steve pointed out, we\u2019re continuing to see growth and expect to see growth in the high-tier. The high-tier actually has a pretty wide spread of selling prices, and so as Steve pointed out, there might be a situation where some of our, not the highest tier, but still a high-tier part are going into devices that still from a licensing perspective we would categorize as high-tier. And although, as the selling prices come down, we have things like caps that may cause a muted effect as some of the ASPs come down. So probably be some impact on licensing, but I would expect it to be less than what\u2019s been seen right now in QCT.","George S. Davis","Kulbinde, this is George. Just want to add one other point. I think you would ask about the dependency on China LTE in the second half and I would just say that our actions on operating expenses, our actions on product cost improvements, both in the supply chain and internally plus our view of where the part mix goes based on the launches, all those are factors that are not depended on that that help us in the second half of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.","Tavis C. McCourt \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for taking my question, a couple of them. First, specifically on the Snapdragon 200, which I think was the first purpose built design lower in Snapdragon, where are you in terms of shipments related to that and is there more coming in terms of low-end designs or is that one design that could help the margins to flow in?","Steve Mollenkopf","Sure. Tavis, the 200, I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t have the actual numbers on that. That was a very successful product for us and continues to do well. I just don\u2019t remember what the numbers are. If you look at our product portfolio looking forward, I think we\u2019re pretty pleased actually with the design traction in the lower part of the roadmap.","Today we have a couple of products, the AX10 and similar family that I think is doing a fairly good job in terms of design traction, particularly in international OEMs that are now looking at the growth in the China market as a growth area, particularly when they see the same concentration in developed markets and they\u2019re going after that and they intend to after that with products that we\u2019re engaging with them on.","Additionally, we are coming out with a product that\u2019s already sampling. It\u2019s actually going to be in devices here soon, which is essentially a lower tier AP, but also a LTE solution as well. And we expect that to also be an important product, not only in China, but also worldwide.","So we\u2019re continuing to, I think, put more focus on the low-end versus what we have had historically and really refreshing that product line. In addition, we are working on an cost optimized architecture for the low-end, which we think in addition to providing good design traction will also improve our cost structure down there as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark McKechnie with Evercore. Please go ahead with your question. Mark, your line is open. Please ensure that your line isn\u2019t on mute.","Mark McKechnie \u2013 Evercore Partners","Hi. Yes. Thank you. Sorry, it was on mute. This question is for Derek. The implied royalty rate for QTL, you brought up some of the factors that caused that to drop there in September. Could you just give us a sense for directionally how you see that moving throughout fiscal 2014? Thanks.","Derek Aberle","Hey, Mark, I was planning to give probably more color around that in New York. If you look at last year for instance that\u2019s kind of at the beginning of the year, we thought our best guess at the outset was we would come in maybe a little under the 338 range or so. But we said at the time that that was based on our current outlook of the market and as you know the market grew significantly faster than we expected.","And also ASPs went up throughout the year and so couple of things that we noted was that, if those things came through, it would likely be bit of a drag on the rate, which is kind of where we ended the year, here about 327 taking into account the last quarter. So I'm planning to go through kind of what we see in New York in a couple of weeks bearing in mind that there are so many factors that impact the rate that it is pretty hard to forecast that far out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura. Please go ahead with your question.","Romit J. Shah \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Yes. Thanks. Steve, MSM units at the midpoint look like they are up about 6% in December, which is below the growth rate we saw in December of last year and the year before. Could you talk a little bit about channel inventories? How your biggest customers are managing supply, and I guess tagged into that how do we think about seasonality for March?","Steve Mollenkopf","Okay, I will start and maybe some of my colleagues can jump in as well. I think particularly comparing to last, last year I think was an exceptionally strong year. So I think comparing to last year is difficult to do. I think from two perspectives; one, as we were coming off of a supply constrained environment. We also had I think some very strong product launches that also impacted that last year.","This year I think you are seeing a combination of a little bit weaker mix than what we typically see and then people trying to figure out how to deal with the concentration that is existing in the handset industry. And we\u2019re seeing that little bit in our orders. The other thing I would caution too is that, these things can change now pretty radically in terms of how the smartphone business works. So this is our best estimate right now. We expect to see, I think, good unit growth but these dynamics can change pretty rapidly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America.

Please go ahead with your question.","Vijay R. Rakesh \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","So just two questions here, you mentioned the cost side. I was wondering the 28 nanometer works \u2013 do you have any acting things going on your product line as you look at 2014?","Steve Mollenkopf","Hi. The answer is yes. I will say we are in a constant state of deciding which products go to the next node and cost optimizing them. Also a lot of work even on, particularly in the low tier, how do we change the packaging to make it more appropriate for the low tier which is fairly different than what's in the high tier. So it is a constant effort for us to do that. As you know we have multiple sources of supply and some of this suppliers are a bit more focused on the lower cost notes versus the high performance notes, and you will see some times CS move supply around consistent with those goals.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with CLSA Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","Srini R. Pajjuri \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you, Steve a question on the mix of modem versus Snapdragon, how should we think about it for next year versus last year?","George S. Davis","Srini, this is George. What we are seeing is volumetrically it\u2019s easier to see. We believe we\u2019ll be starting out stronger in the first part of the year than we saw last year. How that plays out will really depend on product launches in the second half of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Mark Sue \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you, George we recognized it\u2019s easier to control OpEx to protect your profitability. That program reduced your cost of goods particular at the low end. I don\u2019t know what\u2018s the matter with the high-tier. China any how we can quantify improving contribution margins going forward and maybe where we are in terms of extracting further value from the supply chain what programs that we can do on the gross profit side. And indirect, I usually ask the same question on your cost of level to collect TD LTE?","George S. Davis","Clearly we see the actions that we are taking. This is obviously managing our costs. We are not just focusing on OpEx, the supply chain you can affected by how you design and you can also affected by how you interact with the supply chain and we are obviously focused on all of those things. And as we sided part of the improvement that we see in the second half comes from some of the actions that we are taking above the line not just below the line.","Mark Sue \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","So they\u2019re going to on the LTE TDD question I think really probably not much change from last year, we continue to believe that we\u2019ll be able to successfully collect on LTE broadly including in China. We continue to add additional license fees over the coarse of the quarter on sort of single mode LTE several of those came from China as well. And we\u2019ve actually seen recently in the last couple of months some positive statements from the operators as well as some of the government officials in China that I think are consistent with our prior view.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.","Blayne Curtis \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good afternoon guys, thanks for taking the question. Lot of focus on today\u2019s view, I just wanted to go back I want to make sure I heard you right, if you could just talk about the adoption or the tax rate with Wi-Fi that\u2019s the way to add content. Relatively go back on the traction you\u2019re seeing with RFP, I think you said you will \u2013 that the EP shipping now but the TA will ship this fiscal year, can you just talk about the doubts that you\u2019re seeing with the OEMs and if you frame it with any sort of design wins or any color would be great, thanks.","Steve Mollenkopf","Sure, Blayne this is Steve. On the Wi-Fi side I think I mentioned that the unit share which includes all of our OEMs including ones which includes our modem solutions as well as our MSM solutions. We are now roughly 50% probably little higher than that, and we think that\u2019s going to grow into next year. if we were to back out solutions that are essentially just the once at MSM it\u2019s significantly higher than that. We are very pleased actually with how Wi-Fi has gone and we\u2019ve talked for many years that we thought it would go into a similar way that Bluetooth and GPS have gone. It\u2019s just something that it\u2019s just advantageous to the customer for us to deliver together. So I think that\u2019s worked out there quite well.","On RF360, I think the main point is it\u2019s on track. You\u2019ve already seen the first products come out and I think they have been pretty well covered actually in the blogs, but there are some devices that you are probably well known that have come out with the first version which is ET, the ET solution.","Throughout fiscal year 2014 we will see additional products within that family start to launch and that\u2019s again, as we expected, they\u2019re on track and we are pleased with how that goes. We think that\u2019s going to be an interesting business for us not only from the perspective of growing continental device, but it\u2019s also important for us to be able to solve the RF band problem, which we think we\u2019re well ahead of the competition and that will help us with not only in the additional business, but also pull-through I think our leadership in LTE.","Operator","This end our allotted time for questions and answers.

Revenue was up 28%, and non-GAAP earnings per share was up 16% compared to a year ago. Adoption of 3G and 3G\/4G technologies continues around the world, and our licensees report stronger-than-expected total reported device sales driven by strength in high-end smartphones.","Looking forward, we're now forecasting approximately 14% growth of 3G\/4G device shipments in calendar 2012, reflecting a slightly more cautious outlook on the macroeconomic environment. We now also expect the profile of the calendar year to be more back-end loaded as new devices are launched for the holiday season.","Now although our outlook for semiconductor volumes in the fiscal fourth quarter has been reduced from our prior expectations, we are ramping our supply of 28 nanometer chipsets. We expect this ramp, along with new devices launched for the holiday season, to result in a strong December quarter for our semiconductor business.","During the third fiscal quarter and up through today, we returned approximately $1.4 billion in capital to stockholders. This includes approximately $1 billion in stock repurchases. We believe that the combination of dividends and stock repurchases are effective means to increase our stockholders' returns and build additional stockholder value.","In QCT, we're continuing to see strong demand for our new Snapdragon S4, and other 28 nanometer chipsets, and that demand continues to exceed our available supply. We will continue to ramp capacity in the upcoming quarters consistent with our prior expectation. However, the constraints on 28 nanometer supply are continuing to limit our potential revenue upside this fiscal year.","QCT continues to drive technology and product leadership, including the sampling of 802.11ac solutions for mobile computing and networking products and several new chipsets in the Snapdragon S4 family.","QTL continues to grow and expand its base of licensees, and we now have over 215 CDMA licensees, including our first major Brazilian licensee, Digibras Group. We now also have more than 25 royalty-bearing, single-mode OFDMA licensing -- licensees. And as with 3G, we believe that our 4G portfolio is the most widely licensed in the industry.","On the spectrum front, Bharti Airtel, a leading wireless -- Indian wireless operator, acquired a 49% interest in our Indian BWA entities. One of our key objectives from the outset of our investment has been to include a strong Indian operator as our partner in the Indian venture with the scale, experiences and resources to deploy and operate an LTE TDD network. We're very pleased to have Bharti's participation and support in this effort.","Also related to spectrum, the European CEPT reached an initial conclusion, which is subject to final approval, to harmonize the L-Band for supplemental downlink. This is the same spectrum that we own in the U.K. This is an important milestone, and it opens up the potential to have our carrier aggregation technology deployed widely across Europe.","With respect to QMT, we're now focusing on licensing our next-generation mirasol display technology and will directly commercialize only certain mirasol products. We believe that this strategy will better align our updated roadmap with the addressable opportunities.","Looking forward, we believe that our long-term growth drivers remain intact. Smartphone demand continues to grow. Gartner estimates that approximately 145 million smartphones were shipped in the first calendar quarter of this year, representing 45% growth year-over-year. In China alone, they estimate that approximately 33 million smartphones were shipped, representing greater than 160% year-over-year growth. This year, Gartner estimates that China will become the largest consumer of smartphone. And just to give you some idea of the interest, I recently attended China Telecom's 3G handset fair where it was reported that more than 20,000 industry players and 200,000 consumers attended. And at that event, China Telecom encouraged their manufacturers to launch a full range of smartphones from flagship devices through all of the tiers.","The overall growth of 3G remains strong especially in emerging regions. According to Wireless Intelligence, at the end of June, of the 1.8 billion 3G connections globally, there were greater than 900 million 3G connections in emerging regions, representing a 42% growth year-over-year. We believe the burgeoning opportunity beyond handsets is front of us -- is in front of us and, moving forward, will be driven by the growth in 3G\/4G connectivity from tablets, mobile PCs, machine-to-machine and other devices. We're encouraged by developments in the computing space with Microsoft's support behind the ecosystem for Windows RT with general availability expected in October.","On the legal front, I wanted to give you an update on our ongoing SEC and DOJ investigations. As we noted in our 10-Q, which was filed today, we have discovered and, as part of our ongoing cooperation with these investigations, have informed the SEC and DOJ of instances in which special hiring consideration, gifts or other benefits were provided to several individuals associated with certain Chinese state-owned companies or agencies. Based on the facts currently known, we believe that the monetary value of these benefits in aggregate to be less than $250,000, excluding employment compensation. We're continuing to investigate the circumstances related to providing these benefits and are attempting to identify when -- whether any other benefits were provided. We're continuing to cooperate with these investigations, but we are unable to predict their outcome. Given the ongoing nature of the investigations, we'll have no further comments beyond the foregoing and what's contained in our Form 10-Q.","So to conclude, we've completed another solid quarter at Qualcomm. And despite some challenging near-term market dynamics and supply constraints, we're very pleased to see the continued growth of 3G and 3G\/4G multimode smartphones, as well as new mobile computing devices. We're looking forward to an exciting portfolio of device launches for the holiday season and are anticipating a strong December quarter on the semiconductor front and believe that we are well positioned for the opportunities ahead. Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Steve Mollenkopf.","Steven M. Mollenkopf","Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to first congratulate Cristiano Amon and Dr. Murthy Renduchintala on their new roles as co-presidents of Qualcomm mobile and computing products. Their leadership has been instrumental in our success to date, and I look forward to working with them in their expanded roles. Dr. Craig Barratt will continue as President of QCA, focusing on connectivity and networking products, and Jim Lederer will continue in his current General Manager role, leading the sport organizations across the semiconductor business.","QCT shipped 141 million MSMs this quarter, up 18% year-over-year but below our prior expectations. Our fiscal third quarter MSM shipments and our outlook for the fourth quarter have been impacted by a number of factors, including a near-term reduction in the 3G\/4G inventory channel, which we believe reflects a pause and a re-profiling of demand prior to the launch of some key flagship devices for the holiday season. Additionally, we have seen some impact from customer mix shifts and competitive pressures in the low tiers, as well as a slowdown in the industry demand for USB dongles, particularly in Europe.","We continue to be supplies constrained on our 28 nanometer products but are ramping supply with multiple foundries in the September quarter and again into the December quarter consistent with our prior expectations. We currently project that we'll be able to closely match supply with demand as we exit the calendar year.","The reduced demand profile and ongoing 28 nanometer supply constraints, as well as our increased efforts to bring additional 28 nanometer capacity online and continue investments in our QRD and mobile computing programs in advance of the opportunities ahead are driving lower operating margins in the fiscal third and fourth quarters versus historical norms.","Looking ahead, we anticipate a strong lineup of device launches leading into the holiday season and believe QCT is well positioned for the December quarter, particularly with the increasing supply of industry-leading chipsets for high-tier devices.","Over 15 devices based on our S4 MSM8960 28 nanometer chipsets have launched to date, including the Samsung GALAXY S III, the HTC One S and One X, LG Optimus LTE2, Pantech Vega Racer 2 and Sony Xperia SX. There are now more than 420 announced Snapdragon-based devices with over 400 more in design, including 175 S4 designs. Third-party reviews and benchmarks again reinforced our product leadership this quarter, confirming that the Snapdragon MSM8960 outperforms quad-core CPUs-based handsets by using a complete multi-core system with our custom GPU, DSP and dual-Krait CPU cores. We also sampled 3 new S4 chips this quarter, including the APQ8064 and the MSM8x30. The APQ8064 includes 4 Krait CPUs. It is the first to use our new Adreno 320 GPU and will extend the performance expectations we recently established with the MSM8960. The MSM8x30 integrates a multi-mode LG or 3G LTE and is designed to enable 3G\/4G smartphones at high-volume price points globally.","Our modem leadership also continues to be a differentiator for design wins in modem plus AP smartphones, in tablets, modules and WiFi personal hotspots, including over 90 designs in process based on our 28 nanometer 3G\/4G LTE MDM9x15 modem. While many companies are still commercializing their first LTE products, we have already announced our third-generation LTE chipsets and will continue investing in our modem road map to maintain our leadership.","Our connectivity solutions, which include WiFi, GPS, GLONASS, Bluetooth and FM, continue to be used in a vast majority of our customers' designs on the S4. Our new-generation 802.11ac solutions are being designed into smartphones, tablets, computers and networking products and align with the WiFi industry's certifications timeline to enable 802.11ac interoperable products in market by early 2013.","In emerging regions, our QRD program, which provides turnkey designs for affordable smartphones, continues to expand rapidly. We continue to grow our QRD road map with differentiated technology, including our new Snapdragon 8x25 1.2 gigahertz dual-core chipset, which began shipping commercially in July, only 2 months after first sampling. We are engaged with over 40 OEMs, many of which are now transitioning their platforms from 2G to 3G, and these OEMs have announced approximately 50 devices based on our chipsets for China and other emerging countries. In addition to the announced devices, we currently have 100 new QRD-based smartphone designs in the pipeline.","We also continue to invest in mobile computing and are pleased to see the momentum building around the new ARM-based Windows platform. As the only chipset provider supporting Windows on both PCs and phones sold commercially, we look forward to the availability of both Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 this fall.","Looking ahead, while we are forecasting sequentially lower MSM shipments based on midpoints in the September quarter consistent with the pause and re-profiling of demand, we expect a strong December quarter as new high-tier smartphone devices launch for the holidays and we have an improved supply of 28 nanometer products.","That concludes my remarks, and I will now turn the call over to Bill Keitel.","William E. Keitel","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We have another good quarter. Compared to last year, our fiscal third quarter revenues were up 28% to $4.6 billion, non-GAAP operating income was up 23% to $1.7 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was up 16% to $0.85 per share.","As both Paul and Steve mentioned, our results this quarter and updated fiscal 2012 guidance reflect estimated reductions in the 3G\/4G inventory channel in the June and September quarters, as well as our expectation that a greater percentage of calendar year volume will be sold in the December quarter as new, high-tier devices launch for the holidays.","We continue to expect this to drive a strong December quarter for our chipset business.","In QTL, total reported device sales by our licensees were up 31% year-over-year to $47.8 billion and above the high end of our prior guidance range, driven by strong smartphone demand. We estimate that approximately 206 million to 211 million 3G\/4G-based devices were shipped by our licensees in the March quarter at an average selling price of approximately $226 to $232, up approximately $15 sequentially, reflecting higher average selling prices in multiple regions, particularly Europe and developed regions in Asia, and combined with lower mix of data modems.","QCT shipped 141 million MSMs, up 18% year-over-year but below our expectations at the outset of the quarter for the reasons Steve just explained.","During the third fiscal quarter and the first few weeks of this current quarter, we returned approximately $1.4 billion of capital to our stockholders, including dividends paid of $429 million and approximately $990 million for stock repurchases.","Now turning to our guidance. We are modifying our estimate of global 3G\/4G-based device shipments for calendar year 2012, reflecting economists' more cautious view on the 2012 world economy. We now estimate that between 875 million and 935 million 3G\/4G-based devices will ship in calendar year 2012, up approximately 14% year-over-year at the midpoint.","We expect the second half profile to be similar to calendar year 2011, which had muted growth of 3G\/4G devices in the September quarter and very strong growth in the December quarter.","We estimate that the average selling price of 3G\/4G-based devices for fiscal 2012 will be approximately $216 to $222. The $219 midpoint is $7 above our prior $212 midpoint estimate primarily driven by higher average selling prices in multiple regions, including an increased mix of smartphone shipments, particularly at the high tier.","We expect fiscal 2012 revenues to be in the range of approximately $18.7 billion to $19.1 billion, up approximately 26% year-over-year at the midpoint. We anticipate fiscal 2012 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $3.61 to $3.67, up approximately 14% year-over-year at the midpoint.","In QCT, we estimate operating margins to be approximately 18% to 19% for the fiscal year, lower by approximately 100 basis points than our prior estimate, and reflecting reduced expectations for MSM volumes driven primarily by lower expected 3G\/4G channel inventory and a re-profiling of demand prior to new devices being launched for the holiday season. We expect the combination of non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to grow approximately 24% year-over-year.","We estimate our fiscal 2012 tax rate to be approximately 20% for both GAAP and non-GAAP and a bit higher than our prior estimates driven by the mix of our foreign and domestic earnings.","Specific to the fiscal fourth quarter, we estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $4.45 billion to $4.85 billion, up approximately 13% year-over-year at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $0.78 to $0.84, up approximately 1% year-over-year at the midpoint.","We estimate that our subscriber licensees will report total reported device sales of approximately $43.5 billion to $47.5 billion in the September quarter for shipments they made in the June quarter and up approximately 16% year-over-year at the midpoint.","We anticipate shipments of approximately 134 million to 142 million MSM units during the September quarter with revenue per MSM higher sequentially, reflecting favorable product mix, including lower sequential shipments of shipments [ph] for data modems and increased volume of 28 nanometer products.","We estimate that the 3G\/4G inventory channel declined in the June quarter, and our guidance includes an additional bleed of channel inventory in the September quarter, ahead of new device launches for the holidays. We estimate the channel inventory will exit the fiscal year at or slightly below the low end of the 13- to 18-week normal range.","We expect QCT's operating margin to be approximately 14% in the fourth fiscal quarter, approximately 500 basis points below the midpoint of our prior outlook and driven primarily by the expected contraction of 3G\/4G channel inventory and re-profiling of demand prior to new devices launching for the holiday season.","We anticipate fourth fiscal quarter non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses combined will increase sequentially approximately 11%, reflecting continued QCT investments in 28 nanometer, QRD products and mobile computing.","That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren Kneeshaw.","Warren Kneeshaw","Thank you, Bill. Josh, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity.","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Bill, just 2 questions for me. One, just on the mirasol going to a licensing model, could you remind us what kind of impact was -- mirasol might have had to earnings this year and how that business model might change? And then just on a higher level on the royalty side, much better-than-expected QTL ASPs, but there's certain smartphones that are dominating the high end of the market. So with that coming more in the holiday season, would you expect us to see ASPs drop maybe for the next 2 quarters and recover again into the March quarter given QTL's reported quarter arrears [ph]? I'm just trying to get a feel for the new cadence of ASPs as they might be tied to certain high-end smartphone launches.","William E. Keitel","Sure, Mike. On mirasol, we did announce today a shift in our focus, a bit more of a licensing focus number one. And number two, commercialization. We're going to be focused on certain mirasol products. The impact for the year, this fiscal year, will be relatively muted since we're largely through the year. But we do expect some changes to be taking effect for fiscal '13. On the royalty side, yes, we -- Mike, we do expect quite a strong December quarter for the QCT business, and we expect a very large increase in the overall shipments of 3G\/4G devices. And that will then -- should extend then to a strong second fiscal quarter for the QTL business. On the ASP front, I think it's always prudent to be cautious on ASPs rising. We do -- but I think a reasonable expectation is low single-digit decrease on an annual basis.","Operator","Sam Weil [ph] with the Bank of Montreal.","Unknown Analyst","Just getting back to the chip business. I think you said ASPs went up and they're expected to go up again next quarter. Just looking at the profitability there, obviously the volumes hurt, but it looks to me, by my calculations, we had another tick down in gross margin. So I'm just curious, what would be causing the gross margin pressure still than just competition? And then you did mention 28 nanometer helping the ASP. I'm curious both on ASP and gross margin as we get into Q3 and really calendar Q4 when the volumes are fully there. How should that impact both ASP and gross margin? And how much of that will be passed through the model? And how much will be used to maybe accelerate the QRD program? So if you could help us talk about the balance between the profitability and growth as we transition to 28 nanometer.","William E. Keitel","Sure. I'll take stab at it here, but others might want to chime in. On the chip ASPs, yes, we do expect a sequential increase from Q3 to Q4. There is, of course, pressure on the gross margins. We've been seeing that now for some time. It's consistent -- largely consistent with our expectations. No real surprises there. But we've added into the business mix what has traditionally been lower gross margin products, number one. Number two, as we're going more in -- more and more into emerging markets, it does have a lower cost profile and price profile. So that puts pressure on it. But, I mean, aside from the supply shortages and channel inventory corrections, we've been able to sustain still a pretty rich operating margin in this environment of pressure on the gross margins. The 28 nanometer, I think, fits much into that fold. I won't comment directly on the gross margin of 28 nanometer, but I think you're aware we have stated in the past that we have been pricing pretty aggressively. But nonetheless, these are very rich products, and we think we're quite a distance ahead of the competition as well. So I do think it will be a nice positive to our business as we ramp 28 nanometer here.","Operator","Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank.","Brian T. Modoff - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Steve, on the 28 nanometer, can you talk a little bit about how you see demand in the current quarter? You've talked about hitting 1\/3 of volume by September. Is that still feasible? In terms of the guide down sequentially, is this -- a lot of this -- have you seen cuts in the 45-nanometer demand trends as well? And then are you bringing a second source on for -- in terms of meeting the demand as you get into the fourth quarter? And are you happy with the yields that you're seeing on that second source at this point?","Steven M. Mollenkopf","Brian, yes, it's Steve. The 28 nanometer right now, as I said, we're supply limited. So it's -- and it's going quite well in terms of bringing up additional sources. We actually have 4 sources that we're now bringing up. If you track through the calendar year, we're engaged with all of them now. And it's going the way that we had thought. You had -- you talked a little bit about the 45-nanometer products and such, and I think what you're seeing a bit of is a little less of the backfill that we would have expected. And I think that's consistent with what we were talking about, the re-profiling of demand. That's really a little bit less of the backfill and a little bit more waiting for the new products to come out. So we're just working very hard to try to get those products out the door.","Brian T. Modoff - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So in terms of talking through the -- just talking about a more positive December quarter, some of this is you're getting demand. People want the 28 nanometer. So the push in demand is to that quarter is what you're saying?","Steven M. Mollenkopf","That's right. You -- at the same time, you're -- we have a significant demand for the 28-nanometer products. And as you get into the December quarter, you now have a tier of products on 28 nanometer, which, I think, is a big advantage for our portfolio. And they're moving forward. And you're essentially in a situation where demand is increasing and supply is increasing, and we're trying to match those 2 ramps. And it's -- we're just in execution mode getting through that right now and engaged with 4 fabs in order to do that.","Operator","Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of questions. First, Steve, in the past, you've given us a sense of the growth in Snapdragon. I was wondering if you'd do it again in terms of however you look at it, quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year, half-over-half, whatever you can give us in terms of what the Snapdragon growth is. And Bill, on the ASP jump from the $214 to $229 in the March quarter, it seems relatively -- I mean, that's a large jump. Can at least some of that -- and obviously, you said that -- I heard the narrative that you said, and it makes sense that smartphones are growing. But could some of that be explained by higher tablets that are going in there because they go in at the full ASP as opposed to at the truncated ASP? I'm just wondering just if -- any granularity you have, an explanation of that large jump and what we should do with that going forward? And then when you were talking about this year unfolding similar to last year with a more muted September on the QCT unit side and a stronger December, last year, we went from 127 million in September to 156 million in December. So on absolute value terms, 30 units. This year, we're going be somewhere in the, by your guidance, mid- to high 130s, probably high 130s, maybe around 140. Should we be looking again at the same 30 million uptick as we look into December? Or should we be looking at higher because it's just a bigger market and a bigger year?","Steven M. Mollenkopf","Ehud, it's -- this is Steve. Your first question was about growth in Snapdragon. Snapdragon's a big portion of our shipments now. And if you look at the year-over-year, it's probably in the high 20s in terms of percent growth. And that includes -- that's if I looked at the quarter we just were reporting on now. That includes the fact that a number of the Snapdragon products are, of course, 28-nanometer products and they're a bit supply-constrained today. So we would have even seen higher growth than that year-over-year. So we're quite pleased with how the Snapdragon product line is ramping throughout the year, so. And I'll -- I think the second part is really more Bill could perhaps take.","Derek K. Aberle","Ehud, let me -- this is Derek. Let me jump in on the ASP. I think actually, the increase quarter-over-quarter on the ASP was pretty broad based. Just generally stronger ASPs across both emerging and developed regions. The tablet numbers, although they tend to go up and down with the market, have remained relatively constant in terms of a percentage of total units. And so although again, we saw strength across pretty much all products and geographies, it wasn't driven by an increase in the percentage of tablets as compared to total units.","William E. Keitel","And Ehud, Bill. On your last question, the profile for the year, for 2011, calendar 2011, our estimate is about 24% of the total devices that year were shipped in the September quarter. And then there was a large jump to approximately 30% of the total devices shipped in the December quarter. And that's for 2011. Our estimates for 2012 are -- based on the midpoint of that -- the 905 million total units is very similar to that profile that I just quoted for last year. And by the way, that's -- that information is now on our website if anybody wants to take a look at that.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","If I can follow up? So should your QCT units match that? Or is it going to be different because you have maybe unusually low share now with 28 nanometers restricted and maybe proportionally higher share in December once your restriction is over. So maybe even more drastic than that 21 to 30?","William E. Keitel","I think it's best I refrain getting too specific on the first fiscal quarter of 2013. I'll just say that we're looking for a pretty substantial increase in QCT's quantity of MSMs.","Operator","Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions. First, to clarify. With your comments on the 28 nanometer, suffice to say it's alleviating in the December quarter, was that referring to the entirety of the December quarter? Or is it just for the exit run rate? In other words, would you still see inability to meet some of the demand in the entirety of that quarter? And then as it pertains to your chipset margin, is there any reason to think that in December, chipset margins should not be above your typical average margin given the volumes you're expecting?","Steven M. Mollenkopf","Simona, it's -- this is Steve. The supply really exits the quarter on a matched situation. It doesn't end -- enter the quarter that way. So at the beginning of the quarter, we still have a gap that  we need to deal with, but it improves throughout the quarter. We think it matches up toward the end.","William E. Keitel","And Simona, it's Bill. On the margin side, it's -- well, it's preliminary here. We do expect a nice, increasing QCT op margin. But understand, it's still going to be a very active quarter in terms of ramping the supply. So there's going to be a high level of costs supporting that. So I think it's too early to comment or maybe even to expect that the December quarter would be above our averages in the past.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So then maybe just a question for Paul. In terms of looking strategically longer at some of your big customers who are becoming more vertically integrated, and obviously, we had the announcement yesterday from Samsung are buying some of the technology and connectivity from CSR, now how should we think about customers like that longer term for fall coming in terms of your potential share of their silicon business?","Paul E. Jacobs","Yes. So we've had these same issues throughout the history of the company where internal efforts -- people try to build the silicon for their own chipsets. And I think the key way to combat that, as we've done all along, is to continue to drive the technology hard. Obviously, we're driving it very rapidly in a number of areas now, not just the radio. It used to be just the radio. But now it's also processor and graphics technology. And we've seen -- I'm sure you've seen a number of the benchmarks coming out talking about how, I think the latest one I saw was on graphics, how we were really winning on the graphics side but, obviously also, on the computing side, we've had great comparisons. So the key, as I said, is drive the technology hard. Do people for their internal uses have enough scale to invest at the same rate that we do? And the answer is generally no. And plus, we have just a level of experience that we can bring to bear, and I think that, that strategy will continue to work as it has in the past.","Operator","Rod Hall with JPMorgan.","Rod B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of questions and clarifications. I guess first on the channel inventory. I don't think I heard, Bill, you comment on how many weeks of inventory -- the inventory is reducing down to that  below-13 level. So I don't know if you could just comment on what the change in channel inventory is from your point of view or the change in your expectation, I should say. And then also, I'm just wondering on your GDP assumption. You talked to us about what you -- what GDP assumption you make underlying your guidance. I wonder if you could just update us on that. Then on the -- just the overall demand picture, if you could talk to us about the rate of deterioration. Are you guys expecting demand, based on what you're seeing out there, to remain roughly where it is now? Or do you think demand is going to continue to deteriorate? And at what sort of rate do you think that might occur? And then on 28 nanometer, just one more thing. Can you quantify at all what kind of 28-nanometer shortfall you're assuming in the fiscal Q4 guidance?","William E. Keitel","Okay, Rod. First, on channel inventory. We think we're exiting here the June quarter at just -- or coming in -- we exited the March quarter just a little bit above 15 weeks. We think we're exiting the June quarter at a little bit below 15 weeks, and we think we're going to exit the September quarter at just below 13 weeks. So obviously, that September quarter, if that happens, which we obviously expect it will, would be almost a new low for at least our history.","Rod B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","What did you think before, Bill? Did you think it was going to be around 15 and now it's 13? Or I just wonder what you were expecting. Okay.","William E. Keitel","We thought it was going to be more flattish between just a little bit under 15 to just above 15 weeks. So that's on the channel inventory. On GDP, we're aligned with consensus economists for 2012. And you're probably aware, they recently downticked from about 3.2% world GDP growth to about 3.1%. Obviously, a little bit more in the second half of the year relative to the first half. For 2013, I'm -- I would say we're a bit below consensus right now. We're a little more cautious than where the consensus economists are. But to translate that back into our estimate, our midpoint estimate of 3G\/4G devices, so 3 months ago, our midpoint was 915 million units, and our updated guidance here is 905 million. That 10 million reduction is approximately a 1 percentage drop in the turnover rate, replacement rate of devices. We've previously been around 34%. We're just -- we're a little bit above 33% now. So as the economy weakens, we typically expect consumers to hold on to their devices a little bit longer. And we think this is concentrated for -- our decrease here is concentrated in Europe and North America. On overall demand, I think we have a good sizing on it now. The -- I think historically, we've seen, on a quarterly basis, we're pretty good at predicting MSM volume. And obviously, there's a lot of interest and focus on what we're going to be able to ship here all this quarter and particularly into December. So I feel like we have a good handle on it right now, Rod.","Rod B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And 28 nanometer?","William E. Keitel","What on 28 nanometer?","Rod B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just how much is -- they tend to the guidance in terms of shortfall?","William E. Keitel","Oh, in the shortfall. Well, let me say this. First of all, 28 nanometer, our shipment estimates both for the fourth fiscal quarter and what we expect for the first fiscal quarter, we're essentially in line with where we were 3 months ago. So the QCT team is executing well on that aggressive ramp that we had talked about last time. But going out of this quarter, if we could ship all the demand that's in front of us for this quarter, I would just say that our revenue and operating margin would be materially higher.","Operator","Tal Liani with Bank of America.","Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have 2 questions. First, the NREs. I think you said before they're going to be $200 million. Can you give an update on where it is and when would this be reversed? Second, the -- on the same topic, is -- should we expect the OpEx intensity ratio or OpEx ratio to be relatively the same as you transition to smaller geometries? Or are we going to see improvement sometimes once you're done with the 28 nano? Those are my 2 questions.","William E. Keitel","Sure. Tal, it's Bill. On the NRE, I think your -- I think the 200 million is referring to our -- the increase in R&D that we're looking at approximately this time of year versus where we were at the outset of the year. I want to answer your question correctly because that's approximately what we're up in R&D outlook, current outlook for fiscal 2012 versus the outlook at the outset of fiscal 2012. Am I vectored correctly with it?","Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes. Yes, I...","William E. Keitel","Yes, all right. Yes, the key components of that, foremost, is spending around 28-nanometer products, both the -- accelerating the supply as much as we could, but then also, there's been expansion in the products and the future road map for those products. That's number one. Secondly would be the mobile computing. We've stepped up our investments there relative to what we expected at the outset of the year. Thirdly would be you heard Steve talk a lot about how well we're doing on the modem. And so we have stepped that investment up, both -- carrier aggregation being one example. There's a lot of demand for that right now. And then lastly would be in QCA, the Atheros business. Those would be the 4 primary areas that make up the great majority of the R&D increase this year. Steve, anything to add to that?","Steven M. Mollenkopf","Well, I might say that this year is a little bit unusual in the sense that we pulled in some real [ph] SLA [ph] investments essentially to accelerate the speed at which we're going through future nodes. So this year is a little bit faster than you would typically see because we're trying to go through the nodes even faster than we have done in the past. And you're seeing that in the OpEx this year in particular. The other aspect, just to add to the QCA comment, was we're seeing significant fan out in terms of design wins on our connectivity products, and we're essentially scaling up our ability to deliver on those design wins. Those are probably the 2 of the bigger topics we're having right now.","William E. Keitel","And then the last one, Tal, this was on OpEx, operating expense, intensity and -- particularly in light of new -- as we go through new geometries from here. I think the key there is scale. And we're doing very well on scale. So we've got a good opportunity to manage our operating expense intensity, I think, pretty well. But the key, I think, there is scale.","Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So if you look at -- just to combine your 2 answers, if you look at the growth in OpEx this year, given that next year you have other plans and -- to drive different technologies, is the hike this year kind of one-off? Or is it going to be reversed? Or is this just a new level that from this point onward, it depend -- revenue growth will determine the margin level of the company unless the decline in OpEx?","William E. Keitel","I think, Tal, this year, it's unusual in respect that we've ramped the operating expenses even though we aren't able to ship all of our customer demand. That's a rare case in our history where we can't ship demand. But going forward then, the operating expense intensity, I think we've said in the past we expect that -- I mean, our goal is to improve it. It isn't -- I -- that isn't a guidance point for fiscal '13, but I would take it as a guidance point looking 3 years out. And maybe Paul, I don't [indiscernible].","Paul E. Jacobs","Yes, I just wanted to say also we're obviously investing a lot in QMT. We're looking at the opportunities to -- on that business model to reduce some of the expenses that we have there. And so that could have a pretty significant impact as well.","Operator","Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I  was wondering first if you could talk a little bit about emerging markets. We've seen some signs of weakness in emerging markets in the handsets and in others and even some of your big customers reporting to more weakness there. But your own outlook seems to be pointing more weakness in developed markets or even where you took guidance down with more in developed markets than in emerging. So if you could talk about some of the dynamics that you're seeing between those, so that'd be helpful, and particularly potential impacts going forward on ASPs. I think for -- and just a second question, if you could just maybe comment a little bit about the recent IP restructuring that you guys did. If you could give us a little more commentary on the rationale for that. And then any sort of impacts or not that, that may have going forward, that would be helpful.","William E. Keitel","Stacy, I'll take your first point. On the emerging market side, now we -- our estimates within that 915 million midpoint estimate that we shared 3 months ago are largely intact. So I have seen some reports here where some people are seeing some surprises here and there. But overall, we feel it's holding fairly steady. So the 2 changes we really made in our estimates for this year are North America and Europe and really just a bit of an extension on the replacement rate that we had previously been forecasting. So I think emerging is holding strong. And then on the -- expect on ASPs, as we said in the past, as we're seeing smartphones penetrating emerging markets. And so the ASP trends that we've been seeing on the emerging front is -- has been really quite positive to us.","Derek K. Aberle","This is Derek. Let me just take a second answer to your question on the corporate restructuring. So we just went through the corporate restructuring for a variety of reasons. I think it's something that if you look kind of across various industries, that companies will adopt as a corporate structure separating certain businesses and liabilities for other regions. But also, obviously, a big part of this was to kind of reflect the way that we've been doing business for a number of years and to further protect the intellectual property portfolio for some of the activities of the operating businesses such as the chip business. And in particular, we've been working quite a bit with open source historically and feel very good about the way we've been doing that. But we expect that, that need will continue to increase, and this just kind of further protects the important intellectual property that underpins the licensing business from some claims or inadvertent activities by others in the business.","Operator","Jeff Kvaal with Barclays.","Jeffrey T. Kvaal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I have a couple, gentlemen. I think the first is to follow up on the internal production. I think we've seen the pendulum shift back and forth between internal and outsourced a bit over the years. Where are we in the current swing? Should we expect production to go a little bit more internal perhaps over the course of the next few quarters or years? Then my second question is on the Intel-ASML relationship. I wonder if you had some observations on that of how you feel about your access to capacity looking out over a 5- to 10-year period.","Steven M. Mollenkopf","This is Steve. I'm assuming the first question is really more about the vertical customers. I would say that it's really consistent with what Paul said. I think it's getting harder and harder to create chipsets moving forward. It's primarily because in order to create particularly high-end products, you need to innovate across so many different technology vectors. And unless you're fairly large and you have a fairly broad technology portfolio and you're at the leading nodes, I think you're going to have a difficult time producing the type of products that you need. So in our view, it's actually getting harder to do chipsets and so, therefore, probably more favoring of our model. With regards to the ASML and really the 450 move, our view essentially that the industry moving that direction and supporting larger wafers and really bringing the economies of scale even to further out nodes is something that we actually want to see happen. But it's also the expense is so large. It's unlikely to us that one company is going to be able to put something in place that will advance them and given the fact that it's just going to require a number of different companies to put the investment in. So we're happy to see that the industry is moving in a way that keeps Moore's Law working. We think that's good for our business as it is for others.","Jeffrey T. Kvaal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Are you comfortable that -- or should we expect you to be contributing to procuring that capacity yourself, Steve? Does it mean you would do it on your own or as a part of a group?","Steven M. Mollenkopf","Well, I hope [ph] -- I think you'll start to see some of our fab partners perhaps working on that, but I don't have any special information on that. We're still committed to the fabless model. It served us well. And with our size, I think we're probably a bigger player in terms of being able to influence it. But I don't know to the degree that our -- that we will have a direct relationship in that particular issue.","Operator","Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.","Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just want to dig into QCT margins a little bit. I understand that you said they're going to go down to somewhere around 14% in the near term, and I understand the drivers. I'm wondering how quick the snapback is. And the reason why I'm asking is that as QCT margin's at a new low, I'm just trying to think, has there been any structural change? Once upon a time, ex Atheros [ph] they were at 30%. Then we talked about the mid-20s. Now we're at 14%. I'm just thinking, as we look out beyond a couple of quarters and as you get through these ramp issues, are you really confident enough in this change to the competitive dynamics? That's my first question for Steve. On the ASP front, I understand the strength you've seen. I understand, Bill, also the conservatism you want to think about with ASPs going forward. But specifically, as you're going through the back half, many of these product launches that are discussed or speculate seem very high end. So doesn't the mix shift of the industry actually go -- even to calendar Q4 look very high end as well? And that would help licensing for the whole of next year or for a significant part of next year. What's wrong with that way of thinking of things?","William E. Keitel","Sure. Kulbinder, this is Bill. I'll take on the 14% up margin question and will there really be a quick snapback. Yes, I feel like we just had a quick snap down. I was expecting -- we were expecting 19% operating margin. We lost a little bit of volume and we're at 14%. So I do expect a quick snapback, use your terminology. But maybe more important, we've said for sometime now here our goal as a company is to look over the next 5 years or so to be improving the QCT operating margin a bit. And the June quarter, September quarter, really, that's -- it's not having any impact. It isn't making us re-question our goal there. It's just a temporary phenomena that -- and we think we understand it pretty well.","Steven M. Mollenkopf","We also have a very significant investment in pre-revenue opportunity, which is the whole mobile computing space. So we certainly expect to get a good return on that investment going forward. But right now, currently weighing down the margins.","William E. Keitel","On ASPs, I think you're characterizing a positive outlook, at least for the next couple of quarters, and we don't disagree with that. But obviously, there's a lot of pressure within the industry to be reducing prices, both consumers and carriers, and OEMs putting the pressure on their suppliers. We're trying -- we're working hard to enable that best we can. And hence, I always think it's just a little bit better to be not looking for ASP increases but just flat to modestly down, I think, is the better outlook. But I agree, we're looking -- I think the next couple of quarters look pretty positive for us.","Operator","James Faucette with Pacific Crest.","James E. Faucette - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just a few follow-up questions. First, back to Steve or Paul related to your partnerships with your foundries. I think, Steve, you said that you're now sourcing 28 nanometer from 4 different partners. Going forward as we look at future geometry and process improvements, should we expect you to continue to be diversified at the outset across multiple partners? Or should we expect you to return to concentrating on 1 or 2 key partners for future transitions, firstly? Secondly, Bill, just could you update us quickly on where we're at in terms of authorized buyback? I mean, you've been fairly active since the end of June or starting at the end of June, and I just want to make sure that I kind of know where you're at in terms of what you still have authorized.","Steven M. Mollenkopf","James, this is Steve. Our product portfolio at the high tier, we tend to be on the leading node; on the lower tiers or the mass-market tiers, we may be one node behind. So we tend to have a broad sourcing strategy to take account of the fact that we're on leading node. And also, following nodes, we tend to engage with a lot of fab partners by necessity. On the leading nodes, I think you're not going to see a big change in our strategy moving forward with the exception that we do, obviously, a much better job of matching our ramps, capacity ramps and demand ramps, as we drive leading nodes. For us, you're going to continue to see us really taking advantage of the fact that you can play the integration game at the leading nodes. And there's a number of different good road maps that we're seeing from the industry through the fab -- through fab partners, and we're going to continue to drive the best ones that we can find.","William E. Keitel","On the -- James, on the buyback authorization, as of a day or 2 ago, it was just a little under $3 billion. But I think just think in terms of -- it's about $3 billion. We have one more put that's set to expire for about $200 million. And so approximately $3 billion remaining authority on our buyback.","Operator","Parag Agarwal with UBS.","Parag Agarwal - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Steve, I just wanted to know, how do you plan to manage the QCT business as you try to balance revenue and the margins? And also, if you could give some color as to was there any impact on the gross margins you could really shoot as you're ramping for foundry partners.","Steven M. Mollenkopf","So yes, we -- really consistent with what Paul said, we -- we're now in a position where we're investing pretty heavily in a number of different pre-revenue areas, the biggest one really being the mobile computing market, which we're very happy to see the software partners doing things that we think are going to bring that to a revenue event here in the near term. So really, the way that we're looking at the businesses is this year, is we're -- even though we're continuing to grow the business, were still investing pretty heavily because we like the opportunity that exists in front of us, particularly as more and more things leverage technology that you have to develop to be a strong phone player. So we continue to drive that. We think that, that will turn into, we think, a more positive trajectory in terms of the business moving forward. There was a question that I missed.","Parag Agarwal - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","On the...","Steven M. Mollenkopf","With yield, anytime that you're ramping a new source, at the beginning part of a ramp, you don't have yield and cost numbers consistent with several quarters into ramp. And we have that given the fact that we're bringing up multiple sources. But that's part of what we're spending a lot of energy now trying to get that as quickly as possible.","Operator","This concludes the allotted time for question and answers. Dr. Jacobs, do you have anything further to add before adjourning the call?","Paul E. Jacobs","Yes, I just wanted to close by saying that we're very happy with the strong growth this quarter. Obviously, it could have been better and we're disappointed that we're not able yet to fulfill demand, but we are working very hard to bring up additional capacity. And we're certainly pleased that our customers are working with us through the shortages, and we're very excited that they're building some absolutely great products. So we'll work through this near term. We're looking forward to a very strong close to the calendar year. And the nice thing is, people still love their smartphones. They love wireless data. We're working hard to give them better and better experiences. That's really a great opportunity for us. So thanks, everybody, and I look forward to seeing you soon or talking to you soon.

The playback reservation number is 48860663.","I would now like to turn the call over to John Sinnott, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sinnott, please go ahead.","John Sinnott","Thank you and good afternoon everyone. Today\u2019s call will include prepared remarks by Steve Mollenkopf, Derek Aberle and George Davis. In addition, Cristiano Amon and Don Rosenberg will join the question-and-answer session. You can access our earnings release and a slide presentation that accompany this call on our investor relations Web site.

And you can find the related reconciliations to GAAP on our Web site. In addition, we will make forward-looking statements, including projections and estimates of future events, business, or industry trends, or our business or financial results. Actual events or results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q, which contain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","And now, the comments from QUALCOMM\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Steven Mollenkopf.","Steve Mollenkopf","Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered a strong quarter with revenue and non-GAAP EPS growth of 4% and 23% year-over-year respectively, reflecting strong results of technology leadership and disciplined execution in our core mobile businesses.","Before discussing our business activities further, I would like to first comment on the recent legal challenges facing QUALCOMM. This is something we take very seriously, and we\u2019ll cover in depth today. But before that, let me say that, historically, we\u2019ve had a strong relationship with Apple, and they have been a long standing and valued customer. We intend to remain a good supplier to Apple, even while this dispute continues, and believe there is no better long-term partner for Apple than QUALCOMM and our industry leading technology. We believe that our strong and highly differentiated product roadmap will continue to be the foundation for our relationship, and covers a broad range of technologies that will be fundamental to new products for years to come.","Our preference is always to resolve customer disputes through negotiations, instead of litigation. So it is regrettable that Apple has chosen to take this path. We are well prepared and confident in our ability to successfully defend against Apple's claims, as well as the related regulatory matters in Korea and with the FTC. Apple's complaint contains a lot of assertions. But in the end, this is a commercial dispute over the price of intellectual property. They want to pay less with the fair value that QUALCOMM has established in the marketplace for our technology, even though Apple has generated billions in profits from using that technology.","QUALCOMM has always been and remains a systems innovator, and R&D engine for the mobile industry. Unlike virtually every major company in our industry, sharing technology broadly with the industry through our licensing program has always been a paramount aspect of our business model, along with enabling competition. Our inventions have fundamentally enabled the mobile industry, and while those contributions began more than three decades ago. We continue to invest heavily and lead the way in 4G LTE technology and mobile computing, and we are now leading the industry to 5G.","And, although the initial market value of our portfolio was established a long time ago, that value has tangibly and meaningfully increased overtime as our technology contributions and our patent portfolio have grown significantly. Yet, we have never raised our royalty rates. This established value, that has been reaffirmed time-and-time again as we have renegotiated existing licenses and entered into new license agreements with numerous licensees over the years, including over 120 new licenses in China within just the last two years.","As many of you on the call today are aware, we have a long history of successfully defending our licensing practices and business model, which have been tested around the global, most recently in China. The resilience of our practices reflects both the fundamental and differentiated contributions we make to the core technology, enabling the smartphone platform and the mobile industry as a whole. We invest heavily to push the technology boundaries for the benefit of our licenses and their customers, and the industry as a whole. And their licenses become more valuable and comprehensive overtime.","We out-innovate and out-invest other players in mobile and have negotiated and signed more than 200 license agreements, which validate and recognize the value of our technology contributions and related portfolio of IP. At the same time, I believe we have more opportunity ahead of us than at any time in the Company's history. And I assure you that our teams remained focused on executing on those opportunities, which when realized, will provide the next significant growth period for QUALCOMM with an estimated $138 billion serviceable addressable market in 2020.","Our pending acquisition of NXP is reflective of and consistent with these opportunities. This highly complementary combination accelerates our scale and portfolio of products and technologies, as well as expands our go-to-market channels in the growth segments of automotive, IoT, security, and networking. We are seeing very strong support for this transaction, and our conversations with customers. And look forward to realizing the full potential of bringing the two companies together.","We are progressing on our regulatory filings for the NXP transaction and integration planning is well underway. Another important opportunity comes with the formation of our joint venture with TDK. We are concluding 12 months of preparation and expect to close the JV this quarter. I believe this JV would transform our activities RF front-end from a strong niche player to a truly formidable challenger competing with all the necessary technology blocks to build our presence in that space.","I\u2019m also excited about our recently announced program with Microsoft to bring Snapdragon to mobile compute. This allows us to bring the advantages of mobile innovation, leading consumer electronics technologies, and connectivity of the Snapdragon platform to laptop PCs, and expand our participation in a serviceable addressable market opportunity, expected to be $6 billion in 2020. As another example of our ability to expand our computing presence, our data center business also continues to execute well, as Derek will explain in more detail in a moment.","I would like to thank the QUALCOMM team for a strong showing at CES. Our newly announced Snapdragon 835 sets new standards for the next generation of smartphones, computing, VR and AR, and many other applications. And we are leading the semiconductor industry in 10 nanometer technology. We also continue to set new bars in modem technology, including our new X16 gigabit LTE and X55 modems. Simply stated, the roadmap is as strong today as it is ever been.","To summarize, we are very excited about the future and the many opportunities directly in front of us. This is a truly transformative time in the Company\u2019s history. I\u2019m confident we will address and get through the legal challenges underway as we have done many times in the past. And in the meantime, I\u2019m pleased to see our results reflect strong execution in both our major businesses.","I would now like to turn the call over to Derek.","Derek Aberle","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone. First, I would like to build on Steve\u2019s earlier comments regarding Apple\u2019s recent legal claims. Not only our Apple\u2019s claims without merit, but the attempt to undermine the standards-based agreements that have been the backbone of the mobile revolution, the framework that has facilitated and motivated a small number of companies, like QUALCOMM, to make investments to develop new technology, as well as the products and infrastructure to support that technology.","The cornerstone of the global mobile technology ecosystem and the success of so many industry participants is based on the notion that companies that are willing to invest the necessary capital and devote engineering talent to invent technologies long before they can ever be implemented be fairly compensated for sharing those inventions through licensing. At QUALCOMM, we have spent billions of dollars, and have continually focused on inventing the breakthrough technologies that have fuelled the mobile revolution, and enabled multiple generations of technological innovations in smartphones and other connected devices.","Our industry leadership today comes from making these significant focused investments ahead of the industry over many years to create leading technology. From our inception, QUALCOMM has been at the forefront of the industry; imaging, inventing and commercializing the fundamental technologies at scale that brought high-speed mobile data and computing to a global mass market reality. It is QUALCOMM, which drove the development of ubiquitous cellular connectivity in mobile computing, including increasingly higher data rates and spectrum efficiency, as well as more powerful and efficient mobile computing solutions that enable the key features and functions of smartphones, and which are making consumers\u2019 lives better, connecting billions of people to the Internet for the first time, and enabling countless new businesses in industries.","Our technology has enabled the mobile economy and the foundation for business models and applications of companies like Uber, Snapchat, Instagram, messaging apps like WhatsApp and iMessage, streaming services like Spotify, smart assistance like Siri and Google Assistant, and many others across the globe. Our innovations in assisted GPS have also led to location based services, real-time mapping, and navigation service on which hundreds of millions of people around the world now depend.","This mobile application revolution was enabled directly by QUALCOMM's business model of inventing and broadly sharing through licensing our key technologies with hundreds of companies in the mobile ecosystem. Without our technology, our investments and our innovation, the mobile world today would not be nearly as disruptive, efficient or useful. QUALCOMM led the industry in producing innovations that provide or support almost every aspect of your smartphone\u2019s capability.","And Apple has been among the largest beneficiaries of our efforts in investments by been able to easily enter the smartphone space with little to know investments in the core technology. Apple has utilized our technology as the foundation for becoming the most profitable smartphone supplier in the world. Apple's own marketing statements recognize the value QUALCOMM technology contributes to its products. For example, Apple recently acknowledged that the roll-out of LTE networks in India will be the transition that unleashes the power and capability of the iPhone in India. As the leading innovator in 4G LTE, we agree.","Touching briefly on Apple's complaints filed in San Diego and China, they claims that QUALCOMM should be required to license its cellular, standard essential patents for SEPs to modem suppliers, that even when licensing those patents at the device level, QUALCOMM should only be able to charge royalties on the price of the cellular modem chip inside the device. These positions, however, are inconsistent with long-standing industry practice, the IPR policies of the relevant standard setting bodies, the realities of licensing large portfolios of patents, and basic notions of efficiency fairness and economics.","First, QUALCOMM and many other major patent holders have long-followed the practice of licensing portfolios of SEPs at the device level, including for 3G and LTE. There has been no sudden change in the law to make this practice improper. And it remains the most efficient and fair method of licensing. Second, neither QUALCOMM's licensing commitments nor panel requires QUALCOMM to license its SEPs at the component level, or charge royalties on the modem chip within a smartphone.","There was an attempt by Apple and others to modify the IPR policy of SE, which governs licensing commitments for cellular SEPs to include these concepts. But that effort failed. Third, QUALCOMM has a vast technology patent portfolio that is broadly applicable to the technology and features implemented in smartphones.","Focusing on just our cellular SEPs, which is a subset of our overall patent portfolio, only a small percentage of the claims in those patents are implemented entirely within the cellular modem chip. So, even if QUALCOMM were to license that subset of its cellular SEPs to a modem chip supplier. The device supplier using that chip would still need to take a license to the reminder of our cellular SEPs and other patents. Engaging in licensing at multiple levels create significant inefficiencies with no tangible benefits. And the established value for a portfolio of patents, like QUALCOMM\u2019s, does not change by moving from device-level licensing to multi-level licensing at both the model chip and device levels.","Finally, Apple claims the QUALCOMM\u2019s licensing terms would require Apple to pay higher royalties whenever they add new features that they claim have nothing to do with QUALCOMM\u2019s technology or intellectual property. As I just explained, QUALCOMM\u2019s mobile technology enables the applications and functions that Apple highlights. In addition, it is well-know that QUALCOMM has per unit running royalty caps as part of its licensing program. This effectively results in licensees not paying running royalties as a percentage of the device price above a certain net selling price of any given device.","Apple\u2019s claim that royalties are uncapped is simply incorrect. Licensing at device level provides the licensee with the certainty that it has the rights needed to design, manufacture, and sell devices, regardless of which components within the phone, implement the patents, or whether the component supplier has a license for those patents. Charging royalties, as a percentage of the device price, is fair and consistent with the fact that lower price devices can be used and rely upon less of the licensed technology than the more expensive fully featured devices.","The recent KFTC decision, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission compliant, and the filing of Apple\u2019s complaints are not coincidental in terms of content and timing. Apple has been actively driving regulatory tax on QUALCOMM\u2019s business and jurisdictions around the world, and misrepresenting facts and withholding information.","Apple claims the QUALCOMM retaliated because Apple cooperated with government investigations. To be clear, we did no such thing. We simply objected to Apple making false and misleading statements and withholding information to motivate a tax against QUALCOMM. We welcome the opportunity to have Apple\u2019s claims heard in court where we will be entitled the full discovery of Apple\u2019s practices in a robust examination of the merits. We will prove that Apple\u2019s irresponsible claims of extortion are false.","With respect to the KFTC decision, in December, it announced that it intends to issue a corrective order and impose a fine. As we said last month, this is an unprecedented and unsupportable decision. Inconsistent with the facts in the law and representing a clear violation of due process rights under the Korea U.S. pre-trade agreement.","We recently received a written decision from the KFTC, and we\u2019ll be appealing the decision and seeking a stay in the sole high court, which we expect will rigorously analyze evidence and apply sound antitrust principles. It should be noted that the KFTC usually takes some number of months to go from a post-hearing decision to a written final order. Here the KFTC completed a very lengthy written decision in less than a month time, which is further evidence the KFTC hurry to judgment without regard to the merits of the case.","With respect to the FTC complaint, filed last week, as we outlined in our press release, it was a split decision taken in the last days of the Obama administration and is very focused on Apple, which filed its related case just days later. It is based on a flawed legal theory, a lack of economic support, and significant misconceptions about the mobile technology industry. It is also very important to note that FTC commissioner, Maureen Ohlhausen, voted against filing the complaint, and went so far as to issue a strong defending statement.","We look forward to vigorously defending our business. We have faced legal challenges to our business model over the years, given the powerful commercial interest that play. But there is clear evidence of vibrant competition across the mobile industry. And this environment is enabled by our broad pro-competitive licensing program. We expect and look forward to outcomes that confirm the valuable contributions to innovation and competition that our technologies bring. Apple's attack on QUALCOMM's business model is not only an attack on QUALCOMM, but also an attack on the smartphone competition that QUALCOMM's business model enables.","Shifting gears, as Steve noted, QTL had a strong first fiscal quarter, as we continue to make very good progress signing new license agreements in China, including a complete resolution of our outstanding legal issues with Meizu. QTL revenues were $1.8 billion, up approximately 13% year-over-year, driven primarily by favorable trends in China including handset sales growth and licensing and compliance progress in the region, as well as strong growth of global sales by Chinese licensees.","Total reported device sales in the fiscal first quarter were $62.9 billion, above the mid-point of our prior guidance. And we estimate that reported 3G\/4G device shipments were 330 million units with an ASP of $189 at the mid-point. After the end of the first quarter, we completed licensing agreements with both Gionee and Meizu, and have now completed agreements with all of the top 10 Chinese OEMs according to IDC.","To date, we have completed agreements with more than 120 manufacturers in China consistent with the NDRC terms. We estimate that we are now collecting royalties on approximately 80% of Chinese OEM global 3G\/4G device sales. We remain focused on improved compliance and completing additional agreements, which could provide upside to our estimates.","Turning to global 3G\/4G device shipments. For calendar 2016, we estimate 1.56 billion to 1.7 billion devices were shipped, up 8% year-over-year at the mid-point and in line with our prior forecast. For calendar 2017, we continue to expect approximately 7% growth year-over-year with global 3G\/4G device shipments of 1.75 billion to 1.85 billion devices, driven by demand in the emerging regions. We estimate the global handset ASP in fiscal 2016 was approximately $185, down approximately 6% year-over-year, consistent with our expectations and well below the 12% decline in fiscal 2015.","We continue to expect that the annual decline in the global ASP for handsets shipped, during fiscal 2017, will further moderate as compared to fiscal 2016, despite FX headwinds. You may recall that a few years ago we forecast that global handset ASP would go through a period of accelerated erosion for a couple of years, and then those declines would moderate overtime. We are seeing those trends play-out as we predicted.","We expect total reported device sales from licensees in the second fiscal quarter to be approximately $74 billion to $82 billion, up approximately 24% sequentially and 11% year-over-year at the mid-point, driven primarily by the busy holiday December quarter shipment activity, and reflective of increased licensing and compliance progress.","In our data center business, we achieved a key milestone as we announced the commercial standpoint and conducted a live demonstration of the world\u2019s 10 nanometer server processor. And early customer feedback and testing have been encouraging. As the first in the QUALCOMM Centriq product family, the QUALCOMM Centriq 2400 series has up to 48 cores, and is built on the most advanced 10 nanometer FinFET process technology. It features the QUALCOMM Falkor CPU, QUALCOMM data center technologies, custom RMVA compliance core, which is highly optimized to deliver both high performance and power efficiency, and designed to tackle the most common data center workloads.","In China, we also have made great progress with our data center joint venture, which is now busy developing a customized server CPU product based on our technology and designs for the China market. Although, we have several ongoing challenges to our licensing program, we are confident in our positions. And we believe we will come out of these challenges stronger as a Company in the end as we have done many times in the past.","That concludes my comments. And I will turn the call over to George.","George Davis","Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal first quarter results were in line with our outlook with revenues of $6 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.19, $0.02 above the midpoint of our guidance, driven primarily by performance in our licensing business. In QTL, revenues were $1.8 billion and total reported device sales by licensees were $62.9 billion, just above the midpoint of our guidance, driven by stronger ASPs in developed regions. The Q1 results for QTL exclude contributions from the recently signed licensed agreements with Meizu and Gionee, which expect to start benefitting -- we expect to start benefitting QTL in fiscal Q2.","In QCT, MSM chip shipment were 217 million, modestly above the midpoint of our guidance range. Overall, performance was in line with expectations and we had strong contributions from our adjacent areas, including IoT, wireless networking, and auto. QCT\u2019s earnings before tax was up 23% versus the first fiscal quarter of 2016, reflecting strong demand for our new products, growth and adjacencies, and an improved cost structure. QCT operating margin was approximately 18% for the quarter, up more than 300 basis points over the same period last year.","For the Company, non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses increased by less than 1% sequentially, modestly above our prior guidance. GAAP earnings included the accrual of the KFTCs approximately $868 million fine announced in late December, which is excluded from our non-GAAP results. The accrual impacted fiscal first quarter GAAP EPS by $0.49 per share, and raised our full year GAAP estimated tax rate by approximately 280 basis points to 22%.","We plan to appeal this decision, but we are still required to pay the fine within 60 days of receiving the written order, which was received earlier this week. We returned $1.2 billion to stockholders in the quarter in the form of dividend and buybacks. As of the end of the fiscal first quarter, we had approximately $2.5 billion of our stock repurchase authorization remaining.","Turning to our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, our outlook reflects the seasonally stronger December quarter, 3G\/4G device shipments for QTL, and the seasonally lower first calendar quarter MSM shipments for QCT, typical for this time of year. We are not forecasting any impact to revenues related to the dispute with Apple as we are continuing to meet their supply needs in good faith, and expect Apple will continue to meet its obligations. We have not reported any benefit to the P&L associated with non-payment of disputed amounts to-date or in our Q2 guidance.","We estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $5.5 billion to $6.3 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of approximately $1.15 to $1.25 per share. We anticipate fiscal second quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be up approximately 6% to 8% or $110 million at the mid-point sequentially, reflecting employee related costs that typically begin with the new calendar year, increased QTL compliance initiatives, and growing investments in data center and 5G.","In QTL, we estimate total reported device sales of $74 billion to $82 billion will be reported by our licensees in the March quarter, for shipments they made in the December quarter, up approximately 24% sequentially and 11% year-over-year at the mid-point. Our financial guidance includes an estimate for some catch-up licensing revenue, we expect to record in the quarter, including some benefit related to the recently concluded license agreements with Gionee and Meizu.","In QCT, we expect MSM shipments of approximately 165 million to 185 million units lower sequentially, reflecting typical seasonal trends. Year-over-year differences also include lower modem sales, given second sourcing by a customer. We expect QCT revenue for MSM to be up modestly on a sequential basis in the second fiscal quarter on stronger product mix. We expect QCT's fiscal second quarter operating margin to be approximately 10% to 12%, reflecting significant year-over-year improvement, consistent with the product and cost elements that drove our fiscal first quarter performance, but down sequentially on seasonality.","We expect to close the TDK joint venture later in this quarter, but are not including the expected impact in our guidance. We will update the go-forward implications of closing the joint venture on our next earnings call.","Turning to our investment income, in anticipation of funding the acquisition of NXP, we will continue liquidating the longer duration risk assets in our treasury portfolio over the next couple of quarters, which we expect to result in lower yields and total returns, more in line with short duration high credit quality portfolios. The impact of these changes will primarily be seen in the second half of the fiscal year. We also plan to execute a meaningful portion of our acquisition related financing in the second half of fiscal 2017.","As a result, we expect the combination of lower net investment income and higher interest expense to impact EPS by approximately $0.15 or approximately $300 million before tax in the second half of 2017 as compared to the levels we saw in the second half of fiscal 2016.","Despite recent foreign currency headwinds, we continued to estimate mid single-digit percentage growth of global 3G\/4G handset sales in fiscal 2017. We are estimating that FX headwinds of approximately 200 basis points based on current exchange rates will be partially offset by a better than expected outlook for global 3G\/4G handset ASPs on a local currency basis.","That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to John.","John Sinnott","Thank you, George. Operator, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","Michael Walkley","A couple of questions -- just here one on the business just in terms of seasonality of the business in to the March quarter, could you talk about some of the puts and takes with major customer in Korea\u2019s new product timing ramp, seasonality for Apple and then what you\u2019re seeing in the Chinese market in terms of your sequential MSM shipments. And then just a clarification for Derek and Don, as you look at the global dispute with Apple going on, it\u2019s my belief that Apple actually paid you through some of their ODMs, such as Foxconn. Could you just walk us through that and maybe any accounting issues should these ODM decide not to pay on Apple\u2019s behalf? Thank you.","Cristiano Amon","Maybe, I\u2019ll start addressing the Q2 seasonality on the chip business. So, I think Q2 MSM unit movement is largely seasonal. I think we see seasonality tied to two main effects; one, I think you have build on the Chinese customers in anticipation of the Chinese New Year. And I think they basically build and bleed as related Chinese New Year sales. We also saw -- in units in Q2 are dependent on timing on launching on Flagship devices within the quarter. And I think we\u2019re going to see some of those clear to I would say, MCC announcement. So it\u2019s going to be more on flagship device, it's going to more of a second of the year.","And I think in terms of your question in China, market position, we\u2019ll continue to see strong demand for industry products, leading products in China. I think we see good traction with the OEMs for MSM roadmap. So, it\u2019s mostly a seasonality that we out-experienced in Q2.","Derek Aberle","Yes to answer your question, so you\u2019re right, Apple does not have a direct license with QUALCOMM today. And so the royalties on Apple products, they get paid to QUALCOMM or reported and paid by their contract manufacturers. So, although we do have a dispute now with Apple and they\u2019re challenging some of the offers and some of our licensing terms. The contracts that we have in place with their suppliers remain valid and enforceable. And we would expect that our licensees will continue to comply with the terms of their agreements. And we would also hope and expect that Apple would not interfere with the terms of those agreements. But of course, we can\u2019t fully control those actions.","So, I guess, a little bit that we\u2019re going to have to have a -- take a wait and see approach. We have no indication as we sit here today that our licensees will stop paying royalties. In the past, when we have had disputes with companies related to the royalties they own under an existing valid agreement, generally, those companies tended to report and pay royalties, even when we were in disputes like in arbitration. You might remember that was case with LG, not only have the recent arbitration with them also the case with Panasonic when we had a previous arbitration with them.","So we\u2019ll have to wait and see what happens, but that\u2019s the indication we have today. I guess, the final pointy I\u2019ll make is we don\u2019t believe or expect that we will see an impact in the second quarter or second fiscal quarter from the dispute, and our guidance reflects that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Simona Jankowski","Two questions for Derek. Apple claims that your NDRC rectification plan has never been adopted or endorsed by any agency or court. And they are challenging your royalty rate in China, and have now taken to court there. So can you clarify if your new license structure in China was in fact endorsed or not by the NDRC? And then the second question is, I don\u2019t think you addressed Apple's charge that your chipset exclusivity agreement was evidence of abusive monopoly power. So I would love to hear your position there as well.","Derek Aberle","So, in China, basically the way that the NDRC investigation was resolved, QUALCOMM -- the NDRC issued an order and QUALCOMM submitted what we called a rectification plan. And within the rectification plan, we basically committed to offer a new set of licensing terms for sales for use in China under our Chinese essential patents. And as part of that, the NDRC agreed, and this was main public I believe in the press release at a time that QUALCOMM\u2019s rectification plan and the commitments that we made in that fully addressed the issues that were raised in the NDRC's order. So, although, I am not sure I would use the term endorsed, certainly, we believe the NDRC agreed that the rectification plan and the licensing terms are very consistent with addressing the concerns in their order.","Of course, since then, we\u2019ve gone out and negotiated and signed over 120 license agreements with terms that are consistent and reflective of the NDRC terms, and that was done under the supervision of the NDRC. So, we feel very confident that those terms are fair and reasonable, and we think it's a difficult position for Apple to claim that those terms are not fair. By the way, we have offered those same terms to Apple we did with all our other licensees, and they have refused to accept them.","Don Rosenberg","With regard to your question about, so called, exclusivity deal, first of all, I think you\u2019ve called us monopoly power and monopoly power. We don\u2019t believe we have monopoly power in the chip market or any other market, and nor do we have an exclusivity arrangement. We have never prevented Apple or anybody else from buying from competitive chip makers. And in the Apple case, it's pretty clear since, as you know they\u2019ve been buying from Intel fairly recently. So, it's a mischaracterization to call it an exclusive dealing arrangement. We have been defending that accusation in Europe for about, I don\u2019t know, four years now, and it's not new. Although, now it's out in the open that Apple is the one who has challenged us on this. And we will continue to defend it both in Europe and in this case. But we are quite confident that it doesn\u2019t fit the definition of an exclusivity deal here, and it doesn\u2019t violate any competition loss.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","James Faucette","Just one clarifying question, I think, Derek you\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times that the Apple\u2019s ODMs continue to comply. So, should we understand that according -- I mean your understanding of the contracts that they are paying, the contracted amounts in full? And then I guess for Derek and Don. How should we think about timeframes for both, for the KFTC and FTC case, the U.S. FTC cases, in terms of how long to go through the process of appeal or be a case itself here in the U. S.? And then Don you also just mentioned Europe. Where we are on that investigation, and any since of timing on when we may see further progress or the next steps there? Thank you very much.","Derek Aberle","So, on the ODM contracts, I think the point to keep in mind is that, again Apple is not a direct licensee. And we have valid and enforceable contracts in place with their contract manufacturers who are our licensees, and have been paying royalties to us under those agreements. Again, we would expect and hope that our licensees will continue to comply with their agreements, and that Apple will not interfere with those contractual relationships that we have in place. And we have no indication, as we sit here today that the ODMs will stop paying or that Apple will interfere. But we obviously can\u2019t control their actions down the road. So, we\u2019ll have to see how that develops. As to our guidance in Q2, we believe at this point that it will not be an impact in terms of the revenue for QTL in Q2, which would be sales through the December quarter.","Don Rosenberg","So, with respect to, I think I guess three questions; one, timing of KFTC timing of the FTC and then DigiComp status. The KFTC, as Derek indicated earlier, has now issued its order in that case, which means that the order is now effective as opposed to the press release that was issued less than a month ago. And we will now be able to seek an appeal at the sole High Court. And once we\u2019ve start the appeal process, we will immediately seek a stay of the remedial release that was ordered by the KFTC. And we are obviously going to pretty strong arguments with respect to their conclusions, and hope that that will lead to a stay. And then the appeal process can take quite sometime in the sole High Court, and then if necessary, subsequent courts.","The FTC case, which was filed in District Court in the Northern District of California, as you know, we\u2019ve said very clearly we think that case was lacking in any real coherent theory of competitive harm didn\u2019t, and all one needs to do is read the descending statement of commissioner Ohlhausen to get a good sense of how we object to that, and how she did. And I commented to you if you haven\u2019t read it.","We have two paths to follows. Obviously, once a new Federal Trade Commission is assembled, we will probably go back to the full commission, or at least when there is a majority of more than -- at least, there are more than two commissioners in place. And seek a re-evaluation of that late decision to file. And hopefully we might be able to get that withdrawn, if not, we will proceed with, as usual, defenses in the northern district and that will take some time obviously. With respect to DigiComp, we have two statements of objections, as you know, that we have been defending there, and I have no new news as to timing there. We are waiting at this point for the next step from DigiComp.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Tim Long","Two quick ones, if I could, or maybe not quick. George, you\u2019ve mentioned, I think your language, is no benefit to P&L impact from non-paid amounts. Are you referring to what Apple called the rebates or the payments in their complaint? But either way, if you can just talk about changes in contracts, it sounds like nothing has hit the P&L yet. But where was that impacting, was that a COGS item in QCT, was it somehow in the QTL line? It would be helpful for us to understand where that is. And if there is more that\u2019s not going out, at what point, would that become a benefit to the QUALCOMM model? And then Derek, I mean, you talked a lot about this thing about just raise in the commercial agreement. I\u2019d just love your perspective on the other major patent holders, the Nokia's and Ericsson's that I think also license at the device level, but their rates wind-up, you\u2019re five or 10 times higher than them. So, can you just talk a little about maybe your difference in materiality of your patent pool relative to other players that might result in higher rates than the others, which consider something lower to the FRAND? Thank you.","George Davis","So, yes, there has been no P&L benefit from the payments to-date, they\u2019ve been held on the balance sheet as current liabilities. As you know, the agreements are now subject to litigation. And so there is a limit to how much we can describe, where they might -- how things might be resolved in the future. But the amounts will remain on our balance sheet until the dispute is resolved. And then we\u2019ll account for them in whatever way that the resolution has reached.","Derek Aberle","So, I\u2019ll try to keep this as concise as I can. If you think about the contributions that QUALCOMM has made to the technology-first and all the way back to 2G, but then moving on to 3G and 4G and now on to 5G, all the way along the path. We really have been, from our perspective, the leading contributor to the most valuable portions of the technology that are in those standards. And I think that has borne-out through the commercial agreements that we\u2019ve been able to negotiate through arms length and fair negotiations over the years with 250 plus licenses.","As Steve mentioned in his remarks, those aren\u2019t agreements that are just 20 years old. Many of those have been renegotiated several times with the largest players over the year, and continually reaffirm the value of our portfolio. So, we believe our contributions, which are tend to be more focused on the device side and then the overall system as well, are just frankly more valuable than some of the other contributions that we see across the industry. And the second piece is you have to look at the circumstances under which the other companies negotiated their licenses. Obviously, when Nokia negotiated a number of their licenses, they had a significant device business, and they bargain for cross-licenses from other patent holders, which would have been offset and help establish the value of their portfolio. Same is true with Ericcson.","So again, those companies both have made significant contributions. I am not doing anything to suggest, otherwise. But we believe that our contributions have been different in kind. And again, the market has valued those contributions through the agreements we have negotiated over the years.","Don Rosenberg","I just want to add one or two points to Derek\u2019s -- primarily as he said, we have enormous contributions. But the point that Derek was making needs to be hammered home, because people get confused. He was talking about cross-licenses, like the Samsung and Nokia. As you know, we are not in the device business. So, when we\u2019re negotiating, we\u2019re not seeking cross-licenses to be able to sell devices as they are. And so that\u2019s a whole different dynamic in the negotiation, and people often get confused about that.","And the other thing is, it\u2019d be interesting for people to take a look at, there\u2019s is lot in the record of this. Of all the losses that Apple has brought against its competitors and look at what they\u2019ve sought in damages for just couple of patents, or less than a handful of patents. So, that\u2019s an interesting comparison to their claiming in terms of the portfolio that we have.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Rod Hall","I guess, well, I\u2019ve got a bunch I\u2019ll try to pull it down to just a couple. One is can you clarify whether Apple\u2019s deal or Foxconn\u2019s deal was set to expire at the end of 2016? We understand it probably was good. Could you just clarify, whether that is the case and in fact this is part of normal deal expiration and then negotiations and then through after that that\u2019s my first question? Second question is on materiality of this. If they were to stop paying, we\u2019ve done our own calculations with EPS impacts of around 30%, others have gotten around 25%. I wonder, could you guys just say whether those calculations are in the ballpark? And if not, give us any kind of idea of what sort of EPS impact we might expect if they were to stop payment? And then I guess my last question for you is, whether you had any direct discussion with Foxconn? Or the comments you\u2019re making that they should continue to pay, strictly based on legal agreements. Are they based also on some discussions that you had with them, and that have been sued after the suits were filed? Thank you.","Derek Aberle","Maybe I will take your first and last and last question, and then maybe George can jump in on the other one. So, we don\u2019t have -- the agreements that are subject to the dispute with Apple are with Apple. We don\u2019t have agreements with Foxconn. And I think it\u2019s fair to assume that those agreements basically expired at the end of 2016. As to Foxconn, again, we don\u2019t typically get into discussions we have with our licensees. What I can tell you is we have no indication and we do have frequent interactions with our licensees. We have no indication at this point that Foxconn or any of our other licensees will not comply with the terms of their agreement. So, that\u2019s probably the best we can tell you at this point.","George Davis","Rod on the materiality, clearly, Apple and Samsung are two very large customers. Apple being one and we\u2019ve said that two largest, about 40% of revenue, but that includes both chip and licensing for both. The way we think about it is, one we\u2019ve customers actually continue to pay even during disputes in many cases and also our ongoing relevant to customers across their business generally provides additional coverage there. But part of why we have a strong balance sheet is, so that when events like this happen, we are able to not only sustain ourselves and the investments that required but we\u2019re able to fund acquisitions and other key initiatives of the Company. So, we feel we\u2019re in a very strong position to continue to execute going forward and under almost any circumstance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Timothy Arcuri","I guess, my question, Derek, is really what does Apple want? Because if you look at the effective rate that they are paying, they pay basically on-cause and they pay the contract -- and the contract manufacturer pays you. If you do some math, they are sort in the low to mid-200 basis points as a percentage of COGS, which doesn\u2019t seems to be that much different than what the 4G rate that you signed in China is. So, what do they want other than just getting a better deal? I guess, that\u2019s my first question.","Derek Aberle","Really, I mean, if you peal apart all of the arguments that Apple is making, as we said, we believe firmly that they are all without merit. In the end of the day, they essentially want to pay less for the technology that they are using. And it's pretty simple. And that\u2019s really the motivation. And again, they wrap a lot of stuff around that, which really we think overtime, we will be able to clearly show is false. But in the end of the day, they want to get to a lower payment. And we think that\u2019s not appropriate, given the value that we\u2019ve established. We think they should pay a fair value, the fair value that we have established and our other licensees are paying. And that\u2019s unfortunately why we\u2019re in dispute.","Timothy Arcuri","And then I guess just as a quick follow up Derek. What is the way to think about to sustained royalty rate? Does this change how we should think about it this and particularly what's happening with the KFTC as well? Does that change the 290 basis points longer term rate that we should think about? Thanks.","Derek Aberle","I think from our perspective, again, as Don mentioned, we are going to appeal and seek a stay of the decision in Korea. And in the end of the day if that decision even were to come into effect, it's not going to -- it does not invalidate the contracts that we have. It just set forward process for having us enter into renegotiations with some number of companies. And then if we can't resolve that, ultimately enter into some kind of dispute resolution. But we believe firmly that the contracts that we have in place are complaint with FRAND and consistent with our obligation. So we would expect, even if we had to go through that process that we would end up in the same place.","So again, as we look at all these things, also the FTC, we believe, that we will be able to defend against that claim hopefully more quickly rather than over a longer period of time. And we ultimately believe we will prevail into seeding the arguments that are being brought by Apple. So, really none of this affects our long-term view for the growth of the business, or the 2.9%-ish effective rate that we\u2019ve talked about over -- as kind of normalized rate over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.","Stacy Rasgon","I have one on Apple and then two quick operational ones. Just on Apple, the structure of your business, obviously, device level pricing. You\u2019ve laid out I think a good case for why it's done this way. Has this model ever actually gone to an actual court in front of a judge and jury? And if so when, and what happened in that case? And if it hasn\u2019t, can you please tell us if it never actually gone in front of -- in the court. In terms of operation, we just -- recently give us feeling for how much of the TRDS guidance next quarter is catch-up? And can you give us feeling for what\u2019s going on with your inventories, why are they so high? Why do they go up so much into a quarter where chipsets are falling a lot?","Steve Mollenkopf","So, Stacy, let me take your first question. Listen, as we noted in some of the comments, if you look at Apple\u2019s complaint one of the things that they argue is that royalty should be based on just the base band chip within the phone or what they refer to as small and sellable unit. But that is -- there really is -- there is no legal precedent to suggest that when you\u2019re licensing a portfolio of patents, such as a large portfolio of standard essential patents, that that legal document has any application. And there are numerous examples, reasonable royalties being set in court cases as a percentage of the end product.","So, this is a well understood, I think, a well laid out concept. And it\u2019s consistent with the way that, not only in QUALCOMM has licensed in our own industry for decades, but also virtually every other patent holder when they are seeking to collect royalties on their intellectual property. And I think, as Don mentioned, even when non-standard essential patents are asserted, royalties have been sought on a per unit basis far in excess of what QUALCOMM charges for a much larger technology contribution in the license.","On the question on TRDS, I think, probably you have to -- the impact of the -- was that on Q2?","Derek Aberle","If you think about on in terms of the impact of catch-up, the overwhelming growth is coming from the seasonal movements, and less than a third of the EPS impact is related to catch-up, which is pure revenue, pure profit.","Steve Mollenkopf","I can address the inventory question. So, Stacy, I think inventory maybe three topics for you to think about it on the chip side. I think one is, as we said the Chinese New Year. So, I think given how we feel good about our position in China, it\u2019s just providing increased assurance to supply and meeting customer demand with some of those products launch. The other thing to think about it is we had early in the year as normal with any new process know that we had as conservative planning on 10 nanometer ramp, we just had a little bit more parts of the predecessor in case of some of those things shift in into the quarter. And the last one, I think, you probably know there is cancellation of orders from a customer for one of this, or flagship products, last year they got cancelled. And I think endorsing will flow through normal inventory levels throughout the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Kulbinder Garcha","I have a couple of questions, on the Apple situation maybe for Derek. Apple has put in the lawsuit that they would be withholding payments to their contract OEMs. Now, I know your licensees are saying that they will continue to pay you, whether it's Honhi or whoever. But there must be a risk that that gets withheld from you at some point. Are you just saying that you don't see it right now? That's my first question. And my second question is that -- linked to Apple is that there was various points in their lawsuit that seemed to imply that they didn't have visibility over which intellectual property they had indirectly licensed. And so my question is are there vast parts of your portfolio, which they have not licensed? And what are you doing about maybe pursuing them? Or is that something you are considering right now? And my operational question, just on China, is what level of compliance that we got now over the market, like with the deals you\u2019ve recently signed, what [indiscernible] [59.20] in the area? Thanks.","Derek Aberle","So, let me take each one of those. On the first question, basically, what Apple said in its complaint was that it would withhold payment to its contract manufactures of an amount equal to what it claims that we owe them. But it didn\u2019t go beyond that. In other words they didn\u2019t say that it was going to withhold payment for all royalties going forward. They just talked about the amount that was in dispute. And I think George covered off already how we\u2019ve already deal with that in our P&Ls.","But again on a going forward basis, these are valid and forcible contracts with our ODMs, there is no question there. And we would expect to get paid on a going forward basis, and we would also expect that Apple wouldn\u2019t interfere with those contracts. And we have no indication as we sit here that either party will be either of those things, meaning withhold payment or interfere. But again, we\u2019re going to have to take somewhat of a wait and see approach. This is a fluid situation. Complaint just came late last week, and we\u2019re continuing to monitor the situation, and we\u2019ll be updating you all as things progress.","We have given Apple more than full visibility into the scope of our technology, and the scope of our patent portfolio. And they have tremendous amount of information from us in terms of what we expect them to pay for in terms of our technology position. There is, as I said before, the contracts that we have today are with their contract manufactures. Those agreements do not include licenses to all of our portfolio. But we both been -- we have been discussing a direct license with Apple as well, which would obviously include a broader portfolio license.","So probably not going to comment today on our legal strategy as to what we may or may not do with the patents that are unlicensed to Apple or a contract manufacturers, but there are some patents in our portfolio that are outside those agreements. I mentioned in my remarks that with the further progress in China, we\u2019re now in a position of collecting on about 80% of the Chinese OEM global device sales. You may remember back in February at the last Analyst Day, we talked about trying to get to about 75% collection with the key deals, and we\u2019re now at 80% and hope to overtime take that number higher.","Operator","Thank you. This ends our allotted time for questions and answers. Mr. Mollenkopf, do you have anything further to add before adjourning the call?","Steve Mollenkopf","Yes, thank you. I just want to thank everyone for joining the call today. We obviously are working through our dispute here. We\u2019ll get through it like we have in the past. I appreciate everybody\u2019s patience here, but we're going to do the right thing for shareholders. I also want to recognize, and thank the employee base for their, really their strong work in not only repositioning the Company, but also delivering the results that we show today. So, thank you all and talk to you next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"18572":["QUALCOMM, Inc.

The playback reservation number is 95200877.","I would now like to turn the call over to John Sinnott, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sinnott, please go ahead.","John Sinnott","Thank you, everyone and good afternoon. Today\u2019s call will include prepared remarks by Steve Mollenkopf, Derek Aberle and George Davis. In addition, Cristiano Amon and Don Rosenberg will join the question-and-answer session. You can access our earnings release and a slide presentation that accompany this call on our investor relations website. This call is also being webcast on qualcomm.com, and a replay will be available on our website later today.","During the call today, we will use non-GAAP financial measures, as defined in Regulation G. And you can find the related reconciliations to GAAP on our website. We will also make forward-looking statements, including projections and estimates of future events, business, or industry trends, or our business or financial results. Actual events or results could differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q, which contain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","And now, the comments from QUALCOMM\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Steve Mollenkopf.","Steve Mollenkopf","Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report strong results this quarter. Fiscal second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.14 above the midpoint of our prior guidance range, reflecting a continued focus on operational performance across the businesses.","Our semiconductor business continues to benefit from both a strong product roadmap, perhaps the strongest in our Company\u2019s history as well as industry trends that bode well for our ability to further grow the semiconductor business outside of handsets. Automotive, networking and IoT were particularly strong this quarter.","Several of these product lines became part of QUALCOMM largely through M&A and will be further strengthened with the upcoming addition of NXP. Our QCT business continues to deliver a broad set of industry leading products, positioning us well for the opportunities ahead. We delivered strong topline results this quarter and operating margins were ahead of expectations.","Our partners are already announcing new premium tier devices based on our new Snapdragon 835 mobile platform including the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+, Sony Xperia XZ premium and the Xiaomi Mi 6. Additionally, the 835 is extending to new categories beyond smartphones such as the ODR or ODG AR smart glasses announced at CES. Our high and mid-tier Snapdragon 600 and 400 platform offerings continued to see high adoption, particularly in China with 200 plus devices and design in the 600-tier and 190 plus devices and design in the 400-tier worldwide.","In March, we announced our 205 mobile platforms designed to bring 4G LTE connectivity and 4G services for entry level feature phones and we expect OEM devices to be announced starting this quarter. The increasing number of gigabit LTE operator launches around the world this year validates our early investment and enabling gigabit speeds across 4G networks and our modem roadmap continues to be more than a generation ahead of the competition.","Telstra launched the world's first gigabit LTE network and device earlier this year and all four major U.S. carriers have announced plans to launch gigabit LTE in 2017. Our Snapdragon X16 gigabit LTE modem was featured in February in a live demo of the Sony Xperia XZ premium and more recently versions of the Samsung Galaxy S8 including in North America, China and Japan also featured gigabit LTE based on the Snapdragon 835. We continue to lead the industry to 5G through our 3GPP leadership, ongoing prototype efforts, announcements of meaningful 5G new radio trials as well as our industry first X50 5G modem.","In February, we demonstrated the first 3GPP based 5G new radio connection and announced the extension of our Snapdragon X50 family of 5G modems to include support for the global 5G NR standard across the millimeter wave and sub-6 gigahertz frequency bands, along with backwards compatibility for 2G, 3G, 4G, including gigabit LTE. We expect commercial products to be available to support the first large scale 5G NR trials and commercial network launches starting in 2019.","Turning to QTL, the licensing business had a strong quarter. Total reported device sales were a record driven by strong 3G\/4G unit shipments and higher than expected ASPs. QTL results were in line with expectations as the stronger market and improved licensing in China offset the impact of a new dispute with a licensee.","During the quarter, we returned approximately $1.1 billion to stockholders through dividends and stock repurchases. We also announced a 7.5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend now at $2.28 per share annually reflecting our confidence in the strength of our ongoing cash flows and future earnings growth.","During the quarter, we closed on our joint venture with TDK, which is an important strategic milestone to grow our portfolio of RF front-end products and technologies. I am very pleased that we now have all the critical components to build industry-leading RF modules across tiers and to compete in the total RF front-end service available market. We also received U.S. regulatory clearance for our pending acquisition of NXP. We remain on track to close the transaction this calendar year and integration planning continues across both companies.","Looking ahead, the adoption of mobile technologies and mobile computing is accelerating around the world. Our broad and growing set of technologies and innovations are fundamental to mobile communications and are enabling entirely new business models and ecosystems. This trend will continue for years to come as advanced 4G, 5G and other mobile technologies expand their footprint into new industries.","Looking across the growing set of new industries embracing mobile technologies, we have more opportunities ahead of us than it any time in the Company's history. Against this backdrop, we have had a series of legal and regulatory challenges that have unfortunately overshadowed otherwise strong operating performance at QUALCOMM.","We have successfully navigated challenges like this in the past and we have confidence in the sustainability of our licensing business. But we know these periods can generate added volatility in near-term results and require open and regular dialogue with our investors, which is something we are fully committed to providing. While we work to conclude the right deals that will deliver long-term value to our shareholders.","Most importantly, we will remain focused on investing to lead innovation in key mobile and related technologies as that has always been the core of what's placed us in this unique and unmatched leadership position. While Derek will provide more details on the recent legal challenges, we have taken several specific steps to address the KFTC and FTC matters during the last quarter.","And last week, we filed our answer and counterclaims in the Apple litigation here in Southern California. It is important to remember that ultimately this is about a contract dispute and business negotiation and we will work to reach the right resolution for our shareholders as we have done so often throughout our history.","Further, the Company will continue to focus on developing and delivering the best products to our customers including Apple consistent with our track record to-date. We are optimistic about the speed of innovation in the modem and RF areas with technologies such as gigabit LTE, 5G NR, multimode and millimeter wave becoming increasingly important. Considering the strength of both our product roadmap in R&D investments, we expect to continue to be an important supplier to Apple now and into the future.","As we continue towards the closing of our pending acquisition of NXP later this year, I thought it would be good to review some of the larger growth opportunities that will be enabled by our unique collection of technologies, sales channels and scale for the interconnected world.","First, we will lead in 5G. 5G is the interconnecting fabric for the connected world and will drive not only an upgrade cycle in mobile, but will also enable new industries to take advantage of the mobile ecosystem. We will continue to work closely with global infrastructure vendors and operators on 5G NR trials to drive the mobile ecosystem toward validation and timely commercialization of 5G NR.","To-date, we have announced 5G NR trials with SKT and Ericsson in Korea, AT&T and Ericsson in the United States, ZTE and China Mobile in China, Telstra and Ericsson in Australia, and Vodafone and Ericsson in Europe. The interoperability testing and trials are planned to launch in the second half of 2017.","Second, we will grow our content in the device with our expanding RF front-end capabilities. We have taken a big step forward in closing the RF360 JV to transform this business and we also have already started delivering our first gallium arsenide PAs. As we move to 5G, the device will become more complex from an RF point of view as massive MIMO and multi-element arrays exist on many devices and our unique ability to provide solutions across the baseband and RF will become even more important to our customers.","Third, automotive will continue to be a source of growth and we are winning more than just the telematics systems. Our automotive solutions, including cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and infotainment SoCs have been adopted by every major global automaker. Our Snapdragon, automotive infotainment platforms have won new designs at 12 of the top 25 global automaker brands. This strong design pipeline shows the strength of our computing solutions in the automotive market and represents an opportunity to sell multiple Snapdragons per car.","With the addition of NXP, the opportunity to grow content in the car increases dramatically and we will be uniquely positioned for ADAS and autonomous driving, a large multi-decade mega trend that is just starting. You will be hearing more from us on this important topic in the future.","Fourth, IoT will drive meaningful growth across a broad range of opportunities. Success in these opportunities will be defined by the ability to combined connectivity, computing and security along with a broad channel to serve not only industrial verticals, but a long tail of customers to deliver high complexity products and platforms that are easy for our customers to use and integrate. Here again the acquisition of NXP will uniquely position us with IoT systems solutions and channels and builds on the success we are seeing in the business today.","Fifth, we have an opportunity to disrupt the existing suppliers of the PC and the datacenter. Our Snapdragon 835 is expanding into Mobile PC designs running Windows 10, which are scheduled to launch in the fourth calendar quarter this year. In the data center, we announced the collaboration with Microsoft and demonstrated Windows Server Running on our 10 nanometer Qualcomm Centriq processors, the first 10 nanometer server processors in the industry.","To close, we are very focused on resolving the challenges to our licensing business and business model and we are confident we will be able to successfully navigate through this environment. At the same time, this is an extremely exciting and transformative time for our Company as the technologies and products are well positioned to expand into a growing set of opportunities and will be further enhanced with the completion of our pending acquisition of NXP.","I would now like to turn the call over to Derek.","Derek Aberle","Thank you, Steve and good afternoon, everyone. As Steve noted, QTL had a strong fiscal second quarter with record total reported device sales of approximately $82.6 billion, up approximately 18% year-over-year and just above the high-end of our prior guidance range. The record TRDS for the quarter reflects significantly increased year-over-year unit reporting from recent China licensing progress as well as ASP strength particularly in China and typical seasonal strength in North America.","We estimate that reported 3G\/4G device shipments were approximately 400 million units within ASP of approximately $207 at the midpoints. Global 3G\/4G handset ASPs are tracking consistent with our prior expectations of low single-digit percentage declines year-over-year. We also continue to see healthy growth in global 3G\/4G device shipments. For calendar year 2016, we have increased our estimate of global 3G\/4G device shipments to reflect even stronger December quarter shipments than we previously expected led by stronger sales in China.","We estimate that approximately 1.7 billion 3G\/4G devices were shipped in 2016, up approximately 10% year-over-year. For calendar 2017, we are reaffirming our estimated global 3G\/4G device shipments of 1.75 billion to 1.85 billion devices, up approximately 6% year-over-year at the midpoint.","We believe that some of the December quarter shipments strength in China resulted in a modest build-up of inventory there, which we expect will be sold through in the first half of calendar 2017. We estimate that this will push some of the expected first half calendar 2017 shipments into the second half of the calendar year and thus into QTL\u2019s fiscal 2018 instead of fiscal 2017.","The fiscal second quarter revenue and operating profit results for QTL, which were largely in line with our prior guidance were negatively impacted by a dispute with one of our licensees. This dispute resulted in the licensee underpaying royalties of more than $150 million for sales during the December quarter. We are working to resolve this dispute, but we expect the licensee, which is not one of the suppliers of iPhones to Apple to continue to under report its royalties until the dispute is resolved and therefore have factored that into our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2017.","Last week, we announced that an arbitration panel awarded BlackBerry and $850 million refund of royalties that have previously paid to QUALCOMM for past sales. The dispute related to whether our voluntary per unit running royalty cap program applied to BlackBerry\u2019s non-refundable prepayments of royalties for a license to sell a specified number of handsets from 2010 through the end of 2015.","We strongly disagree with the ruling, but it is binding and not appealable. It is worth noting that this was a specific contract provision that was unique to BlackBerry\u2019s agreement, so this outcome has no impact on agreements with any other licensee. The contract provision also does not apply to BlackBerry sales after 2015.","It is also important to note that even after this refund, BlackBerry paid royalties for all devices it sold during the 2010 to 2015 time period equal to the per unit amount specified in our voluntary per unit running royalty program. We continue to actively pursue resolutions and protect the established value of our patented technologies in the regulatory and other legal matters in which we are involved. We have plans for addressing each of these proceedings and are confident that the QTL business will remain a strong cash flow contributor to the Company for many years to come.","Regarding the KFTC, we have begun the formal legal process for both an appeal and a stay of the decision pending the outcome of the appeal, as the ruling is clearly inconsistent with the facts and the law reflects a flawed process and represents a violation of due process rights owed American companies under the Korea, U.S. pre-trade agreement. We expect to have a decision on our application for a stay in the coming months.","As to the U.S. FTC investigation, we have filed a motion to dismiss the FTC\u2019s compliant consistent with our ongoing view that the complaint which was filed just days before the change in administration in over a strong objection by the commissioner who is now the acting chair of the FTC fails to state a plausible antitrust claim and offers no facts or economic theory supporting the claim of competitive harm.","As to the Taiwan investigation, we are continuing to cooperate with the TFTC as we work towards finding the resolution of this matter. While certain investigations in Europe remain pending. These investigations do not involve QUALCOMM's licensing business or practices.","Finally, as Steve mentioned, we have now formally responded to the complaint filed by Apple here in Southern California. Apple\u2019s complaint includes numerous misstatements and mischaracterizations of our agreements, negotiations and contributions to the industry. I urge you to read our answer which clearly describes in detail the facts and corrects these misstatements and mischaracterizations as well as details of the value of the fundamental technologies we have invented, contributed and shared with the industry through our licensing program.","We have a strong track record of establishing and defending the value of our technologies that have played an important role in enabling the entire mobile ecosystem, including the incredible smartphone experience. We have freely negotiated and entered into more than 300 license agreements over many years, including with the largest and most sophisticated companies in our industry.","The offers we have made to Apple for a direct license to QUALCOMM cellular standard essential patents are consistent with the value of our patent technologies established by these more than 300 arm\u2019s length license agreements and are fully compliant with QUALCOMM's FRAND commitments. It is unfortunate that Apple has rejected these fair and reasonable offers.","Also our license agreements with Apple suppliers remain valid long-term agreements many of which were negotiated and entered into before Apple sold the first iPhone. Despite Apple's claims against QUALCOMM, Apple suppliers remain contractually obligated to pay royalties to QUALCOMM under their license agreements with us, including for sales of iPhones to Apple.","In our fiscal second quarter, Apple interfered with the license agreements between QUALCOMM and the Apple suppliers by actively inducing them to underpay the royalties they owed to QUALCOMM for sales during the December quarter. Apple withheld payment to their suppliers for sales in the December quarter in an amount equal to what Apple claims QUALCOMM owes to Apple under a separate cooperation agreement between the companies.","This was consistent with what Apple said it would do in the complaint it filed in San Diego prior to our last earnings call. Apple suppliers then underpaid royalties to QUALCOMM in the same amount. In the aggregate, this amount is approximately $1 billion. Most of Apple suppliers have already reported the royalties they owe to QUALCOMM for sales to Apple during the March quarter and they are obligated to pay the full amount of those royalties to us.","While would expect Apple suppliers to pay the royalties they owe us under their license agreements, it is possible that Apple will continue to interfere with the Apple suppliers license agreements leading those suppliers to breach their contract with QUALCOMM by underpaying some or all of what they owe us.","We expect to have more visibility into this in the coming weeks. Given this uncertainty, our fiscal third quarter guidance assumes a range of possible payments from Apple, from the Apple suppliers, but does not reflect a scenario that Apple suppliers pay nothing to us for March quarter sales.","Turning to our data center business, as Steve mentioned, we recently announced the collaboration with Microsoft to accelerate next-generation cloud services on our 10 nanometer Centriq 2400 platform, which will span multiple future generations of hardware, software and systems.","We also showcased our first public demonstration of Windows Server on ARM running on our processors and contributed a Qualcomm Centriq Open Compute Motherboard to the OCP community. We remain on track for commercial shipments of our server processors by the end of the calendar year and we continue to receive good feedback from our customers.","That concludes my comments, and I will now turn the call over to George.","George Davis","Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal second quarter was another solid quarter with non-GAAP revenues of $6 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.34, up 13% sequentially. We exceeded the midpoint of our non-GAAP earnings per share by $0.14.","Better than expected performance at QCT accounted for approximately $0.05 of the upside on solid MSM demand and strong performance across auto, networking and IoT. The balance of the performance came from better than expected investment portfolio gains and a lower estimated annual tax rate. QTL was in line with expectations for the quarter despite the impact of a licensee dispute join the positive effect of licensing progress in China, strong 3G, 4G demand and a focus on costs.","In QCT, MSM chip shipments were 179 million, modestly above the midpoint of our prior guidance. QCT revenues were $3.7 billion and implied revenue per MSM was up sequentially on stronger product mix consistent with our expectations. QCT operating margin was 13% above the high-end of our prior expectations, reflecting higher gross margins in mobile and better than expected operating results in auto, networking and IoT.","As Steve mentioned, we were pleased to close the RF360 joint venture in February. We are consolidating the results of the JV on a one-month lag basis and it added approximately 75 million in revenue in the quarter on one-month of activity. QTL fiscal second quarter revenues were $2.2 billion in line with expectations. Total reported device sales were a record and exceeded our prior guidance range on strong ASPs offset by an estimated underpayment of more than 150 million related to a dispute with a licensee.","As Derek explained, Apple suppliers reported royalties in the fiscal second quarter for sales activity in the December quarter withheld approximately $1 billion from their payments. This amount is equal to the amount that Apple claims QUALCOMM owes it under a separate cooperation agreement between QUALCOMM and Apple.","It is worth noting that fiscal second quarter royalties revenues were not impacted by the underpayment because the suppliers reported the full royalties for the term of their agreement and acknowledge they were due, but underpaid by the same amount that QUALCOMM is withholding from Apple under the cooperation agreement. This is consistent with the guidance we provided last quarter.","GAAP results for our fiscal second quarter reflect a $974 million reduction of revenues associated with the BlackBerry arbitration award including estimated interest in attorney's fees. This reduced fiscal second quarter GAAP EPS by approximately $0.48 per share.","Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses increased approximately 7% sequentially including the RF360 JV, which was not in our original guidance. Absence of JV, we would have been at the low end of our prior 6% to 8% guidance range. Our non-GAAP tax rate during the fiscal second quarter was 15%. We now estimate that our fiscal 2027 non-GAAP tax rate will be approximately 17% down from our prior estimate of 18% on changes in business mix.","We returned approximately $1.1 billion to stockholders in the quarter including $782 million of dividends paid and $283 million in stock repurchases. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $29 billion. The balance sheet this quarter merits some additional commentary to explain the impacts of the licensing related matters as well as the close of RF360 joint venture.","First, there were notable adjustments associated with our joint venture with TDK. As a reminder, we are fully consolidating the results of this joint venture as we have the ability to control the business. As a result, our balance sheet reflects the addition of approximately $3.1 billion of the JVs net assets including $1.7 billion of intangible assets in goodwill, $800 million in property, plant and equipment, $260 million in inventory, and $250 million in accounts receivable.","Our accounts receivable balance at quarter end also reflects the approximately $1 billion due from Apple suppliers and we continue to carry approximately $1 billion in other current liabilities for the unpaid disputed amounts with respect to the cooperation agreement with Apple, which expired at the end of calendar 2016.","Note that these unpaid disputed amounts have been accrued as a reduction to revenues in our P&L over the past few quarters. Also including other current liabilities is $974 million related to the recent BlackBerry award, which we expect to pay in the next few months and $921 million related to the KFTC fine, which was paid shortly after the end of the fiscal second quarter.","I will now turn to our fiscal third quarter. Our guidance range for earnings per share is wider than our typical practice primarily due to the uncertainty around whether Apple suppliers will withhold some portion of the royalty payments they are obligated to pay another contracts with us. We have considered a variety of scenarios within the range.","Our guidance range does not include the case where no payments are made by Apple suppliers. We will update our guidance if we subsequently learn of any action that would take us materially outside of the announced guidance range. We have also assumed in our guidance that the licensee dispute that Derek mentioned, which arose in the fiscal second quarter remains unresolved in the third quarter and will result in an underpayment relative to what the licensee owes for the third quarter.","As a reminder, we are coming off the seasonally strong fiscal second quarter for QTL and our fiscal third quarter typically reflects our low quarter of the year for both revenues and EPS on a normalized basis. We estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $5.3 billion to $6.1 billion. The year-over-year comparisons for both revenue and EPS are impacted by more than $400 million in catch up licensing revenues recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2016.","We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share in our fiscal third quarter to be in the range of approximately $0.90 to $1.15 per share. We expect fiscal third quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be up approximately 2% to 4% sequentially primarily due to a full quarter impact of the RF360 JV operating expenses and growing spend on litigation matters.","In QTL we estimate total reported device sales between $59 billion and $67 billion will be reported by our licensees in the June quarter for shipments they made in the March quarter, down sequentially compared to the seasonally high holiday quarter shipments reflected in fiscal Q2. This includes estimated 3G\/4G device sales from Apple's contract manufacturers as well as from the licensee currently in dispute in underpaying.","In QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 180 million to 200 million units during the June quarter, higher sequentially at the midpoint despite the excess inventory at certain OEMs in China exiting Q2. We expect inventory levels at those OEMs to largely correct within our fiscal third quarter.","For the Snapdragon 835 premium tier chipset, we are seeing strong demand exceeding supply. Our growth in operating margin relative to demand in the quarter is being limited by our ability to ramp volumes at 10 nanometer. We expect this to begin to normalize in the fiscal fourth quarter. We expect QCT's fiscal third quarter operating margin to be approximately 13% plus or minus 100 basis points reflecting year-over-year improvement as we continue to gain traction in adjacent opportunities particularly auto, IoT and networking.","Our current expectation is that we will be in the capital markets in the second half of fiscal 2017 to fund the remaining portion of our acquisition related needs. We continue to sell longer dated and higher volatility assets in our treasury investment portfolio in anticipation of funding the close of our pending NXP acquisition later in the calendar year.","Based on the current market environment, we expect the total of net investment income and interest expense for fiscal 2017 to be flat to down modestly on a non-GAAP basis versus fiscal 2016. The outlook has improved somewhat on the higher yields on short-term assets.","That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to John.","John Sinnott","Thank you, George. Operator, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Rod Hall","Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Hope you can hear me okay. I just wanted to clarify George what you guys are saying about the withholding, and Derek as well. So our understanding is the rebates, the alleged rebates were withheld for a couple of quarters, and so it sounds like what you're saying is the amount of royalty withheld is catching up for two quarter of rebate withholdings. So I just want to clarify that is in fact the case.","And then I also wanted to see if you guys could give us any further color on the guidance range and are you assuming that the royalty withholdings at the midpoint would be equivalent to these rebates that are allegedly not being paid, and then how does the top and bottom end of that EPS range figure into what you're assuming on royalties? Thank you.","Derek Aberle","Hey, Rod. This is Derek. So if you think about Q2 which we had talked about last quarter in our reporting obviously for this quarter. Basically what happened is, we have a dispute with Apple as to whether we owe them about $1 billion under a cooperation agreement we have. That spans over several quarters of possible payments.","What they said in their complaint and what they ended up doing as it relates to the second quarter which are sales through the end of December of 2016 is they effectively withheld payment to their contract manufacturers who then in turn withheld payment to us for royalties that were owed under the contract manufacturers agreements with us in the amount of this disputed cooperation payment, which is about $1 billion.","And so that is all reflected in Q2, and as George mentioned because the amounts were reported to us and acknowledged as due, and then we have the cash that we haven't paid to Apple, effectively we took the revenue in Q2 for the amount of the four royalties that were paid net the reserve we had for the payments that are being disputed going back towards Apple. So that's the situation on Q2.","On Q3, the guidance as we mentioned includes sort of a variety of possible assumptions on what may play out in terms of what gets paid to us by the contract manufacturers for Q3. I would say the high end of the guidance would be reflective of us getting paid in full, but we've got some other scenarios that are reflected in the range.","The agreement itself with Apple which is where we have the dispute of what is owed to them expired at the end of 2016, so has really no relevance or impact to what the contract manufacturers would owe us for sales during the March quarter which is the guidance we\u2019ve provided for Q3. One last point on this is what is not contemplated in the guidance range is for the contract manufacturers to pay us nothing or very low amount. If that were to happen then we would update you all.","George Davis","Rod let me add one thing as well, when you look at Q2 you can look to the balance sheet and see the accounts receivable has had a fairly significant pop, not only because we've brought in RF360, but the receivable is up by the - $1 billion of that is the amount owed by the CM\u2019s which are not disputing the fact that they have reported and are obligated to pay under the contract for this amount. So it has shown as a receivable. We are still holding the $1 billion related to the dispute from the prior quarters under current liabilities on our balance sheet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Kulbinder Garcha","Thanks. Along the same subject I\u2019m afraid and then - on the - just a clarification on your own building was withheld by the contract manufacturers, but something was paid to you, something else was paid to you above that level I assume and it\u2019s not good lead indicator for being paid going forward, am I thinking if I wrong?","Steve Mollenkopf","No. Yes, go ahead and ask your second question, would jump and then\u2026","Kulbinder Garcha","And then the other question was really more strategic about how the Apple and QUALCOMM thing plays out. The Foxconn agreement you have is that due to expire anytime soon? I assume it's not you haven't told us about device when it clarify that and it's very rare from what I can remember where you have an agreement with a party and it just stopped paying you. You had a deals expired in the past and you've had disputes perhaps and you have people that want to report on you all day, but is has ever been a scenario where you've had an agreement that last or some period of time and vendor in question just stops paying?","George Davis","So Kulbin, I'll take the first part of the question, which is what they paid to us, was simply the difference between the full amount owed under the contract minus the disputed amount. So there was some incremental payment that came in, but it was net of that $1 billion that that we described in the prepared remarks.","Derek Aberle","Yes, just to add to that - this is Derek. The cooperation agreement between QUALCOMM and Apple as I said expired at the end of 2016. So unlike Q2 there really is no basis on which to even argue that there should be a payment of something less than the full amount that the contract manufacturers owed to us.","In terms of the Foxconn agreement, it's a long-term agreement. It is not set to expire any time soon. Those are again long-term agreements that are valid in binding and include the contractual obligation to pay the only thing that expired or the direct agreements between QUALCOMM and Apple and those went away at the end of 2016.","And to your last point, yes it's been very rare, actually as I sit here can't think of a situation where somebody just simply stop paying us entirely under their agreement where we didn't have a dispute with them as to what they owed or some other thing going on, so that would be rare.","Donald Rosenberg","This is Don. Just to add one or two things. So to be clear, the excuse that the contract manufacturers used was that Apple wasn't paying them and what Apple was saying was that they are holding back payment to them to match the payments that they claim we owed them from the other agreement to BCPA, no connection to the license agreement between us and our contract manufacturers.","So with this totally improper for the contract manufacturers to withhold and we now look at what they're going to do going forward and we say well even we excuse that they used before that is Apple claiming that they were making up for amounts that we didn't pay them doesn't exist anymore. So there doesn't seem to be even an arguable rational reason for anybody to withhold payments.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","Michael Walkley","Great, thank you. Just staying on this topic, just trying to understand maybe the guidance in accounting ramifications, one, you have a licensee that you're dispute with and you didn't recognize $150 million in revenue and I think when you had a dispute with Nokia going back in time when they materially underpaid during that process you have withheld Nokia revenue from your guidance.","So if say the contract manufacturers pay some smaller dollar amount that Apple theoretically said they should pay them, do you still recognize a portion of that revenue or do you just take out for altogether like maybe you've done with some of the licensee. Just trying to understand the accounting ramifications if there is any change from your licensee?","And then my more fundamental question just on the outlook for QTL, if you can help just walk us on a sequential between seasonality of this the Apple range and then you had this licensee disputed maybe if you could help us just see the sequential decline kind of those different puts and takes that would be helpful? Thank you.","Steve Mollenkopf","So in terms of taking revenue in the case of a dispute, typically if there's a formal dispute then we would not take revenue until the dispute is resolved and I'll let Derek or Don comment on what constitutes the formal dispute, but certainly entry into arbitration or lawsuit is one case in the past.","For the customer in the second quarter, the customer reported fully and underpaid and as not filed a formal dispute and in that case we take the revenue for the amount paid while we're working on collecting the balance owed from the customer. And then do you want to add to that at all?","Derek Aberle","Yes. I think just the difference Mike - this is Derek - in the two scenarios that the situation we have the current dispute where we didn't take revenue this quarter about 150 million - little more than 150 million. That situation where we did not get paid, so typically if there's a dispute and we're not getting paid, we wouldn't take the portion that's being withheld, which is different than if we are getting paid.","On your sequence question, I think really got to remember the Q2 obviously is seasonally high quarter for the year, December quarter obviously typically the high quarter for QTL, so there would normally be a sequential decline going into Q3. I think other factors to consider, I would say we're assuming as I mentioned in my remarks that this dispute will not get resolved with the licensee we mentioned in Q3. So Q2 to Q3 were both assuming an underpayment and then we have a range of possibilities in the assumptions for what we'll get paid from the contract manufacturers supplying to Apple.","If I up level it to the market, the market I think is continues to be quite strong. I would say it played out just a little bit differently in terms of what came in, in Q2 versus Q3. If you look at the TRDS range, we were above the high-end slightly of the Q2 TRDS range because of the phenomena of just more sales into China with a little inventory build that we expect will get sold through in Q3, which is therefore a bit of a drag on Q3 TRDS. So I think those are sort of the main drivers to keep in mind.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Tim Long","Thank you. Just two quick ones if I could here. First, I just want to clarify the guidance for next quarter. Are you still booking the operating expenses or COGS hit that you were taking for the payment that was going back to Apple previously under that agreement. So if you can clarify if that's still hurting your EPS and reserving against it on the balance sheet and when would that change?","And then secondly, the licensee with the $150 million dispute, Derek could you talk a little bit about, I know you can't get into too much of the details, but I just want to understand is this something that maybe is a by-product of other licensees seeing some of these special Apple agreements that were mentioned in their dispute in the BlackBerry arbitration and if not are you getting a lot of phone calls from other OEMs that have seen these other deals that they maybe do not have an understanding they have separate arrangements is that potentially causing any renegotiations? Thank you.","Derek Aberle","Tim on the - in terms of the accruals that we've taken, those stopped as the contract expires at the end of the calendar year with the last period that that would be reported in - for us was in fiscal Q2.","George Davis","And just to be - just a reminder, we didn't characterize sort of where those - were accruing on the P&L and that\u2019s I don't want to make it seem like we're validating your description of them. On the second point, I think the way to think about that is the licensee with, which we have a dispute now, those discussions with the licensee I would say have been ongoing for some time and predated the filing in any of the litigation between us and Apple.","A lot of times these discussions will go for a period of time before they escalate into a dispute and so that the timing is what it is, but I think it's important to note that the discussions leading up to dispute predated into the BlackBerry or the Apple litigation. And I don't really see a connection to that if you think about the BlackBerry decision. It really is an isolated agreement.","And as I mentioned in my remarks even after we make the refund, the amount that BlackBerry paid per unit during that time period was basically consistent with the caps that we have for premium tier devices. So I don't anticipate really any impact from that decision on what other licensees would claim in terms of what it means to their agreements.","The Apple situation as we mentioned in a lot of detail in our response, the terms under those agreements I think were grossly mischaracterized in Apple submission. So, yes we've had to have some discussions with licensees to try to clarify what it is and isn't. But I would say that's sort of normal course discussions we would typically have with companies.","Steve Mollenkopf","Tim, I would add that as I said in my prepared remarks that the disputed amounts under the cooperation agreement were accrued as a reduction to revenues in the P&L. So we can give that level of commentary.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","James Faucette","Thank you very much. Just a couple of questions, first on that the topic of royalties from the contract manufacturers, have you received any payments sense that the original lawsuit was filed and is that part of the reason that you feel comfortable assuming that at least some royalties will be paid and in the June quarter?","And then I did want to touch quickly on the NXPI acquisition. Any update on timing of other regulatory body approvals? And can you give us a rough outline yet as to what the financing cost for that portion will be or what the interest rates may look like et cetera if and as that deal closes? Thank you very much.","Derek Aberle","Jim, this is Derek. On your first question about the contract manufacturers. So yes for Q2 what was reported and owed to us by the contract manufacturers actually exceeded the amount that's in dispute between QUALCOMM and Apple under the cooperation agreement. So we did receive payments under those licenses for the difference as George mentioned between what those companies owed and basically the disputed amount that Apple withheld.","And for the Q3, basically we've already received royalty reports from most of the contract manufacturer suppliers to Apple and believe there is a clear and binding payment obligation as it relates to those payments and there is no dispute about other money that is owed from QUALCOMM to Apple.","So again if these licensees are operating in accordance with the terms of the agreement they should pay and they should pay the full amount, but again more - a little cautious until we actually get the payment in hand and so that's reflected in the guidance as well as just pointing out that the situation where there's zero payment is not reflected in our range today.","Donald Rosenberg","This is Don. On the NXP question. So yes, we're pretty much moving as expected as Steve mentioned, we have past the HSR process in the U.S. We should be filing very shortly in Europe and we filed in China already that has not yet been doctored by China, but it's there. And we would anticipate filing in the other jurisdiction very quickly after we\u2019ve completed filing in Europe. So we believe we\u2019re still on track, and we're moving forward.","George Davis","On the financing front, we expect to be in the market in the second half, we have not put out an estimate yet on the financing costs. No material change in our expected sizing, which was between $10 billion and $12 billion of acquisition debt. But the form of that debt, the term and the tenor will all have an impact on estimated cost and we're not locked down on those yet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Simona Jankowski","Hi. Thank you very much. First, I just wanted to clarify if the payments to Apple under the BCPA were previously reported as comes from revenues in QCT or in QTL. And then the question on the new licensee that was underpaying in the quarter, did they still pay the majority of what they owed you or what\u2019s the $150 million that they underpaid in fact the majority of what they owed you?","And then along the same lines, your accounts receivable increased by about $2 billion of which you commented that $1 billion was due to the Apple withholding and then some of that was the TDK joint venture, but in the filing - in the Q, you also say that some of the increase was due to the delayed payments of other licensees. So I was just curious if there are other potential disputes that contributed to that or if that's just purely timing?","Derek Aberle","Hi, Simona. This is Derek. Maybe I'll take the first two and then George can take the last one. Yes, the amounts that are in dispute between us and Apple as we mentioned last quarter have been fully accounted for and run through the P&L in prior quarters. We did not specify sort of where in the P&L, the various payments were flowing and I think at this time are going to continue on that path. As to the dispute with the licensee, I'm not sure I can characterize majority versus minority, but they did pay a significant amount of royalties to us and didn't withhold - they withheld only a portion of what they owed not the entire payment.","George Davis","So on the accounts receivable outside of the Apple related $1 billion and the RF360 amounts, what you had was growth in receivables related to QCT, which was just a timing issue or payment relative to when shipments were made. And then on the QTL piece that is really just the timing of payments that are being made on some of the catch up payments where they're spread out over a short period of time just to allow customers to get caught up in addition to fully paying at their new run rate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Stacy Rasgon","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I know you're making the point that the contract manufacturers are under obligation to pay no matter what they're getting from Apple, but let's be honest they're going to pay you whatever they get from Apple given presumably. So given what you know at this point of Apple's intentions, how can we assess that risks just the fact that you're - you aren't contemplating Apple completely ceasing their payments, so I just think you judge their risk of that happen to be lower, it's just not a scenario that you want to contemplate at this point?","And on the revenue recognition, you give us some good color on kind of what constitutes a deferral versus not, but let's just say hypothetically next quarter the contract manufacturers were to pay you 50% of what you believe they owe you for Q3. Would you be able to recognize all that 50% or would you have to defer at that point and send an arbitration and call it zero? How do we think about revenue recognition depending on what's coming in?","Donald Rosenberg","Stacy, this is Don. Maybe a couple of us who would want to respond to the first question, but yes, to start what you said, I understand it\u2019s a figure of speech, let's be honest. We are being honest and what is a good thing to think about is I disagree with you that it's a foregone conclusion.","As I said earlier, Apple's claimed in its case against us is that they would held the specific amount of money in payments to their contract manufacturers because they said it's an offset against money that they claim, we withheld from them improperly in another contract. While we disagree with that claim obviously, the rationale for that no longer applies.","As Derek said earlier, that BCPA contract is expired. So they're no more moneys even arguably due from us to them and therefore no basis or rationale to continue withholding from the contract manufacturers. And as Derek also said the contract manufacturers have valid binding contracts with us and our expectation is that they will abide by those obligations and pay us the amount they owe us, which they reported for the quarter.","Derek Aberle","Stacy, this is Derek. I think on your second question, I think probably the best way to think about it is, we\u2019d have to wait and see all of the circumstances under which the revenue got reported and paid to us to sort of make a final judgment on that, but at a high level I would say we have binding valid agreements with them if they reported half of what they owe and paid that to us. I think the most likely scenario is as long as we're not in litigation with them that we would recognize that revenue within the quarter that is paid.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Tavis McCourt","Hey, thanks for taking my questions. The $150 million or so license payments that have been withheld in the second quarter, was that contemplated in your second quarter guidance or is that something that happened after the last report? And then, so just to be clear on the contract manufacturers payments for your third quarter guidance, the high end of the guidance would presume they pay in full, but there's no presumption of, obviously, the cooperation agreement payments from you towards Apple with that guidance? Is that correct?","George Davis","Let me start with your first question which was - we did not contemplate the underpayment in the Q2 guidance. It\u2019s one of the reasons why we made the point that actually if you factor that out it was a strong quarter for QTL, they were able to come in at expectation despite that, and you saw that in the strength of the market and also the strength in ASP's, they also worked hard to manage the cost.","In terms of our guidance for Q3, again we\u2019ve looked at a variety of scenarios, I\u2019m not going to lay out every one of the scenarios, but the things that we thought could happen. We are anticipating in our guidance that we have not resolved the dispute with the one customer that made the underpayment in Q2, so that is factored into our guidance. And then there's a variety of scenarios for the Apple contract manufacturers and also just the normal range of uncertainties that we have when we give guidance.","Operator","This ends our allotted time for questions and answers. Mr. Mollenkopf, do you have anything further to add before adjourning the call?","Steve Mollenkopf","Well, I just want to thank everyone for joining us today. I also want to thank the employees for delivering a great quarter and particular the folks who are delivering on the new businesses. It was really a strong quarter and I appreciate all the hard work. We'll talk to everybody next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"18339":["QUALCOMM, Inc.

International callers please dial 404-537-3406. The playback reservation number is 39466125.","I would now like to turn the call over to John Sinnott, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sinnott, please go ahead.","John T. Sinnott - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Thank you and good afternoon everyone. Today's call will include prepared remarks by Steve Mollenkopf and George Davis. In addition, Cristiano Amon, Alex Rogers and Don Rosenberg will join the question-and-answer session. You can access our earnings release and a slide presentation that accompany this call on our Investor Relations website. In addition, this call is being webcast on qualcomm.com and a replay will be available on our website later today.","During the call today, we will use non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G and you can find the related reconciliations to GAAP on our website. We will also make forward-looking statements, including projections and estimates of future events, business or industry trends or business or financial results. Actual events or results could differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Please refer to our SEC filings including our most recent 10-Q, which contain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","And now, to comments from Qualcomm's Chief Executive Officer, Steve Mollenkopf.","Steven M. Mollenkopf - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal second quarter results were strong with non-GAAP earnings per share 14% above the midpoint of our guidance range, driven by continued strong performance in QCT and cost management throughout the company, which was balanced by some headwinds from weaker industry conditions and litigation costs in QTL.","We returned approximately $1 billion to stockholders in the quarter, including $845 million of dividends paid and $200 million in stock repurchases. We also announced a 9% increase to our quarterly dividend rate in the quarter, effective for dividends starting in the June quarter.","Looking ahead, we see some near-term headwinds, but our longer-term outlook is consistent with our fiscal 2019 targets that we shared with you in January. Our fiscal third quarter guidance reflects some softness in global 3G\/4G device shipments, particularly in China, the impact of some changes we have made to our licensing framework, as well as the impact of increased litigation expenses in our licensing business.","QCT continues to execute well with strong performance in China and growth in adjacent areas, offset by some impact of lower modem shipments. For calendar 2018, we are adjusting our growth estimate for global 3G\/4G device shipments lower. However, handset selling prices continue to be stronger than expected, which continues to be a favorable trend.","As we navigate the short-term industry weakness in QCT, we continue to execute well in that business and our market share remains strong. The Snapdragon 845 platform, our latest premium tier offering, has achieved substantial commercial success with over 100 design wins already, including launched flagship devices by Samsung, Sony, ASUS and Xiaomi.","Our modem leadership continues. We recently announced our X24 LTE modem, which is the world's first 2 gigabit 4G modem and the world's first announced 7 nanometer chip. As the market transitions to 5G, the engineering challenges embedded in the 5G opportunity play directly to Qualcomm's strengths and the focused investment we have made over the last several years. We are leading the industry to 5G and we are pleased to see the strength of our roadmap helping to enable the upcoming commercial launches of 5G networks and devices, including the 18 network operators and 20 manufacturers that have selected our X50 5G modem for trials and 5G devices.","We also recently announced the world's first 5G module solutions, which include highly integrated turnkey 5G modules, including application processor, baseband, transceiver, memory, power management, RF front-end, antennas and other components that are designed to expand the ecosystem and accelerate 5G deployments.","Our products continue to be differentiated, driven by our unique systems-based approach to the complexities across wireless networks and devices. We are delivering industry-leading technologies and performance, which translates into a more efficient use of spectrum for operators and a lower bill of materials for device makers, delivering attractive economics for our partners and higher device content share for us.","In auto, our backlog of awarded design wins has increased to $4 billion, as automakers and Tier 1 suppliers begin gearing up for 5G-enabled cars in 2021. We continue to be the supplier of choice, given our decades of wireless technology leadership. In infotainment, we have designs with 14 of the top 25 global automaker brands, including Audi, BYD, Geely, Honda, Jaguar Land Rover, PSA and Volkswagen.","In networking, we see favorable trends with continued share gains and growth in the Wi-Fi infrastructure opportunity across enterprise, retail and carriers. And we launched the world's first draft 802.11ax carrier gateway, which started shipping in March in KDDI and NEC.","In summary, we are well positioned to grow in our adjacent opportunities of auto, IoT, networking and compute as we leverage our core competencies to gain share in these emerging areas.","In November 2017, we announced a global framework for licensing Qualcomm's standard essential patents at an effective rate of 3.25%, covering multimode devices inclusive of 5G Release 15 standards. We also recently set the selling price cap for a handset at $400 for all licensees. This global rate is consistent with the SEP-only licensing program we successfully established in China since 2015, which has resulted in over 120 agreements for 3G and 4G devices. We are now in negotiations for license extensions under the new program announced in November that include rights to our 5G patents and expect to conclude a number of agreements in Q3.","The transparency of our worldwide SEP-only licensing program, including announced rates for 5G Release 15, facilitates the effort to conclude agreements and extensions in 2018 and early 2019, providing for a seamless transition for the launch of 5G devices in 2019. Longer term, we believe this SEP-only licensing program enhances the stability of QTL with extended contract terms that incorporate 5G pricing. While execution of new agreements with existing handset licensees will create some near-term revenue impact in QTL, they are consistent with our assumptions that we set for fiscal year 2019 EPS targets.","Looking ahead, we are focused on executing on our strategy to deliver our fiscal 2019 earnings per share targets. We have identified a number of specific strategic areas as part of that plan, and we will be updating you on our ongoing progress. First, we continue to focus on closing the NXP transaction. As we announced last week at the request of MOFCOM, we withdrew and refiled our application for Chinese regulatory approval. We also agreed with NXP to extend the purchase agreement to July 25. While we continue to work closely with the Chinese regulators and remain optimistic about getting the necessary regulatory approvals there, it is clear that the geopolitical environment and trade actions are having an impact.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this is the operator. I apologize, but there will be a slight delay in today's conference. Please hold, and the conference will resume momentarily. Thank you for your patience.","Steven M. Mollenkopf - QUALCOMM, Inc.","On the timelines we previously discussed and should converge toward multiple important milestones later this year.","In addition, our breach of contract case against Apple's contract manufacturers and our claim against Apple for interfering with those contracts is on schedule to be prepared for trial setting by the end of the year. As the legal cases progress, we continue our direct engagement with Apple and prefer to ultimately reach a negotiated settlement.","Regarding our other dispute with a large licensee, we are in discussions toward a negotiated resolution and those discussions are very active.","Third, we are progressing on our previously announced plans to reduce our spending by $1 billion. We have made good progress on this commitment, taking steps to reduce spending across SG&A and R&D. We are also focused on spending reductions in our noncore product areas.","Fourth, we are executing our product roadmap and continue to make the investments necessary to maintain our technology and product leadership, lead the industry to 5G and grow our adjacent areas across the RF front end, automotive, IoT, networking and mobile compute.","In closing, we are pleased to report strong results this quarter and we remain 100% focused on delivering on our fiscal 2019 commitments and creating that value for stockholders. We look forward to continuing to update you on our progress.","I now turn the call over to George.","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone. Our fiscal second quarter results were above the midpoint of our guidance with revenues of $5.3 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.80 per share, $0.10 above the midpoint of our guidance. The non-GAAP EPS outperformance in the quarter was driven by higher MSM shipments, improved gross margins in QCT, a more favorable tax rate from lower domestic versus foreign earnings and lower operating expenses.","In QCT, MSM chip shipments were $187 million, towards the high end of our guidance range. QCT revenues were $3.9 billion, in line with expectations. As we expected, QCT results this quarter reflected the normal seasonal effects of lower demand, typical in the calendar first quarter, a reduction in orders sequentially from a large modem customer and reduced demand from customers in China as they reduced inventory balances. As a result, we saw handset inventory balances in China come down in line with long term trends. While we remain conservative on demand for the second half of the year, we think the lower level of inventory is a very healthy development.","QCT's earnings before tax was up 28% year-over-year, the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. QCT EBT margin was 16%, above the high end of our guidance range, reflecting stronger than expected gross margins in mobile, primarily in product cost benefits, including some discrete benefits related to conclusion of negotiations with a supplier.","QTL fiscal second quarter revenues were $1.26 billion, slightly above the midpoint of guidance and included a modestly higher amount of out of period catch-up that we anticipated offset by lower than expected 3G\/4G units reported by licensees for the December quarter, particularly in the emerging regions.","Note that these results exclude royalty revenues on Apple's products and the other licensee in dispute. It is also worth noting that in the December quarter we continue to see strong year-over-year trends in global 3G\/4G handset ASPs across various price levels.","We are seeing significantly higher run rate spending this year driven by litigation matters related to Apple and the FTC. In the second fiscal quarter, we spent approximately $125 million on these cases and expect that to ramp further in Q3. Spending is somewhat more heavily weighted in the second half of our fiscal year, in line with broad-based discovery activities and the timing of IP cases globally. We will provide information on our OpEx, both with and without excess litigation, so that the underlying cost structure changes are more visible.","QTL earnings before tax was $850 million, or 67% of revenues, above the midpoint of expectations or 78% if you adjust for extraordinary litigation expense. For Qualcomm overall, non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses decreased approximately 2% sequentially or down 4% if you adjust for extraordinary litigation expense.","We began implementing our $1 billion cost plan that will accelerate in the latter part of the year. In Q2 we booked restructuring and related charges under the cost plan of $310 million or $0.18 per share. These items were excluded from non-GAAP results. It is important to note that these initiatives will not impact our strong investment in 5G and our commitment to grow in mobile, RFFE, IoT, automotive, networking and mobile compute.","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate during the fiscal second quarter was 4%, favorable relative to our prior guidance due to the catch-up associated with a lower estimated annual effective tax rate on lower domestic versus foreign earnings mix. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $39.6 billion or $16.5 billion net of outstanding debt.","Turning to our financial guidance for the fiscal third quarter. We estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $4.8 billion to $5.6 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of approximately $0.65 to $0.75 per share. Our guidance incorporates a relatively balanced mix of positive and negative factors in the quarter with tax benefits related to potential restructuring opportunities under tax reform offsetting the impacts of initial plan changes in our licensing program, higher litigation costs in the quarter and approximately $0.03 of expected ZTE order effects across the company.","In QTL, we are expecting QTL fiscal third quarter revenues of approximately $950 million at the midpoint, down sequentially approximately $300 million. This outlook reflects three primary issues. First, about half of the sequential decline reflects the combined impact of a seasonably low quarter along with generally weak industry conditions along with approximately $40 million in higher onetime catch-up payments in Q2 relative to our outlook for Q3. Second, we have begun to recognize this quarter the impact related to the recent amendments to our Samsung licensing agreement, including the effects of the expanded cross-license agreement. And third, we are seeing the initial run rate impact of the licensing SEP-only framework including 5G that Steve described earlier. Slightly less than half of the sequential impact on revenue is from the changes to the Samsung agreement and other licensing program terms.","I should note that we have also implemented a voluntary revised cap in which the maximum net selling price of a handset on which the royalty is based will be capped at $400 per device, down from $500 per device. This will be broadly implemented in fiscal Q4 and we do not expect a material impact overall.","We expect QTL EBT margin to be approximately 50% to 54% in the fiscal third quarter, down sequentially at the midpoint on lower revenues and increased litigation cost. Without the extraordinary litigation expenses, QTL EBT margin expectations would be approximately 65% to 69%.","Turning to QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 185 million to 205 million units during the June quarter, higher sequentially at the midpoint on increased demand in China as inventory improved in the last two months of the fiscal second quarter. We expect QCT's fiscal third quarter EBT margin to be approximately 13% to 15%, down sequentially, primarily due to seasonally weaker product mix including lower thin modem shipments and the absence of the discrete product cost benefit in Q2.","We expect fiscal third quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be roughly flat to up approximately 2% sequentially, primarily due to increased litigation expenses as we continue to defend our business model, somewhat mitigated by the impacts of our cost efforts. Excluding the elevated litigation costs, we estimate that our non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses would otherwise be down approximately 1%. Non-GAAP interest expense net of investment income in the fiscal third quarter is expected to be roughly flat sequentially.","Turning to tax matters. As a result of the recent tax legislation enacted in the U.S., we anticipate implementing certain restructuring options that will reduce our current year tax rate and have been factored into our fiscal third quarter guidance. As a result, we expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fiscal third quarter to be a benefit of approximately 20% to 25%, which we expect to provide a benefit to non-GAAP EPS of $0.10 to $0.15 per share.","Regarding our 3G\/4G device shipment forecast, we are updating our unit estimates for calendar year global device shipments for both 2017 and 2018. For calendar year 2017, we now estimate approximately 1.755 billion global 3G\/4G devices shipped, up approximately 3% year-over-year at the low end of our prior estimates, primarily due to lengthening replacement rates in North America and China in the fourth calendar quarter.","For calendar year 2018, we now estimate approximately 1.8 billion to 1.9 billion global 3G\/4G device shipments or growth of approximately 5% year-over-year. This is lower from our prior estimate by 50 million units at the midpoint, reflecting a lower 2017 base as well as reduced demand expected in China. Within this population, handset growth is expected to be approximately 3% year-over-year.","With respect to global 3G\/4G device sales for fiscal 2018, we now expect growth of approximately 10% year-over-year at the midpoint, as the reduction in our estimate of global 3G\/4G units in the year is expected to be more than offset by strength in ASPs. Within this population, 3G\/4G global handset sales are expected to grow at similar percentage in fiscal 2018, driven primarily by strength in handset ASPs year-over-year.","I will provide some additional color on our committed 2019 targets. As I noted earlier, we are making good progress on the $1 billion cost plan. This is a critical element of our $5.25 non-GAAP EPS target, along with closing NXP, or alternatively moving ahead with our option to repurchase stock.","For our licensing business, the 5G royalty rates, the reduced NSP cap and the effects of the amended long-term Samsung license agreement were all factored into our fiscal 2019 guidance. Taking into consideration these items and the expectation of continued growth in global 3G\/4G handset sales in fiscal 2019, we expect QTL quarterly revenues in the near and medium term to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion on average, excluding the royalties from Apple's products and the other licensee in dispute. Of course, the amount in any one quarter will be subject to seasonal fluctuations, OEM mix, out-of-period catch-up amounts and continued progress on the licensing and compliance front, among other factors.","In QCT, we expect that fiscal 2019 performance will benefit from continued handset growth, particularly in emerging regions, continued strength in our China share in the mid, high and premium tiers, and growth in adjacent opportunities, including automotive, IoT, networking and mobile compute.","That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to John.","John T. Sinnott - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Thank you, George. Operator, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question is from Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.","Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Sorry. I was on mute. Can you hear me? Hello?","John T. Sinnott - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Yes, we can hear you, Tal. Go ahead.","Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Well, good. Can you repeat the reasons for the weak QTL guidance for next quarter? And how does it change going forward, especially what happens with Release 15 licensing? What I didn't understand is so far \u2013 and maybe it's just my understanding \u2013 so far your license covered all the patents and clients had to pay regardless of what patent you're using. Does it mean that LTE licensing is separate? And is the royalty rate for LTE licensing different, lower than the general licensing rate?","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","So, what I'll do \u2013 Tal, this is George \u2013 I'll cover the questions on the bridge, and then maybe Alex can talk a little bit about the structure of the SEP-only program.","So if you look at the sequential bridge, we said that it's down about $300 million. Some of that is the normal seasonal drop-off that we get, because this \u2013 remember, we're reporting on a lag, so this is calendar Q1 activities. This is where we saw the significant pullback in demand across four devices in general. So, we have a weak market. We also have the pullback that's just natural with Q1. The other piece is we also had some higher onetime amounts in Q2 than we're reporting Q3. So, that's about a little more than half of the $300 million.","The other half is the changes that we talked about, reflecting both the amendment to the Samsung agreement, which among other things includes the cross-license rights that are quite extensive, and the changes that we anticipate to see in the quarter to contracts for licensees that will take an SEP-only license, which has a number of favorable characteristics that I'm sure Alex will cover.","Alexander Rogers - QUALCOMM, Inc.","So, this is Alex, picking up where George left off. Just a little bit of context, I think, is helpful. Since 2015, we established a very successful licensing program in China for SEP licenses for 3G and 4G through Release 11 at a set of rates that came out of the resolution of the China matter. And what we've done and what we announced in November of 2017 is that we were extending that set of rates to a worldwide program for SEP-only licensing for 3G and 4G through the remaining releases also to include the first release of 5G, where the standard, the specification was finalized in December of last year.","That is our SEP-only licensing program going forward. Of course, we still have a portfolio-wide licensing program at the standard rate of 5%, but we expect on a go-forward basis that there will be a number of licensees who are interested in extensions and renewals who may want to have SEP-only license agreements. And of course, we'll negotiate those sorts of agreements, and we expect that there will be a few of those agreements being reached even in this quarter.","So, the program is rooted in a very successful program that came out of China with over 120 license agreements. We expect this program to be successful and to facilitate a very good transition to 5G in the second half of 2019. We expect there will be a number of licensees who want to maintain portfolio-wide agreements worldwide, but there will also be licensees who want to have SEP-only agreements on a worldwide basis. And that is, of course, something that we can accommodate on a case-by-case basis.","Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And I apologize if it sounds stupid, but would you mind to discuss what does it mean SEP-only?","Alexander Rogers - QUALCOMM, Inc.","No problem. Standard essential patents, so our standard essential patents that have been declared for 3G\/4G, and the first 5G standard. Those patents as distinguished from nonessential patents, implementation patents, other patents that are relevant to other standards other than cellular standards. So when we refer to SEPs, we're referring generally to cellular standard essential patents for the technology generations that we all understand to be 3G, 4G, and 5G.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Caso with Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.","Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. Just to follow up on the previous discussion a little bit, with regard to the fiscal 2019 guidance, you talked about that this new licensing scheme was included in that. Could you walk us through a bit of how you get to that fiscal 2019 EPS guidance, what are the puts and takes there and how this new licensing scheme falls into that as well?","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Yeah. This is George, Chris. The $5.25 base, as we said, included approximately $1.50 from NXP accretion. It included the benefit of $1 billion in the year of OpEx reduction and then it had the underlying run rate of the business absent the Apple license payments, new Apple business that we presume would be held up as part of the process of the litigation. And so we said to help people model, we indicated in my script that for modeling the levels of licensing revenue excluding Apple and the other licensee, you can plan on, on average between $1 billion and $1.1 billion per quarter.","Obviously that can fluctuate a little bit depending on some of the onetime items that show up or the strength of the market overall changing. We think that's a reasonable number. The balance of that, then, is going to be driven by fundamentally the performance of the QCT mobile business and the adjacent businesses as part of that. And I think the $5.25 is consistent with the basic position we have in QCT today and continued growth in the adjacents.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead with your question.","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Thank you. Just for the $5.25 in guidance for that out year, can you walk us through maybe what you expect for QCT in terms of margin targets that you expect to hit as the cost reductions come out of the business model implied in that guidance? And then also for the $5.25, what is management's plans should China continue to block NXP? When do you finally just pull the plug and is the buyback really the best thing to do with that cash to get to that $5.25? Thank you.","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Yeah. We haven't put out margin targets for QCT. Obviously we've said that we expect to get to our long-term margin target of greater than 20% over time, and certainly you would expect to see that as part of the kind of recovery case that the $6.75 to $7.50 envisions where we start to get some product business back that was taken away and also probably additional RF front end business is part of that. So I think overall, the $5.25 is really just a continuation for QCT of their current position strength in China, strength in the premium tier, which has been a positive relative to what we've seen with the fall-off in the thin modem business and then growth in the adjacents.","Steven M. Mollenkopf - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Mike, this is Steve. Maybe on your question related to NXP, there was probably a point in there, as I understand in the audio where people couldn't hear my comments related to NXP, but in short what I said was that we continue to work closely with China. The environment is obviously quite difficult from a geopolitical point of view, at least right now. However, we expect to ultimately receive approval and I'd just remind folks that we have eight of nine jurisdictions that have already ruled on it.","So although we remain committed to it and we think it's going to get done. However if it does not get done, as you mentioned, we think we have the ability to move very rapidly on a buyback as we communicated earlier in the January timeframe. I'll just remind everyone that we did a 90-day extension to the merger agreement and we're going to work very hard to get that done. And if it doesn't get done, we're going to move onto another approach. So hopefully that answers the question.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks a lot for taking my question, guys. I guess, Steve, maybe just to follow up on the line you had earlier, is July 25 sort of the drop dead deadline where if this is not done by then, you will move to plan B, i.e. buybacks or would you just extend the merger agreement further? And then any sense on what the MOFCOM issues are or what remedies they want above and beyond which you agreed to in other jurisdictions?","Steven M. Mollenkopf - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Well, I would say, Amit, with respect to the agreement, yes, we have just extended it by 90 days. So I think both companies are moving toward that timeline and we certainly have other ability and avenues to drive value and that's how we're thinking about the issue. Of course things can always change as we move through the process but that's the way that it's set up right now.","With respect to MOFCOM and remedies, our evaluation of the environment is such that, really, I think the issue is probably more related to the higher level discussions between the countries as opposed to any individual issue related to MOFCOM. Of course, we continue to work with the regulators and work through any issues that pop up, but I think the environmental issues between the countries are probably more the situation today than anything else but obviously we work closely with the regulator.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. Just wanted to closeout one more on the QTL part and then a question on the QCT piece. So, Alex, I just wanted make sure I understand this. So the impact of the SEP-only and 5G licenses that's hitting revenues, is that because those deals will have a lower rate structure? Or is it because there's some kind of onetime impact of nonpayment as those deals are being negotiated?","And then on the QCT side, units are holding up very well. I think you mentioned some ZTE hit in the quarter. You mentioned inventory reductions but it's a pretty weak market in China. And I guess we got a new set of iPhones coming out, and you guys have intimated that you potentially could do a little bit worse there or you're at least planning that you might not have as much share in that win. So could you just maybe is this predominantly market share that you think is keeping your numbers better I'd say than the end market for the last few quarters? That would be helpful. Thank you.","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Hey, Tim. This is George. Maybe I'll take the point on what is the impact that we're seeing from these changes. Again, what we said is a little less than half of the $300 million is related to what I would call the run rate changes associated with the amendments to the Samsung agreement that we announced last quarter and also the SEP-only expected impacts that we expect to be in the run rate this quarter. So it would be effectively a lower effective rate for those licensees than if they had had a portfolio license prior to that time.","Alexander Rogers - QUALCOMM, Inc.","This is Alex. What I think it's important to note that again, some licensees may choose to have an SEP-only agreement, including the 5G IP rights going forward. And they may choose to expand on that basis. But others will prefer a portfolio-wide agreement for obvious reasons. They enjoy the benefits of the entire portfolio and protected under the entire portfolio. And these are going to be determined on a case-by-case basis as we get into these negotiations, but we do believe that some licensees will choose SEP-only on a worldwide basis.","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Hey, Tim. Let me add one more thing I think before Cristiano comes in on some of the demand things, the demand environment for QCT. As I look at Q3, one of the difficult stories is because we're seeing some, this is the quarter where QCT is seeing some of the weakness in reports that we talked about because they report a month lag, so those are the weakness that QCT saw in Q2 but is seeing recovery in Q3.","But we continue to see an underlying growth in the licensing markets when you look at units and ASPs. If we just looked back to Q3 2017 and we looked at the market as for the licensees that are paying today, and we look at today the market has grown to the point where essentially the cost of these changes in the program on a run-rate basis is being covered by the growth in the market because of the strength of both units and in particular ASPs. Cristiano, did you want to?","Cristiano R. Amon - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Yes. Hi, Tim. So on QCT, it's exactly a simple story. Q2 has been a great quarter for us, particularly if you look compared to our year-over-year. I think we saw continued strength in our portfolio. As we look forward, and that's I think George said that we still take a conservative approach. However, we do see that the inventory levels came down back to normal in China.","So it's a story that we look at the units, we still think there is overall the drivers of our strength in China business continue. I think we see an improvement of mix. We see an improvement of handset ASPs. We have some interesting transitions ahead of us, such as China Mobile recently got a license for FDD. We have 5G coming in 2019. So I think the story is good. We're just dealing with how we think about the overall industry is in the second half, and we have seen a decline in thin modems, probably consistent with everybody else in the industry.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Guys, thanks for taking my questions. I just want to make sure I have this straight. So basically, you're folding 5G now into the licensing model and you're getting paid less for it and you're talking about it like it's a good thing. Why is this a good thing? Is this being proactive to halt the spread of other disputes? Or like what's the driving force behind doing this?","Alexander Rogers - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Stacy, this is Alex. We are including 5G in the SEP-only licensing model. We're not getting paid less for it. I think the best way to think about this is building a foundation for long-term stability in QTL. The current program that we've announced for SEPs that we announced back in November has tremendous consistency with the program that we successfully established in China coming out of the China investigation. We actually now have over 150 SEP-only licensees through the 3G and 4G program there.","And in addition, with the announcement in November ahead of the adoption of the first release of 5G, we have tremendous transparency for the program going forward. And so, what we've done is we purposely built the program to facilitate a transition to 5G in a way that successfully enables us to bring on new licensees and extend their agreements for longer terms. And so, this creates tremendous stability. Now, we do expect that a number of licensees will want to have portfolio-wide licenses, and so there's going to be a mix. But the effect of all of this has been considered in our FY 2019 numbers. So, we've looked at this and purposely built this program for stability long term.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. I wanted to, I guess, follow up on that question or at least as it pertains to the unnamed licensee. I guess with the new structure, how should we expect the impact to compliance and ability to assure compliance, firstly?","And secondly, I guess I'm wondering a little bit why anybody would offer a portfolio-wide license, especially when from the time that you introduced the standard essential patent licensing program in China, you had indicated that negotiations around nonessential IP would be done separately. But I don't think we've really seen any movement there. So, it seems like you're moving towards a standard essential patent-only licensing program, and I'm wondering how we should expect you to be able to collect on nonessential IP and how this may impact bringing the non-complying unnamed licensee into compliance. Thank you.","Alexander Rogers - QUALCOMM, Inc.","So with respect to the unnamed licensee, having a consistent program that's widely adopted is very good thing from a comp perspective. So, it actually creates an environment that enables us to essentially engage in the ongoing negotiations with that licensee from a position of strength, essentially saying that this is a widely adopted program. So, that unnamed licensee is an outlier.","In terms of SEP-only in the rest of the portfolio, there are a number of licensees that still have portfolio-wide agreements and will continue with those portfolio-wide agreements. And we expect that to happen. As I said, it will be a mix. The rest of the portfolio is still valuable. It's a very large portfolio, as you know, 130 patents and pending applications.","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","130,000.","Alexander Rogers - QUALCOMM, Inc.","130,000 patents and pending applications. And the value and strength of that portfolio, I think, is demonstrated in the assertions that we've had when we've had to have them, including against a company in China that signed up to a license and the assertions that we're making now in our litigation where over 40 nonessential \u2013 excuse me, over 50 nonessential patents are being asserted. So, the rest of the portfolio is still valuable and licensees will still want to have portfolio-wide protection. In fact, we have many portfolio-wide agreements that will continue. It will be a mix.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Just one question and one follow-up. So, I guess, two questions here. Just to wrap up the QTL side of things, embedded in the $5.25 base and then the road towards $7, et cetera, in your 2019 goal, do you believe that the implied royalty rate that we had before of roughly 2.9% will be higher or lower given all the moving parts that you've described on today's call?","And then the second question more for George, specifically, on the OpEx cuts and the $1 billion number, can you talk a little bit about the linearity of that, when are we going to start to see some of those absolute dollars come out? And how important is that litigation that's currently elevated, going back to some normalized level, how important is that in getting to the $1 billion annualized savings? Thank you.","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Yeah. Hi, Ross. This is George. So on the implied royalty rate, obviously, there's a lot of moving parts when you have two major licensees, one of which is reporting, one of which is not reporting. So it's really not a very meaningful number, which is why we have stopped guiding total reported device sales and some of these other items.","We think the rates that are embedded in the SEP-only licenses are fully consistent, as we said, in the run rate that we had factored into the FY 2019 numbers. As you remember, we actually announced the 5G program in last November. Also, if you applied them to the volumes, these same standards to the volumes of the non-paying licensees, you would very easily get to our $6.75 to $7.50 range. So, I think that's a key point.","And with respect to litigation normalization, the cost reduction program expects to take out $1 billion in the run rate without relying on a change in the litigation run rate of the company. I would describe that as a peace dividend that would flow through post the resolution of the litigation matters.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura Equity. Please go ahead with your question.","Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet","Yes. Thank you, guys. I had two questions. One, George, just the litigation costs rising a little bit in June. Should we assume this level for litigation for the foreseeable future? That's the first question.","The second question, I just wanted to ask about just the smartphone market overall and unit growth. You guys mentioned in your monologue that replacement rates are going out. When we saw this happen with PCs, unit growth actually went negative and today we're seeing weakness in smartphones that for the most part seems fairly broad-based. And I guess my question is what makes you confident that this weakness we're seeing is just temporary and that the market overall can grow from here? Thank you.","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","So on the litigation pattern, where we're in a period during this quarter, Q3, where we have very, very significant discovery processes and active preparation for multiple cases. So I would like to believe that this represents kind of a high water mark, but of course it's very important that we get this right. So we're going to spend what we need to spend as we see necessary to protect our licensing program. But I would say the second half is going to be heavier in the fiscal year 2018 than the first half, but we're kind of at a level now where we're supporting a lot of activity on multiple fronts. So I don't expect it to be significantly higher on a run-rate basis, but it could be sustained at this level for a little period of time.","In terms of the handset market and units, what you're really seeing is the impact of replacement rates has really slowed growth. In the developed markets you're getting a little bit of growth in Europe. But the emerging markets continue to be a positive source of growth, and in particular in India, in Southeast Asia, in Middle East, Africa, we're continuing to still see healthy mid to high, well you've seen double-digit growth in India and mid to high single digit growth in some of these other areas. So I think that remains a positive.","Also we think in 2019, you're starting to see the first 5G phones come into the marketplace, and as you go in 2019 and into 2020, you could start to see a replacement cycle just really driven by people wanting to take advantage of the capabilities that 5G brings.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. George, I actually had two questions. The first is I'm wondering how you handicapped for the fiscal 2019 guidance, how you handicapped the potential for the trade issues to broaden. Obviously, there's news now that Huawei's being looked at as well. So I'm wondering how you handicap that in your guidance, number one. And then number two, the guidance for the June quarter. If I read your comments right, are you basically saying that the normalized earnings guidance, if you assume that 8% tax rate that you had said previously, would be like $0.50? Thanks.","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Tim, so on the first, obviously the trade talks are current, and it's very hard to forecast. Those were not part of our thinking, and we've seen even in China some pretty big swings in demand intra-quarter. So there's always going to be market fluctuations, but we think the fundamentals, if we think about the licensing business, the fundamentals, particularly on ASPs, are a real tailwind for that business going into 2019. We also like the growth that we're seeing in our adjacent businesses and we like our position overall in China. But we'll have to see. The trade issues are an intangible. We'll have to see how that plays out.","In terms of the June quarter, what I would say is if you back out simply the tax items, which to me are really fundamentally offsetting what is a weaker market. Also clearly ZTE is coming out of there. We have the absence of some onetime items that were in our Q2 that are not in the Q3. So I think it would be wrong to draw a line to $0.50, which is what I think your question was.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Danely with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, thanks guys. Just a question on plan B if NXP does not happen. Could you give us any color on what the potential size and timing of a buyback would be? And then if this does not go through, does this necessarily sort of end any M&A potential for you guys? Or would you look at doing something else?","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","So on plan B, it would be a large, very large program. It would be in the $20 billion to $30 billion range. Obviously, at these prices we think the stock price is quite attractive. We don't think M&A would necessarily be closed off to the company. We think these are pretty unusual circumstances that we're seeing today. So we will continue to look at opportunities to add to the portfolio over time. We will generate the kind of cash flow that will allow us to consider other options down the road.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. I just have a clarification. I guess, Alex, can you talk about where we are in the SEP-only transition in terms of how long will it take? And then I guess the real question is you're guiding for $950 million in QTL revenue for Q2 or the next quarter. And then you also said that that run rate will come back to $1 billion to $1.1 billion. So I'm just trying to understand what will drive that incremental growth.","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","So this is George. Maybe I'll take the second question first and then Alex can jump in. So remember that our Q3 is the very weak calendar Q1 quarter for QTL, so you're seeing some seasonal elements there. That being said, we believe in addition to some of the other moving parts that I talked about, not to mention just the general, the broader market weakness and the seasonal elements, the lower out-of-period, you factor all of those elements in and also we're continuing to see very strong ASPs and ASP growth in the marketplace. That all moves you towards the $1 billion to $1.1 billion number.","Alexander Rogers - QUALCOMM, Inc.","And then with respect to the first part of the question, the chronology is that in November when we announced the 5G program, the SEP program including 5G release 2015, we're anticipating devices coming to market in second half of 2019, so we've got close to a two-year window. And there are a number of agreements that will extend through this entire timeframe. Those agreements, there are a number of agreements that will simply remain in place but there are other agreements that will come up for extensions and renewals.","And so the timing of the announcement was to essentially provide transparency before the release, the specification was adopted but also to facilitate a transition to negotiating these agreements, these extensions and renewals during this current timeframe. And we expect that to happen with significant pace. So we do expect a number of agreements to be reached or renewals and extensions to be reached even in this quarter and in the following quarters, both on an SEP-only basis but also on a portfolio-wide basis.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brett Simpson with Arete Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Brett Simpson - Arete Research Services LLP","Thanks very much. I have a question for Alex and a follow-up for Cristiano. Alex, I just wanted to talk about the non-SEP part of the portfolio. So you said there was a transition where you'll be offering SEP-only licenses. Can you talk about the nonstandard essential portfolio and how you plan to monetize the patents here from a licensing perspective? What royalty rates do you think can be achieved here and how many deals have you signed already for non-SEP only deals thus far?","Alexander Rogers - QUALCOMM, Inc.","So the history of the licensing business is that most licensees have wanted full portfolio agreements. It's the most efficient and most cost efficient way to take a license to this portfolio. And so the commercialization of the non-SEPs has always been in the context of full portfolio agreements. It is very rare that a company asks us for a separate license to non-SEPs only. So typically a company will want a full portfolio agreement if they want full protection. Again, that has happened historically the majority of the time. We don't have a separate distinct program at this point in time for non-SEPs.","Again, our primary commercial objective is to license the full portfolio, but we do have a number of aspects of the portfolio, for example, in multimedia, in position location and then other areas where if we decide to do it, we can license them on a disaggregated basis, But that's really all that I can say about that at this point.","Brett Simpson - Arete Research Services LLP","And so you have not licensed any company who have taken SEP only. There's a whole raft of nonessential patents that you have not licensed to these companies that are taking SEP-only deals. Is there a plan to monetize that out with doing platform deals, trading up to a platform deal so to speak?","Alexander Rogers - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Again, I'll go back to what I said before. I apologize if it wasn't clear, but the licensees have typically wanted, overwhelmingly wanted, full portfolio agreements. SEP-only licensing has been primarily a function of the program that we laid out in China and very successfully established in China since 2015. And we do expect that on a go-forward basis, even though we've offered SEP-only in the past, on a go forward basis there will be more companies that want SEP-only to include 5G. But the primary commercialization of the rest of the portfolio will be in the context of full portfolio licensing.","Operator","This ends our allotted time for questions and answers. Mr. Mollenkopf, do you have anything further to add before adjourning the call?","Steven M. Mollenkopf - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. I just want to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. I also want to thank the employees for their hard work and I just want to say that the management team and the company will continue to focus on executing toward our fiscal year 2019 targets and we look forward to updating you next quarter on our progress.

In addition, Cristiano Amon, Alex Rogers and Don Rosenberg will join the question-and-answer session.","You can access our earnings release and a slide presentation that accompany this call on our Investor Relations website. In addition, this call is being webcast on qualcomm.com and a replay will be available on our website later today.","During the call today, we will use non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G, and you can find the related reconciliations to GAAP on our website. We will also make forward-looking statements, including projections and estimates of future events, business, industry trends or business or financial results. Actual events or results could differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements.","Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K, which contain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","And now to comments from Qualcomm's Chief Executive Officer, Steve Mollenkopf.","Steve Mollenkopf","Thank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report strong results in the first fiscal quarter with non-GAAP earnings of $0.99 per share, above the high end of our guidance range, led by strength in our chip business. We're also pleased to see strong year-over-year revenue growth in our licensing business.","As you can see from our strong results, our business reached a key inflection point exiting fiscal Q1, demonstrating the positive financial impact of our 5G strategy to grow our addressable dollar content per device with higher-performing core chipsets and new RF front-end content. Virtually all of our 5G Snapdragon design wins are using our RF front-end solutions for 5G sub 6 and\/or millimeter wave, including design wins based on our second-generation solutions.","As we continue to execute on our RF front-end strategy, we are pleased to see our RF design win pipeline contribute to the strength of our quarterly results and our outlook. We are in a strong position with leading technology and intellectual property and the best products in the company's history. Our 5G roadmap extends beyond release '17, placing us on the cusp of a multi-decade mobile transformation as 5G increasingly becomes the foundation for the digital transformation of industries beyond smartphones.","Turning to QTL, we have now signed over 85 G license agreements up from 75 license agreements last November. Most recently, we signed extensions with 2 key Chinese OEMs through the end of March as we work to complete long-term 5G license agreements.","Let me now spend some time updating you on 5G traction globally. As we start the year, there are over 345 operators in nearly 120 countries, investing in 5G, including 45 operators in over 20 countries that have launched commercial 5G services, spanning both the sub-6 and millimeter wave spectrum. Looking forward, we continue to expect millimeter wave to be deployed in all regions.","Additionally, more than 45 OEMs have launched or announced commercial 5G devices, many of which are using our Snapdragon 5G platforms. On the product side, we recently introduced our flagship Snapdragon 865 mobile platform that we expect will power many premium tier Android smartphones this year. We also introduced the Snapdragon 765 and 765 Gaming Mobile platforms with an integrated 5G modem.","With over 275 5G devices announced or in development, spanning multiple price tiers, our product offerings will help make 5G more accessible to consumers. We also expanded our 4G lineup with new mobile platforms that enable our partners to offer sophisticated solutions that meet global 4G demand, particularly in emerging economies across multiple tiers and price segments.","Turning to Korea, last December, all three Korean operators combined reported approximately 4.7 million 5G subscribers and are forecasting continued growth throughout calendar year 2020. We see Korea as a leading indicator for the pace of 5G adoption. Of note, the expected 5G subscriber growth is not just isolated to the sub-6 frequency bands. Carriers are planning millimeter wave service in 2020.","Turning to China, 5G device sell in increased through December. The China Academy of Telecommunication Research reported sell-in of 13 million 5G handsets in calendar Q4 2019. Importantly, 5G handset sell-in penetration reached 19% in December 2019. We are already seeing devices priced as low as RMB 2,000 or approximately USD 285 million. At this point, 5G can address approximately 40% of domestic China smartphone sales.","In the U.S., the 5G network build-out is progressing well at the top 4 carriers across sub-6 and millimeter wave spectrum. Verizon is leading the deployment of enhanced mobile broadband with millimeter wave service in 31 cities and is expanding their device roadmap to approximately 20 new 5G products this year.","T-Mobile's 5G network now covers more than 200 million people and more than 1 million square miles across the United States. AT&T expects to have nationwide 5G coverage by calendar Q2. And Sprint expanded their 5G network coverage to 9 metropolitan areas.","I would also like to highlight two recent developments on spectrum in the United States that will help drive even greater momentum for 5G. First, the FCC gave final approval for commercial use of the CBRS band, taking advantage of spectrum sharing techniques that we and others in the industry began working on years ago. The CBRS band is well suited for enterprise, smart city and industrial IoT deployments.","And second, the FCC's latest millimeter wave auction which includes the largest amount of millimeter wave spectrum ever up for bid in an auction, is ongoing and will bring up to 3.4 gigahertz of additional millimeter wave spectrum to the U.S. market.","Turning to automotive, as a measure of our continued automotive success, our design win pipeline is now over $7 billion, up from $5.5 billion a year ago, which does not include any impact from our recently launched autonomous driving platform, Snapdragon Ride. We continued to benefit from our systems level expertise, expanding our automotive solutions to include an autonomous driving platform, Snapdragon Ride.","With a long history of automotive innovation, we now -- we have now become a trusted adviser to many of the world's leading automakers. Over 125 million vehicles use our broad range of automotive solutions, including telematics, in-car connectivity and infotainment platforms.","Our Snapdragon Ride ADAS platform represents a significant expansion of our addressable market. We look forward to seeing our Snapdragon Ride ADAS and autonomous solutions on the road in 2023.","We are very pleased with the FCC's unanimous vote in December to move forward with allocating spectrum in the 5.9 gigahertz band for cellular vehicle to everything technology. Since that vote, we are seeing traction for cellular V2x in the 5.9 gigahertz band across regions. Looking forward, we continue to remain optimistic about our growth opportunities in IoT, always connected PCs and cloud AI.","Lastly, as the coronavirus situation continues to unfold. Our thoughts are with the many Qualcomm employees in China, our customers and suppliers, their families, as well as those who are impacted by this unprecedented situation. As Akash will share with you, we have considered the impact of the coronavirus in our forward guidance based on the limited information we have at this time.","I would now like to turn the call over to Akash.","Akash Palkhiwala","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I will begin with a discussion of first fiscal quarter earnings. Our results demonstrated strong execution with revenues of $5.1 billion at the high end of our guidance range and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.99, $0.14 above the midpoint of our guidance.","The outperformance in the quarter was driven by strength in QCT across 5G, RF front-end and adjacent platforms with revenues of $3.6 billion, an EBITDA margin of 13%, which was above the high end of our guidance range.","MSM shipments of 155 million units were consistent with the midpoint of our guidance. QTL delivered revenues of $1.4 billion, a 38% increase year-over-year and EBIT margins of 72%, reflecting the benefit of a seasonally high quarter. We returned approximately $1.5 billion to stockholders during the quarter, consisting of $710 million in dividends and $762 million in stock repurchases..","With that, I'd like to turn to our global 3G\/4G\/5G device forecast. We continue to expect approximately 1.75 billion devices for calendar 2019. Our forecast for calendar 2020 remains unchanged at 1.75 billion to 1.85 billion devices, including 175 million to 225 million 5G devices. This forecast continues to reflect flat handsets and low double-digit growth in non-handsets.","Now let me walk you through our financial guidance. For our second fiscal quarter guidance, we are estimating revenues to be in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.7 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.80 to $0.95. There is significant uncertainty around the impact from the coronavirus on handset demand and supply chain. Based on the information we have at this time, we are widening and reducing the low end of our guidance range. We remain in active contact with our employees, customers and suppliers as we continue to monitor the situation.","In QCT, we expect second fiscal quarter revenues of $3.9 billion to $4.5 billion, an EBIT margin of 15% to 17%. The midpoint of our revenue guidance represents approximately 16% growth sequentially.","We estimate MSM shipments of 125 million to 145 million units, a 13% sequential decline at the midpoint. This trend is consistent with historical seasonality and reflects the latest demand signals from our customers. Sequentially, we expect revenue per MSM to be meaningfully higher, reflecting increased content with 5G device launches in addition to normal seasonal mix shift towards higher tier chipsets.","Our guidance includes a greater than 50% increase in RF front-end revenues in the second fiscal quarter on both a year-over-year and sequential basis.","For QTL, we estimate second fiscal quarter revenues to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion with EBITDA margins of 61% to 65%. We anticipate second fiscal quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses to be up 5% to 7% sequentially due to normal seasonality.","Looking forward, we continue to see two inflection points in fiscal 2020. The strength in the first half of the fiscal year reflects the first inflection point on the acceleration of 5G demand. We expect our third fiscal quarter performance to be in line with our second fiscal quarter, consistent with historical trends in our QCT business. We expect the next inflection point with the launch of additional 5G flagship handsets to be in the fourth quarter and extend into fiscal 2021.","In conclusion, we remain confident in the long-term growth opportunities we outlined at our Analyst Day, including 5G adoption, RF front-end content capture and expansion of our technology into adjacent platforms.","Thank you and I will now turn the call back to Mauricio.","Mauricio Lopez-Hodoyan","Thank you, Akash. Operator, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Samik Chatterjee","So if I can just start off on the guidance itself and you mentioned kind of the seasonal decline in some unit shipments. So just wondering if you can walk us through the kind of sequential move from the 155 million unit shipments you had this quarter to the new range of $125 million to $145 million. How much of that is seasonality and what are you really factoring in terms of the kind of budgeting for the virus impact? And what you're hearing from OEMs in terms of delays that might be impacting that range that you're guiding to?","Akash Palkhiwala","Samik, this is Akash. So if you take the midpoint of our guidance range and look at the sequential decline, it's approximately a 13% decline. And if you consider the seasonality in previous years, we've seen a decline of 16% to 22%. So it's largely consistent with the sequential decline we have seen in the past. So that's kind of your question on seasonality. This also -- our forecast also reflects the demand that we currently have from our OEM partners. And so that's -- it's also consistent with the demand we're seeing at this point.","Samik Chatterjee","Okay. And then if I can just follow-up on the ASP ramp here. So if you take the guidance that you have, the average ASP seems to ramp up sequentially from $23 on the MSM unit to $31. I'm just wondering if you -- that's already a 23% sequential increase, if you're doing the math right. Just wondering if you can share your thoughts about what that ASP ramp looks like because it sounded like you're expecting more RF content to come through later half of the year?","Akash Palkhiwala","Yes. Samik, yes, you're doing the math right, it's consistent with our view. Really, there are 3 drivers to the ASP increase. First is our normal sequential increase because of the benefit of the mix improved. What happens is we launched our new premium tier and high tier chip during this time frame and new devices are launched with it. And so you see a mix shift to premium and high tiers, which benefits us. So that's the first driver.","The second driver is with 5G coming in, the transition from 4G to 5G, it gives us an opportunity to increase the content in the core chipset before RF front end. And so you have incremental monetization from that. And then finally, RF front-end also impacting that because we have, as we've talked about, we have a very strong design win pipeline, not just on the core chipset, but on RF front end as well. And now that is being reflected in our guidance.","I'd also note that in my script, I went through -- I provided a data point on RF front-end revenue growth. So we're seeing 50% -- greater than 50% revenue growth in RF front end both on a sequential basis, so first quarter to second quarter, and a year-over-year basis. So it's our design win pipeline going up and the revenue and the forecast now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity.","Mike Walkley","Great. Yes, just building on some of those questions. I guess, first, maybe for Cristiano. Can you update us on the competitive environment for 5G, particularly on the Android side? How do you see 5G ramps potential Qualcomm share improving over the course of the year? And with the x55 coming, how should that also maybe impact share and ASP trends?","Cristiano Amon","Mike, thanks for the question. So there's a lot there. Let me just talk a little bit about the ramp and the impact on the new chipset. So we said in our script that the number of designs on 5Gs are now 275. 2\/3 of that design pipeline now is on our second-generation chipset. So we continue to see traction especially as we go from our first 5G product or second product that is increasing. And in that traction, we continue to see the trend of high RF front end attached on Snapdragon.","Competition, we expect to have competition since the very beginning. This is a very competitive market. However, we're not seeing anything on competition different than what we expected in our planning assumptions. So we expect QCT share to remain strong. We have made assumptions on -- throughout the year, that it is consistent to what we have seen in the market, and there's nothing new there.","Mike Walkley","Great. And just a follow-up for clarification with the ramp laid out in the guidance on Q4, is that also an ASP ramp coming again on better 5G mix? Or is it more towards a unit ramp? Obviously, new customer, Apple coming back into the model and just more seasonal trends, can you help us think about what kind of ramp on those 2 metrics? That would be great.","Cristiano Amon","Yes. So on the ASP side, the way we think about ASP is a factor of -- a combination of a couple of factors. One is just as we go from 4G to 5G, we've talked about how we expect the revenue opportunity for us to expand by 1.5x between the core chipset and the RF front end. But then also, as we go across the tiers, down the tiers, starting with the premium and high tier, but then eventually going into mid-tier later in the year as well with 5G, the combination of those factors will inform the average revenue per MSM.","And then for later flagship launches that happened in the fall time frame. Again, it will -- kind of the same 1.5x rule should apply as we go from 4G to 5G, and it's really a question of how the mix plays out across the tiers and the OEMs that drives the weighted average ASP.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Caso with Raymond James.","Chris Caso","Just first question is just a clarification of what you guided to for the third fiscal quarter. And you said the performance to be in line with the second fiscal quarter. Just give some more color around that, is that with regard to QCT, QTL together? Is that simply referring to revenue? Is that a margin assumption as well?","Akash Palkhiwala","Yes. So I mean, the way we think about the year, Chris, it's kind of playing out largely as we had expected. In the last call, we outlined that we saw a couple of inflection points through the year, kind of both in the first half of the year and then in the fourth quarter. And our view kind of hasn't changed. We've seen a little bit of an acceleration in 5G deployment which shows up in our results for the quarter and the guidance. And beyond that, as you go from second quarter to third quarter, it just plays to the normal seasonality of our businesses.","Chris Caso","All right. And with regard to QCT now. Just a couple of questions there. With regard to the MSM guidance for the March quarter. Of the 135 million midpoint units, how many of those are 5G now? Can you give us some sense of how, I guess, the 5G penetration into the product line right now and then following from that, with the big jump that you've had in ASPs for all the reasons that you mentioned.","Is that something we should expect to be sustainable through the year? Perhaps, does it get better as 5G attach rates increase? Is there perhaps some natural ASP declines as products mature? Could you give us some sense of how that progresses through the year?","Akash Palkhiwala","Yes. So Chris, this is Akash. We're not breaking down our 5G units at this point as a percent of our total MSM units. But the way to think about that number is really look at new handset launches. That launches that will happen in the quarter and over the next 6 months. And those where we expect primarily to be, at the premium and the high tier, mostly be 5G launches. And so the volume driven by those launches would be 5G.","Cristiano Amon","Chris, this is Cristiano, just to add a data point maybe it will help to get to the answer. If you look at markets such as United States, I think the device requirements where they move on some of all the flagships and the high tier products, they are 5G products today. But the China one is an interesting one we said in the script, which is 5G sell-in penetration reached 19% the month of December. And some of the price points already can address about 40% of the total China market based on the price points we see in the market. So all of this is good indicator about the 5G transition.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.","Stacy Rasgon","I was wondering if -- I want to ask the coronavirus question a little more explicitly. What was your QCT MSM guide be for Q2 if you weren't baking in any coronavirus?","Akash Palkhiwala","So Stacy, what we are factoring into our guidance is really looking at the demand that we have from the customers and the information we have from them. When you look at -- on the MSM side, when you look at the overall EPS guidance, as you're aware, we typically guide a $0.10 range. And what we did to include the impact of the viruses to reduce the bottom end of the range by $0.05 to reflect the information we have at this point. But it's really something that we're going to continue to monitor as we go forward.","Stacy Rasgon","Got it. For my follow-up, I want to ask about QCT pricing and margins into Q2. So you're guiding revenue per MSM up 33%, give or take, sequentially. And I get that. Why are you guiding chipset margins only up a few points, like 3 points. Like, what are the gross margins of these 5G parts look like? Is there like a headwind there? Or is there something else that's going on with the remainder of like 4G pricing as that flushes out? I guess, I would have expected more margin upside given that share of magnitude of ASP upside? What's going on there?","Akash Palkhiwala","Yes, Stacy, it's Akash again. I think the numbers we gave out are actually very consistent with what we had outlined at previous earnings release. We had indicated a mid-teens growth in revenue and a mid-teens margin profile. And we're guiding 15% to 17%. ","I mean, as you know well, it's a combination of this total units, the pricing environment and then -- and the profitability around it. And it's very consistent with our expectations.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore","I wanted to stick on the theme of the revenue per MSM side, but maybe take a slightly different spin to it. You guys always do a great job of explaining in detail what the revenue per MSM assumptions are and then you tie it together to the EBT margins. But I wanted to see just conceptually going forward, if the AP side or the revenue per MSM is the most powerful driver of the business, is that accretive to the gross margin side?","And I guess, somewhat similar to Stacy's question, is there something detrimental to the gross margin side that's capping how much the operating margin would otherwise go up? Because I would think the ASPs or the content going up that much would be a very accretive outcome for you?","Akash Palkhiwala","Ross, so it's a combination of a couple of things. I think as we see more percent of our devices move to 5G, we're going to see a benefit not just on the revenue per MSM, but also in the operating margin. The second is we're going across tiers. And so as we go across tiers and we have a second inflection point, that will further expand the scale of the 5G opportunity for us.","As we outlined at the Analyst Day, we definitely expect to realize the operating leverage from the investment in 5G. And so as we go forward, we'll continue to see, as we had -- especially as we hit the second inflection point later in the year, expansion in our operating margins.","Ross Seymore","I guess as my 1 follow-up, moving over to the QTL side of things. I think Steve said earlier that you had 10 new licensees or 85 versus the 75 before. Does that do anything to change things in the QTL revenue outlook to some sort of above seasonal trends, whether it be in the March quarter or beyond as you're getting more people to pay for you with those -- the new 5G licenses?","Akash Palkhiwala","Yes. So the way we think about we planned QTL from a 5G perspective, is we've assumed that the market kind of stays at its current structure. And any 5G benefit that comes either from higher replacement rates and more devices as a result of that. Or it comes through an improved ASP, especially at the mid and the low tiers, that would be incremental to our forecast. I mean, clearly, as we go and sign the remaining licensees on 5G and go through our entire licensing base to convert the 2 5G licenses, that's something that's very important to us and critical to us as the transition to 5G happens.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Ramsay with Cowen.","Matt Ramsay","Yes. Thank you very much. I guess, I wanted to ask a little bit about -- I know I caution in the commentary in the guidance, you talked about the normal seasonality from December to March of 13% on units. But if you look back on a year-over-year basis in both of those quarters, the total numbers are down fairly substantially. And with 5G ramping, I wonder if the team could give a little bit of update on the 4G business that you have and the market share shifts that may or may not be happening? Or is this just all a market volume story?","Akash Palkhiwala","Yes. Matt, it's a combination of a couple of things. In these quarters last year, a year ago, we had a higher volume at Apple since we were in the previous models and still shipping volume to them, which is one reason for the decline. And then second is Huawei. While in the scheme of things, they're a small customer for us, they were a small customer for us, we still had material volume with them. And so when you adjust for those, the delta to what you would expect is extremely small and it just reflects the general market environment.","Matt Ramsay","Got it. And as my follow-up, I don't know if this is for Christian or Steve. It's sort of an interesting juxtaposition that one of the big drivers of growth at your company is 5G RF content. At the same time, one of the big players in RF is deeming that business as noncore. Maybe you could just share your reactions to that news if do you think is a result of your business or a future opportunity for your business? And just how you've seen the customer base react? That would be really helpful.","Steve Mollenkopf","Sure. This is Steve. I would say, obviously, it's not a surprise to us. We've been building this for some time and working really to get this opportunity into the business. The growth of opportunity on the RF side for us due to 5G, I think, is a good story, a good continuing story. We're happy to see it grow across tiers. I think there's still an opportunity for other players. There's obviously an opportunity on the 4G side.","In terms of competitive dynamic or what we're seeing from the customers, we're definitely seeing the customers resonate with the system solution. There are some features that we can add, that we've been investing in, that I think people are finding valuable. But we're happy to see it flow into our business. We've been talking about it for some time, and it's great to see it actually in the results and in the guide.","Cristiano Amon","Matt, this is Cristiano. I'll just add one thing real quick. Look, for us, the way to think about it, this is going to become part of our core business. And that's what you see reflected in the revenue per MSM. We expect that uplift that we've seen on 5G and RF to continue going forward, especially as we go down the tiers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs.","Rod Hall","I wanted to start with channel inventory. And kind of -- I know you don't generally like to comment on it. But as we exit March, given what's going on with demand in China, do you have an expectation that handset channel inventory there will be higher than normal as we exit March? And just kind of what you think the flow of inventory might look like over the course of a couple of quarters here.","And then I also wanted to kind of come back to the competitive environment on 5G and ask you, how important share is to you in that environment? And maybe, Steve, you could comment on what you would see as advantages to having higher market share? Obviously, there are cost advantages and so on. But there are other strategic advantages we might not be thinking about that are important to you.","Akash Palkhiwala","Rob, from a channel inventory perspective, I mean, obviously, given how we are closely following the situation in China, but this is something that we need to continue to monitor. The key driver for us is 5G and 5G launches. And so in terms of inventory on 5G, we're really at the front end. And we have increasing demand from our OEM base. And really, the challenge for us is how do we keep up with increasing demand, because it's an incredible opportunity for us to grow.","Steve Mollenkopf","Yes, I think on share. I think -- this is Steve. I think on share, we're not seeing anything that we didn't anticipate. We benefit, I think, a bit from a bit more geographical capability. We sell into handsets that sell into more markets. They tend to be better units for us and they give us not only scale kind of from the normal scale perspective, but also, I would say, feature and diversity scale from things. If we have an issue, a supply chain issue in the -- or demand issue in China, we tend to have the ability to have other regions to back it up.","So we tend to look at the business in terms of our planning. We want to make sure that we maintain that strength across different markets. And I think that's going to serve us well.","Operator","Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore.","C.J. Muse","Just a follow-up question on the corona, earlier question to Akash, just trying to get this right, have you tempered the midpoint of your guide either on royalties or chipsets or you're just reflecting a wider EPS range?","Akash Palkhiwala","Yes, C.J., you should think of it as a wider EPS range. I mean, it's clearly something that we wanted to factor in our guidance. So what we did is we kind of held our normal guide but moved the lower end by $0.05.","Cristiano Amon","Okay, helpful. As my follow-up, you're guiding revenues up roughly 5%, OpEx up 5% to 7%. So I guess, can you walk through what's driving the greater spending on the OpEx side? And how we should think about operating leverage as we proceed through calendar '20 and beyond?","Akash Palkhiwala","Yes. So maybe two points to it. First is on the OpEx side, the increase is being driven by normal calendar year resets for employee expenses. And so it's really -- that's the primary driver.","As you think about the full year, we are -- we have given guidance before where we expect it to be -- expect to be at the exit rate for '19 plus some small incremental on top of it. And so we're still sticking with that. I think if we execute to that and we have the growth on the revenue side, it will allow us to expand our margins and realize operating leverage.","Operator","Our next question is from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.","Timothy Arcuri","There's a lot of questions on MSM ASPs. But obviously, RF front-end really is the big piece of the story. But I guess, we don't really have any benchmarks in terms of what your revenue is there. And I guess, in early 2018, I think you said that you thought that fiscal '19 revenue would be roughly $2 billion to $3 billion for RF front end.","And it sounds like, in prior calls, you sort of hinted that you didn't get there. But I guess, just because it's such a big piece of the story. Can you sort of anchor it for us, where are you right now? How much revenue maybe in fiscal '19, did you do for RF front end. If you're doing so well, I would think you want to give us some numbers there?","Akash Palkhiwala","Yes, Tim, this is Akash. At this point, we're not giving a breakdown of our RF front-end revenue base. I mean, you have data points from a while ago. And kind of the market has changed since then. And we've kind of grown our business through the RF 360 transaction and just the incredible opportunity to grow RF front end on top of 5G. So we're excited about where it takes us, and we'll look for opportunities as we go forward to provide more data to you. But at this point, we're not providing any additional information.","Timothy Arcuri","Okay. Okay. Okay. I guess then, I had a question on expenses in QTL. And it looks like they bottomed in the mid $300 million range back in September. But based on the guidance, they're sort of ramping back up by about $40 million per quarter. Is all of that legal expense related to the appeal? And sort of how do you think about the trajectory of margins in QTL and particularly the OpEx ramp through the year in that business?","Akash Palkhiwala","Yes. So for QTL, if the way to think about the OpEx and the business going forward is really look at the first quarter actuals and use that as the basis for the expense going forward. I mean, it's -- at this point, we're not necessarily looking to scale expenses and litigation we see it as largely steady state. You will see some normal increases and declines. But it's really kind of flat OpEx. And then based on how the revenue shape changes through the year, that will -- that is how the margin will get impacted.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko Securities.","Srini Pajjuri","A couple of questions. Akash, on the gross margin, obviously, a lot of questions there. My question is, my model, I think I'm getting close to flattish gross margin with almost 40% ASP increase here. My question is, I know you're ramping 5G and I'm suspecting most of the 5G initially is high tier. As we go through the year and as you ramp more mid and low-tier, is there a risk that gross margins could actually decline? Or are you comfortable saying that gross margins can at least remain at these levels?","Akash Palkhiwala","Yes. Srini, we're not giving guidance on gross margins. But really, from an operating margin perspective, the way we think about leverage is really as we transition from 4G to 5G, we should be able to hold or improve our structure. And then with OpEx guidance that we've previously provided, the combination of those factors should allow us to meet our long-term operating margin guidance.","Srini Pajjuri","Got it. And then maybe for Cristiano. Cristiano, on the RF, you said vast majority of the modem design wins are using your RF solutions. Any way to give us an idea as to what percent of the mix is using millimeter wave? And where do you see that going by the end of the year?","Cristiano Amon","Thanks for the question. Right now, we see millimeter wave as a requirement for at least the majority of the United States operators in this year, we are working towards the millimeter wave launch of Japan and Korea. So we expect that to start to be a requirement on devices as well. And we have an optimistic view that by 2021 we're going to start to see that going into other geographies such as China and Europe. So 2020 is a United States, Japan and Korea story.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Mollenkopf, do you have anything further to add before turning the call?","Steve Mollenkopf","Yes. So just number one, thanks to the employees of Qualcomm for driving 5G, as I know you spent a lot, a lot going on in the last year. I appreciate all that hard work. It's great to see the results flow through into the financials. We look forward to continuing that and talk to everybody next call.

We are pleased to report another very strong quarter, with record revenues and earnings per share, driven by broad-based demand for our 3G and multimode 3G\/4G chipsets. In QCT, we shipped a record 225 million MSM chipsets, well ahead of expectations, driven primarily by strength in emerging regions.","We continue to benefit from our tiered roadmap and diversified customer base, as revenues in MSM chip shipments were up 17% and 31% year-over-year respectively. Total 3G\/4G device demand in the March quarter, was stronger than our expectations. However, QTL total reported device sales and revenues were down from our prior guidance expectations, as a result of a dispute with the licensee. Under reporting by certain licensees, in China, and sales of certain unlicensed devices in China. Derek will discuss this more fully, including the actions we are taking to address this situation. We will also give a brief update on the ongoing NDRC investigation.","We began the year with several key objectives; first, we set out to compete effectively across all tiers in the LTE rollout in China, while driving the modem and AP roadmap to maintain our competitive lead. Second, we have developed plans to focus our investments on adjacent opportunities, that adopt our core technologies, as well as technologies that address the 1000X data challenge, and drive IOE adoption.","Third, we set challenging OpEx targets to achieve greater operating leverage from our scale, and finally, we committed to materially increase our return of capital. As I will explain further, I am very pleased with our results to date on all of these elements.","I will begin with the operational front, where we are executing against our initiatives to drive productivity. We remain committed to exiting our fiscal year at an overall operating expense run rate lower than our exit from last year. Our team is executing to this, while making critical investments in our roadmap and supply chain initiatives. We also continue to make progress on our efforts to focus our new business initiatives across the company.","As part of that effort, we are accelerating our transition from the current generation Mirasol display technology to the licensing of the next generation, with a focus on wearable devices. However, we will continue to make and sell the current generation Mirasol displays, to support certain existing customer requirements.","As a result of this new plan, we expect a significantly lower spend in our QMT division in fiscal 2015, providing an expected annualized savings of more than $125 million. The actions related to these changes resulted in an impairment to the QMT business this quarter, which George will cover in more detail.","Adding to our portfolio of important technologies, we recently completed a few noteworthy acquisitions. First, we acquired Velocity, a leader in the development of 60-GHZ chipsets based on the IEEE, 802.11ad standard, also known as WiGig. We have been working closely with this team for many years, and see this technology as important to the new high bandwidth used cases we expect.","The Black Sand acquisition supplements our RF team, and expands our RF 360 roadmap. And finally, we acquired leading digital still camera technology from CSR, which further enhances our differentiation in the important area of image processing.","On the product front, the first device based on our Snapdragon 805 and fourth generation multimode 3G\/4G modem was launched. The Samsung Galaxy S5 broadband LTE-A. The Snapdragon 805 processor is the first mobile processor to offer system level Ultra HD support, 4K video capture and playback and when coupled with our industry-leading Gobi modems, enables users to stream and watch 4K content over LTE.","The fourth generation Qualcomm Gobi 9x35, is the first 3G LTE modem to commercially ship in smartphones, that's the port's global carrier aggregation deployment, up to 40-MHZ with both LTE TDD and FDD Category 6.","QCT has seen very strong design traction across its peers, with the emerging China customers. It is worth nothing that our success to-date in China is based on chipsets that were launched last year, and we are on track this quarter to commercialize our new low cost architecture with our Snapdragon 410. We believe the launch of the Snapdragon 410 and our follow-on LTE chipsets, raised the competitive benchmark and improve product costs.","With our Wi-Fi and RF360 solutions, we continue to pursue growing our share of content in devices. Both product lines continue to ramp, with our overall Wi-Fi unit volumes on track to grow more than 40% this fiscal year, as our attach rate in mobile continues to grow significantly. We now have over 100 devices launched or in design incorporating RF360, including the first launch of the device to feature the Envelope tracker, antenna tuner and power amplifier.","Looking forward, the continued roll-out and growth of multimode 3G LTE has a significant opportunity for the company. According to the GSA, 300 operators have deployed LTE and more than 200 more have committed to deploy LTE. In addition, over 55 operators have or are planning to deploy LTE Advanced services, including carrier aggregation.","We are now positioned to help enable this opportunity with our LTE Leadership position, including chipsets across multiple product tiers, and we expect to launch the Snapdragon 810, the world's first premium tier integrated SoC with Category 6 for smartphones, later this calendar year. To-date, over 2,000 multimode 3G LTE devices have now either been launched or are in design, based on our chipset solutions. The LTE feature set continues to evolve, with features such as LTE Broadcast and LTE Direct. LTE Broadcast has been commercialized in Korea, and has been demonstrated in the U.S., Europe and Australia. We have also announced an LTE Direct trial in Germany, in collaboration with Deutsche Telekom.","Although still early in the adoption cycle, opportunities in the automotive, healthcare and wearable segments are taking shape. Our automobile pipeline continues to add OEMs and design wins. Our leadership in LTE is an advantage in this segment, as it moves from 3G to multimode LTE and this quarter, we saw General Motors launch OnStar LTE. In addition, new Android Wear devices were recently announced and Snapdragon 400 is enabling devices offered by Samsung and LG.","Adjacent opportunities allow us to build off our core investments into new growth segments. We expect to see an increasing impact of this over time.","In closing, we are making substantial progress on the key objectives we set for the company. We delivered a record quarter, and see significant opportunities ahead. Our portfolio of multimode 3G LTE chipsets has strong design traction, which positions us well, and we are working hard to address the near term challenges in our licensing business.","That concludes my remarks, and I will now turn the call over to Qualcomm's President, Derek Aberle.","Derek Aberle","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone. We continue to see healthy end user device demand, spurred by among other things, the transition to 3G LTE in China. In fact, we now believe 3G\/4G device demand, excluding TD-SCDMA GSM devices for calendar 2014, will be at the high end of the 1.22 billion to 1.3 billion device range that we provided last quarter, reflecting strength in both developed and emerging regions.","Turning to China, China Mobile has launched LTE service in over 300 cities, with over 300 LTE device models, and has seen increased data usage in ARPU from its LTE subscribers. In addition, LTE FDD trial licenses have been granted to both China Unicom and China Telecom. Both operators are launching hybrid LTE TDD and FDD trial networks in 16 cities. We expect those trials to expand to additional cities throughout the year. We are working closely with the operators to help them optimize their networks, and our chipset solutions, which support both the TDD and FDD modes of LTE, provide the mode, band and hand-off combinations they require for their 3G and LTE networks.","As Steve mentioned, we continue to have strong LTE chipset design momentum with manufacturers in China, and we are seeing significant demand for our multimode 3G LTE chipsets.","Here in the U.S., we have also seen positive trends as a result of competition amongst the carriers. In addition, promotions tied into the World Cup have shown success in Latin America, and we have seen positive 2G to 3G migration trends in Southeast Asia as well.","Despite this healthy 3G\/4G device demand environment, we have reduced our financial outlook for QTL for this fiscal year, to reflect some challenges in China, that could prevent us from collecting royalties in the near term on the full 3G\/4G device demand.","First, we have a dispute with the licensee that has resulted in a portion of that licensee shipment activity being excluded from our fiscal third quarter results and fiscal fourth quarter outlook. Like other disputes we have had in the past, we expect to resolve this situation and are in active discussions with this licensee. However, the timing of a potential resolution is uncertain.","Second, as we have previously said, the timing of the LTE launches in China, as well as device composition at China Mobile, has been a bit difficult to forecast. Although, we have signed more than 70 single mode LTE license with Chinese OEMs, we still need to sign agreements with a number of other Chinese OEMs, in order to be able to collect royalties on all three mode devices in China.","Given the time it will take to complete the remaining single mode LTE licenses in China, we expect to experience a delay in the timing of our collection of royalties on these devices.","Third, we recently have seen an increase in sales of lower tier 3G connected tablets by a number of Chinese OEMs, and we expect sales of these devices to continue to grow. This is a positive sign for 3G\/4G attach rates and tablets, but the tablet OEMs are largely not the same companies that have been supplying the handsets in China, and therefore in most cases, are not currently licensed. We are in the process of negotiating licenses with this new base of potential licensees, but those discussions will take some time to complete.","Fourth, we believe that some of our Chinese licensees are under reporting, and may continue to under report a portion of their 3G\/4G device sales. As we have explained in the past, we have robust and active compliance programs in priority for the business going forward. We are taking steps to confirm the underreporting and to work with the licensees to resolve the issues.","In summary, primarily, as a result of these four items, a revised QTL fiscal year outlook reflects a reduction of approximately 8% in total reported device sales for the second half of fiscal 2014. The timing of the resolution of these items is uncertain, and we will update you on our progress next quarter.","For the calendar year 2014, 3G\/4G device forecast, we now expect that total unit demand will be at the high end of our prior unit estimate, for approximately 1.3 billion devices. However, we currently expect that QTL will not participate near term in the full device demand, based on the four items we just explained.","We now expect that between 1.04 billion and 1.13 billion 3G\/4G devices will be reported to us for sales during calendar 2014. We estimate the impact from these four items on total reported device sales on a percentage basis to be between 6% and 9% for calendar year 2014. The percentage reduction in units is greater than in total reported device sales, because the units are expected to be lower priced devices.","Although we have these near term challenges, we continue to expect to collect royalties on all LTE devices globally, including three mode devices sold in China, and have executed more than 110 single mode LTE licenses, in addition to our more than 260 3G licenses, which cover multimode 3G\/4G devices.","We have had disputes in the past, and have a good track record of successfully resolving those disputes. It is also not uncommon for a licensor to experience some delays in collecting royalties, while they negotiate license agreements covering new entrants or new products.","Finally, we are closely monitoring and in discussions with companies that we believe are underreporting or operating without a license, consistent with our longstanding compliance activities around the world.","Let me now move on to discuss the status of the investigation in China. As previously disclosed, the China National Development and Reform Commission or the NDRC, is conducting an anti-monopoly investigation of certain aspects of the company's business, primarily the company's licensing business and certain interactions between the company's licensing business and our chipset business. We have met with and are continuing to fully cooperate with the NDRC, as it conducts its investigation, but the timing and outcome of any resolution remains uncertain, as does the impact on our future business in China.","That concludes my comments, and I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, George Davis.","George Davis","Thank you, Derek and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to be reporting strong operating and financial results this quarter, primarily driven by record QCT performance.","Fiscal third quarter revenues were a record $6.8 billion, up 9% year-over-year, and 7% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating income of $2.43 billion was up 19% year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.44 was up 40% year-over-year and up 10% quarter-over-quarter. Overall, non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.24 above the midpoint of our guidance range.","Our results included a $164 million charge or $0.08 per share related to the transition of our Mirasol business, as well as a $208 million gain or $0.12 per share for reversal of expenses, related to the favorable ruling in the ParkerVision litigation.","Excluding these two items, non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $1.40, $0.20 above the midpoint of our prior guidance range. In QTL, total reported device sales by our licensees were $58.1 billion, and we estimate that 250 million to 254 million 3G\/4G based devices were reported by our licensees for the March quarter at an average selling price of $228 to $234, up approximately $7 sequentially at the midpoint.","QTL's ASP in the fiscal third quarter reflected strength in mid to high tier devices, as well as the absence of lower ASP devices associated with the licensing challenges, summarized by Derek.","In QCT, revenues, earnings before tax and MSM shipments were all quarterly records, as demands strongly exceeded our prior expectations. QCT shipped 225 million MSMs, 12 million units above the high end of our prior guidance range, primarily driven by shipments to Chinese manufacturers for 3G and 3G LTE devices. Implied revenue per MSM was approximately $22, slightly lower sequentially on the mix of demand.","QCT operating margin was 23%, also above our prior expectations, reflecting the stronger than expected MSM demand, as well as some favorable impact as a result of the ParkerVision ruling.","Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses grew 7% sequentially, in line with our prior expectations. Investment income was strong this quarter, adding $0.06 in EPS relative to our prior guidance. Strength in the financial markets, and changes in asset allocation to lower long term risk in certain of our investment portfolios drove this contribution. Looking ahead, we forecast fiscal fourth quarter investment income to be in the range of $200 million to $250 million, which is down sequentially on lower realized gains.","Cash flow from operations was strong at 39% of revenues, and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $32.7 billion. During the quarter, we returned almost $2.1 billion to stockholders, including approximately $700 million in dividends and $1.35 billion in stock repurchases. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $6.5 billion remaining on our buyback authorization.","Our non-GAAP tax rate was 13% and lower than expected on business mix and the effects of the ParkerVision reversal.","Now, turning to our guidance; we are updating our financial forecast for fiscal 2014 to reflect our fiscal third quarter results, and increased outlook for QCT, partially offset by our lower estimates for QTL. We estimate fiscal 2014 revenues to be in the range of approximately $26.3 billion to $27.2 billion, up approximately 8% year-over-year and unchanged at the midpoint from our prior guidance.","We expect fiscal 2014 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $5.21 to $5.36, up approximately 17% year-over-year at the midpoint, and up $0.14 per share from our previous guidance midpoint on the strength of our fiscal third quarter.","We are increasing our estimate for the reported fiscal 2014 QTL average selling price to approximately $222 to $228, which is $2 above our prior $223 estimate at the midpoint, again reflecting the absence of the mixed impact of underreported and disputed devices.","We expect combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to grow approximately 5% to 6% year-over-year, and as Steve indicated, we are still on track to exit the fiscal year below the run rate at the end of the last fiscal year.","Turning to the fourth fiscal quarter, we estimate our revenues to be in the range of approximately $6.5 billion to $7.4 billion, up approximately 7% year-over-year at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share in our fourth fiscal quarter to be approximately $1.20 to $1.35 per share, up approximately 21% year-over-year at the midpoint. We anticipate fourth fiscal quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be between 2% lower and flat sequentially.","In QTL, we forecast total reported device sales of $53 billion to $59 billion, down approximately 4% sequentially at the midpoint, reflecting the uncertain timing of potential resolution of the licensing matters.","In QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 230 million to 245 million units during the September quarter, reflecting continued strong demand across all tiers, with particular strength in low and mid-tier chipsets for Chinese OEMs.","We expect QCT operating margin to exit the fiscal year above 20% as previously forecasted, as a result of solid execution on spending and supply chain initiatives.","We continue to expect 3G\/4G channel inventory to remain within the normal 11 to 16 week range through this calendar year, with China related inventory increasing on LTE channel fill.","That concludes my comments, and I will now turn the call back to Warren.","Warren Kneeshaw","Thank you, George. Operator, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead with your question.","Mike Walkley - Canaccord Genuity","Great, thank you. Derek, just going back, as you take the midpoint of the units now excluded, roughly 215 million units, can you help us maybe break it down between the four reasons you gave excluding those units, and the one licensee dispute, is that a meaningful piece of that 215 million excluded now from your outlook?","Derek Aberle","Sure Mike. Yeah, it\u2019s a little bit hard. We have a pretty wide range on the units, because of the uncertainty of the timing of the resolution, and they are all kind of different in kind. But the licensee dispute is a meaningful contributor to that number during this timeframe, and of course, if that particular licensee were to gain more share or lose share, that can impact the estimate that we have at this time. But they are all meaningful contributors to the numbers that we put out for the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Tim Long - BMO Capital Markets","Thank you. If I could just follow-up on the China piece here; maybe, if you could talk to us a little bit about the complexion of some of these customers and what Qualcomm could do to some of them to sell outside of China, where you might have a little bit more leverage. Are they chipset customers, where maybe you also have some leverage on the supply side? And then related to that, do you -- are you concerned about the spreading maybe to some of the other Chinese, and also there has been some stories about some Google initiatives in China with a few handset companies that are not Qualcomm licensees. So maybe can you just talk a little bit about this as potentially being a broader issue than just these OEMs in China? Thank you.","Derek Aberle","Sure Tim, this is Derek. Yeah again, there are kind of multiple factors here, so let me try to break them down. On the dispute, I think that's something that we have had -- we have had several of these in the past, as you know, over the years, and our typical process is to try to engage with the licensee and see if we can resolve it through negotiation, which we usually are pretty successful at. And when that doesn't work, things need to take a different course, and even in that route, we have, I think, had a history of pretty successful results there.","On the other OEM; so it's really a mixed bag. In the white box or the lower end tablet space, it's really a set of -- kind of a new set of suppliers, that at least today are I think primarily focused in China, and then maybe some of the other emerging regions. And much like the mid to smaller sized companies in China in the past, we have had a lot of success in getting those companies to sign licenses over time. It's really just a timing question, I think, in my mind, because we are kind of at the outset of this growth in a new segment and its new supplier, so it's going to take some time to get those licenses in place.","The same is really true for the three mode volume. I think its, from our perspective, more of a timing question, in terms of getting the remaining licenses in place. And then around the underreporting, it is -- again, we are at the pretty early stages of trying to confirm sort of the extent of this, and engage directly with the OEMs in China. But our typical process is, we will uncover something and then we will work with the licensee through the compliance and also an audit process which takes some time, to try to get, what we believe, is a compliance situation. And when that doesn't work, obviously, we have different mechanisms we can pursue under the agreements themselves.","So I think, you know again, I think we have a number of avenues available to us, which have proven successful in the past, and we just have, with a little bit of more uncertainty right now in China, we have a period where we need to push these things and its going to take a little time.","In terms of things spreading, I am actually -- my sense is that the units that are supplied even into the local brands in India, are really supplied primarily today out of China, and so it would be sort of the similar set of suppliers as we have discussions with for supply in China and the other emerging regions. Its not a -- in other words, it's not a new set of suppliers cropping up in India, that aren't supplied elsewhere from the licensee base.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank","Yeah guys. So it\u2019s a little bit of math. So we are talking 215 million units for the year, that are, potentially, you are dealing with this licensing collection issue, approximately?","Derek Aberle","Approximately, that's the midpoint of the range that we gave. Brian, from a TRDS standpoint though, the range is more like 6% to 9%, so it's about half the percentage effect that the units would imply.","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank","Okay. and then if you're -- if these are lower end products, you are probably looking at royalties, on ASP of say $100 or maybe even lower depending on what the product is, is that correct?","Derek Aberle","I mean these are lower -- yeah, these are lower priced devices that we believe are kind of in this bucket, generally.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Kulbinder Garcha - Credit Suisse","Question for Derek again, not surprisingly today Derek. I guess I am trying to understand how this whole thing came about? What I am getting at is that, you mentioned the whole thing about connected tablets taking off, were you previously assuming your guidance, you would license them, and now you can't. I am surprised you have even included that, I guess is my point, and then the additional thing I was just thinking is, in terms of the -- same thing applies to new licensees you were targeting but you weren't able to close them. I am surprised that caused you to revise your estimates down, so that would be an incremental upside, if it ever occurred? And so what I am getting at, is it just the people -- is the main driver this major licensee that's not paying you now, and the underreporting generically by everyone? Because that $200 million on the Chinese market is a really big number on that market frankly; and so I am trying to understand, how this kind of came about, and why it suddenly hit you now, or was it warning indicator [ph] for the last six months about this? Any kind of context around that would be helpful.","Derek Aberle","Okay. Kulbinder, this is Derek. Let me try to break that down a little bit. So first of all, the 215 million is the midpoint of, as I said, a relatively wide range, and the reason we gave a relatively wide range is just because of the number of factors involved and the uncertainty around the timing of each one of those potential resolutions. The dispute that we have with the licensee, as I said, is a significant contributor to these units. If not all of their units, we have a dispute around some of them, and frankly, I don't think it\u2019s a question of whether they are going to end up paying royalties, it's just a question of the timing of trying to resolve it, and what that resolution will look like.","On the white box tablets, we have been monitoring that, and we have been in discussions with a number of those companies. Frankly, just the acceleration of the growth that we expect to see over this period is faster now than we expected a few months ago, or even before that. And that is a contributor, but I am not going to suggest if that's the largest contributor of the units, it's just a piece of it.","On the underreporting, again, if you think back to calendar 2013 as we have been monitoring this, and I know you have asked questions about this periodically. You know, we have been really on top of the compliance aspects in China. And really, the first time we are really seeing a meaningful impact of this is in the current quarter that we are reporting, and it's really a relatively recent phenomena. And part of it is really just trying to understand where this will go in terms of a trend, and we have provided a relatively wide range on that for that reason. Again, the typical process is, when we notice things that look suspicious, we will engage with the licensees quickly, and then usually move to an audit process, which takes some time to get the data and then work through the issues. But once we get through that process, we are able to typically get a resolution.","So again, I think there is just a number of factors that came together at the same time. Obviously, we are also seeing a ramp in the LTE volumes, from China Mobile, which is a good market phenomena. But given some of the uncertainty there right now and the discussions around the LTE licenses, although they have been ongoing and we have been progressing and increasing the numbers, has been a little slower than we had anticipated. So it's taking longer now to get to some of these agreements. And so we believe we will get there, it's just a question of timing, and it's uncertain in terms of when that will be.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs","Hi, thank you. I just wanted to see if you can give us a little bit of color Derek, on -- of the 70 licensees that you have in China, what percent of the total volumes in China do those cover? And then is there a distinction in terms of your collection of Chinese-made devices that are sold in China, versus those that are sold overseas?","Derek Aberle","Yeah, its really hard for us to pinpoint a -- or give a range even for the percentage of the units that will be supplied over the calendar year, where we are giving these projections from the licensee base, that are currently licensed for LTE. There are significant companies in the group of companies that have signed licenses for three mode devices in LTE generally. But there are a number of other meaningful suppliers in China that haven't yet signed up, which is why you are seeing the impact -- and those negotiations are continuing, and I suspect will get concluded, its just a question of when they will be concluded.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ehud Gelblum with Citi. Please go ahead with your question.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup","Hey guys, thanks. I appreciate it. Sorry about that, I was messing up my phone. Thank you. A couple of questions again, I am trying to get this straight; first of all, on the NDRC, could a possible conclusion of that investigation be something that relates to the royalty rates that you will end up having with your licensees in China, or is that completely separate, and the negotiations you do with the licensees, that will -- and the royalty rates that come out of that, will be totally separate from what the NDRC conclusion is? And then again, just to understand a few of the specific things, I just want to confirm the dispute that you're having with the Chinese vendor, and that is with handsets, as Simona said before, both that they sell within China, as well as ones that they sell outside of China, just coming back to some of the other questions; we can't get to a player large enough in China to be a significant player of that 215 million, if we only consider their Chinese handsets. So just trying to get a frame of that.","And if I could sneak one more in, these vendors are not paying, or either underreporting or not paying you now, are these ones that were licensed in the past, and therefore had paid you in the past, not now, or are these new vendors that had never paid you? Sorry for all the questions.","Derek Aberle","Okay, a little hard to -- hopefully I got all of them scribbled down there. So Ehud, I think -- on the NDRC, I think we have made a pretty robust -- not a pretty robust, a very robust disclosure in our 10-Q, in terms of the range of potential outcomes that could come out of a decision of the NDRC. And so, at this point, we are continuing to fully cooperate, as I said, and try to work through this, but we can't comment specifically on what any particular outcome may be from that proceeding.","In parallel, we are in negotiations with a number of licensees as is typical for the business, and there is a little bit -- I would say, a little bit of a more complication and a little bit slower pace of those negotiations, given the backdrop of the investigation, which is having some amount of impact.","As to the units, kind of inside versus outside China; the 215 million midpoint or the overall range, would not necessarily be limited to sales, in fact, likely is not limited to sales just for China. Number of these suppliers, as you know, supply worldwide. And so really it\u2019s a phenomena that's right now we believe unique to Chinese OEMs.","And as to the ones that are -- that we believe are underreporting, its not a question of companies that have stopped paying or reporting entirely, I think its just -- as we look at the market data that's available to us, which is a very extensive process we have, we now believe that there is a gap between what we expect it to be reported to us, and what actually was reported to us in the third quarter and what we expect for the fourth quarter and for the remainder of the calendar year, unless and until we an get resolution on some of these issues.","So its really companies that are under agreement and the typical process I outlined before is to go through sort of the compliance discussion, which has started already, and then from there, if its not resolved, we move to audit, and if ultimately that's unsuccessful, we have other mechanisms to pursue it under the contracts themselves that they have signed.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","James Faucette - Morgan Stanley","Thanks a lot. Just a quick follow-up to that then Derek; I think you mentioned that you felt like some of the negotiations with potential new licensees were being impacted by the NDRC investigation etcetera. Do you feel like that some of the compliance issues with existing licensees are also being impacted by that same investigation? And then just a quick question, maybe for Steve on the overall market for chips into China, and the emerging markets is that, clearly you're seeing good success and that's evidenced by the large volumes you shipped last quarter, but just wondering how you're feeling about the competitive environment and anything that you need to do from a pricing or a promotion standpoint to continue to [indiscernible] that you'd like to, in those developing markets? Thanks.","Derek Aberle","Sure James, this is Derek. I mean, it's clear to us that the investigation, among other things is creating an increased level of uncertainty I think with the licensee base in China right now. I guess the way I would answer that is, we believe the investigation will be resolved at some point. We are working hard to try to see that through, and once that is resolved, I do believe some of the challenges we have had in the near term, will become easier.","Steve Mollenkopf","James, this is Steve. With regards to your question about chips; it has been an area of strength for us, actually shipping chips into the Chinese customer base. Not all of those, by the way, are being sold in China as well, we have had actually some strength in the 3G portfolio over the last quarter for devices, head into Latin America and rest of the world. So I think its in general, been a very strong picture, and I would say we feel very good about where we sit competitively, and I think if you look at the guide, its consistent with that view.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank","Yeah guys. The way I was going with that line of questioning earlier was, if you -- its like you assume 215 million units, and you assume probably an ASP of around $100 getting into China, and [indiscernible] royalty rate, we are talking about say $645 million, $650 million of revenues in royalties that you will need to pull back over time, once these disputes get settled. Is that a kind of good way to look at it? And then a second question for you Steve, you're doing a lot of work around -- your 28-nanometer RF getting ready to start shipping in October. You have got a ton of 14-nanometer taken off the curtain with Samsung. Can you talk a little bit about how some of these advances you're doing on the substrate side would help you from an economies of scale and margin standpoint against the competitors, that should push forward aggressively in these areas? Thanks.","George Davis","Hey Brian, this is George, I will take a shot at your -- the sizing issue. I think your basic math is in general, right. The way I would look at it, in terms of -- these are lower price devices on average, less than 50% of the average for the overall ASP for the company that we report. And I think -- one of the things you can do is, this is a very strong year relative to our expectations, on the QCT side for the year. Now we talked last quarter about there being a bit of a lag, just because of the timing of the ramp in QCT that QTL wouldn't fully participate this year, all things being equal, but it was really good momentum going into 2015.","So I think if you look at the -- if you want to try and size the impact, I think you would have started to see this impact more fully realize in the third quarter, fourth calendar quarter, and if you look at what the year-over-year looks like there, we are down about 3% year-over-year on QCT this quarter, it widens out a little bit next quarter -- QTL, excuse me, not QCT. Obviously QCT was up significantly year-over-year.","So I think you can size it. We would have expected and expect this result, that this will be a strong momentum for QTL as well.","Steve Mollenkopf","And Brian, on your question about the substrates and different technologies that we are going to -- there were a couple of things I think, one is, its clearly been an advantage to have the scale that we have and to have that scale across multiple foundries that's helped us with supplies, its helped us with pricing, it has helped us with a number of items. And then I think probably the most important thing is from the design perspective, your ability to go to advanced node and to integrate a number of different technologies on to the same die and increasingly, those technologies are F technologies, that has been a competitive advantage for us, and we think its going to continue to be in a competitive advantage moving forward. So we continue to push that -- that's one of the things that I mentioned in my script, that we were pleased that we are able to even execute on that strategy, while cutting back on the OpEx as well. So its -- we feel like we are pretty positioned well from a product perspective.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.","Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, 215 million units out of your forecast seems too big to me to be strictly 4G in China situation. So can you give us some feeling for -- suspect this is beyond 4G, this is 3G as well, so do you ha actually have 3G licensees that we are paying, who are now underreporting as its leaking out?","Secondly on the NDRC, I know in your Q you talked about that there would be likely a probable impact, a financial impact, but you're unable to size it at this point. Can you talk about what some of the possibilities are, anywhere from a [indiscernible] business model transitions. Is there a possibility that there could be an adverse change to your business in China, and if there is, how do you stop that adverse change from leaking out of China into the rest of your regions, and impacting your royalty business overall?","Derek Aberle","Stacy, this is Derek. Yeah so on the 215 million midpoint, again, from the TRDS impact, you will see significantly less than that. The reason I try to kind of break it down into four different buckets, is because of the underreporting bucket that you mentioned, that we believe is going on right now, is broader than just LTE, would include 3G volumes as well, and so that's -- when we look at the market, in terms of both China and devices flowing outside of China to other parts of the world, that's encompassing the broader technology set than just 4G.","On the NDRC, really I don't think I can say much more than I said in response to a prior question. Other than, yes, we did change the disclosure to indicate that -- we believed some loss would be probable. But given the many factors that are involved there, we are really not in a position to be able to estimate what that might look like, we just believe whatever the resolution may be, will likely include some form of payment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura. Please go ahead with your question.","Romit Shah - Nomura","Thanks. A couple. Derek, first, the NDRC investigation, should we expect some resolution this year, or should we be waiting for this thing to spill into 2015? The other question I had was, on just the strength in MSM this quarter, you mentioned emerging -- can you talk a little bit about how the -- your tier-1 customers influence the performance here in June and your outlook for September? Thanks.","Derek Aberle","So this is Derek, I will take the first one. It is pretty difficult to determine timing on the NDRC resolution. As I have said in the past, we are -- this is obviously a large priority for the company to resolve it, and we are cooperating and actively engaged with the NDRC to try to get to resolve this as expeditiously as possible.","Steve Mollenkopf","And on the second question, I think this last quarter, we really benefited from our diversified customer base and our strength across tiers, and that continues to be something that we think will be a good part of the business. What we are seeing in China, and I think most people probably don't realize all the time, is that it is very much a multi-tiered market, and we are seeing strength across the tiers. And what's really interesting is that, you're seeing a lot of the OEMs in China going international as well, and that's -- I think that's helping us on the chipset business as well.","One other thing that I wanted to mentioned and it was in my script, is that we will be focusing more and more of our chipset roadmap and energy on increasing the pace in which we refresh that roadmap and I think that will benefit us as well moving forward, in the customer base.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead with your question.","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen and Company","Thanks a lot. I have two. First Derek, of the 215 million units, can you somehow put those into each of the four buckets, the dispute, the tablets, the three mode and then the underreporting. And then, a question for George; George, I a trying to get the pro forma op margins for QCT. It looks like it's about 19%. And if that's right, I am surprised it wasn't a little better given the revenue upside, so I wanted you to comment on that. Thanks.","Derek Aberle","Tim, this is Derek. Again, the 215 million is the midpoint of a relatively wide range of units, and a number of different assumptions in terms of potential outcomes are baked into sort of the high end versus the low end of that. And so it's really hard to break down the bucketing of that. As I said, I think, probably the smallest contributor in this timeframe would be the tablet space, which shouldn't be surprising, and kind of the other three are all pretty meaningful contributors.","George Davis","Tim, I am not sure I followed that. The operating profit percentage that was reported was at 23% for QCT, very strong, certainly above the expectations. We said we are going to exit the year above 20%. If you put all those together and look at our 18% to 20% range for the year, we are clearly at the high end of that. And I think that's fully -- in keeping with our outlook for the year, and benefiting a little bit more from the upside in MSM units.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.","Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi guys. Before I go to the main question, just a few housekeeping items; implied royalty rate was higher than you said last quarter. Last quarter you said its going to be 3.1%, and you reported 3.24%, you can go over it. Also the ASPs were higher, is this just related to the elimination of China in the number that there -- that was part of China that we are talking here about? Or is it also related to other things?","Also financial expenses --","Derek Aberle","Could you repeat that question, I think -- okay, go ahead.","Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Should I repeat the question?","Derek Aberle","No its okay. He got it.","Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Half of the outperformance this quarter outside of the revenues was higher financial income, lower taxes, what's going on there, if you can discuss? So these are all the P&L items. One question that I have on the issues of the licensing issue, is -- what I want to understand is, is it related to MediaTek not reporting anymore the numbers to you, so you have more limited way to audit the numbers that the vendors are reporting? Or is it more related to new technology and vendors basically making it very broad kind of claim saying, this kind of technology we are not paying, which is -- there is a difference in the difficulty to convince them to pay in one scenario versus another? Thanks.","George Davis","Maybe I will jump on the P&L items first, and the implied royalty rate. So I think we are looking at different numbers. The reported number would be 3.1%, which was right on top of what we had guided. So if you have got some more questions, you should may be check with the IR team, they can go through the calculation.","In terms of tax, what you saw is, actually last quarter, we reached a settlement which lowered out outlook for the tax rate for the year. We got an additional benefit this quarter as well from the effects of the reversal of the ParkerVision judgment and so that was a -- it didn't carry tax with it, so it had the overall effect of lowering our tax rate.","And as we have been reporting, we are seeing higher investment income on gains in the portfolio, as we have started to implement higher return of capital, we have had a program to reduce some of the volatility in the higher risk assets that are in our long dated portfolio, just to keep our risk levels in line and so, that's led to gains; and the gains turned out to be a little bit higher than we thought in the quarter, because it has just been such a strong financial market. As we've sold those down, we have had greater benefit.","Derek Aberle","Tal, this is Derek. On the ASP for the quarter, I think really the primary driver was the fact that we got -- we had less volume in than we expected at the lower tier devices in China, that's really the primary driver.","On your second question, really the underreporting, it's not an issue of kind of a new technology issue as you described it -- meaning, licensees taking a position that they don't owe royalties on a particular product or technology under their agreement. We really think it is just a -- as we dig into this we are going to -- we believe we will find that they are only reporting something less than 100% of their sales, and hoping they are going to be able to get away with it. Again, we have always been very clear that, you know, the effort involved in making sure we collect on everything in China is significant, and we have a lot of resource in that, and we triangulate a lot of different information at -- we get from MediaTek as one element, and certainly, having less information makes things a little more difficult than having more information. But that, we don't believe is the primary sort of indicator for what's going on here.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Sue with RBC. Please go ahead with your question.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you. Gentlemen, historically, when Qualcomm worked and settled with the Korean vendors, the Japanese, or even the European vendors, we have always had a subsequent resolution and subsequent recovery, and along the way, there was a little bit of give or take, which then sets a precedent. China just seems like a whole new animal in terms of the size and the scope; so conceptually, should we think about just kind of the different structural rate going forward, considering that there is a balance of allocating power that seems to be shifting. How do we kind of containerize what happens in China, so that is not inflicted by others as a precedent; and also additionally, is there additional OpEx that we should be thinking about, in terms of the cost of doing business in China, auditing the extra data for example? Thank you.","Derek Aberle","I am not sure -- again, I think the way that we have been handling China is very similar to the way that we have addressed our licensing program worldwide, very consistent. You're right that -- I would say the typical resolution of these things, when there is a period of uncertainty in a period of time where amounts are not being paid to us, that we believe are recoverable. That resolution usually carries with it, some kind of recovery for past, and I have no reason to believe, that would also be the case with the items that we have outlined.","Again, we look at the compliance activity very carefully, and that's a meaningful part of the program and has been for several years, the number of audits that we do has increased pretty much every year. But we do have, I mean -- I think we do have a reasonable amount of resource and we have that in the plan, I don't see like a significant increase in OpEx that would be needed to address the issues. Again, our best assessment is, that these are near term challenges that given a period of uncertainty we have, may take some time to resolve, but will get resolved, and we will just have to see how this plays out, as we move forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Rod Hall - JP Morgan","Hi guys, thanks for the question. I guess I had a couple. Derek, I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the likelihood this turns into a collective bargaining situation, or if it is already there, and if that's the case, who the negotiator on the other side of the table would be? Would it be a consortium of these companies, or some representative of them? So if you could just kind of talk about how you expect this to play out in the single deal you do with all the companies, or do you do individual deals with everybody?","Also, I wanted to go back to the question on the reports that -- the question on the chips and the involvement of the chips, it seems clear that that 215 million number involves people pulling CDMA royalties from you that they'd already agreed to pay. So why wouldn't chips at some point, get involved in this, if the negotiation drags on? Is there any good logical reason why that wouldn't happen? Just would be curious to hear that. And then lastly, given that the fun place that China is to do business, we have also got these reports the government is talking about limiting high end marketing spending from the carriers, I wonder maybe Steve, since you are there, could you comment on what's going on with that? Is that's a real issue? Is that's something that's going to impact high end smartphone demand over time? Be interested in some color on that, thanks.","Derek Aberle","Rod, hey this is Derek. Let me try to take the first two, and then Steve can cover the last one. So again, we have sort of two things; we do have the NDRC investigation ongoing, and as we have said, we are actively engaged with them, to try to find a resolution. We don't know exactly what the impact or the resolution will look like, both looking backwards or looking forward; we are just continuing to try to -- just try to work that one and get to a resolution.","Beyond that, we don't anticipate that there will be sort of a need or a movement to collective negotiation with companies in China. That has not been the practice that we followed successfully over the last many number of years. And that continues to be the way that we were operating. We are basically in discussions with individual companies, which every company has different needs, different business models, etcetera. And so collective deal really isn't typically appropriate in any event.","So I expect going forward, we will continue to negotiate like we have in the past, individually, with the various companies, and that won't be a change.","On the chip side, I am not sure I fully understood your question, but let me try to answer it as best I can. Certainly, if you look at the magnitude of the number of units that we have kind of in this range, there are -- we do expect that there will be products in that mix, that aren't reported to us for a period of time, that could include our chipsets. Our typical practice, when that has happened in the past, is to engage with the licensee and try to work it out and find a resolution and pursue payment under the license, without an impact on the chip side. And that's what we would plan to do here as well.","Steve Mollenkopf","Rod, this is Steve. There have been reports about the level of subsidy changing in China. I don't know to a degree that we are seeing that reflected in the demand. I mean, if you look at the raw number of dollars that are actually authorized, its quite a number. And I would say, I would characterize our demand across tiers to be fairly robust. So I am not sure we are seeing a downstream impact of that concern.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anil Doradla with William Blair. Please go ahead with your question.","Anil Doradla - William Blair","Hey guys, if I recall, Derek, some time ago you talked about maybe all the licensees now due to 2017. I think that was the comment you made maybe a year, year and half ago. Can you give us an update on that from the Chinese guys? And as a follow-up, Broadcom obviously exiting the baseband business, they talked about even writing down all that stuff, what immediate impacts have you seen in your business with them getting out of baseband? Thanks.","Derek Aberle","So I think straining my memory a little bit, but let me try. Going back several years ago, we did talk about at one point in time, we had basically five WCDMA licenses that had to get extended before that time frame that you mentioned, 2017-2018. And then we kind of knocked all of those off some time ago. We haven't really updated that or given color, as to whether there are other agreements that need to be extended beyond that. So that's a little bit of a dated number, and I don't think we are prepared to update that today.","Warren Kneeshaw","I'd like to thank each of you for joining us here today.

Jacobs","Thanks, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone. I think it's fair to say I'm extremely pleased with Qualcomm's performance this past fiscal year. We delivered record revenues of $19 billion, up 28% versus last year. Earnings, total reported device sales and MSM chipset shipments were also records, was driven by the increasing global consumption of wireless data across a diverse range of devices and particularly smartphones.","We also increased our dividend for the 10th consecutive year and returned $2.9 billion to stockholders in the form of buybacks and cash dividends.","As to the fourth quarter, we are above the high end of our previous revenue and earnings guidance as demand in 28-nanometer supply improved as the quarter progressed. This gives us a strong base to build off of. And looking forward to next year, we expect double-digit revenue and non-GAAP earnings growth again in fiscal 2013.","For the year, we had a number of highlights. We delivered double-digit growth in our Licensing business, with record revenues and earnings. We now have over 220 royalty-bearing 3G licensees. And this year, we added more than 20 new Chinese licensees and our first license agreements with major Brazilian consumer electronic suppliers. We've also continued to grow our single-mode OFDM licensees. We now have over 30 single-mode OFDM licensees around the world and believe our 4G portfolio is the most widely licensed in the industry. Through our licensing program, we continue to foster innovation and enable a large and growing ecosystem that benefits wireless consumers worldwide.","Our semiconductor business had double-digit growth as well, delivering record revenues and earnings. During the year, we continued to lead in LTE with our integrated modem solutions. We delivered significant product enhancements across all key technology vectors including the modem, processor, graphics and connectivity with world-class integration. And we executed the fastest ramp of a new process node in our history. Now this was not without its challenges, but the teams consistently executed to an accelerated schedule over the last 9 months.","We believe the breadth and depth of our product road map is unparalleled, and our Snapdragon and Gobi family of chipsets has established the industry standard in integrated mobile semiconductors, allowing us to continue to extend our partnerships with key OEMs.","On the display front, we continue to believe MEMS-based displays will provide key differentiating features such as low-power consumption and outdoor view-ability. As we previously indicated, we are increasing our focus on licensing our display technologies, including our next-generation mirasol display technology, while at the same time directly commercializing certain current-generation mirasol displays. And we're also evaluating various options for our display manufacturing facility in Taiwan.","Shifting to our spectrum-related initiatives, we achieved many significant milestones this year. In United States, we completed the sale of our 700 megahertz spectrum to AT&T, and we're working closely with them to enable their deployment of supplemental downlink using our carrier aggregation technology on this unpaired spectrum to improve download speeds and capacity.","In Europe, the regulatory group CEPT decided to harmonize the L-Band at 1.4 gigahertz for supplemental downlink. This, by the way, is the same band that we own in the U.K., and this opens up the potential to have supplemental downlink deployed widely across Europe.","And finally, in India, we received our license in the assignment of the 2.3 gigahertz spectrum we won in India's BWA auction. And Bharti Airtel, a leading Indian wireless operator, acquired a 49% interest in our Indian BWA entities, and we expect they will take full ownership of those entities in calendar 2014. Bharti's acquisition added an operator-partner with the scale, experience and resources to roll out and operate an LTE TDD network on this spectrum.","Turning to calendar 2013. Despite a somewhat cautious macroeconomic outlook, we expect 3G\/4G device shipments to grow approximately 14% year-over-year based on the midpoint of our forecast. We believe our long-term growth drivers remain intact. Smartphone adoption continues at a rapid pace, with many increasingly capable devices at a variety of price points being launched on a global basis.","According to industry analysts, more than 300 million smartphones were shipped in the first half of calendar 2012, representing approximately 45% year-over-year growth. To put this in perspective, according to Gartner, this was over 2\/3 higher than the volume of PCs that shipped during the same period.","Further, the demand for data on mobile networks continues to grow, which is driving the need for continued technological innovation, and we're seeing a fundamental shift towards mobile computing. Watch for these and other opportunities in more detail during our upcoming Analyst Day, and I look forward to seeing many of you there.","As you heard, due to the impact of Hurricane Sandy, we were unfortunately forced to move the Analyst Day to San Diego, but our thoughts are with all of those that were affected by this tragedy.","So to wrap up, we've once -- we have completed another outstanding year at Qualcomm. I would once again like to thank all of our employees and partners for their innovation, effort and leadership. Looking forward, I'm pleased with our outlook for continued double-digit revenue and non-GAAP earnings growth in fiscal 2013.","That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to Qualcomm's President and Chief Operating Officer, Steve Mollenkopf.","Steven M. Mollenkopf","Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. QCT had another strong year, with record revenues up 37% year-over-year, driven by record shipments of 590 million MSM chipsets, which were up 22% year-over-year. In the fiscal fourth quarter, we shipped approximately 141 million MSM chipsets, above the midpoint of our prior guidance.","Revenue per MSM was up approximately 9% sequentially, driven by a greater mix of multimode 3G LTE devices, which more than doubled quarter-over-quarter and made up approximately 1\/3 of our shipments exiting the quarter as expected. Similarly, shipments of our new dual-core MSM8960 tripled quarter-over-quarter as demand for our integrated application processors continues to grow.","Demand for our 28-nanometer products remained strong, including significant design activity on our follow-on chipsets. As expected, we ramped our 28-nanometer supply significantly in the fiscal fourth quarter, and we remain on track to match our current 28-nanometer demand profile exiting the December quarter.","Our industry-leading modem technology continues to be a tremendous differentiator for us. As modem complexity continues to increase with multimode and multiband requirements, we are well-positioned with a single solution that offers a true global modem, supporting all cellular modes including CDMA, WCDMA, TD-SCDMA and both LTE TDD and LTE FDD, as well as the approximately 40 related RF bands.","In addition, we recently sampled our third-generation multimode 3G\/LTE chipset, the MDM 9x25, which is also a global modem that adds support for LTE category 4 and carrier aggregation.","We believe our first 28-nanometer Snapdragon product, the dual-core MSM8960 with integrated 3G\/LTE has become the global standard for combined performance and battery life, powering recent flagship devices such as the Samsung Galaxy S III, the HTC 8X, the Motorola RAZR M and the new Nokia Lumia phones.","As carriers deploy LTE networks, they are looking to Qualcomm as the leader in multimode LTE for smartphones. For example, KDDI, NTT DOCOMO and SoftBank announced 27 new smartphones in Japan in October, and 24 of those were powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon processors.","Since releasing the MSM8960, 15 OEMs have launched devices with this chipset across 19 carriers around the globe. The 8960 was our fastest integrated product to ship 100 million units.","Our OEM customers have also moved quickly to adopt the Snapdragon S4 Pro, which includes our latest Adreno 320 GPU, 4 Krait CPU cores and is paired with an MDM9x15 multimode LTE modem. Early reviews show that this product has set a new bar for multitasking and graphics performance. The first OEM devices based on this platform include the Google Nexus 4, LG Optimus G and Xiaomi MI2, and we expect more leading devices on this platform to be announced soon.","Smartphone demand in emerging regions is growing rapidly, and we continue to invest in our Qualcomm Reference Design program to help service a new group of emerging customer accounts. The program now has over 40 OEM customers and 100 commercially launched devices. And this quarter we expanded our road map to include the new Snapdragon quad-core MSM8x25Q and our new 28-nanometer based MSM8930 with an integrated global modem.","We are pleased to see the initial launch of Windows RT devices, including the Snapdragon-based Samsung ATIV Tab and the Dell XPS 10. While this early, we are positioned to benefit from this new category as our Qualcomm Snapdragon chipsets are the only chipsets to power both Windows smartphones and these new mobile computing devices.","Our mobile connectivity solutions, which include integrated Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth and FM continue to be used by the vast majority of our customers' designs for their 28-nanometer S4 devices.","As we mentioned on the last call, we expect a strong December quarter for QCT as our supply of 28-nanometer chipsets continues to ramp and our partners launch a broad lineup of handsets for the holiday quarter. We are expecting record MSM shipments of between 168 million and 178 million units in the first fiscal quarter, up approximately 19% to 26% sequentially, with revenue per MSM also up sequentially.","In fiscal 2013, we expect multimode 3G\/LTE shipments for smartphones to constitute a much greater percentage of our mix, which we estimate will significantly increase our average revenue per MSM versus fiscal 2012. We also expect our 3G\/LTE leadership and broad-tiered road map to help increase our design traction within key customer accounts.","Leadership across multiple technologies require to succeed in mobile remains our strategic priority for our business, and we are increasing our R&D investments in fiscal 2013, including investments in our modem, the application processor and driving new process technologies, as well as our reference design effort.","That concludes my remarks. I look forward to seeing many of you in San Diego at our upcoming analyst event. I will now turn the call over to Bill Keitel.","William E. Keitel","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We have strong financial results and guidance to report to you today.","Fiscal fourth quarter revenues were $4.87 billion, up 18% year-over-year; and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.89, up 11% year-over-year, both above the high end of our prior guidance range. QTL revenues grew 16% year-over-year, and total reported device sales by our licensees were approximately $46.5 billion, up 19% year-over-year.","We estimate that approximately 210 million to 214 million subscriber units were shipped by our licensees in the June quarter, up 12% year-over-year at the midpoint at an average selling price of approximately $216 to $222.","QCT fiscal fourth quarter revenues were a new record, growing 21% year-over-year, and QCT's operating margin was 16%, above our prior guidance, reflecting strong shipments of our multimode 3G\/LTE solutions.","We returned $1.27 billion to stockholders in the fiscal fourth quarter, including $426 million in cash dividends and $841 million through stock repurchases. In addition, since the end of fiscal 2012 and through yesterday's market close, we repurchased another 4.1 million shares of our stock for $240 million.","Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.89 for the quarter, $0.08 better than our prior-guidance midpoint. QTL was $0.02 better, driven by strong 3G\/4G device shipments. And QCT added $0.07, driven by higher MSM shipments and favorable multimode 3G\/LTE product mix. The net of higher operating expenses and impairment charge and higher investment income accounted for $0.01 reduction.","Turning to our results for fiscal year 2012. Revenues were a record $19.1 billion, up 28% from last year. GAAP earnings were a record $3.51 per share, up 39% year-over-year; non-GAAP operating income was a record $7.1 billion, up 17% year-over-year; and non-GAAP earnings per share were a record $3.71, up approximately 16% year-over-year.","QTL's fiscal 2012 revenues were a record $6.3 billion, up 17% year-over-year, and QTL's operating margin was 88%. We estimate that the fiscal 2012 3G\/4G device average selling price, as reported by our licensees, was approximately $216 to $222, up 6% compared to fiscal 2011 and reflecting strong adoption of smartphones in multiple tiers in both developed and emerging regions.","QCT's fiscal 2012 revenues were a record $12.1 billion, up 37% year-over-year with operating margin of 19%. Our fiscal 2012 operating cash flow was $6 billion and 31% of revenues. We returned approximately $2.9 billion to stockholders during fiscal 2012, including $1.6 billion of cash dividends and $1.3 billion through stock repurchases.","We are reaffirming our 905 million unit midpoint estimate for calendar 2012 3G\/4G device shipments by our licensees, up approximately 14% year-over-year.","Now turning to next year. We estimate calendar 2013 3G\/4G device shipments by our licensees will be approximately 1 billion to 1.07 billion units, up approximately 14% year-over-year at the midpoint. Our economic outlook is largely aligned with consensus worldwide GDP forecast except that we have less optimism in developed economies.","The midpoint of our guidance is based on 3.0% world GDP growth in 2013 compared to consensus of 3.4%. We expect fiscal 2013 revenues to be in the range of approximately $23 billion to $24 billion, up approximately 23% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect our non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of approximately $8.1 billion to $8.6 billion, an increase of approximately 18% at the midpoint.","While we anticipate strong growth in both our chip and Licensing businesses, we expect the higher mix of multimode 3G\/LTE and 28-nanometer chipsets to drive growth in QCT's revenue and operating income at a comparatively faster pace than QTL. We expect fiscal 2013 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $4.12 to $4.32, an increase of approximately 14% year-over-year at the midpoint.","We estimate that the 3G\/4G device ASP will be approximately $214 to $226 in fiscal 2013, a slight increase year-over-year at the midpoint. We anticipate that combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses will grow approximately 19% year-over-year, primarily driven by increased R&D investments and those R&D investments focused on furthering QCT's leadership position.","Absent U.S. corporate tax reform, we expect both our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in fiscal 2013 to be approximately 18% to 19%. As a reminder, we do not include estimates for realized investment gains or losses on our cash and marketable securities portfolio in our financial guidance unless they are reasonably certain.","Now looking out to the first quarter of fiscal 2013. We estimate revenues to be approximately $5.6 billion to $6.1 billion, an increase of 25% year-over-year at the midpoint. We anticipate that non-GAAP earnings per share will be approximately $1.08 to $1.16 a share, an increase of 15% year-over-year at the midpoint. This estimate includes expected total reported device sales of approximately $46 billion to $51 billion by our licensees for shipments in the September quarter, up 17% year-over-year at the midpoint.","We estimate that QCT will ship approximately 168 million to 178 million MSM chipsets during the December quarter, with revenue per MSM higher sequentially, reflecting strong demand for our multimode 3G\/LTE solutions and improved 28-nanometer supply. We expect a modest build in the 3G\/4G inventory channel in the December quarter, as is typical for the holiday season. And we estimate that 3G\/4G inventory channel will remain towards the low end of the 13- to 18-week band throughout the remainder of fiscal 2013. We expect combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to decrease approximately 2% sequentially.","We hope to see many of you at our November 15 Analyst Day, where we will share additional data points regarding our fiscal 2013 guidance, including segment operating margins, ASP trends and 3G\/4G regional breakouts. The event will be webcast live on our Qualcomm Investor Relations website, which also includes a slide presentation on the data points included on today's call.","That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back over to Warren.","Warren Kneeshaw","Thank you, Bill. Operator, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets.","Timothy Long - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just a 2-parter on the chipset ASPs, if I could. It sounds like a lot of LTE and good smartphone shipments in the quarter and expecting the same next quarter. Two things. One, could you talk a little bit about what's going on with ASP at the lower end? Obviously, MediaTek is starting to do a little bit better. Are you seeing more price pressure there? And secondly, I'm calculating a little bit better gross margin profile for the chipset business in the quarter. Is that accurate? Have you seen -- starting to see gross margin benefits from the move to 28-nanometer or from the higher ASPs?","William E. Keitel","Tim, I'll take the first -- second part of your question on the gross margins. Let me just say, for our first fiscal quarter of 2013, we do expect a nice increase in QCT's operating margins. I won't comment on the gross margin, and I won't give specifics on the Q1 operating margin for QCT. But I think we'll share a little more color next week at the analyst meeting. But again, we do expect a nice pick up in QCT's operating margin in fiscal Q1.","Timothy Long - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Then maybe the impact at the low end?","Steven M. Mollenkopf","Tim, this is Steve. On the low end, it's pretty much playing out the way that we've discussed and\/or described over the last year or so, which is pretty competitive market at the low end. It's very crowded a bit competitively, and people are really pricing aggressively in order to get share or to maintain share. So we expect that to continue to some degree as we talked about for some time. One thing I should mention too, earlier I misspoke a bit. I said that the MSM8960 was our fastest product to 100 million units. It actually should have been 10 million units. Apologize for that. It's 10 million units.","Operator","Mike Walkley with Canaccord.","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Bill, on QTL or the CDMA device market, ASPs are flat to even improving next year, especially with your GDP comments about lower mix maybe from mature markets. Can you just walk us through some of the factors that are keeping ASPs flat to up next year? And what you might think longer term with more growth from emerging markets that might put a downward pressure on QTL ASPs longer term?","Derek K. Aberle","This is Derek. Let me go ahead and take that one. I think as we've said in the past, over the longer term, we should see some amount of erosion in the ASP. I think as you look ahead to next year, and we'll provide some more color on this next week, I think there's going to be somewhat offsetting trends. I think we are expecting to see more volume coming from the emerging regions. But then sort of offsetting that to some extent, we're seeing more higher percentage of devices at the highest tier in some of the developed regions, and also we expect, as we've said in the past, ASPs in some of the emerging regions that have been quite low to continue to increase with more smartphone penetration cannibalizing the feature phone. So I think all that kind of nets out together to relatively flat picture going forward next year.","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","And Derek a follow-on question is are connected tablets becoming a bigger impact in terms of the ASP trends that you report?","Derek K. Aberle","I'm sorry. Could you repeat that?","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Sure. Just wondering if connected tablets works more with LTE shipping and 3G? Are the connected tablets becoming more meaningful to your ASP calculations?","Derek K. Aberle","I think we've been -- as the volume goes up and down quarterly, the volumes themselves have changed, but I think the percentage of total units that are coming from tablets have been relatively constant. I think we'll kind of have to wait and see how things play out going forward with Windows RT and some of the other Android tablets coming into the market over the next year.","Operator","Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to clarify, when you talk about expecting a significant increase in the MSM ASPs, it's interesting that you're not also expecting an increase in the QTL ASPs to match that. So that will seem to imply that directionally your market share is increasing more at the high end of the total device opportunity. Is that a reasonable conclusion?","William E. Keitel","I think it's a combination of things, Simona. One, you're going to get a timing difference between the MSM shipment and the impact into our Licensing business. So that would be number one. But number two, we are -- as Derek said, the high end of the market seems to be playing out pretty strongly here in the near term. So you're going to see more of effect of that initially. Through -- later through the year though, as Derek did say, we do expect the emerging markets to be growing at a faster pace than developed markets. So I think some of it's -- a lot of what you're seeing there is just timing, Simona.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And also wanted to follow up on the guidance for fiscal '13 within QTL. Can you just be a little more specific on what you're assuming there on the success for Windows RT with 3G\/4G connectivity attached. Is that a meaningful assumption as part of your guidance? Or if that platform were to be successful, would that imply upside?","William E. Keitel","I would say on Windows RT, in our guidance here we've been cautious. But looking out in time, we're cautiously optimistic.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, so not embedding a big number for that next year?","William E. Keitel","Not in our guidance.","Operator","Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank.","Brian T. Modoff - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple of questions. Steve, on the LTE side, you talked about your MSM ASPs going up because of the shift towards more of the LTE product and more of the advanced MDM product. Can you talk a little bit about LTE competition? Our own checks indicate the competitors who are getting continuous delays in getting their products out. Can you talk about when you expect to see merchant silicon out from some of the competitors? And then, Bill, a question around -- you guide revenues next year, 23% and EPS, 14%. Why such a gap between the 2.","Steven M. Mollenkopf","Brian, this is Steve. On your first question about LTE, yes, LTEs become really a table stakes feature at the high end. And it's something that we have not only in our modem product line but also in the application processor line as you know. And it's become tiered now when you look at our 28-nanometer shipments, meaning that we have multiple tiers of AP shipping LTE now integrated. Moving into next year, we expect that feature set to turnover, meaning that the LTE solutions that we're shipping today will add additional bands, they'll also add different data rates, as well as carrier aggregation. I talked about how we had been sampling our new design as well, which is our third generation. So we think that's moving quite fast, and we think it's going to be a very difficult situation to come into that market. But as you know, everyone is trying to do that. So we expect a number of competitors to go after portions of that market. But I think getting the worldwide SKU, we're going to try to make it very difficult.","William E. Keitel","And Brian, to your second question, the reason that revenue growth is greater than earnings per share growth is simply the difference in margins between QCT and QTL. Now we're expecting QCT next year to grow at a substantially higher rate than QTL. That is the primary difference. There's a small amount of difference as well, because we don't forecast realized gains on our cash and marketable securities portfolio beyond what we have clear visibility on. And that tends to be a very near-term picture. So those are the 2 factors. The great majority, though, being the fact that QCT we expect to be growing at a much faster pace than QTL, albeit both businesses we expect to grow double digit.","Operator","Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of quick questions. One is, if you look at your guidance for QTL market size, these are the market size in June that you got relative revenues on and, in September, was $46.5 billion. And you said that's going to go to $46 billion to $51 billion. The midpoint of that is up 4%. Most of what we've seen, I think you've probably seen the same things from all of your licensees, which show that smartphone growth from calendar Q2 to calendar Q3 was a lot more than 4.5% or 4%. I think most of the numbers are showing well into the double digits. How did you get to your $46 billion to $51 billion range? I would have thought it would have been higher than that. And then, just want to see what you did or didn't bake into that, and then I have a follow-up on royalty rate.","William E. Keitel","Yes, Ehud, this is Bill. Yes, we monitor the OEMs as you do. Obviously, we're able to engage probably at a more detailed level. There's -- as we mentioned, we're seeing -- Steve Mollenkopf and Paul describing this way that the OEM market is kind of getting to be a barbell, where you have one end of the barbell with names that we all recognize. But the other end of the barbell has a lot of names that very few people recognize concentrated in Asia. And it's the -- it's that visible name in one end of the barbell that people tend to focus on and where data is more readily available. The other end of the barbell, the data can be hard to come by. So I think that's probably a key difference between what you're rolling up, and what we're rolling up.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So I'm guessing it's more that you can't see it either, and so you're going conservative there versus you actually know more than we do there. Or do you know more than we do? And then my extra question is on the royalty rate. It came back to 3.4%. Obviously, it has to do with a couple of your providers or a couple of your licensees that have some fixed components to their rate structure. And when they're up or down, it does fluctuate a little bit. But as you look into 2013, do you expect the same 3.4% to hold? And at what point do you expect your single-mode LTE licensees, who presumably have a lower royalty rate than 3.4%, to start dragging on that?","William E. Keitel","On the TRDS question, total reported device sales, I hope is that we have more visibility than you or others do. We've tended to do reasonably well with our forecast. I'm hopeful that we're going to hold that pattern here going forward.","Derek K. Aberle","This is Derek. Let me try to answer your question on the rate. As we've pointed out kind of repeatedly, we do tend to see quarterly fluctuations in the rate. And it's for a variety of factors that can move it around. And last quarter, obviously, the TRDS was a bit higher than came in this quarter. So that's an impact, and we actually saw with some of this growth at the high end of the market a larger percentage of devices hitting the caps that we have in place. So that's going to have an impact on the rate. I think we're not prepared today to talk about what we see going forward. But hopefully, we can give you some color on that next week. What we did say a couple of quarters ago is we expected to finish up the year towards the low end of the 3.4% to 3.5% indicator we gave at the outset of the year. And I think we're pretty close to that. It's where we ended up.","Operator","Rod Hall with JPMorgan.","Roderick B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a question on R&D, maybe for you, Bill. If you could talk a little bit about -- R&D's a little bit higher than we thought it would be in fiscal Q4. How much of that was related to 28-nanometer? And then I also wanted to ask about next year, the fiscal 2013 guidance. I mean your R&D is -- or the overall OpEx is kind of pacing in terms of growth a little bit below expected revenue growth. And I wonder if you could talk a little bit about -- but put that in context with Paul's commentary about R&D investments increasing next year. Should we expect OpEx to shift more toward R&D next year? Or how is that going to play out as we move through the year?","William E. Keitel","Sure, Rod. Yes, next year, we expect R&D to grow at a rate substantially higher than SG&A. We're pretty excited about the R&D investment opportunity ahead. And at the same time, I think we're pretty pleased that we think we'll be able to get a lot of leverage -- operating leverage out of the SG&A we got in place. So we expect R&D to grow at a rate substantially higher than SG&A. What you're seeing in fiscal Q4 is just we're on that ramp. The expenses came in a little bit higher. Now we did point out that we did have an impairment charge in the quarter. It was a $54 million impairment charge related to our display business, which as I think everybody's aware, we're -- we've shifted our focus there a bit. And that impairment follows on that shift in focus. But other than that, we're on a ramp here that there's a fast growth in R&D because of the exciting opportunities ahead.","Roderick B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Though, would you -- would your R&D have ended up in the quarter around 850 or something like that without the impairment of the 28-nanometer? Or can you give us any idea kind of where it would be normalized?","William E. Keitel","The impairment was charged to SG&A. So I brought that up in the context of our total operating expenses.","Roderick B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Oh, sorry, okay. So -- and your -- but your R&D underlying, can you give us any idea where that might have been or...","William E. Keitel","Well, it -- I would say there weren't that many. I don't see a lot of non-recurring elements in our fourth quarter R&D. The largest R&D program in Qualcomm today is 4G LTE along with 28-nanometer. That is our largest program in Qualcomm today.","Operator","Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.","Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, I have one question for Steve. I guess, with the rising ASPs you're talking about in the QCT business, is it fair to say that -- how do you think about QCT margins over the next year, maybe over the long term? Can we get back to historic levels? Is that level of investment you're needing to make or pricing pressure or competitive environment you're breaking into the next fiscal year so margins don't expand? Any color there would be, specifically of QCT, will be helpful. And I guess, Bill, I'm just going back to the whole issue off OpEx. And I think all the questions are really getting guys [ph] this. You have like fairly decent R&D growth last year, fairly decent OpEx growth. This year, it's going to grow slightly a touch slower than sales. But you're not necessarily giving, especially in the R&D line, as much leverage I guess as we once spoke about. I thought there has been a number of investments and heavy level of investments in recent years. And so, at what point do you think you could get actual significant operating leverage over R&D? Is that still a 3- to 5-year discussion? Or could we actually start seeing that towards the end of the next fiscal year, for example?","Steven M. Mollenkopf","Kulbinder, this is Steve. On the first question, what you're seeing in the QCT business is we have the strategy, and it's particularly true on the high end of trying to set the design -- essentially the design point for the industry really create an integrated product that leads in multiple dimensions. Those dimensions, graphics, modem, connectivity, what have you, we continue to invest pretty heavily in. And we think that, that strategy is working, particularly as you look at the outlook in '13. We feel that we'll be able to really see a significant year-over-year growth because of that, as Bill mentioned. The other thing that you're seeing as well is we are transitioning through nodes at a faster pace than we have done historically. So we have, probably on a historical basis, a bit more VLSI investment consistent with transitioning through nodes quickly. We think that, over time, it'll be very difficult for people to continue to keep up with that level of technology innovation. That's essentially our strategy on the high end, and it seems to be paying off right now. We're going to continue it through the next year. And as Bill said, we're pretty excited about where we think that's going to lead. Particularly at a time when the smartphone and the tablet are converging, we think long term.","Paul E. Jacobs","In terms of getting leverage on the R&D investments outside of things Steve has been talking about, obviously, we have a pretty significant investment in supporting multiple operating systems and being, let's say, cautiously optimistic about kind of the revenue growth derived from that in the near term. But I would think that those are great growth opportunities looking out. And then we're also doing reasonable amount of R&D in new areas to deal with the data growth and really satisfying customer demand there. And then finally, new R&D in other growth markets that are adjacent. And we'll get into some of those discussions in the Analyst Meeting on where we see the opportunities.","Operator","Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Firstly, with QCT growing significantly more than QTL, it sounds like a lot of this is going to be pricing. But do you see share gains as well? And to the extent you see that, is it more customer exposure versus new [indiscernible] driving it? For the second question, a question on mirasol, you're moving that to a licensing business. So this last year, I think it lost more than $300 million. There's probably $0.15 or $0.20 of EPS. Do you have upside in your annual guidance for next year from that mirasol transition to licensing? Or is there potential further upside once you figure out what to do with it? Or is it already in there and you're spending the savings on the OpEx?","William E. Keitel","Stacy, this is Bill. I'll take the mirasol one first. There are savings built into our guidance. We had indicated earlier this year that we would be -- we're executing on a plan that would deliver savings, and those are built into our guidance. On the question on share gains, we are targeting to do better in QCT. There is a -- we've got both a richer mix, and we're targeting to capture more design wins as we go forward here. So it's a combination of the 2, Stacy.","Operator","Ian Ing with Lazard Capital.","Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","You're upping estimates for emerging market devices in 2012 by $15 million. Could you talk about that? And do you have thoughts on how much of the China market can actually migrate to 3G and 4G? There is a bit of a negative case out there that EDGE plus WiFi is a sufficient smartphone experience for some, given the density of WiFi hotspots in China, and even like iPhones already on the China Mobile network.","William E. Keitel","Ian, this is Bill. On the first question for 2012, yes, we did increase our estimates. It's disclosed on our website, I assume that's where you saw it. For 2012, China and India by 15 million units. And then that was offset with some reductions that we think are occurring elsewhere. The -- between the -- that emerging market estimate, it's primarily China. And that's really extrapolating off the trends we're seeing. I think many are seeing it's a very, very active smartphone market, both the consumers are high consumer take rate and we think a good operator experience as well.","Paul E. Jacobs","If we look at the EDGE smartphone market, I mean, we believe that's a transitional step. Obviously, people aren't going to be satisfied with the EDGE experience when it comes to the kind of content that many people are consuming on their smartphones, high-bandwidth content like video. The other thing is WiFi is going to tap out because it's going to be interference limited. And the nice thing about the licensed band technologies that you can cause the base stations to manage interference among themselves. And that's the kind of technologies that we're going to be bringing to the market over the next few years. And those, I think, will drive the kind of capacities of the network at very, very much decreased cost points. So the wireless operators are going to be in a position to really supply a lot better data experience, lot better quality of service over the 3G and 4G networks. And so while we love WiFi and we sell an awful lot of WiFi through Atheros, we believe in it for offload, it's not going to be the solution for the mass of smartphones and tablets going forward.","Operator","Tal Liani with Bank of America.","Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have a question on MSM ASPs. If I increase the ASPs for MSM by 9% in the fourth quarter, which is I think put an assumption here. I think it's a fair assumption. And from that point, from this quarter point, I keep it flat completely for the following year. I'm still getting 14% growth in ASPs year-over-year. So when you spoke about growth in ASPs for MSM, do you mean that it's going to stay flat, and that's going to imply during -- according to my math, 14%? Or do you mean it's going to further increase from the current fourth quarter level?","William E. Keitel","Tal -- or Steve, do you want to -- go ahead.","Steven M. Mollenkopf","Yes. It's really referencing the fourth quarter that we just reported on. So we believe it's going to increase through the year. And as I said, there will be a sequential increase for Q1. As I mentioned in my remarks earlier, fairly significant sequential increase.","Operator","Jeff Kvaal with Barclays.","Jeffrey T. Kvaal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I would like to ask across the service first, if I could. I think many of the benchmarking studies have indicated that your own architectures are superior on many metrics to the internal ones from Samsung and Apple. Could you talk about why it is that those phones have done so well? And what the implications there are on the apps processor market? Just -- do believe that your market share will go back up again? Is that what you're referencing in your prior statement? And then, Steve, perhaps for you on the seasonality. You had said earlier that you would expect supply to only match demand later in the second half of the December quarter. Does that mean that you will still be working off demand in the March quarter? Is that the implication of that statement?","Steven M. Mollenkopf","Sure. So on your first question, what we've continued to believe, and it's been our strategy for some time, is that we believe that for mobile, you have to have expertise across multiple areas. You have to be able to innovate across multiple dimensions, the modem, the application processor, graphics, connectivity. And probably even more importantly, you need to be able to put those together in some sort of integrated product, where you control the architecture. Because there are a number of different trade-offs that are required. And we've been able to do that over the years and significantly here over the last several years, 8960 being a great example of an area where we've had -- we were the first people to come out with the new micro-architecture for the ARM, CPU, as well as integrated LTE and brand-new graphics core. It's really important for mobile, we think, to put those all together in one package and really optimize the architecture for what's required for mobile. And we've benefited from that. And you're seeing that in the benchmark. So that's our strategy. We're going to continue that moving forward. We're pretty happy with where the roadmap goes to be able to do that moving forward. Incidentally, I think that's also one of the reasons why you're seeing some people who have expertise in one area, let's say CPU or GPU, try to add the other expertise areas. Because it's very difficult to compete unless you have them all. With respect to seasonality, let me clarify my comments. For the fourth quarter, we have been talking about how we thought that exiting the fourth quarter we thought supply and demand of 28-nanometer would be matched. By implication, the starting point or the beginning part of the quarter, meaning the October and September time frame, we are still burning off excess or not enough supply. And by the way, these are calendar quarters. So I'm talking about the December quarter. Now going into March, we feel that we have supply and demand imbalance. And we think that, that will be the case, really, exiting the December month. So hopefully that clarifies it.","Operator","Mark McKechnie with Evercore.","Mark McKechnie - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","This is probably for Steve and\/or Derek. I wanted to ask you, your top customer, Samsung. They've got a legal battle with Apple. I don't expect you to comment too much on that. But are you feeling any impact as they move product around that may help you -- may have helped the ASPs here? And then also going forward, if you have any contingency plans. I mean, if the -- if -- depending on how their legal outcome plays out.","Steven M. Mollenkopf","Mark, this is Steve. Maybe I'll take a piece of that. One of the things that we're seeing, particularly at the high end, is that the customers, they're really very, very -- these launches are global. And the global launches essentially have caused the high end of anybody's smartphone portfolio to absorb technology very quickly. But it's technology that's really the union of all the technologies, all the modem technologies, for example, across the world. And what we've seen is that we've been able to leverage, to some degree, a design win in one geography and be able to move that to another geography. And I think that's just consistent with the way the high end of the market is moving. It's very fast paced in terms of the means at which -- or the speed at which it's taking technology.","Mark McKechnie - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great, that's helpful. And one other question as a follow-up, Steve, if you don't mind. Your chip ASPs ticked up a bit. You talked a little bit about connectivity, but could you comment at all on your attach rate of the WiFi piece, the Bluetooth piece, the connectivity with your 8960 solution?","Steven M. Mollenkopf","Sure. The ASP uptick is really a combination of better modem features, as well as better application processor features, in really selling more and more of the integrated products. On connectivity, what we've really added throughout fiscal year '12 was the ability to attach wireless LAN to our solutions. As you know, we've had very strong attach on GPS and GLONASS here recently, Bluetooth and FM. With the integration strategy that we have, we've added wireless LAN. And as I've mentioned really throughout the year and have reiterated here today, the vast majority of our 28-nanometer S4 designs use our integrated wireless LAN. So we're very pleased at how that's going right now. And we're really trying deliver on the fan-out that we've been able to get. For -- in our view, we think the integration strategy really works across all of these technologies.","Operator","James Faucette with Pacific Crest.","James E. Faucette - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions. First, I wanted to follow up on an earlier question related to device ASPs. I think Mike Walkley has asked about when we might expect to see the growth in emerging market start to have downward pressure on ASPs. At least, how we should think about that qualitatively? And the second question that I had was related to cash. You highlighted very well the use of cash and return of cash to shareholders over the last little while. How should we think about your outlook for buybacks and dividend policy going forward?","William E. Keitel","James, this is Bill. On the device ASP, emerging markets having a larger effect on the total average. The -- although emerging market units are growing faster than the developed markets are, the total dollar value of the developed TRDS is far greater than the emerging market TRDS. And so we're ways away from that crossing over where emerging market dollar value is equal to or greater than the developed market. But I think we're planning a little more color on this next week. So I'll leave that point there. And Paul, do you want to talk about...","Paul E. Jacobs","Yes. So I think you've seen that we're focused on returning capital to shareholders. And we're going to continue to be focused on doing that, as well as investing into research and development and -- because we see the opportunity ahead of us as being so great. But the board, obviously, looks at cash flows when they determine the dividend policy. And we'll continue to look to be opportunistic on the buybacks as well. So I think the one thing that could make a step function difference in these things is hopefully, we'll see some corporate tax reform and go to territorial system going forward. And that would have a significant impact on that as well.","Operator","Romit Shah with Nomura.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just relative to your outlook of 14% growth for device shipments in 2013, can you guys just deconstruct for us the impact from replacement rates versus this transition from 2G to 3G?","William E. Keitel","This is Bill. On the -- we are going to get a little more detail on -- next week on replacement rates. It's the -- it's more of a growth in demand and growth in 3G relative to 2G. The replacement rate is still a positive factor. But we think it's going to be a little bit less of a factor in 2013 as compared to 2012. But we'll get in, I think, into some more detail on that next week.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And just to follow up on ASPs, my understanding is that the strong smartphone adoption that's happening in the emerging markets has been driven in part because the smartphone ASPs have come down. I think, Paul, you were talking recently about the price points getting to $100 and, at some point, maybe going down as low as $50. And I'm just trying to reconcile that with the comments around ASPs at the low end running up, and hence, supporting the outlook of flat to up ASPs in 2013.","Derek K. Aberle","This is Derek. Let me just try to take part of that, and then if Paul wants to add on. I think there's still -- even though the pricing from smartphone is coming down tier, which obviously is a positive for driving growth, there still is a meaningful gap between sort of the lower-end smartphone and the low-end 2G or 3G feature phones that have been sold before those became available. So as we look out and we see the trends, I think we do continue to expect, even as the prices come down, a combination of more people buying at a higher price than they were historically on a feature phone as well as people migrating to even the higher-tier devices will provide some stability there.","Operator","Craig Berger with FBR Capital Markets.","Craig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just based on your next fiscal year revenue guidance and operating profit, it seems like you expect gross margins to go down and that -- at least, a little bit. And that seems somewhat counterintuitive to your higher content for chipset commentary. So can you just explain the kind of how you're looking at gross margins for next year and then the emerging market impacts as well?","William E. Keitel","The -- Craig, the primary driver when you're looking year-over-year at either estimating the gross margin or looking on our guidance on the operating margin, it's really the facts that we see the QCT business growing at a significantly higher rate than the QTL business. And obviously, QTL gross margins and operating margins are much higher than they are for QCT. But both businesses were looking to grow by double digit next year. It's just QCT at a much higher rate. And for both businesses, we'll get a little more into operating margin discussion next week. But both of them, we expect, to perform a very good and healthy operating margin next year.","Operator","This concludes today's allotted time for questions and answers. Dr. Jacobs, do you have anything further to add before adjourning the call?","Paul E. Jacobs","Yes, I just wanted to say I'm really happy that the year turned out so well. And it was a little harder year than I had anticipated. Obviously, the very beginning of the year, we had our engineering teams working feverishly to get chipsets done. They did that so well. And then we ran into supply constraints and had talked to customers about not being able to give them everything that they wanted, and you add that to a somewhat uncertain macroeconomic environment. But in the end of the day, global demand for data and for mobile data and smartphones and tablets and all these device just pulled it really through. And I think that's a testament to the employee base, the focus that they had and just the worldwide excitement around mobile technology. And now looking forward, continue to execute with great team of people. We've got some great products coming out that we're already getting good traction on. A lot of new technologies, a lot of very interesting markets that are expanding. I'm very, very excited by the opportunities that lie in front of us. So I hope to see you all next week, and we'll get chance to go into a little bit more detail on that.

The playback number for today's call is 877-660-6853. International callers, please dial 201-612-7415. The playback reservation number is 13695634.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mauricio Lopez-Hodoyan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Lopez-Hodoyan, please go ahead.","Mauricio Lopez-Hodoyan","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Today's call will include prepared remarks by Steve Mollenkopf and Akash Palkhiwala. In addition, Cristiano Amon, Alex Rogers, and Don Rosenberg will join the question-and-answer session. You can access our earnings release and the slide presentation that accompany this call on our Investor Relations website. In addition, this call is being webcast on qualcomm.com, and a replay will be available on our website later today.","During the call today, we will use non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G, and you can find the related reconciliations to GAAP on our website. We will also make forward-looking statements, including projections and estimates of future events, business or industry trends or business or financial results. Actual events or results could differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K which contain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","And now to comments from Qualcomm's Chief Executive Officer, Steve Mollenkopf.","Steve Mollenkopf","Thank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report strong results in the fourth quarter with non-GAAP earnings of $0.78 per share, above the high end of our guidance range on solid performance in our licensing business. We are also pleased to see our licensing revenue return to a seasonal pattern with fiscal Q1 as a high, based on our recent licensing agreement with Apple. Over the last several years, we have invested to establish Qualcomm as a leader in 5G. As a reminder, 5G brings a significant increase in complexity over 4G, such as new and dense network architectures, high performance basebands, advanced RF front end designs, increased processing requirements, in addition to driving the leading edge process node.","We are actively focused on helping to define and standardize releases 16 and 17 features to support the expansion of 5G into new large adjacent markets such as enterprise, industrial IoT and automotive. The complexity and expansion of cellular technologies beyond the smartphone into nearly every industry play directly to Qualcomm's strengths and are why we believe 5G will represent the single biggest opportunity in Qualcomm's history.","Looking ahead to fiscal year 2020, the Company remains focused on these three key priorities. Number one, continue executing on 5G with our partners around the world. The number of OEMs and operators launching 5G products and services continues to increase throughout the year. There are now over 40 OEMs and over 30 operators launching or announcing 5G products or commercial service, up from approximately 20 OEMs and operators respectively at the start of the year. Looking forward, we expect 5G to launch in all regions, within the next two years to three years.","On the product side, in September, we announced plans to accelerate 5G global commercialization at scale by expanding our portfolio of 5G mobile platforms into the Snapdragon 7 Series and 6 Series, launching as early as calendar Q1 2020. Our integrated 5G SoCs will support both sub-6 gigahertz and millimeter wave at the volume tiers across all geographies.","As we continue to expand our 5G product portfolio, our design wins are also increasing. We now have over 230 5G design wins launched or in development, up from 150 in the prior quarter, virtually, all of which are using our RF front-end solutions for 5G sub-6 and\/or millimeter wave. Notably, multiple OEMs are now shipping or have announced their second or third 5G device models using both our Snapdragon 5G core chipset and our modem to antenna RF front-end solution. In Korea, the migration to 5G continues at a strong pace. According to the Korean Ministry of Science and ICT, Korean operators have already signed up 3.5 million 5G subscribers through September, a pace that remains faster than its migration to 4G. Additionally, 5G millimeter wave services are in planning stages by Korean carriers for calendar 2020.","In the United States, Verizon has committed to deploy 5G Ultra Wideband millimeter wave in 30 markets by year-end and T-Mobile separately announced plans to cover 200 million people with 5G on 600 megahertz before the end of this year. And in Europe, there are multiple 5G launches across Switzerland, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Germany.","In China, all three mobile operators commercially launched 5G services last week bringing 5G to the largest smartphone subscriber base in the world.","We now estimate that by the end of this year, the three operators will deploy a total of approximately 130,000 5G base stations. We further estimate that by the end of 2020, 5G base station deployments will increase to approximately 1 million which to put in context is 10 times the scale of the entire network of a large US operator.","Lastly, TSMC recently attributed the significant increase in demand for their leading technology nodes to a stronger outlook for 5G deployment next year. This is yet another significant indicator of the 5G ramp into 2020.","Second priority, to expand our technology platform into adjacent industry segments. In automotive, we are very encouraged with the engagement and design win traction we are experiencing from automakers and Tier 1 customers with our Telematics and third-generation Snapdragon automotive cockpit solutions. Our design win pipeline has now increased to almost $6.5 billion, up from $5 billion at the start of the fiscal year, giving us great visibility into strong growth in auto over the next several years. Over time, as the technology roadmap in auto converges with the cellular roadmap, we expect to see an increased opportunity to lead in new product categories, notably ADAS.","In compute, we continue to build traction in the Windows on Snapdragon always-on, always-connected PC category. In August, Samsung announced the Galaxy Book S, based on the Snapdragon 8cx. This is the Samsung second Windows on Snapdragon device, and the first announced Snapdragon 8cx always-connected PC.","In October, Microsoft launched the Surface Pro X, our first design with Microsoft in this premium tier, powered by a Snapdragon 8cx variant that is designed for the always-on compute environment, the Microsoft SQ1 developed in partnership with Microsoft. This is the finest surfaced ever and has three times the performance per watt of the Surface Pro 6.","Priority three, drive revenue growth, operating leverage and earnings per share. Consistent with our comments last quarter, we continue to expect a positive inflection point as 5G ramps beginning in our fiscal second quarter. With the conclusion of our cost plan and significant share repurchases over the last year, we are poised to deliver margin expansion, an outsized growth in earnings and earnings per share as revenue growth accelerates.","We are pleased with the progress we have made over the course of 2019 and believe the business is very well positioned for sustained long-term growth as we benefit from the decisions and investments made over the last several years, including 5G, the return of Apple licensing and product revenues, growth in RF front-end and growth in adjacent businesses.","Before I turn the call over to Akash, I'd like to congratulate him on becoming Qualcomm's Chief Financial Officer. As QCT Finance Lead for the past four years, Akash brings a deep knowledge base of our company, both operationally and strategically. I'm looking forward to working closely with Akash as we enter this next chapter of our history.","I would now like to turn the call over to Akash.","Akash Palkhiwala","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. It is a very exciting time to become Chief Financial Officer of Qualcomm and I'm looking forward to engaging with our shareholders and analysts. I will begin with a discussion of our fiscal fourth quarter earnings. We delivered strong results with non-GAAP EPS of $0.78, $0.03 above the high end of our guidance range, and revenues of $4.8 billion, above the midpoint of our guidance range.","The outperformance in the quarter was primarily driven by QTL on higher units and stronger mix resulting in QTL revenues of $1.16 billion and EBT margin of 68%. As a reminder, we did not record any royalty revenues from Huawei in our fiscal fourth quarter results. QCT delivered revenues of $3.6 billion and $152 million MSM chip shipments, in line with our expectations for the quarter. QCT's EBT margin was approximately 14%, flat sequentially and at the midpoint of our guidance range.","Turning to fiscal 2019, we recorded $19.4 billion in non-GAAP revenues and $3.54 in non-GAAP earnings per share. During the year, we achieved several key milestones that position us favorably for fiscal 2020 and beyond. First, our early investments in 5G played a key role in accelerating 5G deployments and we have secured over 230 chipset design wins. Second, we completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in RF360 Holdings and established a strong design win pipeline for RF front-end products across 5G sub-6 and millimeter wave devices.","Third, we signed global patent license and multi-year chipset supply agreements with Apple. Fourth, we concluded our cost reduction plan announced in January 2018. And lastly, since our July 2018 announcement, we have completed approximately $23 billion in stock repurchase through fiscal 2019, at an average price of $65 per share, resulting in a 22% reduction of our shares outstanding.","Turning to our outlook, we are maintaining our estimate of 1.7 billion to 1.8 billion units for calendar 2019 for global 3G, 4G, 5G device forecast. For calendar 2020, we are estimating 1.75 billion to 1.85 billion units, up approximately 3% at the midpoint, reflecting flat handsets and low double-digit growth in non-handsets. We are estimating 175 million to 225 million 5G handset units in calendar 2020.","Consistent with our comments on our previous earnings call, our business outlook is impacted by several factors including weaker demand in China and certain developed regions, Huawei share gain in China and OEMs managing 4G inventory ahead of the transition to 5G.","Turning to our first quarter guidance for fiscal 2020, we expect revenues to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $5.2 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.80 to $0.90. We estimate fiscal first quarter QTL revenues to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion and EBT margin of 70% to 74%. We expect QTL revenues to be up 21% sequentially at the midpoint in our fiscal first quarter due to normal holiday seasonality driven by timing of flagship phone launches. Our fiscal first quarter forecast does not include any royalty revenues from Huawei while we continue to pursue a negotiated resolution of the licensing dispute.","With the completion of the global patent license agreement with Apple earlier this year, QTL revenues will begin to reflect a seasonally high fiscal first quarter. Following the seasonal uplift, we expect QTL revenues to return to a range of $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion in our fiscal second quarter.","In QCT, we estimate fiscal first quarter MSM shipments of 145 million units to 165 million units and EBT margin in the range of 10% to 12%. QCT's EBT margin guidance reflects lower volume in the premium and high tiers, driven by a pause ahead of the transition to 5G in early calendar 2020 and the normal timing of handset launches by our customers in these tiers. As we look beyond our fiscal first quarter, we see a significant inflection point for QCT as we expect to realize the benefits from the ramp of 5G handset launches. In the fiscal second quarter, we anticipate QCT revenues to grow in the mid-teens sequentially and QCT EBT margin to return to the mid-teens.","In our fiscal first quarter, we expect non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses to be flat to down 2% sequentially. As a reminder, expenses are typically higher in our fiscal second quarter as it includes the normal calendar resets for certain employee-related costs.","Interest expense net of investment and other income in the fiscal first quarter is expected to be approximately $100 million and is a reasonable estimate for each of the remaining quarters in fiscal 2020. For our fiscal first quarter, we also estimate approximately 1.16 billion weighted average shares outstanding and a tax rate of 14%.","Looking forward, 2020 is an exciting year for Qualcomm as we expect the financial upside of our 5G strategy to begin to play out with multiple drivers of non-GAAP revenue and earnings growth, including the launch of 5G devices, RF front-end design win traction, growth in adjacencies combined with operating leverage and a substantially reduced share count.","We look forward to seeing you in New York at our Analyst Day on November 19th, where we will be providing additional details about our long-term growth strategy. Thank you.","And, I will now turn the call back over to Mauricio.","Mauricio Lopez-Hodoyan","Thank you, Akash. Operator, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Caso with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Caso","Yes, thank you. Good evening. I guess, first question would be on the pace of the 5G ramp as we proceed through the fiscal year, you've given some indications on where you expect overall revenue to be, if you could talk about that in percentage terms of 5G as a percentage of the mix as it goes through the year even on revenue terms or MSM terms, whatever you could do to give us some sense of how 5G penetrates as the year goes on?","Cristiano Amon","Thanks, Chris. This is Cristiano. Consistent I think with what we just said, in the earnings call, I think timing, our fiscal Q2 is that we started to see the inflection point as the devices have just started to show up in volumes and overall I think mix, we expect that to be ramping in the high and the premium tier and some of the markets that we've seen launching 5G, within that, we provide a metric before that we will see probably 1.5 times the ASP as we look at higher content, both the modem as well as the RF front-end.","Chris Caso","Okay, thank you. And as a follow-on for that maybe you could give us some commentary on how that impacts QCT margins as the year progresses. Obviously, you've got that additional content. The margins are depressed that you're making the transition now, what should we expect as the year goes on those QCT margins?","Akash Palkhiwala","Yes. Hi, Chris. This is Akash. The way you should think about the year playing out for QCT with 5G is really there is going to be two inflection points in the chip business. The first inflection point will be flagship launches in early 2020 by both our global and Chinese OEMs and you should think of it as RMB3000 and above handsets will start adopting 5G. The second inflection point will be in the fall time frame when another set of flagship devices will adopt 5G. So that should be kind of the shape of 5G adoption through the year, and how this translates into margin is, we gave guidance for our second quarter margin. We are expecting from first to second quarter revenue will go up mid-teens and operating margins will also be in the mid-teens range in the second quarter. We are not guiding longer term margins at this point, but we will talk about it at Analyst Day as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","James Faucette","Thank you very much. I wanted to ask kind of a follow-up to that and maybe, Cristiano, you can talk about where you see Qualcomm where it's particularly strong positioned in terms of like, if we look at flagships down through the different tiers of phones, where you've talked a lot about design wins, but where should we expect you to show up most strongly versus where may there be a bit more variety of suppliers?","Cristiano Amon","Thanks for the question, James, We updated our design pipeline. The design pipeline is about now 230 plus 5G devices across now multiple tiers. It's up substantially since 6 months ago, and I'll answer your question in two ways. First, I think, it's been very clear that our early investments in millimeter wave have provided Qualcomm with a significant technology advantage in having the technology to maturity and we're optimistic about millimeter wave going from the United States initial launches into Korea and Japan and other markets, including being license already in Europe where Telecom Italia was the first one happening throughout 2020, that's a very good thing for Qualcomm.","Having said that, I would probably say that every single launch of a flagship OEM today with the exception of Huawei, they use their own silicon, every other launch of every other OEM has been a Qualcomm Snapdragon platform, and that positioned us very well about partnering with OEMs for 5G ramp including Samsung, which we have not only launched with the traditional markets, but also I point you to the A Series, which is the second tier below the flagship that are being launching with Qualcomm globally in addition to the Galaxy Fold.","So those are positive things as we think 5G transition for Qualcomm","James Faucette","Great. And then follow-up question, maybe for Steve and Don. You mentioned that you're in ongoing negotiations with Huawei, but haven't reached any agreement as of yet. How do you think or what needs to happen to move an agreement across the line? And are we going to is -- I guess I'm wondering how China-US trade relations and potential resolution or at least a trade agreement may factor into those negotiations and conversations with Huawei?","Steve Mollenkopf","James, it's Steve. So we continue to talk to Huawei. I would characterize the discussions as ongoing, but really nothing to report on. Obviously, we don't have the numbers. We don't have any revenue in the numbers right now for licensing revenue. In terms of how the trade discussions between the two countries impact the probability or chance that we can get a resolution, I think it's too early to tell. I think it's pretty opaque at the moment. it's good that we're talking, but there's really nothing to report on right now. And you know that the product business for us is actually quite small. We tend to be a little bit more insulated I think from the trade talks compared to maybe other companies, but too early to tell in terms of what it will mean to the licensing discussions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Samik Chatterjee","Hi, thanks for taking the question. I would just wanted to start off firstly on the -- by focusing a bit on the RF front-end opportunity. You mentioned that most of the design wins you're seeing kind of both the modem and the RF front-end go together. So just wanted to kind of get your thoughts about how you're thinking about market share in RF front-end and the early-generation 5G phones to do some of the incumbents in the space and then how should we think about sustaining that market share and kind of the second-generation, third-generation 5G phones? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.","Cristiano Amon","Thanks for the question. So, we look at 5G as the key entry point for RF front-end business and we're very satisfied with the ability as we started to look into the designs with the 5G content, which are specifically sub-6 spectrum as well as millimeter wave spectrum. We actually have seen a very high percentage. Virtually, all of the 230-plus designs now for 5G content have Qualcomm modem to antenna design. We have seen in those devices, some of our existing incumbents continue to support and provide content for 4G, but the 5G position of Qualcomm is very strong. What we are very happy especially at this time, as we head into the Q2 ramp of 5G, we see now as we go into second-generation designs for these -- for the second-generation devices as well as lower tiers, we have maintained that pattern. So we're now going into design number two and design number three that maintain the 5G caught on the RF front-end and we're very happy with that development.","Samik Chatterjee","Okay. And if I can just follow-up, you've talked extensively about the opportunity on 5G handsets. If you can help me quantify the revenue opportunity outside of handsets, be it like small cells or IoT that is also tied to 5G opportunity, but outside of handsets? Just looking for some color there.","Cristiano Amon","Yes. So I may give you the first part of the answer, and I'll ask Akash to add. Devices and smartphones are definitely going to be the vast majority of the earnings, especially as we had in 2020 is how 5G is going to ramp. However, we are happy about the 5G traction in all of our adjacents from upgrade of Telematics in automotive to 5G, we've seen a lot of industrial IoT applications and even our small cell business is getting traction including with traditional infrastructure vendors. So we expect that to be a growth story in as we head into 2021 and '22. In '20 the ones I want to single out is CPE for mobile broadband. And that's part of a lot of the carriers deployment of 5G and fixed wireless.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Ross Seymore","Hi guys, congrats on the strong results and 5G color. I just wanted to see about the seasonality in the QCT side, Steve -- or QTL side, excuse me. Steve, you mentioned that you were happy it was returning to a seasonal pattern. You talked a little bit, I think Akash about what it was going to do in the fiscal second quarter. Can you just talk about the seasonality of that? Is the range that you've given in the past of kind of the $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, is that the new range in kind of the weak quarters and the stronger quarters be closer to the $1.4 billion you just did? Or how should we think about that as the year progresses?","Akash Palkhiwala","Yes, hi, Ross, this is Akash. I think that's a fair way of thinking about it. We just reported actuals for the September quarter at $1.16 billion and we are guiding the December quarter at the midpoint of $1.4 billion and the March quarter at $1.1 billion. So that kind of gives you a sense of the seasonality in the business, and those are fair numbers to use to project the business going forward.","Ross Seymore","Thanks for that. As my follow-up, perhaps one for Cristiano on the revenue per MSM side of things, just would hope to get a little more color on why is that going down sequentially in your fiscal first quarter guidance. And perhaps more importantly, it seems like it's up very nicely, almost 12% year-over-year in fiscal ' 19 and still despite that sequential decline in your fiscal first quarter is still up, the better part of 10% there. I was wondering what's driving the sequential decline, the year-over-year increases. And then, if that's all pre-5 G, how should we think about the lift off of this level?","Cristiano Amon","All right, Ross. So our ASP per MSM has a very high sensitivity to high and premium tiers and I guess if you look at what happened in the quarter and the guide for the next one, I think consistent with what we said on the last earnings call that we're going to see the dynamic throughout the calendar year. We have seen a weaker market, weaker demand in China and that combined with Huawei gaining share in domestic China as well, that's one dynamic. The other dynamic is OEMs canceled some of the 4G flagships and moved their portfolio towards 5G getting ahead of the launch. So that created basically a change in the composition of MSM because of the high and premium tier units as we go through that transition. However, the inflection point for Q2 is where you started to see the effect and when we talk about at the 1.5 times. If anything, the guide that we provide in Q2, it contemplates the core market environment, the typical seasonality of our business, no significant changes in OEM share and does not include yet the ramp of the Apple business, you will see that change just with the 1.5 which in average has higher ASP content on the modem plus the RF front-end.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.","Matt Ramsay","Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Congratulation Akash. I guess, Steve, my first question is around the 5G unit numbers that you gave for calendar '20, I guess the midpoint that you guys have laid out is 200 million units. Maybe you could give a little color on what you're assuming the geographic mix of those units is, in particular, what percentage might be China versus rest of world? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Akash Palkhiwala","Yes, hi Matt, this is Akash. So the way we thought about the 5G forecast for 2020 is a couple of ways. We looked at the tops-down of how transitions have typically happened in previous generations. And the one - - the two things that are different with 5G versus transition from 3G to 4G is China is adopting 5G at the same time as the other geographies versus in 4G they were a couple of years late. And then also within 5G, we are seeing multiple tiers of products being launched simultaneously, which we did not have for 4G. So that's why we think the intensity of the 5G rollout is actually faster and you have China as a big portion of it happening early in the lifecycle. Of course, in addition to that, we are obviously talking to all of our OEM customers and we have a very good sense of how many devices they are planning to launch over the next and several months with 5G and at what price points and that also allows us to inform our tops-down forecast.","Matt Ramsay","Got it, that's really helpful. As my follow-up a quick one for Alex on the licensing agreements and obviously we're all encouraged to see the progress you've made on 5G. There has also been this dynamic of SEP-only licenses become a bigger piece of the mix and some implications for the implied royalty rate. I know that moves around a bit, but I think you guys talked about in an answer to an earlier question about how to model the QTL business going forward. I wonder if we're now at relative steady state for implied royalty rates as we go forward? Any comments there would be helpful. Thank you.","Alex Rogers","So, I think that may be a fair way to look at it, but I think what -- the way you should look at it for guidance is we're guiding revenue. And so, as we noted, we're going to see seasonality and we're going to see the remaining quarters at the range that we identified, and of course, that's without the Huawei numbers, but we have made really good progress with signing up 5G agreements. We have over 75 agreements now in place since we started our 5G licensing program. So I think that reflects a very strong IP position. But I think again, if you look to our guidance on revenue, that's probably the easiest way to think about it.","Akash Palkhiwala","And Matt, this is a Akash. Just a quick reminder that our revenue guidance numbers does not include Huawei. So as that gets resolved, that would be incremental to the range.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.","Stacy Rasgon","Thanks for taking my questions. Around the March quarter on QCT guide. So units in March quarter for MSM units are typically down seasonally, you're obviously guiding revenues up mid-teens on the 5G ramp. So is that all or even maybe more than 100% due to increases in revenue per MSM, like is it with the 5G ramp itself and content is enough to offset the normal seasonal decline in unit shipments? Or are you seeing kind of like an ending of the flush that we've been having and maybe a reversal with some fillers when the new products get in. How do we think about that unit versus ASP trend in that -- embedded in that March quarter revenue guide for chipsets?","Akash Palkhiwala","Yes, hi, Stacy. So there are couple of factors. This is Akash by the way. There are couple of factors that affect our second quarter numbers for units and ASP. You're correct about the seasonal -- seasonally lower quarter, but that is also offset by a stronger mix because we launched our new premium tier chip and new high tier chip during that quarter as well. So there is a mix implication before we get to the 5G benefit. And then the third factor is our -- what we have disclosed previously, which is with 5G devices on a like-for-like device basis, we expect 1.5x monetization as a combination of the chipset and the RF front-end revenue on top of it. So those are kind of the three factors that impact the volume and price revenue per MSM mix in that quarter.","Stacy Rasgon","Thanks. And maybe just a follow-up on that. So, you mentioned 1.5 times content increase, but at the same time, you also mentioned multiple tiers launching simultaneously, which is something we didn't really see in 4G. So how do we think about that, I guess that -- that differential of those drivers on content increase overall versus the general, a mix of tiers that are launching, and do you think that is enough to keep revenue per MSM rising through 2020 -- through fiscal 2020 as 5G becomes more mainstream?","Akash Palkhiwala","Yes, so the way we think about the 1.5x is really for a given tier device, so comparing a premium tier to a premium tier device, when you go from 5G -- 4G to 5 G, the revenue opportunity increases by 1.5x. And then this would also apply to the tiers as it penetrates further down, and so you should, you should think of that as a mechanism of modeling our business as the mix improves from 4G to 5G","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Mitch Steves","Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to focus a little bit back just on the pricing you guys are getting. So I realized this to be down a little bit in December quarter. But, so two really clarifications. If Huawei does come back, would you get an implied ASP that goes up or down? And then secondly, how do we think about that kind of ramping over the next 12 months. I mean, I think most models have it going up a few dollars. But is that rate still or do you guys think it needs to be changed after seeing the mix come through?","Alex Rogers","So, this is Alex. You're asking about on the licensing side or is --","Mitch Steves","Yes.","Alex Rogers","Okay. Look, again, the way we think about it is that -- Akash maybe weigh in here, the way we think about it is that Huawei is incremental and I'm not sure what more to say to that other than what we've already provided by way of guide.","Mitch Steves","Okay. I guess, maybe we should return to Huawei piece that if that comes back is that, are you going to be increasing ASPs, or you think that the ASPs will be flattish or similar?","Akash Palkhiwala","Yes, the way -- this is Akash, Mitch. The way you should think about Huawei is we don't have Huawei units or revenue contemplated in the QTL guide at this point. So when Huawei gets included into the guide, it would be based on what their device ASP is and our licensing deal with them. So it will just fall out of the agreement that we end up having with Huawei.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Rod Hall","Yes, hi guys, thanks for the question. I wanted to just go back to the progress of 5G and particularly millimeter wave attach. And I wonder, Cristiano, if you could talk a little bit about -- of the 230 wins or maybe Steve, you want to address this, how many of those have millimeter waves attached to them or at least some version of them? And then as we get to the flagship launches at the beginning of next year, kind of proportionally, how does it look? And then as we get to the end of next year, how does that look? Do we do we get to most phones by beginning of next year having millimeter wave attach or some smaller proportion? Could you just walk us through that and then I have a follow-up.","Cristiano Amon","Rod, thanks for the question. So the way to think about it, it's pretty much at this point by market, for example, the United States market, all of the devices they have launched, there is a requirement for millimeter wave that the spectrum utilized by all of the three of the four carriers right now and therefore we have seen the initial launches of millimeter wave. Going into 2020, the current planning assumption is you're going to start to see millimeter wave also coming in the Korean market, is going to come into the Japan market, and in the later part of '20 and beginning 2021, you start to see that in Europe. And that's how it's going to change the mix. So right now, you should look at some of the China launches that we're going to see in '20, they're all going to be sub-6,and the Europe in '22 first half will be sub-6, Japan, Korea, and United States are going to have millimeter wave. That's how to think about it.","Rod Hall","And is it your -- Cristiano, just to follow that up, is it your assumption then or our assumption should be that every market that has millimeter wave deployed in the wireless network, you would expect to see millimeter wave attach to most phones in that market. Is that correct?","Cristiano Amon","That's correct. Especially because you have in the wireless industry today you have probably a single SKU launched by an operator within their entire geography, even if you're going to have some markets with millimeter wave, some markets with sub-6, that has been the requirement of a millimeter wave capability in many of those 5G devices.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","C.J. Muse","Yes, good afternoon, and thank you for taking the question. I guess to follow-up on the last question, as you think about the 200 million 5G unit market plus or minus in 2020, what percentage do you believe will have millimeter waves? And then as part of that question, can you kind of talk through the tax rate that you're seeing on RF front-end for you guys at sub-6 versus millimeter wave. I would assume a much higher rate there on millimeter.","Steve Mollenkopf","Hi, let me answer in reverse order. So, on the Snapdragon platform today, the attach rate on millimeter wave in sub-6 is the same. I think we have modem to antenna designs including RF front-end in all of the Snapdragon. There are very few exceptions, and sometimes exception is just one or another band and is very small quantities. I will say the absolutely majority of the devices, we've been winning RF front-end across millimeter wave and sub-6, is not unique to millimeter wave. However, millimeter wave drives a lot more content because unlike sub-6 you need multiple antenna modules and multiple RF change of millimeter wave. So the content is disproportionately higher on the millimeter wave side.","Akash Palkhiwala","C.J., on the mix of sub-6 versus millimeter wave within the 200 million, at this point, we're not disclosing a mix really. But the way to best think about it is what as Cristiano mentioned earlier, is by market and so there are certain markets, US and then Japan and Korea next year, where millimeter wave would be required from an operator perspective. And so those markets would have millimeter wave. So the best way to think about it is a mix of markets","C.J. Muse","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question","Timothy Arcuri","Hi, thanks. I wanted to just clarify the answer that you had to a prior question on the March guidance for QCT. So are you basically implying that units are going to maybe be seasonal plus just [indiscernible] and most of the increase in QCT revenue in March is ASP. Is that right?","Akash Palkhiwala","Yes, I think the units will have kind of the regular cadence of seasonality, maybe with some increase that's driven by 5G launches, but primarily it will be a mix of the tier mix within the chips we have and then also the 4G versus 5G mix.","Timothy Arcuri","Okay. And then I guess just following on to that then if you're not getting much of the unit benefit yet in March, obviously you're going to eventually have to see that unit benefit. So, how sustainable is the growth in QCT revenue into fiscal Q3 when you would I would think see much more of the unit growth in that quarter? Thanks.","Akash Palkhiwala","So from a market perspective, the way we are planning our business going forward is, we're assuming the current market dynamics hold, and within that, our benefit as the transition happens to 5G and then so that's -- that should be the basis for the assumptions for next year. Now, as we have both kind of initial set of 5G launches happen and then additional 5G all launches happen across flagship models later in the year, we will see our operating margin ramp in addition to revenue per MSM as we see the benefit of 5G going through our portfolio.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brett Simpson with Arete Research. Please proceed with your question.","Brett Simpson","Yes, thanks very much. Cristiano, I just have a couple of questions, maybe first up on the 5G outlook for calendar 2020. You're talking about 200 million units at the midpoint. And I know other chipmakers who have reported in the last week or so were talking more like 300 million units globally for 5G next year. I just wanted to sort of delve in a little bit into your assumptions. Are you expecting the large flagship launches next year to be only 5G or do you expect global flagships to also be 4G in that outlook? And anything you can tell us about what your assumptions are for China within that 5G outlook you've given would be very helpful. Thanks.","Cristiano Amon","Excellent question, so let me break that down. As we said earlier in this earnings call, I think Akash also mentioned this. We are assuming existing market dynamics. And I think that's why you probably see us in a more conservative estimate. If you believe that there is a pent-up demand for 5G devices and it's kind of consistent with other transitions, you could have a change in replacement rates and that's going to drive a bigger market, bigger market is even better news for Qualcomm. So we're just assuming existing market dynamics in our projections. Now, going back to the outlook in '20, we talk a lot about the dynamics on Q2, but maybe to add to the prior question, you should expect as we get into the second half of '20, then we're going to see the addition of Apple volumes and so that's, you should think about really a 5G ramp for Qualcomm in 2020.","Your last question is about China. The order of magnitude of deployment in China is significant in we said during the script that it's now the projection is 1 million [indiscernible] or base stations by 2020. That's going to drive a very aggressive migration. So China could also be upside if the market dynamics don't hold and you have higher replacement rates, and also if you assume that the current Huawei share gains in China, which we're assuming as our going assumption if that changes and get to some more normal levels, that's upside as well.","Brett Simpson","And maybe if I can just ask a quick follow up here, just to clarify on the RF front-end side, when you talk about modem to antenna in 5G, are you also including 4G modules, 4G RF modules, like low band, mid high band etcetera? Or are you really talking about ultra high band RF and also just on millimeter wave because I know there's a lot of investors questioning the viability of millimeter wave at the moment. What are you doing in your second-generation millimeter wave platforms to improve things like battery life, or how do we think performance is going to pick up here? Thank you.","Cristiano Amon","Okay, maybe I'll -- two questions. Let me try to go quickly to them. So the first one is we have been very focused in 5G as the entry point. So we have been winning RF front-end in the 5G mid bands, and the 3.5 bands in some cases, and some of the reform bands as well at lower frequencies as well as millimeter wave. It's both. We continue to see the incumbents providing the 4G, but I pointed to what we're going to see in 2020 especially with dynamic spectrum sharing is going to be the re-farming of existing 4G bands, and we expect that to be an expansion of our existing 5G RF front-end solution. So that was the first question.","If you -- can you remind me the second question -- on the millimeter wave performance. Yes. So as we launched a new technology, there is a lot of features that come across the device and the infrastructure and they don't come all day one. So some of the initial I think battery life or even terminal, that was experienced by millimeter wave in the first-generation chipsets, they've already been addressed with software updates and we've seen a full day battery life on existing first-generation chipset. As we go to the second-generation Snapdragon, we see with across process node and evolution of our modern technology also significant improvements in battery life area for the millimeter wave footprint as well as terminals.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Srini [ph] with SMBC. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. Couple of follow-ups actually. I guess first on the 5G ASP boost. There has been a lot of talk about the chipset ASP boost, but I'm just curious, I mean do you see any benefit on the QTL side, I know, I think most of the 4G premium phones are probably already hitting your cap, but as we transition to 5G, what sort of benefit, if any, do you see on the QTL side?","Akash Palkhiwala","Hi Srini, this is Akash. When -- again kind of going back to history, what has happened from 3G to 4G and previous generations. We have seen typically an increase in replacement rates and an increase in ASPs when we go to a new generation. So that is certainly something that is possible and maybe even likely with 5G. For our business planning purposes, we are, as we said earlier, we are planning based on a market being consistent and then within that having a transition to 5G. So that could be an upside opportunity for us. That's not included. And then, you could also see users with low and mid-tier devices upgrade and buy higher tier devices because of the increased capability that 5G brings and that could help QTL ASPs as well, but again, that is not modeled into our business at this point.","Steve Mollenkopf","And one quick point with our early R&D and IP leadership, it's just a really good context for driving new agreements.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. And then Akash, on the margin front, at QCT, I know you said the margins will improve over the next few quarters. But my question is on a like-for-like basis, does 5G give you better margins? Meaning, if I go back to the second half of 2017, I think you hit your 20% and 21% EBIT margin for QCT at that time. Your revenue run rate was close to $1 billion. So when we get back to that kind of revenue run rate, do you expect the margins to be higher than the 20%, 21%?","Akash Palkhiwala","Yes. So Srini, at this point, we are not disclosing kind of separate margins for our 4G versus our 5G business or a specific target for long-term margins. But this is something we will address at Analyst Day. So if you can stay tuned for a couple of weeks and we'll plan to address it there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.","Vijay Rakesh","Yes. Just wondering -- just looking at the RF front-end wins that you're seeing into next year, if you could give us exiting calendar '20, what you see would be the mix of RFFE within your QCT or could you give us some dollar number on what you think your RFFE would be? Thanks.","Akash Palkhiwala","Hi, thanks for the question. We're not really breaking that down, but we did provide that metric of 1.5 times that include both the ASP increase in a 5G modem as well as our RF front-end content in average per tier.","Vijay Rakesh","Got it. And on the QCT side, I know you guys talked about a nice pickup with the mix going to 5G. What kind of ASP assumptions that you assuming on that as you go through 2020 especially as you might have some other merchant suppliers entering the market? Thanks.","Steve Mollenkopf","Well, the way to think about it is, we always have competition and there is nothing that we see in the market on the competitive side that is different than we expected and that is factored in our projections.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Walsh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Mr. Walsh, Your line is live. You may proceed with your question.","Patrick Walsh","Sorry about that. I had it on mute. I just had two quick questions. So the first question on the RF side, when you hear the traditional RF players, Qorvo Skyworks talk, they talk about a change in RF content from either 18 to 20 going to 25. And so my question for you, it seems like, initially you guys are focused more on that incremental $5 to $7. Is that a fair assessment and is the majority of that $5 to $7 made up by millimeter wave? And then if we think about that core 18 to 20 that's been historically there, are you really aiming for these kind of re-farmed band, and then I guess within the bands, can you -- do you have -- I know you have bought capacity via TDK, I wouldn't imagine it's too much just given that [indiscernible] and Qorvo have probably I think 80% of the capacity out there. So would you be targeting more like low-band paths?","Akash Palkhiwala","Patrick, in terms of kind of the ASP question you asked, I think the examples you were quoting was for a premium tier device. Really, as you look at different regions and you look at different frequency bands in a given region and tier of device, those numbers could be vastly different. So I think it's very difficult to generalize in terms of ASP advantages. The way you should think about that is, there is a certain market for RF front-end that exists. With 5G coming in, that is going to expand, and that's going to create an opportunity for us to significantly improve our share in the market. And then on top of that, as Cristiano mentioned, as DSS happens, dynamic spectrum sharing and bands get re-farmed to 5G, we'll be able to participate and further expand our revenue opportunity. So that's kind of the framework you should use.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Mollenkopf, do you have anything further to add before adjourning the call?","Steve Mollenkopf","Yes, thank you. I just want to thank the team -- the Qualcomm team for their hard work and the great execution through 2019. 2020 is the year of 5G. I want to thank everybody for their hard work, we're on the cusp of it, and I'm very excited about it.

In addition, Derek Aberle and Don Rosenberg will join the question-and-answer session. An Internet presentation and audio broadcast is accompanying this call and you can access them by visiting our website at www.qualcomm.com.","During this conference call, if we use non-GAAP financial measures defined in Regulation G, you can find the related reconciliations to GAAP on our website. I would also like to direct you to our 10-Q and earnings release, which were filed and furnished respectively with the SEC today and are available on our website.","During this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events or company results. Actual events or results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K and 10-Q, which contain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","Now, I would like to introduce QUALCOMM's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Paul Jacobs.","Paul Jacobs","Thank you, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone. We are off to a solid start in fiscal 2014, and we are pleased to report record revenues this quarter driven by strong growth in both, QTC and QTL.","Steve will provide more color on the businesses, but I did want to comment on the executive changes we recently announced. First, I am extreme pleased that Steve Mollenkopf will become our next Chief Executive Officer. He is an exceptional leader with a stellar track record over his 20 years at QUALCOMM.","Throughout his tenure, he has played a critical role in developing a number of new technologies and strengthen our relationships with our industry partners. This change will ensure management continuity, will allow me to work on new technologies and help set the future direction for the company as Executive Chairman of the Board. I look forward to continuing to work closely with Steve and the rest of management team.","Secondly, I wanted to thank our employees, customers and suppliers for their support over my tenure as CEO. We have seen tremendous change over the last almost nine years, I began my services CEO, we were predominantly known as the CDMA2000 Company.","Fast-forward to today and we have developed a broadly license and diversified portfolio of technologies not only from an air interface perspective, but also in many other mobile technologies such as computing and connectivity, with an industry-leading approach of integrating these core technologies that define the mobile experience.","Looking back, we had a vision for what a smartphone could be and we worked together with our partners to bring this vision to reality. Really dates back to the early 90s, when we had the idea to put the Internet protocols in to CDMA. We really knew that data will unlock tremendous opportunities for mobile devices. We were the first to put GPS in phones. We developed the first Palm OS based smartphone. We were pioneers in the mobile apps space with our Brew Appstore and we continue to lead with innovation such as first gigahertz smartphone processor and obviously more recently advanced multimedia technologies such as Ultra HD video capture and playback.","Looking forward, opportunities are vast. We work with our partners to help them expand their data capacity by up to 1,000 fold with solutions such as our small cells and other innovations such as LTE in unlicensed spectrum. We are helping to drive adoption of mobile technologies into several exciting new categories including automotive, healthcare and the connected home through our industry leading mobile computing connectivity offerings. And the AllSeen Alliance was recently formed to drive interoperability for the Internet of everything which is based on the use of the AllJoyn software framework.","Now this industry leadership and vision has translated into strong business performance with revenues more than quadrupling and EPS more than tripling since Fiscal 2005. In addition, we have returned over $25 billion in capital to stockholders during this timeframe and recently announced our intent to return 75% of free cash flow to stockholders. We expect that we will more than double the amount returned to stockholders over the next five years as compared to the last five years.","So we continue to be extremely excited about the future, but still in the early rounds of global smartphone adoption, we are in the early rounds of the transition to mobile computing and then we have this broad connection of the Internet of everything. So we have the right technologies and more importantly we have the team to execute on these opportunities ahead. So we are pleased with the start fiscal 2014 and I look forward to continue to work with our team to drive growth in the years ahead.","Thank you and I will now turn the call over to Steven Mollenkopf.","Steven Mollenkopf","Good afternoon, and thank you, Paul. I appreciate your kind words. I am humbled and extremely honored to have been named CEO elective of QUALCOMM. Under Paul's tenure as CEO, the company has established a leadership position in 3G, 4G and next-generation wireless technologies, developed a deep and diverse set of industry-leading mobile technologies and has generated extraordinary results. We are well-positioned to address the significant opportunities ahead and I look forward to guiding the company during its next phase of growth. Paul, I would like to thank you for your leadership and mentorship and I look forward to continuing to work closely with you in the years ahead. I am proud to have been given this opportunity and I look forward to assuming the CEO role in March.","Turning to our fiscal first-quarter. Our QTL and QCT delivered strong financial results and we are off to a solid start to fiscal 2014. In the quarter, we also returned approximately $1.6 billion to shareholders in dividends and buyback activity, consistent with the increased capital return targets that we outlined in November. QTL had a strong quarter, in line with our expectations with revenue and earnings before tax of 8% and 9% respectively, year-over-year. Total reported device sales by our licensees was a record and above the midpoint of our prior guidance range. Global smartphone adoption continues to be a key driver of royalty revenue growth. In the fiscal first quarter we saw increased sequential shipments by our licensees of smartphones in emerging regions. According to Gartner, emerging regions smartphone shipments are expected to grow at close to 30% CAGR between 2012 and 2017. Globally, Gartner expects approximately 7 billion smartphones to be shipped from 2013 to 20 17.","In QCT, revenues and MSM shipments were up 12% and 17% year-over-year respectively MSM shipments were above our expectations driven by demand in emerging regions. Actions taken to manage spending contributed to better than expected operating margins. From an operating expense standpoint, our outlook for moderate year-over-year growth remains on track. We are still investing in both the core businesses and new business opportunities and with our expense management initiatives this year, we continue to forecast that we will exit fiscal 2014 at a lower operating expense run rate for the company than we exited fiscal 2013.","Tuning to China. We are pleased to see that the 4G spectrum licenses have now been issued. We are working closely with the operators as well as domestic and international OEMs to meet this new growth opportunity. We continue to add single mode OFDMA licensees including in China. Given the high degree of similarity between the TDD and FDD modes of the international LTE standard and our position as the leading contributor to LTE, the royalty payable by our licensees under their single mode or OFDMA licenses are the same for devices that implement either or both of the TDD and FDD modes of LTE. QUALCOMM continues to invest heavily in developing the leading and the most widely licensed portfolio of patented technologies applicable to 3G and 4G devices.","For QTC, the growth of LTE, FDD and TDD in China aligns with our strength, both from supporting local Chinese OEMs looking to leverage LTE and build their business outside of China, as well as global OEMs hoping to leverage LTE growth to grow their businesses in China.","For each of these customer types, our multi-mode 3G LTE modem leadership and Snapdragon solutions, combined with our global launches position us well. We have over 70 3G LTE multi-mode designs with leading Chinese OEMs based on our Snapdragon 400 chipsets for the high-volume handset tier.","We believe the recently announced Snapdragon 410 with integrated LTE will also be the world's first 64-bit processor for the high-volume tier and will establish our 64-bit leadership there.","On the legal front, as we previously announced in November, the Chinese National Development and Reform Commission or NDRC, notified us that it had commenced an investigation of us related to the Chinese Anti-monopoly Law. The NDRC has advised us that the substance of the investigation is confidential. We will continue to cooperate with the NDRC as it conduct its investigation.","Globally, the momentum of Snapdragon-based devices continues to grow, with over 1,350 designs announced for shipping and more than 500 designs in the pipeline, including over 40 tablets. We are pleased with our design activity and anticipate good volume growth in flagship tablets, such as the new LG G Pad tablet, the Samsung Galaxy Note Pro and the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro announced at CES.","Looking ahead, our newly announced next-generation chipsets are progressing well and continue to demonstrate our leadership. Since Snapdragon to go five sets a new bar for performance and premium tablets and smartphones with end-to-end Ultra HD capability and the world's fastest mobile CPU. It is on track to ship in commercial devices in the first half of this calendar year and will help our customers take advantage of the increasing interest in Ultra HD across the entertainment and consumer electronics industries.","Our new 9x35 modem delivers our fourth generation of LTE, and is on track to extend our LTE leadership into Category 6. We have already demonstrated the world's first 300 megabits per second LTE Category 6 data session on Ericsson infrastructure and we expect to see our Category 6 modem in the cards, hotspots and smartphones this year.","Our overall Wi-Fi sales are strong and growing, with unit sales this quarter up 50% year-over-year and we have over 200 designs of our premium 802.11 AC solution in the pipeline. Our RF 360 family of products also continues to progress well. Our envelope tracking solution has been shipping for a number of months and is in key devices such as the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, the Google Nexus 5 and the LTE Nubia 5S.","Our dynamic antenna tuner recently launched in flagship Lumia 1520 and remaining RF 360 products are on track to ship later this fiscal year as expected. In closing, we are off to a solid start in the first fiscal quarter and we see the year developing broadly in line with our previous expectations.","That conclude my remarks and I would now like to turn the call over to George Davis.","George Davis","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results came in above expectations on solid operating performance and the positive net impact of certain discrete items. Fiscal first-quarter revenues were a record $6.6 billion, up 10% year-over-year and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.26 above our prior guidance range.","Our results this quarter included a $655 million gain or $0.25 per share related to the sale of substantially all of our Omnitracs business. We also recorded a $444 million impairment or $0.20 per share in other expenses related to the fab assets in our QMT business.","The remaining items in other expenses impacted results by an additional $0.01 per share. In total, these items added a net $0.04 per share gain to results. Excluding these items, our non-GAAP EPS would be $1.22 per share or $0.07 above the midpoint of guidance and $0.02 above the high-end of our guidance range. Result in QCT and in our treasury portfolio was a major contributor to above expectation performance.","In QTL, total reported device sales by our licenses were a record $61.6 billion, up 16% year-over-year and above the mid-point of our guidance range, with an average selling price of $222 at the mid-point and shipments of $278 million 3G\/4G based devices at the mid-point. We saw strength in both emerging and developed regions with increased penetration of smartphones into lower tiers. Emerging regions continue to show the highest unit growth rates for 3G\/4G based devices.","QCT earnings before tax were above expectations with record revenues of $4.6 billion and record shipments of 213 million MSMs. Revenue per MSM was lower sequentially reflecting a higher mix of thin modems and increased MSM shipments for emerging regions. QCT operating margin was 20% in the fiscal first quarter above our prior expectations reflecting actions to manage spending in the quarter. For the company overall, non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses were below our guidance decreasing 3% sequentially primarily driven by our QCT business.","Turning to capital structure. During the fiscal first quarter, we returned approximately $1.6 billion to stockholders including approximately $600 million of dividends paid and $1 billion in stock purchases. As of the end of the first fiscal quarter, we had approximately $3.8 billion remaining of the $5 billion stock repurchase authorization announced in September of last year. Cash flow from operations was very strong again this quarter at approximately $2.8 billion or 42% of revenues. Timing of shipments in Q4 and Q1 led to a higher than normal reduction in receivables which was the major factor in our above trend working capital and cash flow performance. We ended the fiscal quarter with cash and marketable securities of $31.6 billion.","Now turning to our guidance for fiscal 2014. Our outlook for the fiscal year is mostly unchanged but we are increasing our earnings per share guidance to adjust for the above expectation performance in the fiscal first quarter, modestly tempered by a somewhat softer outlook in our fiscal second quarter. We expect fiscal 2014 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $5 to $5.20, up approximately 13% year-over-year at the midpoint relative to 2013 and up $0.05 at the midpoint from our prior guidance.","As it is still very early in the year we are also holding our forecast for calendar 2014 3G\/4G based device shipments, however we do see some potential upside to our forecast perfectly related to LTE deployment in China. We are also holding the midpoint of our calendar 2013 3G\/4G device shipment estimate, although modestly narrowing the range. As we outlined in November, we forecast improving trends in the second half of our fiscal year versus the first half. We expect higher device ASPs for QTL and a better mix of leading parts in QCT including the impact of LTE in China. We also continue to forecast favorable trends in product cost.","For the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $6.1 billion to $6.7 billion, flat to up approximately 9% year-over-year. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share in our fiscal second quarter to be approximately $1.15 to $1.25 per share, up 3% year-over-year at the midpoint. We anticipate second fiscal quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be slightly higher, up 1% to 3% sequentially, reflecting modest growth in R&D. In QTL, we estimate total reported device sales of $66.5 billion to $72.5 billion, it will be reported by licensees in the March quarter for shipments that they made in the December quarter, up approximately 14% year-over-year at the midpoint reflecting the busy holiday season. We estimate that the QTL device ASP will be relatively flat sequentially. In QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 180 million to 195 million units during the March quarter down 12% at the midpoint sequentially and up approximately 8% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect revenue per MSM to be up modestly on mix quarter-over-quarter. We expect QCT operating margin to be approximately 15% in the fiscal second quarter, lower sequentially as expected, reflecting the impact of lower seasonal volumes and the effects of annual pricing resets typical for this time of the year.","We continue to forecast QCT operating margins to be 18% to 20% for the full fiscal year.","That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren.","Warren Kneeshaw","Thank you, George. Brent, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Tim Long - BMO Capital Markets","Thank you. [Two] you mind if I could. Maybe could you give us some update? It looks again the calculator went down a little bit more. Was there anything in there, we are hitting more tabs what's going on with that?","Then secondly, if we could just get your perspective on China, collecting in China, particular as it seems like there has been a lot more three-mode products being announced relative to the five-mode? Do you think that changes the dynamic at all in collecting with the Chinese OEMs? Thank you.","Derek Aberle","Tim, this is Derek. On the rate question, I think again we have kind of gone through a numbers of times all the factors that move this thing around. This quarter, it's sort of a combination and probably for the few things you know TRDS obviously was up again another record, so again we get a little bit of a drag based on the fixed elements of the revenue. Also, you know, I think just given sort of the product launches there were some discounting going on during this quarter that impacted the deductions that our licensees take and so that has also an impact as I explained in New York a couple of months ago.","Then a little bit of OEM mix again, so a number things bounce around. I do think based on the visibility we have into next quarter that the rate should improve some into next quarter and we still believe kind of the range that we gave for the year is still where we think we are going to end up in and that was I think 31 to 33.","On China, really I think not much of a change from again what we went through in New York. Again, we are very active. We are continuing to negotiate agreements on single mode OFDM in China and we added some additional licensees to the mix here over the last quarter. We got a number of other discussions ongoing and expect some other agreements to get signed here hopefully in the next couple of months, so I think we are just continuing to do the work that we started several years ago to make sure we are in a position to collect and still feel comfortable that that will be the case.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Walkley Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead with your question.","Mike Walkley - Canaccord Genuity","Great. Thank you. Paul, just wanted to say congratulations on a great job of navigating some tough time this year with all those renegotiations a few years back. Steve, I just want to ask questions to you about the QCT operating margins. Doctor and the teams here in Q1 just seasonality, but can you talk about how you feel on the cost optimization programs and some of the steps that gives you confidence the recovery in the second half of the year. Thank you.","Paul Jacobs","Thanks a lot. I certainly hope we don't see anything like that, for Steve is starting his tenure. It was, I think, a lot of people decided that was time to test our management team and it wasn't the most fun thing to go through but it was good to get it behind us and also the to see with all the stuff that's going on in the world in terms of litigation that we are no not in the middle of a lot of that stuff. We are actually partners with a lot of those companies that we had battles with in the old days. So its nice to see that change. But thanks for saying that.","Steven Mollenkopf","Mike, this is Steve. With respect to the Op margin, if I look at the year, particularly as the year, first-half, second-half, its unfolding basically the way that we thought it would. I think Q1 was pretty strong and I think particularly strong actually in the emerging markets which we were pleased to see. So I think we are still confident in our outlook in terms of that Op margin guidance that we gave in November. Just pleased to have a good quarter in the book in order to head our direction. As you know there's always some seasonality in this quarter. I don't think we are seeing anything more than that really in what you are seeing in the outlook.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.","Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys. I have two questions. First is, what was impact of foreign exchange on the numbers in the guidance or if you can explain given the broader picture of hedging and the impact on the P&L?","And then secondly, when I look at your number for next quarter, they are below street expectations somewhat. When I look at your numbers for the year, you have brought them up and that means that you expect a second-half recovery in EPS or second-half recovery in the trends. Could you go over the reasons for second-half acceleration versus the previous expectations and what stands behind the increase in EPS? Thanks.","George Davis","Sure. This is George. Let me start off with the FX impact. We had a modestly positive impact in the in the first quarter. As you know, really most of our exposure comes from our licensing business and we have hedging programs in place to help us with that. We expect that the full year again to be modestly positive after our hedging programs but FX has not been a major impact for us over the last couple of years.","In terms of the second quarter and the full year, really actually the year is pretty much playing out in line with our expectations. A little bit more positive in the first quarter but we are seeing a little more softness in the second quarter. Net net, the first half looks about as we said in the second half that really were not calling for anything other than the same environment that we expected going into the year. We have said that we think that whether you are looking at devices or you are looking at potential sales around the world, China LTE looks like an area where there may be, depending on the timing, there might be some benefit, more benefit the hits our fiscal year which as you know closes out a quarter before of the calendar year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Modoff for Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank","Yes, guys. A couple of them. So at the beginning of the call, you talked about being in the early rounds of smartphone adoption growth and can you kind of give a little more color around that, looking at what we are seeing from a maturation standpoint in places like the U.S. but growth in the emerging markets and how do you see that playing out in terms your ASP trends?","Second question. Steve, each of your main competitors in LTE in the last nine months has gone outside their company to acquire technology to try to compete with you in that market and none of them have really come to market with a product of any scale. Can you talk about what you see for LTE competition in the year.","And then Paul, just briefly, can you give us a rundown of some of your focuses in terms of your venture ideas or venture investments as you move on to your next role? Thank you.","Derek Aberle","Brian, this is Derek. Let me answer your first question. Obviously we look at the market as a whole which we break up in developed and emerging regions. Yet while it's true that there is a fair amount of maturation of smartphone adoption in the developed regions, we do still think that there's a lot of things coming that will drive replacement cycles there and then bring the last bit of the tail over, but then when you look at emerging regions, there are still a huge runway for growth there, so I think when we look at it in totality, although the areas where we probably spend most of our time seems like the smartphone space is well penetrated there is still a huge opportunity for us in the emerging regions.","Steven Mollenkopf","Brian, this is Steve. On LTE, yes, I think what we have seen a lot of folks are, obviously, working on LTE. We are continuing to see strong design-in activity and I think what's happening we had an early lead we are driving it across tiers. At the same time, the feature set is turning over, and one of the things that has been important for us, we since day one of our LTE solution we have had the TDD mode in there. That's been, I think, exceedingly important in terms of being able to grow our business into China, which is a good thing, but also what we are seeing in China the effect where people want to use the LTE solution that, number one, has maturity and feature leadership, but also gives them the ability to deliver a product outside of China and to become a global smartphone OEM and not just a regional smartphone OEM, so I think we are continuing to stay ahead of people in terms of technology and certainly maturity and scale, but the things that we bring seem to also be more important as well, so we hope that continues. We are going to continue to invest in that area as it has been our practice.","Paul Jacobs","\u2026I am going to look at in the future and obviously there is a whole set of projects that we have favorite continue to invest in that area as has been our practice and so on the familiar look at the images and obviously visible set of projects that we have going on right now - think it will be nice to spend a little bit more time hands-on with those projects and hopefully it can help accelerate some of the those coming to market.","Then sort of farther out stuff that we haven't talked a lot about yet and everybody is talking about 5G already, I think we have some good ideas for what 5G should be and the kinds of things that it should do in addition to just being faster and more spectrum and more bandwidth and those things, so I got some good projects ahead of me.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs","Hi. Thanks very much and I want to congratulate both of you, Paul and Steve on the new roles. I just wanted to ask you first about your guidance as it pertains to QTL and device sales in particular. It was relatively strong even though we have seen some of the major OEMs actually come in with slightly lower than expected results for the December quarter, so I was just wondering if you can go into some of the drivers for that. Is it emerging market? Is it tablets or any other categories. Then relative to your unit guidance for MSM chipsets in the March quarter, it's a bit below seasonal and I just wanted to dig into that a little more if it has anything to do with market share or inventory or end demand, if you can just give us a bit of color there as well. Thanks.","Derek Aberle","Simona, this is Derek. Why don't I start and if George wants to jump in and add something he can. As you know, we at this stage, we get a fair amount of visibility in from our licensees typically before we provide guidance, so we do have a reasonable amount of confidence in the guide that we have provided for the December quarter sales.","I think it is again a blending, we are seeing a lot of strength in the emerging regions, continue see strength in places like China. Although there was little softness, I think in the in the U.S., some of the other developed regions, it continue to do well such as Europe and I think we are probably going to see a little stronger tablet uptake as well and there are evidence of that coming out of some of the statements Verizon and AT&T made this last week.","George Davis","On the MSM front, I think what we are seeing and it's one of the reasons why we didn't update the number for MSMs for the full year. We think there were some of the benefit that we saw on Q1 were MSM that were being pulled in, so maybe a little bit of a timing issue between Q2 and Q1, but again overall the first half of the year looks very much like we thought it would and second-half the same, so probably not a lot of news in those numbers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura. Please go ahead with your question.","Romit Shah - Nomura","Yes. Thanks a lot. You basically reiterated guidance for the full year revenues, but year is turning out to be a little bit backend loaded than I was thinking. June is historically flat, which if that plays out again, would imply that September is up, north of 10% sequentially. Is that the right way to think about the rest of the year? That's my first question.","Then second. Steve, China Mobile indicated, I believe, in December that they expect to sell 100 million LTE devices. That number seems like it is overstated but I wanted to get your thoughts on that. Thank you.","Paul Jacobs","So on the first-half, second-half, again all I can say is, and we spent some time on this in the original guidance, the year does look a little bit different than the historical pattern with more of the earnings coming in the second half. We still believe that is the case and also you get a slightly higher revenue rate in the second half of the year. So I think in terms of any specific quarter, it is too early to comment beyond our second-quarter guidance but that's why when we raised our guidance, it really was more just to reflect the outperformance in Q1 than a fundamental change in first-half and second-half.","Steven Mollenkopf","This is Steve. On the China Mobile forecast for devices. My guess is if I remember correctly, that was a calendar year number. It is difficult for me to comment on the numbers but I will say that the intensity with the industry is getting prepared for the launch of LTE is quite high. If you look at our designing intensity and you look at the preparations that we are going through with carriers, it is consistent with the big launch of that scale. Now it's always difficult, as we have said before, to pick when those things happen and the start of a new launch is always difficult to pick, particularly as early as it is but we expect that to be a big, pretty significant launch when it occurs and we are going to be prepared for it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ehud Gelblum with Citi. Please go ahead with your question.","Ehud Gelblum - Citi","Hi, guys. I appreciate it. Thanks. A question for you on China. Is there a reason that China Mobile having said they are going to test three mode phones rather than five modes? Is there any reason that your royalty rates on three mode phones will be different than on a five mode phone, obviously due to some difference because of the lack of 3G but, if you can get us a sense as the difference between those two?","On that note, then also, if the share of TD-LTE China Mobile ends up being, say, roughly similar share wise to what 3G looks like right now in China, given that you count a lot of the major Chinese players like Huawei, ZTE, Lenovo, Coolpad as good customers of yours, and I presume therefore paying whatever royalty that they do pay you, if they end up getting the similar shares in the TD-LTE world as that develops, can you give us a sense as to what would that mean for the royalty rates that you collect on LTE?","And then, you made a comment, Steve, I think that there is a higher percentage of thin modems sold, or George, you may have said that, thin modems sold this quarter, and that's what effected the ASP on your MSMs. Is that a trend you are seeing as nonintegrated chips in smartphones or is that an indication that 3G\/4G feature phones are making a comeback? Thanks.","Derek Aberle","Hi, this is Derek. Let me answer your first question. We have talked a lot about some of the challenges we have had with collecting on TD-SCDMA in China and the things that we have been doing to either push things like five mode, so that there is WCDMA in the device or also the move to LTE should be a good one for us. So our 3G deals would cover anything that you called a five mode and in fact in many cases would cover the phones that are three mode. So absent the challenges we have had around TD-SCDMA, we wouldn't really have a need to negotiate new deals on those but like I said, we are signing a number of companies to the LTE licenses and so as we talked about we do expect the rate on what we call the single mode LTE device to be lower than 3G. Although I spent some time going through that in New York, if you recall, in terms of trying to explain the delta between the 3G and 4G royalty picture as a whole based on the companies that were signed up so far, so maybe you can go back and think about that. I can't really specifically comment on any particular licensee or any particular agreement and obviously we are going to have to see how the market develops in terms of the three-mode versus five-mode adoption and who are the suppliers that get share moving forward.","Steven Mollenkopf","This is Steve, so just one follow-up on that question by the way. I think what you are going to see in China Mobile, because it's so big and because the launch is likely to happen across tiers, you are going to get a lot of attraction from international OEMs using their LTE expertise worldwide to exploit that technology change. At the same time, I think you are going to see domestic OEMs looking to leverage their strength in China to the international OEMs. Both of those trends, we think, are positive to our core businesses, which I think is important.","With respect your high or to the number about the thin modems, I don't think is really a trend. I would say the vast majority of our chipsets are actually shipped as integrated and that's really what most people do in the industry. What you are probably seeing is just sort of concentration of some of the OEMs that used in modems and how that might be associated with particular phone launches in the timing of those phone launches through the year as opposed to a trend.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.","Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First of all, I just wanted to dig in a little bit. You are guiding QTL ASPs for December shipments flattish. You saw upside on chipsets, so that shift in the December quarter from the low-end, how do I reconcile those two things, upside from chipsets and December low-end versus guidance for device shipments in December ASPs flattish.","Secondly, in the current quarter, the quarter just past you had ASPs down, but a lot of unit outside which would imply a lot of growth at the lower end. What is it actually imply for continued QRD traction? I think you had said last year the revenues in QRD were in the ballpark of $1 billion. Do we read into the results that we just saw continued traction with QRD or more traction with QRD than we have had?","Derek Aberle","Stacy, this is Derek. I think that part of this might be a little bit of timing in terms of the chip shipments versus one of the devices actually gets sold into the market and reported to us, but we do see some strength in the emerging regions really driving the Q4 results as well. The ASP I think as we said last quarter, we expected this to be kind of in line in the calendar Q4 quarter versus Q3 and that's what we are expecting. We do expect the back half of the year, which is consistent I think with what we have seen in the last three years to be stronger from an ASP perspective just given the timing of some of the iconic product launches we expect to see here shortly.","Steven Mollenkopf","Stacy, this is Steve. Regarding the QRD, we have had another good quarter for our emerging accounts. I would probably categorize that group of accounts. A lot of them use the QRD, but this is really a new channel that we had to develop over the years and with strong quarter for them in the December quarter and we expect that to continue to be a good channel for us moving forward, something we can we can also use our LTE leadership into as well, so we are pleased to be able to see the upside there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Rod Hall - JPMorgan","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple for you. I just wanted to go back to China and see if you guys could talk about two things more there. One is, maybe Derek, if can give us any idea what proportion of the potential LTE volume is licensed or some idea how far it's utilized in process for LTE you are there. Then and also maybe George, you could comment or someone could comment on the if there is any press ruling in China, how that plays our recruiting for potential fine there, when do we get more sort of I guess firmed up in terms of what the impact might be financially from that.","Then lastly, Paul, I just wanted to ask you to give us an update on 1000x and just kind of where that is. I know guys have thought you might have some trial this year. I just wonder how that's progressing along and whether we will be doing trials on that this year. Thanks.","Derek Aberle","Rod, this is Derek. Little bit of a hard to answer, but let me give it a shot. We have signed more 50, I think it's more than 55 companies now to LTE licenses in China, but actually I think large part of the volume initially here will be stuff that is actually covered by our 3G deal. Certainly the volumes that go to China Telecom, China Unicom, the five mode volumes at China Mobile and then also, as Steve mentioned, the international volumes that will be coming in to China likely will be of the same flavor. So its going to depend, like I said, we are continuing to be in discussions and find additional companies as we speak. So again, I think, we are on track to doing the things we needed to do. Without knowing exactly who is going to have what share and how this is all going to play out, I can't really give you any more granularity than that.","Don Rosenberg","Rod, this is Don, and George may answer after me, but just to be clear, you talked about an antitrust ruling. There isn't any ruling in China. The articles that you read are speculating at this point. There is investigation. We have talked about that. We have been told by the NDRC that it is confidential but we are cooperating with them and we are going to continue to cooperate with them, and so at this point anything that anybody is saying is pure speculating at this point, while this proceeds.","George Davis","One the 1,000x, obviously I don't want to announce other people's products, we are supporting the technology. We have obviously done a number of our own trials based of our own products but the traction with the customer base is good and so I feel confident that's continuing to move along and there's obviously a lot of dynamics in the operator market between operators who have a lot of spectrum, operators who have fixed network capabilities and so there are certain ones who will be, I would say, more the leaders and that we are focused on the driving opportunity with those people but it would be done through customers of ours who will deliver the product.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Kulbinder Garcha - Credit Suisse","Thanks, Just a couple of questions, if I can. On the addressable market growth for the overall business of 15%, also unit growth, you guys are talking about, you mentioned I think George, that just you saw more upside to that number. I guess the things that we have heard suggest otherwise, in the sense that you had a number of large handset smartphone vendors, there is point near-term involvement give us a relatively cautious guidance and I understand the upside in China, so equally, China Mobile's network is only really rolling out now. It may take some time. the service pricing seems a bit on the expenses side. So I just kind of curious that there seems to be more kind of downside distance than three or four months, given those things we have learned than before. So what is that you are seeing that gives you the confidence you could see the upside as we go through this year? This is my first question on the addressable market and the confidence you have in that growth rate.","And then, for Steve, is it the case that, I think, when you initially were rolling out LTE chips that they were meaningfully accretive to our ASP because of just the technology, the competition as well as the fact that you were selling more integrated devices and higher end Snapdragon chips. As we go through this year, will that level of accretion still hold, or do you guys have to become more aggrieve even if your peers aren't as competitive, just to kind of ensure that you really dominate that segment. How do you think about managing the business between those various levers? Thanks.","Paul Jacobs","Sure. Let me start off with the size of the market and the outlook for '14. I try to leave the message that, if anything, we have a bias to the upside in these numbers and I think sometimes in the year-over-year comparison when you see the U.S. coming in a little bit softer than people may have expected, it's easy to lose the track of the very high growth rates, certainly well above 15%, 20% type growth rates in emerging markets. You are also seeing actually developed markets maintain overall their growth rates similar to what we saw '12 to '13, because you are seeing, on a year-over-year comparison, more strength in both Europe and Japan and while the rates may not be comparable to emerging market growth rates there, on a year-over-year basis, they contribute to our outlook. So in the upside, we would assign to how the LTE deployment in China plays out.","Steve Mollenkopf","So with respect to LTE pricing. So you should really think of LTE as a tiered offering. In the leadership tier, the high-tier, it's a strong area for our pricing. We continue to have leadership there, we continue to drive there, but we expect the lower tier or more the entry-level LTE feature set to be important and we assumed that that's going to be have to be a priced at a different pricing level than will be one of the leaderships here.","I would also just generally say that I think that the scale that will be built up in the LTE world will also spread to the developing market as well and provide I think some positive view on chipset ASP relative to what you see really like more commoditized 3G pricing in terms of the 3G chipset, so LTE it's definitely a tier, I think it something that provides some kind of an upward trend in terms of pricing for us relative to see in 3G.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark McKechnie with Evercore. Please go ahead with your question.","Mark McKechnie - Evercore","Great. Thanks. A couple of quick question. You might have answered these before, but the chip QCT, you are looking at ASPs or pricing for those to trend up in the March quarter. Maybe you could explain a bit some of the drivers.","Then for George, so housekeeping questions on your guidance specifically, how much interest income? There was a pretty big difference you did like $255 million of interest other expense. Usually would prefer to dwell on that, but that was a pretty big mover earnings. Any assumptions or can you give us a sense of what you are assuming on your guidance for the full year on that line item? Thanks.","Paul Jacobs","Mark, thanks. I will start with your last question first and then I will get to the QCT ASP. On investment income. It's one of the things, actually the performance in the portfolio that we cited as part of adder to the outperformance in the first quarter.","As we have been accelerating return of capital, we have a portfolio that has a broad range of risk and so we are starting to take that risk level down as we draw down more cash for repurchase, so you are seeing some gains embedded in the quarter associated with that. Again, maybe I would say above trend maybe, $0.02, $0.03 from that.","I wouldn't count on that every quarter, that's really more a function of just making sure that we keep the risk level and the portfolio in the right place. For QCT, really what you are seeing is a little bit of a reversal of what you saw in Q1 which is that the mix particularly thin modems will not be quite as higher percent that gives a natural lift to the ASP.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.","Tavis McCourt - Raymond James","Thanks for taking my question. First, a housekeeping question, George. The $1.26 non-GAAP earnings, does that include the Omnitracs sale and I was under the impression that the previous guidance and full-year guide excluded that sale. Just want to make sure we are talking apples-and-apples.","Secondly, a question for Derek. It's been an interesting trend. Nokia has now sold their business and kept the patents. Ericsson did the same and now Google is doing the same. What I am wondering is, does that change the competitive dynamic of QTL at all having multiple patent pulls out there that aren't associated with devices? Thanks.","George Davis","Okay. Let me cover the housekeeping. As we said, the Omni gain was always going to be in non-GAAP, but when we gave guidance, we treated it as a discrete item, so we guided excluding the discrete items. We also had another major discrete item, which was the impairment on the QMT asset, so the net effect of that was $0.05 and then there was about another $0.01 of items and other, so a net $0.04 benefit that's how when we talked our performance would have been $1.22 if not for those which is really the comparable apples-to-apples that you are looking for, so still $0.02 above the upper end of the guidance range and $0.07 over the midpoint?","Derek Aberle","This is Derek. I don't think it really changes the competitive dynamic for QTL for our business. I think, we have obviously been very successful in establishing the value for our own portfolio in the marketplace and the fact that other companies may decide to come in and become more active doesn't really impact our value proposition, per se. Both Ericsson and Nokia have had active licensing programs for many years. The way that they have positioned and valued their patents won't simply change based on whether they have an active business. Now it might change any individual deal based on the relative exposure but again they have been active and I don't think there will be a major disruption or impact in the industry as a results of it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you. Paul, it's a matter of time before the smartphone market matures and it's one of the reasons that the stock multiplied over the last few years. As we look out over the next few years, what do you think will replace the smartphone market in terms of opportunity growth where QUALCOMM can really dominate similar to what they did in smartphones? If we look at tablets, for example, the attach rates have been low because of the pricey data plans, although it seems like a niche opportunity. Just maybe how we should think about it longer term.","And then George, as growth matures for the company and the free cash flow improves, any thoughts on your preference between the split between dividends and also share repurchase? And longer term, can that 75% returns move higher so that we could actually decompress the stock multiples?","Paul Jacobs","I think we are going to do better and better in the computing space and I agree that it's been not as successful as we had hoped in the past in terms of attach rates. I think the operators are getting better at that. We are also building other technologies, obviously, LTE and their license bands do, I think, a lot, some of the small cell stuff should do a lot there. But the other part is just mobile as an enabling technology into other areas.","You can see the beginnings of things, automotive space. Yes, those numbers are relatively small, but people talk about Internet of everything as only low value, low margin devices and I think there is going to be a tiering of different kinds of devices. So there will be high value segments in the Internet of everything. There will be also the very cheap ones, but then we are talking about high volumes also. So there is some kind of decent growth there.","Then you look out and there is a bunch of areas where we can do things that are just adjacent to the phone, additional content in the phone. Obviously to this point, this play of investments have been not as quick to come to fruition as we had hoped, although I think the wearable spaces is a really interesting part, but also connected home spaces is quite interesting. So lot of opportunity for that going forward.","We have some other display technologies as well that are getting a lot of traction with the Pixtronix technology which is more applicable to larger displays, and you know that's a nice licensing business. We have got a bunch of other things in the hopper. The vehicle charging and we are looking at working with partners on that in terms of a larger play there as well. So there is a broad range of technologies out there that we are working on that will drive, I think, a reasonable amount of growth going forward.","George Davis","Mark, just to answer your questions on the capital structure and return of capital. So what we have said is that we expect to grow double digit topline and bottomline over the next five years and really largely driven by the core businesses that we see today and with that we expect strong cash flow to continue. We are going to grow the dividend rate ahead of earnings is what we have committed to. We are going to return 75% of global free cash flow and so then you will see a large, what isn't going through dividends will obviously go for share repurchase, and as Steve mentioned in the script, we expect to more than double the return over the next five years from what we have returned in the past five years.","Operator","Thank you. This ends our allotted time for questions and answers. Dr. Jacobs, do you have anything further to add before adjourning the call.","Paul Jacobs","I just wanted to say thanks again to everybody for all the support over the years and it's been a great run as CEO, I think both, measured by the financial metrics and also by sort of the way we expanded the business and the way the company operates and it's really not one person that does that. That's our employees, our partners, all my colleagues here have done just an amazing job over the years and I am looking forward to Steve take the reigns as CEO and drive the company forward.","I am very, very excited by the future. It's going to be very fun to see how we have this expanding impact of mobile and I am saying that given the background of how much it has already impacted all of our lives, so it's going to be great to be able to refocus my energy on innovation.","I don't think I am going to be presenting at any future earnings calls, but if you guys want I may show up for Q&As and I hope to see you guys, or some of you at least, at Mobile World Congress, so thanks everybody.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

The playback reservation number is 39466104.","I would now like to turn the call over to John Sinnott, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sinnott, please go ahead.","John Sinnott","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Today's call will include prepared remarks by Steve Mollenkopf and George Davis. In addition, Cristiano Amon, Alex Rogers, and Don Rosenberg will join the question-and-answer session. You can access our earnings release and a slide presentation that accompany this call on our Investor Relations website. In addition, this call is being webcast on qualcomm.com and a replay will be available on our website later today.","During the call today, we will use non-GAAP financial measures, as defined in Regulation G, and you can find the related reconciliations to GAAP on our website. We will also make forward-looking statements including projections and estimates of future events, business or industry trends, or business or financial results. Actual events or results could differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q, which contain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. ","We have also recently provided a presentation detailing how we are creating substantial near and long-term value for our shareholders, including our fiscal 2019 financial forecast. That presentation as well as additional materials, including videos from our management team are available at qcomvalue.com.","And now, the comments from Qualcomm's Chief Executive Officer, Steve Mollenkopf.","Steve Mollenkopf","Thank you, John and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report a strong set of results in our first fiscal quarter with non-GAAP earnings per share above the high end of our prior guidance range, driven by better than expected ASPs and units reported by our Chinese licensees and stronger than expected demand for MSMs. Our strong results reflect the actions we have taken to drive our strategic objectives and improve profitability. We are benefiting from our technology and product leadership in mobile and leveraging that leadership into a growing set of opportunities across RF Front End, Auto, IoT, mobile compute and networking. ","Our fiscal second quarter guidance reflects some higher than normal seasonality due to near-term inventory build in the handset market, consistent with what others are reporting as well as the ongoing impact of our non-paying licensees. In QCT, we expect the strong year-over-year performance to continue in our fiscal second quarter, driven by favorable mix and product cost actions. Longer-term, our outlook for our business remains unchanged as we continue to see positive trends with higher than expected global smartphone ASPs in QTL and stronger share and product trends in QCT across multiple growth areas. ","We made two very important announcements today that expand and strengthen our overall relationship with Samsung. In our licensing business, we announced that we have amended and expanded our long-term licensing agreement. The license remains at the device level and continues through 2023. It is important to note that the amended agreement reached with Samsung is fully consistent with brand licensing practices and is consistent with our long term model. More importantly, it provides the foundation for a long-term stable licensing relationship with Samsung following the KFTC investigation. And importantly, as part of the agreement, Samsung is withdrawing its opposition to our appeal of the KFTC's order. We look forward to continuing our long and mutually beneficial relationship with Samsung for many years ahead.","In our product business, we also announced a multi-year strategic agreement with Samsung in various technology areas and across a range of mobile devices. This agreement expands the company's longstanding relationship as technology and business partners into 2018 and beyond as we transition to 5G. QCT had another very successful Consumer Electronics Show earlier this month with important product and partner announcements across RF Front End, auto, networking, mobile computing and IoT. QCT and its partners were awarded 52 Best of CES Awards this year, up from 17 last year, clearly indicating execution in adjacent opportunities and the strength of our design pipeline.","In automotive, we now have more than $3 billion of order backlog, including more than $1 billion of order backlog in infotainment alone. At CES, we announced new auto designs with Honda, Jaguar Land Rover and BYD in China as well as a collaboration with Ford on cellular V2X. We also announced new flagship RF Front End design wins with Google, HTC, LG, Motorola, Samsung and Sony, as we expand our share position, including filter rich modules and newly designed gallium arsenide power amplifiers. ","We also introduced our unique 5G tunable front end solution, which utilizes modem intelligence at a system level to dynamically tune multimode RF performance and power efficiency when sharing radio frequencies and components across 3G, 4G and 5G. We believe this disruptive technology will transition RF Front End design leadership from dedicated component suppliers back to the system solution provider in 5G, consistent with what happened with prior wireless generation transitions.","In networking, we announced solutions with expanded WiFi mesh capabilities as well as a new and upgraded mesh networking platform. We are the number one provider of retail and enterprise WiFi and we are reshaping the carrier segment with our mesh solutions while gaining share from key incumbents. Our success in networking is a result of a deliberate investment several years ago to position our WiFi business with the structural changes we anticipated in the market. ","Last week, we also made some significant announcements at our China Technology Summit in Beijing, further demonstrating our strong ecosystem partnerships and product leadership in China. Lenovo, OPPO, Vivo and Xiaomi joined us at the summit to announce that each had signed non-binding MOUs for the multi-year purchase of our RF Front End solutions, totaling at least $2 billion, which would represent a substantial increase in our RF Front End share at these accounts. The scope of our broad RF Front End platform includes gallium arsenide Pas, envelope trackers, LNAs, multimode PA and modules, RF switches, discrete filters and filter rich modules and antenna tuners across cellular and connectivity technologies.","We also announced collaboration agreements in China called the 5G Pioneer initiative with Lenovo, OPPO, Vivo, Xiaomi, ZTE and Wingtech for the development of advanced 5G Mobile devices, targeting the 2019 timeframe. 5G represents a market discontinuity in the mobile ecosystem and it coincides with China based OEM's plans to expand globally in the premium tier. ","In our dispute with Apple, we continue to move closer toward a number of key legal milestones later this year and early next year. In various jurisdictions around the world, in cases concerning Apple's infringement of Qualcomm's patents, there will be hearings and determinations on whether Qualcomm should be entitled to injunctive relief and exclusion orders. Also, Qualcomm's case against Apple's contract manufacturers for breach of their license agreements continues to move toward resolution in the same timeframe, as does Qualcomm's case against Apple for improperly interfering with those license agreements. ","We value Apple as a customer and would like to continue that relationship into the future, but it is in our stockholders best interest that we ensure that Apple pay a fair and reasonable royalty and operate on a level playing field with the other OEMs. While the litigation with Apple is necessary to protect our IP assets and our contract rights, we remain open to finding a path to resolution and collaboration with Apple as a partner.","Turning to demand trends for 3G, 4G devices around the world. Consistent with what others have been reporting, we are forecasting some short-term end market softness, driven by larger than typical sequential correction in orders from a fin modem customer and near term smartphone trends in China. George will provide more details on our updated forecast, but we continue to see favorable long term trends, including flagship handset launches later this year and the ramp of 5G device shipments beginning in early calendar 2019.","Turning to our pending acquisition of NXP, with recent approvals in both Europe and Korea, only Chinese regulatory approval remains and we hope to receive that soon. We continue to see this as an attractive deal for both our stockholders and NXP\u2019s stockholders at $110 per share as the combination brings together a comprehensive set of capabilities to address next generation auto and IoT devices and provides us with greater scale in auto, IoT, security and networking with their highly complementary products and world-class sales channel.","On January 16, we released an investor presentation that outlined the near term and long term value opportunity for our stockholders and our plan to deliver $6.75 to $7.50 in non-GAAP earnings per share in fiscal 2019. We believe this appropriately frames the core earnings power of Qualcomm and the multiple levers we have within our control to achieve this, along with a significant value for our shareholders as we work through our outstanding licensing disputes. We took a conservative approach to modeling our fiscal year \u201919 earnings target and our management team is very committed to driving this result for our shareholders. We outlined a huge opportunity for growth and diversification through our expansion into new complementary adjacent opportunities. This growth is underpinned by the expansion of our service addressable market from $23 billion in 2015 to approximately $150 billion in 2020 or more than six times the size of Qualcomm's 2015 SAM.","Another important area of value creation is 5G and Qualcomm is leading the industry. Whether you are a phone maker and infrastructure company or a network operator, Qualcomm is already identified as the key partner for accelerating your roadmap to 5G commercialization around the world. We are partnering with leaders across the globe as we work to bring 5G to market, including Verizon, AT&T, Nokia, Ericsson, China Mobile, SK Telecom, Telstra, Vodafone, Orange, NTT DoCoMo, T-Mobile, Sprint and now Samsung. Our announced 5G Pioneer initiative further builds on this strong global momentum.","In closing, we reported a very strong set of results this quarter and our products and technologies are leading in their respective categories and are set to lead as we enter the 5G generation. These generation changes have always provided us with the opportunity to benefit from our significant technology lead and this will be true again to an even greater degree in 5G. Our technologies will expand into many industries as we enter the age of IoT, autonomous vehicles, always on mobile computing and ubiquitous networking.","I will now turn the call over to George.","George Davis","Thank you, Steve and good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal first quarter non-GAAP results were very strong. Non-GAAP revenues were $6 billion, just above the midpoint of our prior guidance range and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.98, $0.08 above the midpoint of our guidance range, reflecting strong performance in both QCT and QTL, In QCT, MSM shipments were 237 million, towards the high end of our guidance range. Overall performance in QCT was above expectations, driven primarily by the higher unit volume on a build ahead for a customer\u2019s flagship launch. QCT's earning before tax in the first fiscal quarter was up 32% year-over-year, the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, reflecting the strong MSM demand, improved product mix and product cost initiatives. ","QCT EBT margin was 21% for the quarter, above our prior guidance on the higher MSM volume and up more than 280 basis points over the same period last year. In QTL, revenues were $1.3 billion, at the high end of our prior guidance range, driven primarily by stronger than expected 3G, 4G device ASPs and units reported by OEMs in China for the September quarter. Recall that this excludes royalty revenues from Apple's products and the other licensee in dispute. QTL EBT margin was 68%, at the low end of our prior guidance. EBT margin would have been 72% or at the high end of prior guidance, if not for bad debt expense recorded in the quarter related to a licensee that is facing significant financial difficulties. ","This charge also accounted for the modestly higher than forecasted OpEx expense in the quarter. The GAAP loss this quarter reflected the impact of a $6 billion charge related to the enactment of US tax reform legislation and the accrual of the European Commission's $1.2 billion fine announced last week. These two charges impacted fiscal first quarter GAAP EPS by $4.79 per share and were excluded from non-GAAP results. The $6 billion book charge largely relates to the one time repatriation tax on our offshore deemed repatriated earnings and profits. ","After application of applicable tax credits, we expect to pay $3.3 billion in cash taxes, back end loaded over eight years, beginning in January 2019. In general, we expect US tax reform in the longer term to result in a modest positive improvement in our effective tax rate as the increase in tax on offshore innings is more than offset by the benefit to onshore earnings. The European Commission fine relates to a decision on its investigation of a modem chip agreement that was in effect from 2011 through 2016. While we disagree with the decision and will immediately appeal it to the General Court of the European Union, it is important to note that the decision does not relate to our licensing business and has no impact on ongoing operations. We will post a bond in lieu of paying the fine during the appeal period. Turning to return of capital, we returned $1.1 billion to stockholders in the quarter in the form of dividends and buybacks. ","Turning to our financial guidance for the fiscal second quarter, we estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $4.8 billion to $5.6 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of approximately $0.65 to $0.75 per share. These expectations are reflecting weaker than forecasted smartphone demand in the December quarter. As a reminder, the fiscal second quarter is normally the seasonally high quarter for QTL revenues, absent the two disputes and the seasonally low quarter for QCT. In QTL, we estimate revenues of $1.15 billion to $1.35 billion in the fiscal second quarter, down approximately 4% sequentially at the midpoint. ","We expect QTL EBT margin to be approximately 64% to 68%, down sequentially at the midpoint on lower revenues and increased litigation expenses. It is important to note the impact of Apple nonpayment is more pronounced in the fiscal second quarter as it is typically an outsized quarter for royalties related to Apple products relative to other licensees, given the timing of their product launch cycle. Our QTL revenue forecast for our second quarter is also being impacted by softer sell through as demand in China in the December quarter was down on a year-over-year basis. We'll be closely watching Chinese New Year device sell through results to assess the time period necessary for the supply and demand dynamics to rebalance.","Turning to the chip business, we expect MSM shipments of approximately 170 million to 190 million units. This outlook includes the normal seasonal effects of lower demand in the calendar first quarter, a larger than normal reduction in orders sequentially from a large modem customer as well as near-term lower than expected orders from customers, particularly in China on inventory concerns from the demand dynamics. This forecast is consistent with continued strong chip share in the quarter. We expect QCT revenue per MSM to be up on a sequential basis in the fiscal second quarter, driven by seasonal factors and favorable product mix. ","We expect QCT\u2019s fiscal second quarter EBT margin to be approximately 13% to 15%, down sequentially on lower MSM volumes, offset by benefits from product cost initiatives, but up 100 basis points year-over-year at the midpoint. We anticipate fiscal second quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be flat to down approximately 2% sequentially, as increased litigation expenses and the reset of Employee Benefit taxes are more than offset by the absence of the prior bad debt charge. We will be implementing the cost reduction initiatives in the quarter and are in the process of determining the expected charges for severance and other related costs. We will provide that information once that estimate is finalized. ","Non-GAAP interest expense, net of investment income, in the fiscal second quarter is expected to be roughly flat sequentially at approximately $60 million. Given the market dynamics we have described, we are updating our unit outlook for calendar year global 3G, 4G devices for both 2017 and 2018. For calendar year 2017, we have adjusted the midpoint lower and narrowed our range. We now expect 3G, 4G device shipments of approximately 1.75 billion to 1.8 billion units, up approximately 4% at the midpoint year-over-year. For calendar year 2018, we are bringing down our estimate modestly to reflect the lower 2017 base. We now estimate a range of 1.85 billion to 1.95 billion 3G, 4G device shipments for calendar 2018 or up approximately 7% from the midpoint of our expectations for calendar 2017.","With respect to fiscal 2018 global 3G 4G device else, we now expect global device ASPs will increase year-over-year, based on strength at the mid and premium tiers as opposed to our previous expectation of a low single digit percentage decline. We are not revising our estimate for fiscal 2018 device sales until we get a clear picture of whether the ASP pick up well more than offset the sell through issues discussed earlier.","Turning to 2019, we continue to be highly confident in our outlook for fiscal 2019 as recently disclosed in our investor presentation with base non-GAAP EPS of $5.25, growing to between $6.75 and $7.50 per share upon resolution of the licensing disputes.","That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to John.","John Sinnott","Thank you, George. Operator, we are ready for questions.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets.","Tim Long","Just wanted a little more color on the Samsung arrangements here. It sounds like you extended with FRAND terms, just talk to us a little bit, I know the prior deal had an upfront payment, it had some technology IPR transfers as well, so can you just talk a little bit about how those two in the new collaboration factor into the FRAND rate discussion for Samsung? And then I have a follow-up after that.","Alex Rogers","Tim, this is Alex. So the amended and expanded agreement basically takes the prior deal and just adds some changes to it. So a lot of what was in the prior deal remains in place. So for example, the upfront payment that you talked about. The key things to keep in mind about this Samsung amended license agreement is that it's consistent with our FRAND licensing practices. It remains a license at the handset level. This is not a chipset level royalty bearing license. And so it also -- one key element also is an expansion of rights back to Qualcomm to Samsung's patent portfolio. And one of the key factors to keep in mind is that as part of this amendment and this new arrangement with Samsung, Samsung is going to be withdrawing from its intervention in the KFTC appeal, adverse to Qualcomm. So they'll no longer participate in that matter adverse to Qualcomm. And from a financial perspective, it supports the numbers that we put out for 2019 fiscal year and beyond and provides a strong foundation for Qualcomm and its relationship with Samsung through 2023.","Tim Long","And then just if I could just follow-up on the China business, it sounds like a lot of moving parts there. September was really strong for the device manufacturers, then weakening. Could you just talk a little bit about what you think is going on with the reason for the change in demand there and second could you talk -- it's been a pretty good market share gain region for you. Can you talk about if you still think you're taking share in the Chinese end market? Thank you.","Cristiano Amon","Hi, Tim. This is Cristiano. I think we talk about a near-term weakness in the domestic China market based on the sell through data in the December quarter and that was contemplated in our guidance. I think you need to think about there was a super -- expect a super cycle and I think one of the flagships and you think that the Chinese OEMs didn't want to go ahead and most of the new products are going to launch in the Chinese New Year. So that\u2019s one thing on the demand sell through in the December quarter. I think we will monitor the Chinese New Year data and whatever could be inventory into the quarter, we should rebalance in the first half of the year. We also see that the forecast is consistent with two things happening for QCT. I think both are strong chip share with those OEMs as well as mix improvements. So we can't really talk about the second half of the year, but the Chinese New Year launches is just ahead of us.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity.","Mike Walkley","Cristiano, just talking about 5G, Qualcomm historically gains share with new wireless technologies. Can you just update us on how you see 5G ramping and why Qualcomm is ahead of the competition, maybe what technology areas you see the competitors might lack and then also just on the China side, also a follow up question, just can you talk about some of these RF agreement and how you see your RF business ramping over the next two years?","Cristiano Amon","Yes, Mike. So let me start with 5G. We have been pretty consistent talking about a 5G acceleration in the industry and we now probably have line of sight of a number of the appointments that are going to happen of the network, of the 3GPP global 5G standard in the later part of this year and we are working with a number of OEMs to have smartphone launches in the first half of 2019. And part of that, I think we also announced in China last week a 5G Pioneer I think program of a number of OEMs of the China market, they see 5G as a discontinuity to basically enable their expansion plans to become global players, leveraging their 5G transition. So I think the motivation to have early launches in the first half of 19 is high and we\u2019re marching towards that date.","So your second question is about competitiveness of 5G. 5G brings a number of complex technologies. One is you have the foundation, which is gigabit LTE, which is we've been investing in 4G continuous to evolve the 17 smartphones in the market today with that capabilities used in a Qualcomm modem. We also have the addition of two other frequencies, sub-6 and millimeter wave and we continue to see complexities in the RF. So we're looking at our position as been a company that has been in a good position for the 4G, which continues to evolve and being supporting multiple global activities with 5G. We have announced probably trials in over the year, I think test towards all of the infrastructure vendors across all of the operators launched. So I think scale is going to be an advantage for us and we're optimistic about the prospect.","Your last question is RF Front End. We announce a total of $2 billion in RF Front End purchase across four OEMs. We're starting to ramp designs. I think, it's probably a second set of announcements. The first one was CES, when we announced a number of OEMs and then Chinese OEMs was in the second wave. We also feel good about the 5G story in front end. When 5G technology gets launched, I believe the baseband in the system platform, the reference design plays a stronger role in defining RF Front End configuration. As part of the same discussion, we saw support in China for our tunable front end solution.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani","Couple from me as well. Could you maybe help us understand how much of an impact are you seeing in your revenue line from the China inventories that you guys talked about and do you think this is something that gets worked through the March quarter or could it persist through the June quarter as well?","George Davis","Clearly, I think two major factors when we think about Q2 is, one is the China weakness really impacted customers that felt they were going to have a stronger sell through at the end of December. And so as Cristiano said, we're going to be watching very closely the Chinese New Year sales to see how much of that gets absorbed in the second quarter. So we don't know yet. There may be some activity that carries on beyond that. But for our revenue overall in the second quarter, there are some other factors that are also at play. ","One in the licensing business, normally, obviously, this is the very strong quarter for licensing, but it also happens to have usually a very heavy weighting of Apple because their flagship launch tends to take place as you know in the fourth calendar quarter, which is the second fiscal quarter for our licensing business. The absence of that, we're not seeing as much of a seasonal pick up as we would normally see there plus the licensing estimates reflect the lower sell through that we ended up seeing in December that really didn't impact the chip business.","Amit Daryanani","And I guess if I could follow up, the OpEx guide that you guys have for March quarter, if my math is working correctly, the implication is OpEx as a percent of sales will be something north of 35%, and I realize there are some one-time variables there, but should we talk about what are these one-time variables, what\u2019s the right way to think about OpEx as a percentage of revenues and when do you get to realize all the $1 billion cost takeout benefits you talked about.","George Davis","Yeah. I think the OpEx as a percent of revenue, it certainly had a little bit of a bounce, but that was more in Q1 relative to the bad debt charge. When I think about OpEx for the company, I think you've seen really since the strategic realignment plan, the major drivers of any pick up have either been our investment in pre-commercial 5G or the increase that you've seen in SG&A to support the higher litigation and model defense spending that we have. We think under the $1 billion plan, we can absorb the 5G costs that you've seen. ","We think as we move our focus further into these new sort of available markets we've talked about, we're going to be able to reprioritize our investment portfolio and take an additional cost out, but really the biggest savings are going to come out of SG&A, which has been a big driver of our growth in OpEx over the last four or five years. In particular, in the licensing area and in this model defense and we think we have a clear path to -- by \u201919 to getting some of those costs taken back out. Of course, we'll have a real focus on overhead cost as well as part of the SG&A.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.","Stacy Rasgon","I had a question on the 2019 guidance. So you're talking a lot about 5G ramping and everything else, which sounds great. But it seems like if I take a look at that guide, 525 without fixing licensing, 375 without the buyback, if I take out the 1 billion cost cut that isn't really in numbers right now, it's more like 315, which seems to be quite a bit worse than where the street is and I would say inconsistent with some of your commentary on some of the good things coming down the pipe. So I guess can we talk a little bit more about what's actually in that guide, what are you assuming is getting worse between now and then. You mentioned Samsung's new royalty payment line with your numbers, are those getting worse versus where they are now, what you assuming for Apple share and any color you can give us on that would be helpful? And then I have a follow up.","George Davis","Sure, Stacy. This is George. I think your math is generally good, but what we \u2013 I think what's missing is we\u2019ve said we're going to put some conservative assumptions into the numbers that quite frankly if you did the math based on a run rate today, you would say would be a lower run rate than we're experiencing today and that is by taking out Apple, all Apple revenue related to new products, including both the modem and the front end and saying if for whatever reason, we're still litigating or pursuing an agreement with Apple and haven't reached it and they decide to take the decision to carve us out completely, what does that look like? ","So again the purpose of that estimate was really to provide stockholders with a high confidence based number before resolution of the licensing. So as they consider alternatives that they can understand what does the kind of core earnings look like on a conservative basis, but you're right, it would be below the run rate today and it was purposefully conservative. We also have some tax impact in the 525 number. Tax reform for us is a little higher tax on offshore earnings, lower earnings on onshore. Net-net, it's slightly positive, but when you break it out the way we did in that analysis, it's negative in the 525 and it's positive on the resolution basis.","Stacy Rasgon","So my follow-up, you mentioned a lot of the 1 billion coming out of SG&A and obviously have a lot of accelerated litigation and other costs there. Is it imperative that you actually do sell out licensing in time for 2019 in order to realize that full 1 billion.","George Davis","No. We think there's some contribution but that's not the primary driver. We\u2019ll be -- again we\u2019ve grown SG&A within the licensing business beyond that as part of the process of addressing the many other challenges leading up to this. We think we have some opportunities there. We certainly believe that as we look at our roadmap that we had to reduce overhead related SG&A over time, we\u2019ll take the steps necessary to accelerate that. So we're not highly dependent solely on a piece dividend to get this number. We think we'll be able to deliver the number.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura Equity.","Romit Shah","I had two. George, just on the tax rate. There's a lot there. Could you just tell us within the fiscal \u201919 EPS guide, what's the tax rate that you're assuming? And then the other question I had was just on NXPI. It would seem that closing this deal in a timely manner would be an important part of your value creation story. And so assuming you close or you get regulatory approval from China, could you give us a feel for what the timeline would look like from there to the actual closure of the deal?","George Davis","So on tax, we've guided the tax rate this year for non-GAAP at 8%. Obviously with the impact of tax reform and the fine, which is not tax deductible, the GAAP number doesn't really hold a lot of information. For \u201919, we would, as I said, long term, we expect the tax rate to be somewhat accretive relative to our history. We have not guided, but we were in the midteens before in our tax rate and I would be closer to that number than I would to the guide for \u201918. ","And then on NXP, not a lot we can say at this time other than we're very focused on working with MOFCOM to secure the final approval. Shortly after regulatory approval, the tender process will begin and then within -- depending on, there's two tender processes anticipated depending on how that process goes and you could close within say three weeks of the approval of regulatory.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie Securities.","Srini Pajjuri","Cristiano, just a question on the RF strategy. It looks like you're winning a lot of designs out there. If I look at the landscape out there, the margin profile in that business is quite strong at least at the operating margin level. As you expand your footprint, how should we think about QCT margins? Do you see an expansion potential here or are you being a little bit aggressive on the pricing side, given that you're starting very early?","Cristiano Amon","We talk about in our 2019 projections, I think this could contribute $2 billion to $3 billion in revenue and I think we're starting to, as we have the complete portfolio and particularly the ones that have higher value such as the PA and the high filter content modules, we see as an opportunity for us to grow faster than the market because we attach an existing MSM and an expansion of margin contribution in the device and I think that's consistent with the strategy we have pursued of diversifying and growing in other areas, leveraging our existing channel.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.","James Faucette","I had a couple of quick follow-up questions. I guess the first one for Cristiano, you talked about bringing to market a mobile device 5G in 2019. At the same time, we've heard a range of comments from carriers on their own outlook for 5G. So maybe you can help us understand kind of their circumstances and the geographies where 5G starts to make first -- makes sense first and then where we would sit it develop from there.","And then I guess my second follow-up question is just on the cost containment or reduction program, what are the things that would allow you to expand that further and further reduce expenses versus what are the competing elements that may limit it to that roughly $1 billion target? Thank you very much.","Cristiano Amon","I'll take the first one and I\u2019ll ask George to answer the second question. So on 5G, I think 5G as it becomes a significant contributor of volumes are really looking at the fiscal 2020, but early launches in \u201919 are very important and particularly, for our position in the chipset, I think early launches and ability to cover that globally define your competitive position and the ability to have a mature product, so you can ramp volumes in premier devices through fiscal \u201820. As you think about the launches in geographies, we see activity across all the developed markets, we see activity in the United States with at least two of the four carriers that is consistent with the timeline of starting to have the devices launching in the first half of \u201919. We see in Europe, at least three operators. ","You should expect in markets such as the UK and markets such as Germany, you\u2019re going to see a high degree activity. Many of those operators, we had announced trial activities and the timeline is the same as the first half of the 2019. Of course, you have Korea with all of the operators driving o the timeframe. You do have a technology race there. You have Australia in the same timeframe and you have Japan towards the second half of \u201919, beginning of 2020. ","The most significant data point is the one that I\u2019m providing last, which is China Mobile. In an event that we had in China last week, I think the executive management of China Mobile made a presentation together with Qualcomm talking about a very large scale activity in the second half of \u201919. The reason China is important because China, it's a very technology focus and harder focus market and as you look at the position that the Chinese OEMs have in the market, that enables an acceleration of the scale for the smartphone market. So China is likely going to be a significant development in the second half of \u201919.","George Davis","On OpEx, I think the -- if you think about our R&D, we're always going to be focused on making the level of R&D investment that is necessary to keep us ahead in things like generation transistors and where you\u2019ve seen today. So the ramp -- one of the ramps, the biggest part of the ramp and spending over the last couple years has really been tied to 5G. I\u2019's absolutely critical not only to the ability of the chip business to come out very strong in a leadership position in the early phase of the generation, but it's also why the value of our licensing program remains strong throughout the ecosystem. So you're going to see us take actions that are consistent with maintaining a strong level of R&D to preserve that position over time. ","We do think that SG&A has been inflated by a number of the challenges that we've seen over time. We think we have the opportunity to take that down, something on the order of 200 to 300 basis points on a stabilized basis. And we will look very strong within the industry with SG&A at that level. It'll look like a very appropriate cost structure, but we\u2019ll always have a little more focus on R&D because quite frankly we have the channels to get a return on that R&D, not only from the chip business and the licensing business but we're now seeing an even greater return on R&D as we expand in to automotive, IoT, networking, mobile compute, all of these markets are looking to the technologies that we lead in mobile as part of their next roadmap. And so we think that's ahead of us. We think that's part of the growth and we think anything we do on this billion dollar OpEx action will be consistent with that outlook.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brett Simpson with Arete.","Brett Simpson","I just had a question about the margin structure in QCT long term. I guess when you look at leadership franchises in semiconductor, you\u2019ve seen margins structurally rise over the last few years, typically leadership franchises that are returning 40% or so operating margins. And if I look at your QCT PBT margins, they have been really disappointing in the 4G era. So I was just wondering when you look to 5G and you believe you have a competitive advantage, a structural competitive advantage in this market and you're going to be selling more platform into RF and baseband and RF has been a much higher returns business than QCT over the years, is it a path where you see the QCT margin starting to inflect and you can reflect the returns of a real leadership franchise long term? Thank you.","George Davis","This is George. As we said, we expect QCT margins to continue to improve over time and rise above the 20% level. But one of the things I would point out, we've said that the growth in adjacencies has been a positive in that respect and it's certainly growing. It is accretive to the margin profile and I think it is getting us into markets where the structure -- the margin structure is more attractive over time. And so we'll continue to push hard on margin expansion and I should point out as the 2019 performance that we put out for the company doesn't include the margin benefit that we would expect to see as we enter the 5G era where we get both improvements in share and improvements in ASPs in the new devices and that's part of even in the core business where we're going to see expansion of margin.","Brett Simpson","And maybe just a follow-up on the Samsung arrangement that you announced, does it have any bearing on how you think about foundry relationships long term. I think in the last couple of years, you've been exclusively using Samsung LSI at 14-nanometer and I'm wondering whether that's something you think will continue as you move to 7 or particularly with this recent agreement with Samsung or will you be multi-sourcing leading edge going forward? Thank you.","Steve Mollenkopf","Brett, it\u2019s Steve. In terms of sourcing agreements, I would say we make them on an individual basis depending on what node and the details of a node. So it really just depends on the generation in terms of where we go. Now that being said, I think it is advantageous for us to have a broader set of assets in the company to be able to resolve issues with companies. And so we view our wafer volume and the fact that we have wafer volume from RF to the leading node as being a strategic asset for us. It's actually proven to be that way over the last several years. So I won't talk about where we're going, but I do think it is something that helps us strategically.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore","Two quick questions here. First on the QTL side, when you put your fiscal \u201919 earnings targets out there, it looks like you have a high level of confidence that the licensing issues will be resolved. So my first question is what gives you that confidence? And then the second question that's somewhat related is I wondered if we could get an update if any on the unnamed dispute that's going on and I assume given the arrangements today and agreement that that second dispute is not with Samsung? So those are the two questions.","Steve Mollenkopf","Ross, well maybe I'll start and I\u2019ll kick it to Don to provide some detail here, but on the disputes, a couple of things. I think there are a number of legal milestones that occur this year that are helpful typically in a licensing dispute, legal milestones provide an opportunity and a forcing function for the parties to sit down and to finally work things out. We've seen that in the case of our past history, both recently and over the last decade, which I think is helpful. ","Don can \u2013 with any follow up can answer that pretty well. I'm sorry you had another question toward the end.","Don Rosenberg","So on the unnamed other licensee, our practice has been that while we still believe there is -- it's productive to continue with negotiations that we don't name the licensee in a dispute. t's only when we get to the point where we feel like we've exhausted all practical activities there and so you should take that as we're still negotiating to see if we can resolve the dispute.","Steve Mollenkopf","And I would say also, this is Steve again. I think that the significance of the agreements that we announced today with Samsung I think are -- I think they're pretty evident, but we're quite pleased with those agreements. They're consistent with what we have done in the past in our forward looking plan and I think they also provide a good benchmark or reference point for our general licensing program moving forward as well. So I think those things to us provide good indicators that I think we're headed in the right direction as a business.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","I guess my first question is for Cristiano. Cristiano, I was wondering to make sure I understand the RF market opportunity. To what extent can you guys drive revenue on the 4G node versus the 5G node and I guess as you think about 5G and it sounds like your value proposition goes up significantly at 5G. How are you guys thinking about sort of the dollar capture potential per phone -- the incremental dollar capture?","Cristiano Amon","Hi, John. Thank you for the question. In 4G, we have been in the process to complete our product portfolio. We have been players within the antenna tuner and the envelope tracker and I think now we add into the portfolio starting to have designs and get ready to ship with our PAs in filters and actually going after the higher value segment, which is the multimode PA and the payment modules. And I think you're going to start that traction -- starting to happen within the second half of the year. That's the reason we talk about China in the China announcement with our OEMs. ","I think the China nature of the market, they look more of a system solution. I think as we establish our business there, we see a power off our MSM platform and be able to actually have a complete platform and so it's natural that you see that reaction coming from the China OEMs and that's how it's going to start building the business in 4G. As you said, 5G changes the landscape significantly because it changes giving a little bit more voice to the system solution provider and the baseband provider about what is the technology and they are at design that goes in the technology launch configuration as well as the opportunity for innovation with the tunable front end. And as we said earlier, I think we expect that to be an expansion of margins and allow us to grow faster than the market.","John Pitzer","George, maybe as my follow-up, in your comments around the chipset guidance being below seasonal for March, you called out both in modems and China, I\u2019m just kind of curious of the two which ones are the bigger driver of the below seasonal for the March quarter on the chipset business?","George Davis","Yeah. I would say from a below seasonal, China certainly is a factor, because the drop off at the end of December was more significant than expected. I would say sequentially, clearly, the big pullback by the modem customer is an important factor as I look sequentially for the chip business.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Mollenkopf, do you have anything further to add before adjourning the call?","Steve Mollenkopf","Thank you. Yes. I would just want to thank the employees for their hard work and for the good quarter, for the hard work in terms of not only delivering across the expectations, but also for the number of announcements that have gone out here over the last quarter or so. So keep up the good work. I really appreciate it. Thank you. We\u2019ll see you all next time.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

In addition, Cristiano Amon, Murthy Renduchintala, and Don Rosenberg will join the question-and-answer session. An Internet presentation and audio broadcast is accompanying this call and you can access them by visiting our Web site at www.qualcomm.com.","During this conference call, we will use non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G, and you can find the related reconciliations to GAAP on our Web site. I'd also like to direct you to our 10-Q and earnings release, which were filed and furnished respectively with the SEC today and are available on our Web site.","During this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future business or results of the Company. Actual events or results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q, which contain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","And now to comments from Qualcomm\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Steve Mollenkopf.","Steve Mollenkopf","Thank you, Warren, and good afternoon everyone. We delivered a strong quarter, achieving record revenues and non-GAAP operating income. QCT shipped a record number of MSM chipsets and delivered our highest ever revenue and earnings before tax. QTL operating performance was ahead of expectations and I am pleased to report that we have resolved our previously disclosed dispute with a large Chinese licensee. We are continuing to cooperate with the NDRC, as it conducts its investigation and believe it is progressing toward a resolution. During the quarter we also returned approximately $2.4 billion to stockholders through dividends and buyback activity, consistent with our increased capital return targets.","Turning to QCT, our first fiscal quarter was very strong with revenues in MSM chip shipments up 14% and 27% year-over-year respectively. MSM chip shipments were at the high end of our expectations as we saw broad strength across multiple OEMs, driven by demand in emerging regions and strong device replacement in the U.S.","While our outlook for the first half of the fiscal year is ahead of our prior expectations, our QCT forecast for the second half of the fiscal year has been reduced due to a number of factors. First, we are currently seeing a shift in share among OEMs at the premium tier, which has reduced the near term addressable opportunity for our Snapdragon processors and has skewed our product mix towards more modem chipsets in this tier. Second, we now expect that our Snapdragon 810 processor will not be in the upcoming design cycle of a large customer\u2019s flagship device, impacting our outlook for both volume and content in that device.","And thirdly, although we had a very strong competitive position exiting fiscal 2014, we are seeing heightened competition in China at the mid and high tiers. We are continuing to gain share year-over-year with OEMs based in China, but not at the pace we had previously expected. This is in part due to some product challenges with one of our chips in meeting some of the more demanding design points of those tiers. This has provided an opening to competitors who are being very aggressive in order to establish a position in the marketplace, resulting in more pricing pressure than previously expected.","We have already addressed many of the initial product challenges in order to support early customer device launches in these tiers and are continuing to further enhance the performance of this chip. As a result, we continue to expect to see a broad range of devices successfully launch and drive volume with this chip. We estimate that these factors will impact our QCT revenue growth and operating margins through the near term product cycles. However despite these near term factors, our view of the long-term strategic environment and QCT\u2019s leadership position remains strong.","Despite -- our design momentum for the Snapdragon 810 processor remains robust, with more than 60 products in the pipeline, including the recently announced LG G Flex2 and the Xiaomi Mi Pro Note. Snapdragon 810 is performing well and we look forward to a growing number of devices to be launched by our customers throughout the year. Snapdragon 810 delivers 64 bit CPU capability using licensed technology and is fabricated in 20 nanometer. As you know, the use of internally designed custom CPUs has been a core part of our strategy that has worked well for some time. With the 810 we made a conscious decision to use licensed cores to accommodate the accelerated shift to 64 bit. The competitive landscape has underscored the importance of differentiation associated with our internal custom designs and looking ahead, our next premium processor will use our own 64 bit custom CPU architecture as well as the most advanced process node. We expect this product to sample in the latter half of calendar 2015.","In China, the expanded FDD licenses increased competition between carriers, and the accelerated pace of LTE device penetration aligns with QCT\u2019s LTE leadership. We believe we are well positioned going forward for three primary reasons. First, we expect a modem transition driven by LTE Advanced, including uplink carrier aggregation will drive a new device design cycle beginning later this year, which our roadmap anticipates. Second, we will drive our roadmap to advanced performance nodes to enable us to competitively address the opportunities ahead. And finally we are differentiated both in terms of features and scale, which will allow us to help OEM\u2019s based in China, meet the specification and deployment challenges related to expanding their businesses outside of China.","For Qualcomm overall, our longer-term growth drivers remain strong, both in smartphones and adjacent areas where our mobile technologies and capabilities can bring next generation solutions; areas such as automotive, Internet of Things, mobile computing, networking, small cells and datacenter solutions. As a Consumer Electronics Show, it was clear that many industries looking to leverage mobile technologies into their products and businesses are looking to the leaders in mobile such as Qualcomm for support creating an Internet of Everything. We demonstrated a broad set of products and equipment that are already shipping with Qualcomm solutions inside, including the areas of automotive, smart home, smart city, networking, mobile healthcare and wearables.","On a related note, the very strong results of the AWS-3 spectrum auction here in the U.S. reinforces the need to continue to invest in cutting edge modem technologies that provide great user experiences, while helping operators improve their return on the spectrum asset investments. We are very well positioned to enable operators and OEMs to bring new spectrum bands online as quickly and as broadly as possible with technologies such as advanced carrier aggregation. ","I would like to now turn the call over to Derek Aberle.","Derek Aberle","Thank you Steve and good afternoon everyone. QTL delivered a strong quarter with revenue and earnings ahead of expectations and total reported device sales of $56.4 billion, which was slightly above the midpoint of our prior guidance. I am also pleased to report that we have resolved the dispute with major Chinese licensee that we previously disclosed. Importantly, we were able to successfully resolve this dispute despite the pending NDRC investigation. In addition to the licensee agreeing to report and pay royalties on past unreported sales, the resolution includes an expansion of the existing license agreement to include royalty bearing licenses for 4G only products, including 3-mode LTE smartphones sold for use in China.","We believe the licensee has fully reported its September quarter shipments in our first fiscal quarter and we expect the licensee to report in our second fiscal quarter a catch up for units that were sold in periods prior to the September quarter, but were not previously reported due to the dispute. We continue to believe that some of our Chinese licensees are not reporting all of their sales of licensed products. We have increased the number of audits that we are conducting of these licensees and are attempting to resolve the instances of under reporting.","While we always prefer to resolve these types of issues amicably with our licensees, we are of course prepared to enforce our rights under our license agreements if that becomes necessary. Although we continue to sign new 4G only and other license agreements, including in China and the recent resolution of the licensee dispute gives us even greater confidence that we'll be able to collect royalties over time on substantially all LTE device shipments, including 3-mode devices in China, and other currently unlicensed products. OEMs supplying a meaningful portion of 3-mode devices and lower Tier 3G connected tablets remained unlicensed. We are in discussions with many of these OEMs and are making progress, but we expect it will take some time to conclude all of the negotiations.","As to the NDRC investigation we are continuing to engage and fully cooperate with the NDRC as it conducts its investigation. We have discussed with the NDRC a number of proposals for addressing its concerns and we believe we are making progress towards a potential resolution. Having said that, the timing and outcome of any potential resolution remains uncertain as does the potential impact on our future business in China. ","Now let me provide an update of our view of global 3G\/4G device demand. We\u2019re seeing demand for global 3G\/4G devices continue to grow at a very healthy pace and we have increased our calendar global 3G\/4G device shipment estimate to approximately 1.35 billion units, up approximately 25% year-over-year. As a reminder, this includes those devices we expect to be reported to us through the first calendar quarter of 2015 as well as our estimates of unreported and unlicensed device sales, but excludes TD-SCDMA devices that do not implement LTE. The broad availability of compelling devices at the mid and low price tiers in emerging regions is driving strong demand for and migration to 3G\/4G devices. We\u2019re also seeing an increase in the replacement rate of devices in the United States.","Looking forward, we are also increasing our estimate for calendar 2015 global 3G\/4G device shipments. We now expect approximately 1.5 billion to 1.6 billion units to be shipped during 2015, up approximately 11% to 19% year-over-year, with a bias towards the high end of the range driven by continued positive upgrade trends in the United States and accelerating migrations to 3G\/4G devices in China, and other emerging regions.","As we explained last quarter, several factors primarily related to challenges in China are currently causing shipments reported by our licensees to be less than the global 3G\/4G unit shipments I just explained. For calendar year 2014 we are increasing our estimate of reported 3G\/4G devices to between 1.135 billion and 1.175 billion units, which is approximately 200 million units below the global 3G\/4G device estimate of approximately 1.35 billion units at the mid-point. This represents our current view of unreported and unlicensed activity for calendar year 2014, and after adjusting for resolution of the dispute, is in line with our prior expectation of the percentage of global device shipments that we expect to be unreported or unlicensed.","Turning to estimated 3G\/4G device ASPs, the ASP of devices reported to QTL during the first quarter of fiscal 2015 was approximately $197 at the mid-point. The sequential decline in the reported ASP was primarily driven by a weaker premium tier in the September quarter, ahead of new flagship launches, heavier price reductions of certain handset models, additional reported units from the Chinese licensee whose dispute we resolved and foreign exchange effects. ","In the second fiscal quarter, we expect both the global and reported ASPs to be higher sequentially as the strong holiday season at the mid and high-tiers more than offset some additional foreign exchange headwinds. We expect the reported ASP will be significantly impacted by the dilutive effects of catch up units sold during several prior periods that we expect to be reported in the second quarter as a result of resolution of a licensee dispute.","We are now forecasting global 3G\/4G device ASPs to decline approximately 12% to 13% year-over-year in fiscal 2015 instead of our previous estimate of 9% to 10%. With the delta being driven by stronger than expected unit growth in emerging regions, the September quarter pause in the premium tier, increased OEM competition and mix shifts and negative effects of foreign exchange, which alone contributes approximately $2 of the ASP decline. Within this overall view we are seeing relative stability in developed region ASPs as well as increasing ASPs from Chinese based OEMs.","In total we expect global 3G\/4G device sales in fiscal 2015 to be up approximately 6% to 9% over fiscal 2014 global 3G\/4G device sales, which is in line with previous expectations as the growth in volume from an increase in the replacement rates in the U.S. and accelerated emerging region migration offsets moderately increased ASP declines, including the expected impact of foreign exchange headwinds.","To conclude, we continue to see strong 3G\/4G device demand from both higher replacement rates and faster 2G to 3G\/4G migration. We are pleased to have resolved the previously disclosed dispute with the major Chinese licensee, and we remain focused on resolving our remaining challenges in China.","That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to George Davis.","George Davis","Thank you Derek and good afternoon everyone. Our first quarter results came in above expectations on better than expected operating performance from both QCT and QTL. Fiscal first quarter revenues were a record $7.1 billion, up 7% year-over-year and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.34, up 6% year-over-year. ","Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.10 above the $1.24 mid-point of our prior guidance range. QCT accounted for approximately half of the upside on strong MSM demand and lower operating expenses, with the balance coming from improved total reported device sales, lower operating expenses in QTL and other businesses, as well as the restatement of the R&D tax credit. In QTL total reported device sales by our licensees were $56.4 billion, slightly above the mid-point of our guidance range, with an average selling price of $197 at the mid-point and reported shipments of 286 million 3G\/4G based devices at the mid-point.","QCT achieved a number of records in this quarter including shipments of 270 million MSMs, revenues of $5.2 billion and earnings before tax of $1.1 billion. Revenue for MSM was lower sequentially as expected, reflecting a greater mix of modems. QCT operating margin was 22% in the fiscal first quarter, reflecting strong MSM shipments and lower operating expenses. For the Company overall, non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses were lower than our expectations, decreasing 3% sequentially, reflecting timing of certain program spending and cost initiatives in the quarter.","Turning to capital structure, during the fiscal first quarter, we returned approximately $2.4 billion to stockholders, or 112% of free cash flow, including approximately $700 million of dividends paid and approximately $1.7 billion in stock repurchases. As of the end of the first fiscal quarter, we had approximately $3.6 billion remaining of our stock repurchase authorization. Additionally, since the end of the fiscal first quarter, we have repurchased an additional 6.8 million shares for approximately $500 million.","Cash flow from operations was approximately $2.4 billion or 33% of revenues and we ended the fiscal first quarter with cash and marketable securities of $31.6 billion. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 18% in the fiscal first quarter and we now estimate that our fiscal 2015 non-GAAP tax rate will be approximately 18%, slightly higher than our original estimates on business mix.","Now turning to our guidance for fiscal 2015, our revised financial guidance for the fiscal year reflects a reduced outlook for the QCT business in the second half of the fiscal year. We now expect 2015 total Qualcomm revenue to be in the range of $26 billion to $28 billion, up approximately 2% year-over-year at the midpoint and lower than our previous guidance midpoint by $800 million. We now expect 2015 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $4.75 to $5.05, down approximately 7% year-over-year at the midpoint and down 6% from our previous full year guidance midpoint. We estimate fiscal 2015 QCT operating margins will now be in the range of 16% to 18%, which reflects a reduction of about 200 basis points at the midpoint.","Our QTL forecast for the fiscal year is modestly improved, driven by an improved TRDS outlook, partially offset by a modest increase and the impact of foreign exchange. We continue to expect that fiscal 2015 QTL operating margins will be approximately 85% to 86%. Combined non-GAAP, R&D and SG&A expenses are expected to grow approximately 3% to 5% year-over-year, in line with prior expectations. As a reminder, we continue to expect lower investment income in fiscal 2015 as compared to the strong investment gains supported in fiscal 2014 as we rebalance the risk levels in our investment portfolio.","Looking to our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $6.5 billion to $7.1 billion, up approximately 7% year-over-year at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share in our second fiscal quarter to be approximately $1.28 to $1.40 per share, up approximately 2% year-over-year at the midpoint. We anticipate second fiscal quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be up 6% to 8% sequentially, reflecting normal increased seasonal expenses primarily related to employee payroll taxes.","In QTL, we estimate total reported device sales of $69.5 billion to $75.5 billion will be reported by our licensees in the March quarter for shipments they made in the December quarter, up approximately 9% year-over-year at the midpoint, reflecting the busy holiday season. We also expect to see a benefit from previously uncollected royalties for prior period sales related to the resolution of a customer dispute in China.","In QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 220 million to 240 million units during the March quarter, down approximately 15% at the midpoint sequentially coming off the busy holiday quarter and up approximately 22% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect revenue per MSM to be relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. We expect QCT operating margin to be approximately 16% to 17% in the fiscal second quarter, lower sequentially, reflecting the impact of lower seasonal volumes.","That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren.","Warren Kneeshaw","Thank you, George. Brent, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","James Faucette","I guess I just want to focus on operating margins for QCT, et cetera. Can you give a little bit of color on what\u2019s driving those down in the -- for the year, like how you're having to spend additional funding or spend additional money versus just pricing pressure and that kind of thing. And I'm also wondering if you can talk through more medium to long run what you think your to do list looks like to recapture the loss share and better reassert yourself in the markets where you're feeling the most pressure. Thank you. ","George Davis","This is George. Really the out margin effect in the near-term that we're talking about is really typical seasonal, coming off of a very strong December quarter. For the full year the reduction of the 200 basis points we talked about is really a function of the change in outlook for the year, which is being driven by impacts at the premium tier and so that\u2019s having margin pressure. You're also seeing some of the OpEx benefit we saw in the first half was really timing of programs, and so that will be in the second half of the year, impacting margins as well. ","Steve Mollenkopf","And this is Steve. With respect to the medium tier, long tier, or long-term I think I would view this more as a product cycle issue versus anything else. If you look at -- one of the hardest things for us do is to project what the mix is going to be, whether we're going to sell a lot of thin modems or whether it\u2019s going to be Snapdragon processors. And I think the largest impact in terms of the change of the outlook is really due to the mix of products. As I said in my remarks, the 810 is actually doing quite well. Any concerns about the 810 in terms of design traction really are probably limited to one OEM versus anything else. ","In the low tier in China it's very competitive right now, primarily because there are a number of new entrants trying to get share. We think there will be a modem transition in the second half of this year and we are anticipating that. We think that will be a good strategy. I think long-term though, I don\u2019t think we see a change in the competitive dynamic, or even a change in the strategy of particular customers. We think this is more of a product issue. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Brian Modoff ","Steve, off that last statement you made in terms of modem transition in the back half of the year, can you give us more color around this? Is this still 20 nanometer? Is it going to be more of a 16? How is it going to different? And then what you're seeing competitively in China? Are you seeing competitors coming with something more than a 3-mode solution? Are you seeing something more advanced than that? And then on George, the question, or Derek, this licensee that you settled with in China, can you give us an idea of what the rates are for that licensee? Is it around your corporate average and it does include single mode LTE as well, and an ability to collect on that as well as collect on multimode that includes TD-SCDMA.","Steve Mollenkopf","So Brian in China, we're not seeing anything different than really 3-mode in China. We're not seeing much ability for the competitors to go outside of China. And we have anticipated that carrier aggression would be important in China across tiers and we think that that will happen here sometime in the second half of the year. It\u2019s always difficult to time transitions in China, but as you're aware, it\u2019s a pretty fast moving situation there. If you look at really kind of year-over-year, we're still going to see share move up in China in these tiers. We just anticipated that it would grow even more. And that\u2019s exacerbated by the pricing pressures as I mentioned. And so we're looking forward to see a modem transition. We will follow that up with FinFET products. Eventually we are going to transition our existing products to move advanced nodes but I'll try to keep some of that proprietary for us right now. ","Derek Aberle","Brian this is Derek. Yes, we can\u2019t talk too specifically about the terms in the agreement, including the rates, but I guess I'll just say that we're pleased with the resolution of the dispute. As I said we believe that in this quarter the licensee has now reported sort of the full volume that they were supposed to report under their agreement. They will also we expect be reporting a catch up amount for prior period sales next quarter. That will benefit for us. And then we were able to extend the scope of the agreement to your question, to include LTE only licenses. This particular licensee was already licensed for 3G, but we've now extended that to include 4G-only, including the 3-mode devices sold on China mobiles network. So all-in-all, we feel very good about the result.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question. ","Tim Long ","Just one follow-up and another one if I could. If we could just go back to the, maybe George, the $800 million revenue reduction and $0.30 in earnings, it seems like pretty large incremental margin implied there. So maybe you can just walk us through how there is that big of an impact on that type of revenue mix? And then I loved the opinion of you guys on this Xiaomi-Ericsson deal in India, where you guys -- Xiaomi allowed to ship with your products in there. Just curious what do you think that means for the chipset business for the Chinese to export, and does it mean anything for the licensing business and potential discussions with NDRC? Thank you.","George Davis","Hi Tim, this is George. So on the flow through issue, which is essentially seeing $0.30 off for the full year on what we\u2019re looking at, what you\u2019re really seeing is the fact that while we describe kind of three themes in terms of impacting the second half of the year for QCT, it\u2019s really the themes that impact the premium tier that are driving the impact. And so the margin flow through impact on that revenue is in line with the adjustment that we\u2019re talking about. So it\u2019s really driven by the fact that the impact is happening at place a where we have strong operating margins.","Derek Aberle","Tim this is Derek. Let me answer your question on Xiaomi. So I think we\u2019ve consistently said that we believe that we\u2019re uniquely positioned to help the Chinese OEMs build their businesses outside the China. That comes obviously both from a product perspective, in terms of our scale and ability to do that, as well as the cross license rights that we\u2019ve obtained as we've negotiated agreements over the years and I think you're seeing some of that play out now in India.","On the licensing side, I wouldn\u2019t draw any direct correlation to the NDRC, but what I would say is we\u2019ve talked from time to time about tools that we have at our disposal to deal with companies that are not complying with their agreements or not signing licenses, and I think you can look at what\u2019s going on in India as just one example of the tools that are available.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead with your question.","Mike Walkley ","Just for Steve, going back to the QCT guidance, can you update us on expectations for revenue per MSM that\u2019s implied in your guidance with the mix shift? And also just longer term, on a bigger picture view, which Qualcomm's long-term business model really has been about increasing dollar content or revenue per MSM over time. After this product cycle, some of the misses do you think this metric can return to growth in fiscal 2016? Thank you.","George Davis","Mike, this is George. On the outlook for the year, we haven\u2019t guided but effectively what we did say it will be relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. For the full year in the second half, again pointing to the premium tier waiting of some of these issues, it will have a dampening effect but we\u2019ll just leave it at that.","Steve Mollenkopf","Mike, this is Steve. Also in the longer term I would say I\u2019m not sure we see a difference in terms of what the market is looking for. In fact I would suggest that even though our mix is probably more in modem versus Snapdragon based, the overall market appears to be absorbing new technology quite rapidly, even to the point where it appears that perhaps even in certain tiers, the replacement rate is improving, because people are upgrading to a larger screen and what have you. And we think that\u2019s a good trend for our business both on a licensing side as well as the chip side eventually. ","I want to be clear. I think -- the 810, we think is going to be quite strong in terms of design traction, and they will be in a lot of devices. As I said, it will be over 60 devices. And it will be interesting to see how it sell through. But we\u2019re definitely getting the sense that you still have to provide leadership technology in order to win.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Ehud Gelblum with Citi. Please go ahead with your question.","Ehud Gelblum ","A couple of questions. Can we just hit at the heart of the 810 issues, obviously been lot of news in the press about overheating and if you can just kind of hit on your -- just want to confirm, is it your opinion or thought process that the issues with that flagship device happened on a compatibility issue or incompatibility issue between the 810 and that particular device and that in any other device those issues are not a concern? If you can just give us a little detail on why that might be, to let us get a feeling as to, maybe there is nothing particularly wrong with 810 per say, but that it just happened to be a matchup with that one device, that would be helpful.","George, or Derek, now that you have that licensee signed up, can you give us sense as to how large is this catch up going to be next quarter and is that in guidance, so we can kind of take that out and get a sense as to what the pure guidance for next quarter will be without that catch up. And your new numbers for the recognized volume for 2014 I believe it was, included just 20 million higher than it was before. So 195 million is the delta between the recognized and unrecognized TRDSs whereas now -- so now it's 195. Last time it was 215 million. I don\u2019t mean to get too complicated, but is that 20 million improvement and the difference between the global TRDS and your recognized TRDS, is that all due to this one licensee. Thank you.","Steve Mollenkopf","Ehud, this is Steve. On the 810, let me be very clear. The device is working the way that we expected it work and we have design traction that reflects that. If you look at the number of designs, it's over 60. It's essentially won all the premium designs across multiple ecosystems in China, Windows Mobile, as well as Android. So we\u2019re quite pleased with how that is performing. There is a concern. As you mentioned it\u2019s related to one OEM, and I don\u2019t think you should extend that to imply that something has changed fundamentally between us and that OEM. And of course that OEM has a number of different models that we feel well positioned across our entire product tiers.","So I think that\u2019s going to be a great product for us. We are going to follow that up as I mentioned in my script with a device that returns to our internally developed CPU with integrated modem and are going at the latest node. So, I don\u2019t think we see any change in strategy, and we\u2019re quite pleased with that device. We just wish it had won one more design.","Derek Aberle","Ehud, its Derek. So you might recall that when we gave prior guidance, just given the amount of issues that were on the table and the uncertainty associated with the timing of resolution of each of those, we gave quite a wide range and said to get towards the higher end of the range we needed to resolve or make progress on several of them. So in essence, the resolution of the dispute was already baked into guidance from that perspective. The catch-up payment is also effectively included within the guidance that we provided for Q2.","On the math exercise, I actually figured somebody was going to ask this question. So let me try to break it down for you. Remember we gave quite a wide range of the under-reported or unreported amount, because again there is uncertainty around exactly what that would be. And everybody kind of gravitated towards using the midpoint of 215 as the talking point, although we don\u2019t have any more confidence necessarily in the midpoint than we do on other parts of the range. And the way you get to the 215 is sort of assuming at the low end of the range there is no resolution with this particular licensee, and at the high end of the range assuming that there would be full resolution. So the midpoint is actually something in between.","So when you actually try to deconstruct the math, it\u2019s pretty hard to get there. But let me just basically tell you, the net-net of all this is, there is an improvement based on resolution of the dispute. So therefore less units being under-reported. But also the overall end market we believe, is going to grow at a faster pace than we did during the last time we provided guidance. ","And so even though the percentage of units that we believe will be unreported is basically staying in line with our prior expectation, the actual number of units would have gone up, but for the resolution. So the net-net of this is it comes down, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily -- can\u2019t attribute the delta exactly to the amount that\u2019s resolved from the dispute.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead with your question.","Timothy Arcuri","Derek, just on that point about the increase in the TAM for 2014 and then also 2015, can you talk about what regions that that\u2019s coming from and maybe what portion of that is China? And then as a follow up for George, just on capital return, the stock is down now sort of into the mid-60s here post market. You bought back $500 million during January, which is sort of the same run rate that you bought back during the entirety of calendar Q4. Yet it doesn\u2019t even really scratch the surface on really what you could do. Is the thinking around more capital return just China and getting that resolved?","Derek Aberle","Tim, its Derek. So I think on your first question, really the growth in the market is primarily coming from a stronger view on emerging regions, which includes China, but it\u2019s not entirely China. So other regions such as India, Middle East and Africa and some others are contributing to that as well.","George Davis","Tim, on capital return, obviously we increased our program in this area substantially starting last year. And this quarter we talked about returning over 112%, our minimum commitment being 75% return of capital. So we\u2019re pleased to be increasing in this environment. But we\u2019ll continue to focus on shareholder returns but we\u2019re again not going to forecast our future repurchases other than we\u2019re committed to the return of capital commitments that we made in our program announcement last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.","Stacy Rasgon","I have two. First, I want to take a little bit of exception to the -- your point that the unit TAM is going up. It looks like the unit TAM is going up, but for the global market. But your global ASPs, you guided them down quite a bit. They were down 9 to 10, now they\u2019re down 12 to 13. It doesn\u2019t look like you took your estimate for the global market value up that all. So all of these units are coming in, but they\u2019re coming in at lower ASP and there is no revenue growth upside versus where you were modeling before. So how should we be thinking about I guess the impact of elasticity here in units and growth and how do we think about the market growth going forward?","Secondly, I\u2019d love to get some feeling. I know you\u2019re enabling -- doing your best to enable the China OEMs to grow outside of China. And maybe you don\u2019t have any choice. So I'm just wondering is that a good thing to do? Maybe get back to the first one, what does it mean for the long term business as the China OEMs gain share outside of China and start to take share in potentially developed markets with ASPs that are probably quite a bit lower than what you\u2019re enjoying there today.","Derek Aberle","Stacy, its Derek. On the market growth, effectively when we think back to the discussion we had in New York, really what we said is about 6% to 9% global TRDS growth, and we had a view on what ASPs would do throughout the calendar year. But we also made the point that in 2014 and \u201915, we really view this fundamentally as an elasticity of demand exercise, and as ASPs come down, that units would go up. So even if there was an increasing pressure or decline on the ASP in the next year or so, that would drive higher units and essentially that\u2019s what we're seeing. So those two dynamics are playing out. The growth in the market overall from a TRDS perspective is in line with what we expected in New York earlier in the year, but it\u2019s just a little different mix in terms of units versus ASP.","And you might recall we did talk about a number of factors, which we think long-term cause the ASP declines to moderate. And I think that also applies to your comment on the Chinese OEMs. I think a couple of things we expect will happen over time. One is that there is going to be consolidation among the Chinese OEM base. There's just really too many players to sustain themselves long-term. And if that happens, as well as they become more successful outside of China, invest in building their brand, invest more in R&D, that there is no reason that their pricing profile would not become more in line with what we're seeing from some of the other OEMs today. And actually we commented on that today in the scripts, that we actually are starting to see Chinese OEM ASPs increase.","Steve Mollenkopf","Stacy, its Steve. I think also you should think about the Chinese OEMs really as being multiple tiers. We see a grouping that in many ways is filling in some of the gaps that are being left because some handset manufacturers that historically have been in the United States and Northern Europe or even in Japan have exited portions of the world, and they've been filled in largely by some of the higher tier Chinese OEMs and they have strong ambitions and they're really developing the assets to be able to do that. In addition there is a lower tier product which I think is being used really to drive the migration from 2G to 3G\/4G and both of those trends we think are good for our business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question. ","Tavis McCourt","Steve two for you. Just to clarify on your answer to Ehud\u2019s question on the large OEM, is that a product line that you'll be selling a thin modem into or no chipset at all? And then secondly you mentioned or I guess hinted at a modem transition in China later this year. I suspect that\u2019s carrier aggression. Do you have any sense of your lead against your major competitor there on getting a carrier aggression chip in that market. Thanks. ","Steve Mollenkopf","It's Steve. I'll try to stay away from talking a lot about the different design dynamics in a particular OEM, in part because I'm not sure it\u2019s even been determined yet as to how that\u2019s going to settle out, and also it's just part of our -- we just don\u2019t talk about those things. But we did think it was important to disclose how it impacted our financials with respect to the 810.","On carrier aggression, and I would say LTE feature set broadly, which is quite diverse as you probably recall from our trip in November to New York, we feel like we're in a very strong position, not just in terms of future leadership at the high tier, but we have moved carrier aggression down in through the tiers. And similar to what we did with the transition to 4G where we made a transition to make sure that we were there for that move in China, we think there will be feature updates happening in China. We also believe that long-term you need to offer international markets to the Chinese OEMs because of the answer to the previous question. And therefore you trip on the requirement to add new bands, to support things like VoLTE and SRVCC, things that really stress the modem feature set. So we feel like we have a strong lead there. We are starting to see 3-mode competition come in, but we don\u2019t believe that to be enough of the feature set to really cause us to change our view of the strategic environment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question. ","Kulbinder Garcha ","My first question for Steve which is the, with this transition of the major OEM, I guess I know you got a lot of 810 design wins. That's reassuring. The issue being at the high-end of the market, what has become very clear in the last three years or four years is its two vendors. One of them doesn\u2019t use your Snapdragon, which is the one seems to be deemphasizing it frankly. And so the issue here being is that, if that condition prevails, you're making a better market share in the high-end which has proved very hard to track if there is somehow [ph] change. And what confidence do you have that therefore that the 810 will drive an improving mix at some point towards three quarters? I'm just trying to understand the dynamic of whether confidence coming from it could be a good product for you in the QCT business, really?","And then for Derek, my question is on the resolution you've had of this one licensee in China. The lower-end of your TDRS range has gone up by only $5 billion. And so high-end hasn\u2019t going up. You probably anticipate it maybe coming through. What I'm trying to get is -- has the outlook for the licensing opportunity in 2015 echo this resolution [indiscernible] ForEx or ASPs or mix and that kind of thing? Is that the right way of thinking about it ex this resolution.","Steve Mollenkopf","Kulbinder, its Steve. So in terms of the long-term, I think our view is that it probably won\u2019t consolidate to just two OEMs. And in fact I think it would be broader than just two ecosystems will be successful in the mobile computing area. And I think even in the near term if you were to look at a market or a region such as China and you would look at how the share has changed around over time, you\u2019ve seen a number of different OEMs who have really taken share at the premium tier. They tend not to be household names in the U.S. or in the developed world yet, but we think there is an opportunity for that to occur.","In addition I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve seen things -- we haven\u2019t seen things settle out in terms of how the different ecosystems will play over a multiyear period. And I think if you look at the views that we have had over the years in terms of which OEM was going to win, we\u2019ve been very, very hesitant to make a particular bet or a strategy based off of that, and just to shift chairs between what\u2019s happened in either Nokia or RIM or what you have over the years have really I think reinforced that to be the right place. What we tend to do is drive technology. We tend to have an interest in technology and make sure that that\u2019s a key thing. Now we are very, very aware that as the market opportunity narrows because of a particular thin modem going better versus the CAP, we have to watch that in terms of how we spend our investment and we\u2019re trying to do that judiciously.","Derek Aberle","Kulbinder, this is Derek. On the second question, really if you look at, like you said, we kept the high end of the reported TRDS range the same, but brought up the bottom into the range by about $5 billion which would actually shift the midpoint up. And there is a bunch of puts and takes in that. Obviously the resolution of the dispute would push it up but there's also some offsetting factors with FX, ASP and unit. So you can necessarily triangulate the 5 billion just to the licensee dispute, but the net-net of that is actually probably a more positive not negative picture and I would say kind of incrementally we\u2019re feeling more positive about the outlook for the business in the fiscal year than in November even.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Tal Liani with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.","Tal Liani ","I have questions about your cash position, U.S. cash position. It declined year-over-year substantially from $8.7 billion to $4.1 billion if my numbers are right. And that means that you will run out of domestic cash in the next nine months or so if you burn the amount of cash. So it also declined substantially sequentially. What are the puts and takes in the cash burn? Is there anything else outside of dividends and buybacks that we need to consider? Then the second question is assuming you\u2019re going to have access to more capital, whether it\u2019s through debt raising or repatriation even, whatever it is, what are going to be the uses of cash? Are you going to increase the dividend substantially or do you have any agenda on the right dividends if you have more access to capital. Thanks.","Steve Mollenkopf","So consistent with what we\u2019ve said, the step up and our return of capital is going to drive down our domestic cash balance and that\u2019s really what you've seen. We indicated either on the last call or at the Analyst Meeting, I believe it was on the last call, we would actually be in the market raising debt in our second fiscal quarter, which we still believe we will do, and again really to try and maintain a cash balance in the $2 billion to $4 billion range at all times domestically for flexibility. But as you\u2019ve seen, in \u201814 we returned capital ahead of our minimum commitment of 75%, closer to 100% and we\u2019re ahead of that in the first quarter, having returned 112%. So it\u2019s really returning capital more aggressively in the former share repurchase, plus the last two dividend increases where 40% and 20%. So significant increase in our divided outlays as well, all part of our program that we talked about last year and are executing to.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Rod Hall ","Thanks for taking my question. I guess you talked a lot about the Snapdragon and what\u2019s going on there and the redesign of the -- using your core and so on. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the second half of the year and the trajectory of the baseband business, the thin modem business. Do you think that you expect to maintain share in the second half of the year? Do you think that share starts to slip a little bit as new competitors come on? Can you just walk us through kind of how you see share progressing on that through the year. And then I wanted to return back to this market growth question. Our model is now predicting a further deceleration of unit volume in 2016. So looking out another year. And I\u2019m just wondering, do you think that ASP declines like you\u2019re expecting this year continue on into that year? Are we looking at a year with even slower growth on the total market value? I know that\u2019s a long ways out but I\u2019d be curious to know what you\u2019re thinking there on ASPs.","Steve Mollenkopf","Rod, this is Steve. So on share, I think what you're really seeing is a change in mix versus a fundamental share picture in QCT. You tend to see more thin modems versus Snapdragon processors. And as everybody is working through changing their portfolio to respond I think to a very strong player in the premium tier that\u2019s changed the mix of products. And then in addition I would say in China, we\u2019re going to see share gains year-over-year but not as much as we had expected. It\u2019s pretty competitive in terms of the environment there. But it\u2019s really more a mix story versus a share story.","Derek Aberle","Rod, this is Derek. Let me just kind of go back. I\u2019ll try to recap some of the stuff we talked about in New York. We really gave a view on ASPs for \u201914 and \u201915 and then talked about -- we think that they\u2019re going to stabilize or moderate more longer term. And so we haven\u2019t given guidance all the way out into \u201916. But if you kind of think back to some of the drivers that we still see as playing out over the longer term, right now we think a lot of this is coming from an accelerated growth of emerging region volume, which we think will -- the relative growth versus developed will moderate over time.","We also think there's going to be a replacement cycle over time in the developing regions. And then we gave a number of statistics I think back in New York around increases and affordability and the amount of disposable income that people are willing to spend on their mobile device. And in fact there was just a Boston consulting group report that was released last week in Davos that really underscored that. I think in India it was about 45% of disposable income. It\u2019s what people would spend on their mobile device. China was around that same range, maybe a little lower.","So we see a longer term picture where affordability and then people trading up as they move into the smartphone tiers will help actually stabilize or even increase selling prices in emerging regions. And then as we talked about on the -- with the Chinese OEMs, one of the things that\u2019s going on right now is basically share shift between non-Chinese players to Chinese OEMs in China and other regions. And today that\u2019s coming at a lower ASP, although we think over the long term that that will stabilize as well as there is consolidation and these companies get a stronger position in the market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amit Shah with Nomura. Please go ahead with your question.","Amit Shah","Derek, you may have read that Apple and Ericsson are in a licensing dispute, with Apple saying that among other things that the royalty should be -- the rate should be based on the price of the baseband chip. And that sort of added to concerns that we may have this spillover effect from China and into other regions. I was hoping you could talk about that. And if you could just update us on when there might be some major contract renewals?","Derek Aberle","Why don\u2019t I take the first -- I'll try very hard not to comment specifically on the litigation between Apple and Ericsson, given that they\u2019re both partners and customers. But let me just kind of take it up a level and talk about the baseband chip licensing. There have been I would say efforts or arguments made for a number of years, both in patent litigation as well as standards bodies that the appropriate royalty base should be the chip instead of the full device. Those have actually never succeeded anywhere where the argument has been made. And even the damage as well in the U.S. is not consistent with that when you think about portfolio based licensing.","So we\u2019ll have to watch this and see where it goes. But certainly the norm in our industry has been very much in line with the way that we have licensed historically and we think there's a lot of good reasons that support that long term. Also I don\u2019t want to comment too specifically on China. There have been obviously a lot of rumors and things in the press. But you even look at the Chinese OEMs that have disclosed how they might license their IP portfolios and they talk about licensing at the handset level, not the chip level, and some of the decisions that have come out of China, and the legal system has been consistent with that as well. So there certainly will be arguments made over the years because there's a lot of incentives to make those arguments, but at least as the law stands today, I think we\u2019re pretty comfortable with the way that we've structured our program.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Mark Sue","In the early stages of the smartphone market, it was really about getting your phones out to market, velocity [ph] of market, getting it out there. And so that favored the integrated solutions. Now with this concentrated market share and the increased choice of components, local competition in China and as the market further matures, is this part of a broader trend to kind of unbundle and disintegrate components in flagship devices? How we should be thinking about it over the longer term?","Steve Mollenkopf","Mark this is Steve. So I\u2019d say when we look at the accounts and we look at the competitive situation, I would really not make that conclusion. Most of -- in fact without question every competitive solution is trying to get to an integrated space. Part of that is in order to compete in the marketplace, you have to fit within an area and a cost target that without integration very, very difficult to do. It\u2019s really only one OEM that doesn\u2019t do that and does that well. And they tend to play at a very high tier which gives you little bit more freedom not to do that. But the vast majority of units worldwide don\u2019t have that luxury. And so we tend to see everybody trying to produce integrated solutions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Simpson with Arete. Please go ahead with your question. ","Brett Simpson ","Just on QCT, the high-end, the situation with the 810 share loss, is this really focused on one launched device with this OEM or will it something that you see impacting other flagship launch devices with this OEM throughout the year? And just as a follow-up on QCT, I wanted to square this relationship you have with Samsung LSI. So, on hand you are competing with Samsung LSI\u2019s Exynos chip and on the other you are partnering with Samsung LSI on the foundry side for FinFET. So can you help us make sense of this and how this isn\u2019t a dangerous position for Qualcomm? Why are you so confident this is good for the Company? ","Steve Mollenkopf","Sure Brett on your first about the 810 and in a particular account, I would think of it as isolated really to one account and one portion of their portfolio. I can\u2019t really talk about what would happen in the future. It\u2019s really a better question for them versus us. Broadly in the industry I think we're quite pleased with the design traction and we just would love to see them take more share versus some other folks in the -- see premium tier growing more would be great for that product, I think this is really the key.","In terms of the relationship with Samsung LSI and Samsung in general, it really hasn\u2019t changed. We've had a long standing relationship with Samsung across different things, whether it\u2019s the licensing or our product business or the foundry or even our collaboration across mobile and different devices. We have a very broad relationship. I wouldn\u2019t think that there is a change in that and it\u2019s not a new relationship as well. As I've mentioned number of times, the fact that Samsung now has a leading node tends to be something that\u2019s good for the Qualcomm business. It allows us to compete with other competitors in the marketplace. So we have a very intricate, but I think a good relationship with Samsung. ","Warren Kneeshaw","Thank you everyone.

Mr. Kneeshaw, please go ahead.","Warren Kneeshaw","Thank you, Ryan, and good afternoon everyone. Today's call will include prepared remarks by Dr. Paul Jacobs, Steve Mollenkopf and Bill Keitel. In addition, Derek Aberle and Don Rosenberg will join the question-and-answer session. An Internet presentation and audio broadcast accompany this call, and you can access them by visiting our website at www.qualcomm.com.","During the conference call, if we use non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G, you can find the related reconciliations to GAAP on our website. I'd also like to direct you to our 10-K and earnings release, which were filed and furnished, respectively, with the SEC today and are available on our website.","During this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events or results of the company. Actual events or results could differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q, which contain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","And now it is my pleasure to introduce Qualcomm's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Paul Jacobs.","Paul Jacobs","Thanks Warren and good afternoon everyone. We\u2019re obviously off to an excellent start in fiscal 2013 and pleased to report a record quarter driven by strong year over year growth in both our QCT and QTL businesses. Revenues were up 29% and non-GAAP earnings per share were up 30% compared to a year ago. In QCT, we delivered record chipset volumes which included eliminating the constraint on 28 nanometer devices as we had expected. In addition, QCT continues to drive technology and product leadership as we announced the new Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 800 and 600 processors, featuring ultra-high definition video playback and capture and our latest generation micro-architecture with clock speeds up to 2.3 gigahertz per core, the 800 processor is class leading and we continue to set the bar for the smartphone user experience. ","Turning to QTL, our licensees reported stronger than expected total reported device sales as the broad based adoption of 3G and 3G\/4G products continues driven by strength in smartphones. We continue to invest and innovate across a broad set of technologies and believe that our patent portfolio applicable to 3G and 4G products is the most widely licensed in the industry. In fact, we have now over 225 CDMA licenses and - licensees \u2013 and more than 40 royalty bearing single mode OFDMA licensees. ","And with respect to our display business, we recently announced an expansion of our display arrangement with Sharp in order to accelerate the commercialization of our Pixtronix MEMS displays utilizing Sharp\u2019s IGZO technology with the goal of driving high performance, lower-power displays from a variety of devices, including smartphones and tablets. ","Our Pixtronix technology uses the MEMS-based shutter system to deliver color performance similar to OLED with wide angle view ability and lower power consumption than LCD or OLED. As we previously indicated, we are increasing our focus on licensing our display technologies, including our next generation Mirasol display technology while at the same time directly commercializing certain current generation Mirasol displays.","Looking forward we believe our long-term growth drivers remain intact. Smartphone demand remains strong. Gartner estimates that approximately 169 million smartphones were shipped in the third calendar quarter of 2012 representing a 47% year-over-year growth. In China alone, Gartner estimates that approximately 47 million smartphones were shipped in the third calendar quarter of 2012 representing greater than 115% year-over-year growth. ","In the U.S. both AT&T and Verizon Wireless recently reported a healthy fourth quarter \u2013 fourth calendar quarter smartphone sales with close to 20 million units between them. And in emerging markets, Wireless Intelligence estimates that there are now more than 1 billion 3G 4G connections, representing 34% year-over-year growth. In China in particular Wireless Intelligence estimates that there were 325 million 3G connections, including [one act] (ph) at the end of 2012 which represents 49% year-over-year growth. ","Now this brings 3G penetration to 29% in China, so excellent progress and still plenty of opportunity ahead. China Mobile recently announced a pre-commercial trial for LTE TDD and Qualcomm chipsets were in 14 out of 31 devices selected for the trial. In addition, I recently attended China Telecom\u2019s annual handset fair where they discussed having 480 CDMA 2000 ecosystem partners and their goal to have 200 million mobile subscribers by the end of 2013. And there are currently over 0.5 billion CDMA 2000 connections globally according to Wireless Intelligence. ","With the increased penetration of the data centric devices and higher usage, we continue to see robust growth in wireless data. In order to address this growing demand we remain focused on addressing what we call the 1000x data challenge. We\u2019re working to expand the wireless data capacity by a 1000 times from its current level. We believe that small cells operating and license spectrum band and using advanced interference management techniques on a dynamic basis will be an important component in meeting the challenge. There was positive progress on this initiative in December when the SEC proposed to convert the 3.5 GHz band into a dedicated license spectrum band for small cells. ","Additionally, operators continue to use the advanced network technologies, such as LTE to help address growing demand for data. Globally the number of LTE operators has now reached 145 according to the GSA representing greater than 200% year-over-year growth, and Wireless Intelligence estimates that global 4G LTE connections which run on multimode 3G, 4G devices reached approximately 60 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, up more than 500% from the prior year. ","Finally, we continue to see the opportunity for non-handset devices as positive for our business. In early December at Dell World, Dell highlighted upcoming support for multimode 3G, 4G and the XTS 10, their Windows RT based tablet as well as across their portfolio of business tablets and notebooks. In addition, auto manufacturers are now announcing multimode 3G, 4G connectivity in new models and together with AT&T we announced a plug and play development platform based on Gobi that will enable a wide range of applications and devices to connect to AT&T\u2019s network.","To conclude, we\u2019ve completed a record quarter at Qualcomm and we\u2019re pleased to be increasing our fiscal 2013 guidance. We are continuing to execute against our strategic priorities and we look forward to addressing the growing set of opportunities ahead.","So, thanks, and I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Steve Mollenkopf.","Steve Mollenkopf","Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. Our QCT business had another great quarter, with record MSM shipments, revenues and operating profit. Revenue and operating profit were up 34% and 45%, respectively, versus a year ago.","We shipped 182 million MSM chipsets above our prior expectations, reflecting strong demand across our portfolio, including China - emerging account shipments, which more than doubled year-over-year, and multimode 3G\/LTE shipments up more than 90% sequentially.","We were pleased to see our chipsets driving many of the flagships smartphone models announced this holiday season, including the Google Nexus 4, the LG Optimus G, the Nokia Lumia models and Samsung Galaxy S III and [Xperia S] [ph], the HTC Droid DNA 8X and 8S, the Motorola RAZR M and the Sony Xperia T and TL.","With our leading technologies broad product roadmap and relationships with all the top OEMs in the industry, our design pipeline continues to grow. There have been more than 600 Snapdragon-based devices announced and another 170 plus devices announced based on our Qualcomm Reference Design solutions.","Looking ahead, there are more than 450 Snapdragon-based designs in development and over 100 plus designs based on our QRD solutions. As you know, our strategy is to set the technology design point for our industry and we have succeeded again with our recently announced Snapdragon 600 and 800 chipsets.","Our new Snapdragon 600 processor builds on the momentum of our highly successful S4 Pro processor. The 600 includes our new Quad Core Krait 300 CPU running up to 1.9 GHz and our Adreno 320 GPU.","Our new Snapdragon 800 processor includes our new Quad Core Krait 400 CPU running at up to 2.3 GHz, our new Adreno 330 GPU with two times the compute performance of our Adreno 320. The third generation of our leading LTE modem which adds LTE Advanced and Carrier Aggregation support, as well as integrated 802.11ac Wi-Fi.","In addition, the Snapdragon 800 is the first chip in the industry to use TSMC's 28-nanometer HPM Advanced process technology. We expect Snapdragon 600 and 800 chipsets to deliver up to 40% and 75% better performance, respectively, than our previous industry-leading Snapdragon S4 Pro.","There are already more than 90 designs in development using the 60 -- 600 and 800 processors, and we expect commercial devices based on the 600 in the second calendar quarter of this year and based on the 800 in the middle of this year.","We are also continuing to invest and grow our business in emerging regions, and with our differentiated technologies and products we believe we are well-positioned versus the competition in this segment as subscribers migrate from 2G to 3G and multimode 3G\/LTE.","Last week in China, we held our bi-annual QRD event with participation by 145 OEMs and ODMs. We had multiple emerging accounts including Yulong and Tianyu announced handsets based on the Snapdragon 8x25Q, making it the first quad-core chip for high-volume 3G smartphones. There are now over 60 8x25Q designs in the pipeline from over 25 OEMs.","Separately, we have also announced the Reference Design for our 8x30 chipset which contains Dual Krait CPUs integrated LTE, TDD and TD-SCDMA, and support for all operators in China.","Also of note, the first TD-SCDMA device based on the Snapdragon processor was launched by Nokia in the December quarter on time.","Our mobile connectivity design traction continues to grow with 400 plus devices based on our 28-nanometer S4 and Snapdragon 600\/800 products. We also announced our first NFC chipset with a new tri-band 802.11ac\/ad Reference Design and our StreamBoost Technology to intelligently optimize home network performance.","We're off to a great start in fiscal 2013 with exciting growth opportunities ahead, including continued global smartphone and multimode 3G\/LTE demand. We continue to manage our business for long-term revenue and operating profit growth and we continue to see the year unfolding broadly in line with our initial expectations.","That concludes my remarks and I will now turn the call over to Bill Keitel.","Bill Keitel","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We had record quarterly results and we are pleased to be raising our estimates for fiscal 2013 revenue and earnings per share. Our record first quarter revenues of $6 billion were up 29% year-over-year and at the high-end of our prior guidance.","Non-GAAP operating income was a record $2.45 billion, up 31% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share were a record $1.26 per share, up 30% year-over-year and $0.14 above the midpoint of our prior guidance.","QTL contributed $0.06 of gross margin improvement driven primarily by greater than expected 3G, 4G device shipments. QCT contributed $0.05 of gross margin improvement on the strength of higher MSM shipments and favorable product cost. More operating expenses contributed $0.02 and higher returns on our cash and marketable securities contributed $0.01.","Total reported device sales reported by our licensees for last September\u2019s quarter were a record $53.3 billion above the high-end of our prior guidance, greater than expected device shipments in both developed and emerging regions, particularly China. We estimate that total reported device sales were comprised between 233 to 237 million 3G, 4G device shipments at an average selling price of $224 to $230 per unit.","QTL's operating margin was 87% and we shipped a record 182 million MSM\u2019s during the quarter, exceeding the high-end of our prior guidance and QCT's operating margin was 26%.","As I mentioned at our Analyst Day in November, we are seeing more efficiency in the 3G, 4G inventory channel as the industry continued to move toward an open retail channel versus a carrier centric channel, consistent with that trend our MSM delivery interval has been shortening, which introduces additional volatility in the timing of shipments and therefore impacts our ability to accurately forecast quarterly MSM shipment timing.","Non-GAAP combined R&D\/SG&A expenses were lower sequentially, which was a bit better than our prior expectations. Operating cash flow was a healthy $2 billion, up 11% year-over-year and 33% of revenues.","During the first quarter we return $678 million to stockholders, including cash dividends of $428 million and $250 million to repurchase 4.3 million shares. We are increasing our estimate for calendar 2012 3G, 4G device shipments to between 915 million to 940 million units, up approximately 17% year-over-year at the midpoint. The increase to our calendar 2012 estimate is driven by global demand for 3G 4G devices, particularly in emerging regions, including China and Latin America.","Turning to our guidance, given continued global macroeconomic uncertainties, we are continuing to maintain a cautious outlook for the year ahead. We are reaffirming our estimate for calendar 2013 3G, 4G device shipments of between 1 billion and 1.07 billion units, up approximately 8% to 15% year-over-year. We are raising fiscal 2013 revenue guidance by approximately $4 million. And we now expect fiscal 2013 revenues to be $23.4 billion to $24.4 billion, up approximately 25% year-over-year at the midpoint. We are raising our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance by $0.13. We now anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.25 to $4.45, up approximately 17% year over year at the midpoint. ","We\u2019re also raising our guidance for GAAP earnings per share by $0.21, and we now expect GAAP earnings per share of $3.61 to $3.81, up approximately 6% year-over-year at the midpoint. We are reiterating our prior fiscal 2013 guidance estimates for QTL ASP, QCT and QTL operating margin percentages as well as non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expense growth. We estimate our non-GAAP annual tax rate to be approximately 17% to 18% for fiscal 2013 below our prior estimate reflecting the retroactive extension of the federal R&D tax credits among other factors. The R&D tax credit benefit related to fiscal 2012 will be recorded in our fiscal second-quarter and consistent with our prior guidance will be excluded from non-GAAP results. ","Now turning to the second fiscal quarter, we estimate revenues of $5.8 billion to $6.3 billion, up approximately 22% year-over-year at the midpoint. And we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.10 to $1.18, up approximately 13% year over year at the midpoint. We expect second fiscal quarter GAAP earnings per share of $0.98 to $1.06 per share. We expect total reported device sales by our licensees to be $57.5 billion to $62.5 billion, up approximately 16% year-over-year and up approximately 13% sequentially at the midpoint, reflecting again strong 3G 4G based device shipments in the busy December holiday quarter. ","We anticipate QCT shipments of 163 million to 173 million MSM chips during the March quarter, down sequentially, which is typical coming off the busy holiday quarter but up approximately 11% year-over-year at the midpoint. Our estimate for 3G, 4G channel inventory through fiscal \u201813 is consistent with our prior expectations remaining within the 11 to 16 week range as we discussed at our analyst day.","We anticipate second-quarter non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses f combined will increase approximately 10% to 12% sequentially, reflecting increased seasonal expenses typical for this time of year, notably employer payroll taxes and increased marketing expenses. We estimate our fiscal second-quarter non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 16%, lower than what we expect for the full year, because it will take count of two quarters of the retroactive R&D tax credits approved by Washington. ","That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Paul Jacobs. ","Paul Jacobs","Thanks Bill. So before we go on to Q&A, I want to let you all know that Bill has decided to retire from Qualcomm effective March 11. Bill has been a great partner to me and an outstanding leader in this role as CFO for Qualcomm over the past 11 years. His financial readerships played a critical role in establishing Qualcomm as a company known not only for leading-edge technology but also for super fiscal performance and rigorous financial discipline. And over the years helped run QUALCOMM as finance and investor relations organization and himself many distinguished award for excellence in financial reporting.","Under Bill\u2019s leadership, the company has achieved unprecedented financial growth and success particularly through some very challenging economic environments. On behalf of the entire executive committee and all our employees worldwide, we really like to thank Bill for his strong financial leadership, partnership and incredible dedication to Qualcomm.","So we wish you all the best. We\u2019re pleased that you\u2019ve agreed to stay at Qualcomm to ensure a smooth transition and will continue throughout the year to serve in the advisory role for the company. So thanks again Bill.","I am also very pleased to announce that after a careful consideration George Davis would join Qualcomm as Bill\u2019s successor in our new executive vice president and chief financial officer. George currently serves as CFO for Applied Materials and will join Qualcomm on March 11. George is a seasoned financial executive and has been the CFO for Applied Materials since 2006. We look forward to George\u2019s joining Qualcomm executive team and working closely with them. His financial expertise and leadership will be instrumental as we continue to expand our business and strive to deliver strong financial results. ","So I like to thank Bill again for his many years of leadership and commitment to Qualcomm, and I look forward to introducing all of you to George in our next quarter\u2019s earnings call. So I will now turn the call back over to Warren Kneeshaw. Thanks Bill.","Warren Kneeshaw","Thank you, Paul. Operator, we are ready for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Mike Walkley from Canaccord Genuity.","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity","Bill, best wishes for a wonderful retirement, it\u2019s great to have worked with you and my questions are really for Steve, just on the competitive dynamics. Can you update us on how you\u2019re seeing your competitors, one, in the low end, a lot of talk about quad-core competition, and then on the high end, on the LTE side, are you seeing any increased competition this year?","Steve Mollenkopf","Hi Mike, this is Steve. I think there is kind of two dynamics, on the high end, it\u2019s all about the technology leadership and I think we\u2019ve been able to keep ourselves in a pretty good position both on the modem side as well as on the AP side. On the low end it\u2019s about scale, and I think speed of execution. Both of those things I think are benefits that we bring to the table as well. We\u2019ve come out with a number of products on the low end. The first one is the 8X25Q which I think has been received quite well. We also announced that our event last week in Shenzhen that we\u2019re going to come out with the first of what will become many new low end optimized chipsets, which is the 8X26. There will be multiple chipsets like that coming out over the years. So I think we feel like we\u2019ve got a pretty good roadmap on the high side and the low side right now. In fact, I would say we\u2019re probably biased positively now on share. We just feel \u2013 we feel the roadmap and the some of the investments are starting to pay off.","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity","Great, thank you. ","Operator","Brian Modoff from Deutsche Bank, please go ahead with your question.","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank","I have another question for Steve, when you say you\u2019re positively biased for share, particularly in China, can you talk about how you see that playing out in terms of where you think you\u2019re at from the standpoint of low end 3G share in that market and then overall share in that market?","And then another question on yield efficiencies with the foundries and so our check indicate TSMC did 95% yield efficiency on 28 nanometer now. How do you see that playing out for you with regard to your margins for this year? Do you see 28 nanometers being perhaps more cost effective than 45 nanometer this year and what about as you bring other foundries on like GlobalFoundries, do you see that giving you some leverage on your margins and the QCT side of the business? Thanks.","Steve Mollenkopf","Okay. Brian, on the first question, I think, remind me, again that was related to low-end\u2026","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank","You noted earlier, we talked about China competitions, you said you\u2019re biased on the low -- you\u2019re biased positively now on share. Can you quantify that particularly with regard to China, what you see there your market share on the low end and then overall in that market thanks?","Steve Mollenkopf","Well, I think I\u2019ll try to stay away from any individual number but what you\u2019re seeing in terms of a dynamic is that there is a conversion of 2G to 3G. At the same time, you\u2019re getting a conversion to smartphones. So for us, we are picking up new customers and new geographies because those transitions are essentially giving us access to what would be traditionally just 2G volume.","So we\u2019ve been ramping our ability to address those customers as you know over the last several years and they\u2019re starting to play into our hands. Also there has been a push and I think you\u2019ll see a push over the next 12 months where technology will be turning over in the large carriers in the world, in particular, in China. And they\u2019ll start demanding some of the combination 3G, 4G technology that we have.","And I think that\u2019s probably a reasonable set up for us. The technology change has actually always been good for us on the chipset business. Your second question was about yields I think. What\u2019s happening with us -- we've actually been quite pleased actually as to how 28 nanometers ramped in terms of yield.","I think Bill also mentioned on -- in his remarks how we had some positive product cost in the last quarter, which was actually a result of that. We\u2019re starting to bring on multiple fabs with more gusto now. You will see however at the end of the year, you will see us transition the portfolio into HPM.","So I don\u2019t know to a degree that those events sort of produce anything different than what Bill would have talked about in terms of the margin profile but pretty much according to plan, I think at this point.","Operator","Tim Long from Bank of Montreal, please go ahead with your question.","Tim Long - Bank of Montreal","Thank you. Congratulations, Bill, on the retirement, well deserved. You will be missed. Got a two parter for you on the royalty side. First, on the calculated rate, I know it does move around but by my numbers it went down about 10 basis points sequential. So just curious if there's anything abnormal in there other than just mix?","And then secondly, I just want to bring you back to something you had mentioned at the analyst day where there was the potential for 25% unit growth in the fourth quarter, that\u2019s what you typically see. It looks like the midpoint of the guidance is a good amount below that. Could you address why, is that just because the September quarter was maybe more than seasonal or was there some other reason why we're looking like mid high teens sequential in the fourth quarter when we normally see more? Thank you.","Derek Aberle","Hey, Tim. This is Derek. Let me take your first question on the rate. I think we were finishing last quarter around 338 and you\u2019re right we\u2019re coming in a bit lower this quarter at about 33. It\u2019s really a function of the things that we\u2019ve talked about in the past but this quarter probably the biggest driver is the fact that we had record TRDS and in fact that came in higher than we expected.","And so that given the fixed licensing fees that roll through and the infrastructure royalties that grow at a slower pace is going to have, kind of, downward pressure on the rate. So that\u2019s really the primary driver. We also had some other fluctuations including lower audit recoveries and mix in there. But that\u2019s really the primary driver.","Bill Keitel","Tim, this is Bill. On the -- take us back to the analyst day and looking for upwards of 25% unit growth from the September to December quarter, the difference we see now, our midpoint estimate is about 17% growth, third quarter, fourth quarter and a bit lower than we were previously expecting. But it's the result of a very strong September that came through in our licensee reports.","Tim Long - Bank of Montreal","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Rod Hall from JPMorgan, please go ahead with your question.","Rod Hall - JPMorgan","Yeah. Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on retirement, Bill. So just -- first of all, I wanted to revisit 28 nanometre situation. I think the numbers suggest that you guys cleared some backlog in fiscal Q1 to December maybe a good chunk of it. And I just wondered if you could comment on, maybe, Steve, you could comment on the backlog status as we head into fiscal Q2. Is most of that now cleared or is some of your guidance including some backlog clearance, so that would be helpful if you could help us understand that.","And then, Bill, I guess this is my last chance to ask this one but could you comment on your underlying GDP growth expectations in your forecast now or is it changed since you guys reported last quarter. And Steve, if you could comment maybe on the 8X26 shipping date as well. And I don\u2019t know if you want to comment on that but you\u2019re just curious whether that devices with that product could ship in the middle of the year, we\u2019re still looking sort of towards the end of the year when those devices would ship into the market. Thanks.","Steve Mollenkopf","This is Steve, I\u2019ll just knock those out pretty quickly. In terms of a 28 nanometer, we -- I think we\u2019d probably clear that sometime in the middle of the quarter that we just reported on. There was some discussion in the industry about some of the OEMs also having some constraints outside of our part, touchscreens and things like that, You probably read as many as I have on that. But I don\u2019t know to a degree that that\u2019s been cleared or not. The 8X26 just to finish up, [is really] [ph] end of this calendar year.","Bill Keitel","And Rod, Bill here, on the GDP growth estimate that\u2019s underlying our current plan it\u2019s unchanged from the time of the Analyst Meeting. The time of the Analyst Meeting consensus GDP worldwide among economist was 3.4%. And we thought that was a bit rosy. We based our plan on the 3% world GDP. Recently, our consensus economist were down to 3.2 and we\u2019re maintaining our basis of 3% worldwide GDP growth for 2013.","Rod Hall - JPMorgan","Great. Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Ehud Gelblum, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley","I appreciate it. Bill, definitely will be missed. Thanks for all the help and time over the years. Have fun in retirement. Couple of questions, question one when I look at your guidance for the TRDS and back it out of your full guidance -- full year guidance, I\u2019m sorry, future guidance for the full company and then sort of back into a QCT guidance and then look at your unit shipment guidance for next quarter, you could sort of back into what you\u2019re thinking about ASPs. It looks a little bit like your guiding ASPs, Steve, to be up next quarter is where I\u2019m going MSM shipments and I just want to make sure that the math is correct. And that you\u2019re sort of looking for ASPs in chips to go up at least one more quarter, and if so, if you can give some color on the variability behind that and what happens going forward. ","And then Bill, on margins for QCT, at the analyst day again I think you had guided to somewhere around 18.5% to 20.5% for the full fiscal year, for now at 26% for Q1, last year we saw something similar, we saw about 23, and we kind of came down through the year but we have that funny thing with 28 nanometer that made the operating margin at the end of the fiscal year a naturally low. Do you still think you will end up, I mean you made the comment that that\u2019s unchanged from 18.5 to 20.5%. We\u2019ve got to start pulling some 13%, 14%, 15% operating margins to get us back into that range and we start off the year so strong at 26%. I guess I am saying is do you still really believe that and if so, why would it get that low at the end of the year?","Bill Keitel","This is Bill. I will take both of those questions. On the MSM ASP, the expectation there we had expected to increase a bit sequentially in the first fiscal quarter and we successfully did that. And yes, you're right. We do expect another increase sequentially in the second fiscal quarter, somewhat of a pattern we\u2019re expecting for the full fiscal year for QCT. ","On the QCT op margins, we are holding to that guidance range that you gave. For the second quarter -- second fiscal quarter we\u2019re expecting a fairly significant dip in the operating margins, it\u2019s based into the guidance we gave in a plus minus 17% kind of range. So -- and the decrease there are drivers. Number one is the volume, we do expect a decrease in MSM volume in the second fiscal quarter. Number two, QCT carries the bulk of the operating expense in QUALCOMM and at this time of year where we start employee payroll taxes and market expenses typically tick up in the December and January  -- starting in January relative to the December quarter. Thirdly, it\u2019s the time of year where we typically do our price resets in the QCT business and then lastly, the QCT team has a fairly high degree of activity of new product work ongoing. And so we expect that to drive up the product costs starting with this quarter.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley","Can you give us a percentage like you do sometimes as to what percent of R&Ds kind of go into future looking type of revenue or is that something that\u2019s not really quantifiable?","Bill Keitel","I would just repeat what we said at the analyst day that we\u2019ve got approximately 30% of our current R&D going towards projects that we don't expect to deliver revenue in fiscal 2013 \u2013 excuse me 27%, it was 30% to year prior, came down to 27% is our current expectation. ","Operator","Simona Jankowski from Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs","Just a couple of questions. One is more on the short term chipset guidance. I understand that you are expecting some normal seasonality there. But it seems that the decline that you are expecting is perhaps not as conservative as I might have expected. And you have the seasonality factor, you\u2019ve also got one of your big customers Apple whose implied decline in the March quarter is about the same magnitude as the total number that you are guiding to. And so I am just wondering if you are accounting for the normal seasonality kind of outside of that one customer especially given that there may have been some excess inventory in China and also given Q4 or calendar Q4 was larger than normal for you because of the shortage alleviation, on the other side of that wouldn\u2019t we see bit more of a correction in the March quarter, and then I have a longer term question as well.","Paul Jacobs","Okay Simona, on the Q2 chipset guidance -- fiscal Q2 guidance, we did factor in seasonality. The last few years we often see a dip going into the March quarter but relative to 5, 6, 7 years ago as not much as we used to use back then. So we have taken account of that. We also think that the channel inventory is being managed pretty tightly. So hopefully we\u2019re right on that estimate and therefore may be a bit less dip than what you otherwise would see. If you're call from the analyst day, many of our customers are relying on us much more for their inventory needs and you'll see that when you look at our \u2013 get through our financials our inventories grew pretty nicely in the December quarter in line with what we wanted them to go. ","So I think we\u2019ve got Q2 pegged pretty well, albeit keep in mind that the order interval has decreased and so there is more volatility in that MSM number. And you had a second question?","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs","Yes, just the second question was an update on the tablet market. Do you have a sense for what percent of the tablets are shipping with 3G and 4G attached in them right now as opposed to WiFi and based on the build you\u2019re seeing where do you think that might be a year from now?","Derek Aberle","Simona, this is Derek. I think the percentage of total unit sets that have been shipping with 3G attached has been relatively stable with, it\u2019s kind of bounced around a little bit and maybe come down in the last couple of quarters some. But as we explained at the analyst conference, I think Paul went through this in his presentation we\u2019re really hoping and expecting that to change course going forward now that we see a more flexibility on the operator side with data plans and hopefully more competition in the tablet device base with Windows RT and some of the new Android tablets coming in.","Operator","Stacy Rasgon from Sanford Bernstein.","Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein","Question on the annual guidance, are you taking annual EPS off pretty much by less than you just beat, and you have a lower tax rate going forward and the OpEx has basically unchanged. I am just wondering why that annual EPS guidance wouldn\u2019t be higher, doesn\u2019t feel like that you are guiding to any sort of lift at all into the back half of the year. If you can, one more question if you could revisit that inventory question, I know you\u2019re talking about customers relying on the need to take more but at the same time you built quite a bit of inventory in the quarter, where -- in front of a quarter where chipsets were going down, if you could just help us and rationalize on what\u2019s actually going on with your own internal inventories, that would be very helpful.","Bill Keitel","Sure Stacy, first on the EPS guidance, correct, relative to our midpoint for Q1 we came in $0.14 higher and relative to the full year, relative to the midpoint we\u2019re raising our guidance by $0.13. So in some of the words that we are seeing is that although we saw a little nice improvement here in the first quarter, we\u2019re cautious on the remaining three quarters given the macro environment and so we\u2019re not adding to the improvement at least at this point for the full fiscal year. ","In terms of the tax item that you mentioned, yes there was a positive on -- because of the R&D tax credit extension. But if you recall though, what we have here on the outlook is better for QTL, pretty close what we previously had for QCT. And that imbalance raises our tax rate.","And so that was able to -- with the R&D tax credit extension, we were able to offset that. There were other few, other items that weren\u2019t that material, so I didn\u2019t mentioned them. For example, foreign exchange in this outlook relative to budget hit us about a penny. So you\u2019ve got some small things that are offsetting the benefit, R&D tax credit extension. But from an operating standpoint, I think it\u2019s a pretty solid $0.13 raise for the full year.","Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein","And in inventories?","Paul Jacobs","And on the inventory, yeah, we have increased our inventory. Remember now, we are increasing -- we\u2019ve got a higher end product that we\u2019ve got a lot of demand for which of course, that aligns with our guidance that we do think average revenue per MSM is going to be increasing here into the second quarter, in fact into the full fiscal year.","So, yeah, our inventory is growing. We have been relatively short on inventory given the 28 nanometer production shortfalls relative to demand. Now that\u2019s caught up and so with the boost in our inventory, I think we are going to be better positioned now to handle the fluctuations that we typically see in customer order demand.","Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein","Right. Very helpful. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Matthew Hoffman from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead with your question.","Matthew Hoffman - Cowen & Company","Bill, congrats on a job well done. So, I'll get one last question here for you. The largest change in the regional forecasts was the uptick in China. Can you kind of give us some color on whether TD-SCDMA and an uptick there really affected your view and the forecast?","And this one is maybe for Derek. As TD-SCDMA moves up the value chain here later this year when we start to see more of high-end offering in c, will that have a positive impact on the royalty rate assuming a greater portion of the Chinese market has multimode phones and maybe even some export? Thanks.","Bill Keitel","Matt, this is Bill. On the first one on China, I think it was a pretty broad-based. Yeah, we did, we are updating our estimate a bit, improving our estimate for TD-SCDMA. But the strength across all the three operators is quite strong. CDMA2000 is going very strong. Take it back to the remarks that Paul gave earlier.","And then China Unicom with WCDMA, so I think it's pretty widespread. China is going quite strong for 3G, 4G devices and we've seen that trend, and our updated estimates here are just improving that trend a bit. Much is the same for Latin America. That\u2019s the other market of note I would draw your attention to. We've seen a lot of strength there and just our most recent data points say that that\u2019s likely be a bit stronger than what we had previously been expecting.","Derek Aberle","Yeah. This is Derek. On the TD-SCDMA situation in China, we have been continuing to collect some amount of royalties TD-SCDMA, although as we've said, we struggled a bit with some of the local Chinese companies. But I agree, we do see an opportunity as the volume hopefully migrates at the high end to multimode with UMTS or even CDMA. And then with the trials launching, the inclusion of LTE, that should open up an opportunity for us to collect on a larger portion of the China mobile volume. Not sure it\u2019s specifically a rate issue, but certainly an opportunity to grow the revenue base.","Matthew Hoffman - Cowen & Company","Thank you.","Operator","Tal Liani from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.","Tal Liani - Bank of America","Yeah. I have two questions. The first one is just, I\u2019d like to understand the assumptions about MSM seasonality into our semiconductor seasonality into the second half of the year, because you're assuming and I know we spoke about it. But you're assuming that EPS is going to be down in second half, 20%. This is the first half and in last year it was a much worse year. It was only down 15%. The previous year was down 13%.","So you are assuming that this year is going to be much worse. Seasonality wise, much worse second half versus first half. And I'm wondering about the MSM assumptions, what drives this number up so low and I know you spoke a little bit about. You gave a very detailed answer. So, I want to focus my question just about at MSM assumptions for the rest of the year. Thanks.","Bill Keitel","Okay. Tal, it\u2019s Bill. I will pick kind of add and maybe others want to add into it. On MSM seasonality, we do expect, obviously we've given your estimates our guidance for fiscal Q2. And if you just take the midpoint of that, we are expecting a decrease. Midpoints about $169 million MSMs compared to $182 million, we just reported having shipped in Q1.","And going into Q3, at this point we are modeling kind of a flattish number and an increase going into the fourth fiscal quarter. On the cost, how that correlates this year to our earnings per share as compared to prior years. Recall that in the last couple years, QTL earnings strength has been very strong at least in proportion to the QCT earnings strength whereas this year, although we are looking for both business segments to grow at a double-digit rate, we are looking for QCT growth to be substantially greater than the earnings growth coming from QTL.","Tal Liani - Bank of America","Okay.","Operator","Kulbinder Garcha from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Kulbinder Garcha - Credit Suisse","Thanks. And congratulations to Bill, again, on the job well done. On QCT, I understand some of the drivers with respect to the margin declined. I guess the question I have for Bill and Steve is the level of market share that you guys have in LTE, the mix shift that you are seeing on the ASP side is going to probably continue, should be positive drivers throughout the year as well. So, just the magnitude of the QCT margin pressure seems surprising to me.","A reason why just the margins are top three higher levels, maybe they do drop suddenly 17% or 18% in the coming quarters seems quite extreme. So, I\u2019m just trying to understand why that isn\u2019t more of the positive driver or are you taking something aggressive on the pricing side mean on mean whether we think.","And then a question for Derek, specifically, on licensing. There is a building sense now and it\u2019s becoming quite clear that you are going to sell maybe 200 million, maybe 250 million 3G enabled smartphones from the Asian Taiwanese chipset community whether it\u2019s Mediatek, Spreadtrum,, et cetera and you guys should be able to license those phones.","How much of that market have you actually assumed? You can license in this year\u2019s guidance. Are you being cautious because it\u2019s a different ecosystem to license, or if there is a significant amount that are embedded into your estimates and how. Any sense around that would be helpful?","Bill Keitel","Kulbinder, first on the QCT margins. It\u2019s Bill. I gave the four major drivers for the decrease that is built into our estimates. I'm not going to \u2013 we will stay away from assigning a value to any one of those four. I will have to suffice to say that we\u2019re very comfortable with our forward plan in the business. It is a large decrease in the operating margin, but it is as we've said in the past we\u2019re going to see quarterly swings. Nothing\u2019s changed on what our three to five-year goals are for the QCT business nor our ability -- our sense of our ability to achieve those goals. So there are a lot of factors obviously, but I would just \u2013 the pricing that we give is very thoughtful, very well considered and it's always with the mind towards where we\u2019re going to be looking a few years out.","Derek Aberle","This is Derek and go ahead and take your second question. So there isn\u2019t really a different base of customers that are buying from Media Tech or others. We have now as we talked about I think more than 70 companies licensed in China and pretty much all the major suppliers in Taiwan have been licensed for quite some time. And those agreements require them to pay royalties regardless of whether it\u2019s our chip or anybody else's chip. And so when we think about the market and we give our projections we\u2019re really trying to capture the entirety and I feel very confident that maybe with the exception of some of the TD-CDMA volume that I spoke about a few minutes ago, we\u2019re really well-positioned to capture the sales of all 3G and 4G devices that are going to be supplied irrespective of the chipset that\u2019s in there.","Operator","James Faucette from Pacific Crest.","James Faucette - Pacific Crest Securities","A couple of questions, first touching on the revisions or the lack thereof for 2012 and 2013, Bill, you indicated that you hadn\u2019t changed your GDP assumption but yet we saw a pretty substantial revisions up for 2012. So just wondering if there was anything that made you feel more cautious about how that GDP could impact us especially since we are looking at a higher base for 2012. And then Derek, I wanted to follow-up on  Kulbinder \u2018s questions I guess related to licensing, in particular on TD-SCDMA could you give us an estimate as to what you think your current coverage or collection portion is on the TD-SCDMA handsets that are being shipped?","Bill Keitel","James on the first one, we did see a very \u2013 we\u2019re seeing a very nice upside to calendar 2012 3G 4G units, and I would just generally say it's fairly widespread by geography, but it's largely two main drivers. One is the upgrade rate, apparently subscribers upgrading to smartphones or upgrading their existing smartphone is one of the major drivers. And then secondly, we think we continue to see good progress on migration of 2G to 3G. We don't have a specific reason as to why those wouldn\u2019t continue to be positive factors into 2013. It was simply a matter of rolling three months into the new fiscal year and we concluded that we have a positive bias in that 3G 4G unit forecasts for 2013 but we thought it was just a bit early in the year to be raising our estimates there. We thought let's wait another three months to see where we are at that time. ","Although we\u2019re very pleased obviously with the total 3G 4G market, I think we all have to be cautious given the macro-economic environment that we\u2019re all seeing here. So I would just say positive bias but not enough at this point to cause us to raise those estimates.","Derek Aberle","James, this is Derek. Let me take your second question. The information on the TD-SCDMA volume in China is a bit difficult to get your arms around completely at times. And I don\u2019t have \u2013 I can\u2019t give you a specific percentage today. I will say that as time has gone on and there has been shifts in the supplier base, the percentage of total unit is as best that we can tell that we\u2019re collecting royalties has come down over time. But then as you go forward as I said, there are some trends that are going to shift things we think back in the other direction, higher percentages of these devices that are going to be multimode with either LTE or UMPS. So it\u2019s really a bit hard to pin it down. ","The other thing just to make sure it's clear, when we give our estimates for unit shipments for the year, what we include is the percentage of total TD-SCDMA that we expect to get reported to us and royalties to paid on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal from Barclays.","Jeffrey Kvaal - Barclays Capital","My question, Derek, is for you and I am wondering if you can talk through a little bit big picture about where you feel that we are in the migration from 2G to royalty bearing fill in (ph) and how far along the penetration wave are we, now quickly do you think we might move up that penetration over the course of the next few years? And I think the idea is we have seen some exceptionally impressive growth out of QTL over the course of the last few years, as Bill suggested himself that mix seems to be shifting the other way at least this year, should that continue, how should we think about the growth trajectory in that business?","Derek Aberle","I think what Bill said is we\u2019re seeing exceptional growth out of the QCT business this year but we\u2019re still expecting a significant growth from QTL as well. So we\u2019re not suggesting we're expecting a decline there, it\u2019s more that QCT is really accelerating. So you got to think about it couple different ways. One is if you look at the unit shipments there is still a pretty decent amount of 2G volume out there that will be shifted over to 3G. When you think about it from a TRDF perspective, meaning the unit times the ASP, actually the volume out there on 2G looks a bit smaller. But I think the opportunity ahead is quite great because we\u2019re expecting when those units transition from 2G to 3G they\u2019re going to transition at a higher ASP whether that\u2019s -- initially we have feature phone although those are rapidly going away, or more likely a low end smartphones. ","So as we look at our plan, and we\u2019ve said we expect continued strong growth in the business over the five-year plan, that\u2019s because we see still quite a long runway. I think China still has what about 26% penetration as Paul noted today or comments today. And we\u2019ve got places like Latin America, Eastern Europe, some very large markets that still have quite a ways to go through the transition and I think as they go that they will go through I think at a higher ASP than some of the early transitions for 3G in the past. ","Jeffrey Kvaal - Barclays Capital","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Mark McKechnie from Evercore Partners. Please go ahead with your question.","Mark McKechnie - Evercore Partners","At the end of the cycle here. But, hey, Bill, your onshore cash grew nicely sequential, I believe, I think, what by the $4 billion or so, am I right? And maybe you could tell me a little -- tell us a little bit about, how that happened and if you feel like, the onshore, offshore cash challenges have subsided a bit here? Thanks.","Bill Keitel","Sure, Mark. Yeah. Total cash grew nicely and more so on the offshore, but offshore -- onshore did increase as well. I think we are clearly in a position where, we are hoping our 10B5-1 program that we have in place will trigger to use up some of that onshore cash. We think we\u2019re in a bit of an excess position on the onshore.","But having said that, we\u2019re, I think you know our philosophy. We\u2019d like to be very patience on those buybacks and our history has shown that\u2019s been the prudent thing to do that eventually will deploy that cash. But at least, historically, we've been able to deploy it in a way that\u2019s a very good return for the shareholder.","On the offshore and your question, more optimistic, I think, I\u2019m just not less optimistic on timing. I think we\u2019ve all seen that we haven't seen any much, let say sufficient cooperation in Washington that is giving me more optimism on an effective corporate tax reform, which is really what\u2019s needed. And clearly the agenda here in the near-term seems it\u2019s going to be consumed with debt ceiling, sequester, gun control and immigration.","However, I\u2019m -- I remain hopeful. I think it can be a good driver to further improvement in the American economy. So I remain hopeful. But my timeframe on hope just moved out a bit.","Mark McKechnie - Evercore Partners","Great. Thanks, Bill, and congrats.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. Dr. Jacobs, do you have any closing remarks.","Paul Jacobs","It\u2019s kind to imagine that this last earnings call I\u2019m going to do with Bill. So I just want to say congratulations again, and thanks Bill very, very much.","Bill Keitel","Thank you, Paul. I\u2019m going to miss Qualcomm greatly, I will. Thank you.","Paul Jacobs","Don\u2019t go too far away from us bro, you\u2019re still part of the family. And of course, we are looking forward to welcoming George at the next call. And I have to say it\u2019s a great time, because the company is really executing extremely well and we\u2019re competing both at the high-end and the value segment in smartphone which are continue to grow globally, really excited about the new products, the new Snapdragons are gaining lot of traction and we\u2019re putting new radio technologies, new processors, new graphics, all sort of things that are getting integrated into those devices, really driving our lead and using our skill to advantage in terms of be able to invest R&D and invest early and drive that. And obviously the licensing business continues to grow strongly.","So, tons of opportunities ahead of us, both in the traditional businesses and in the non-handset devices and so I think, company is very, very well positioned to seize the opportunities we see for the future.","So thanks very much to all of you, and yeah, we\u2019ll probably see some of you in Barcelona.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded January 30, 2019. The playback number for today's call is 877-660-6853. International callers please dial 201-612-7415. The playback reservation number is 13686071.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mauricio Lopez-Hodoyan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Lopez-Hodoyan, please go ahead.","Mauricio Lopez-Hodoyan","Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Today's call will include prepared remarks by Steve Mollenkopf and George Davis. In addition, Cristiano Amon, Alex Rogers and Don Rosenberg will join the question-and-answer session.","You can access our earnings release and a slide presentation that accompany this call on our Investor Relations Web Site. In addition, this call is being webcast on qualcomm.com, and a replay will be available on our Web Site later today.","During the call today, we will use non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G, and you can find the related reconciliations to GAAP on our Web Site.","We will also make forward-looking statements, including projections and estimates of future events, business or industry trends, or business or financial results. Actual events or results could differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q, which contain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","And now to comments from Qualcomm's Chief Executive Officer, Steve Mollenkopf.","Steve Mollenkopf","Thank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon everyone.","We are pleased to report a strong quarter especially in light of the challenging headwinds impacting the entire industry. Our fiscal first quarter results reflect continued execution by our team on the things within our control and influence. Our Q1 non-GAAP earnings of $1.20 per share were $0.10 above the midpoint of our guidance range. Revenue of $4.8 billion was in line with our guidance. Several positive trends enabled us to absorb the impact of general market weakness. Notably, number one, QCT's strong roadmap and financial performance in the high-end; number two, QTL's second interim agreement with Huawei; and number three, lower than expected operating expenses, which includes the impact of our cost reduction initiatives.","Our business prospects remain very healthy as 5G begins to ramp through the balance of this year and beyond. Our Snapdragon platform continues to outperform industry benchmarks and is well-positioned to successfully enable the low latency, high reliability and security requirements of 5G. We continue to extend this expertise with handset OEMs and adjacent industries of compute IoT and auto.","Our Wi-Fi business continues to gain share against longstanding incumbents in enterprise. Reliable intelligent and secure Wi-Fi will be an important part of future 5G networks. And we've introduced innovative and differentiated solutions as the market transitions to Wi-Fi 6. In parallel, we remain focused on resolving our Apple and regulatory disputes.","Before I turn the call over to George to cover our results in more detail, I want to provide an update on some important legal milestones and our ongoing efforts to defend the value of our intellectual property and drive shareholder value. As most of you know, we are one of the main architects of the wireless ecosystem and our leading investments in R&D have positioned the company at the forefront of 2G, 3G, 4G and now 5G leadership. We have one of the largest patent portfolios in the industry with more than 130,000 patents and pending patent applications worldwide. And it is critical that we protect our IP and ensure that we are appropriately compensated for our inventions and investments. Through these various legal cases, we are working to ensure this happens.","Courts in China and Germany have found Apple to be infringing our patents consistent with our prior messaging where the potential of multiple patent infringement rulings before the end of 2018. We are pursuing enforcement of the injunctions awarded by these courts and believe the decisions will be upheld on appeal. These favorable rulings demonstrate Apple's infringement across a broad range of our patented technologies that are unrelated to modem chips, but are widely used in smartphones. We expect additional favorable patent infringement decisions in the coming months in the United States, China and Germany as more of our cases go to trial.","In addition to our patent litigation there are more legal milestones ahead including the trial involving Apple and its contract manufacturers starting in San Diego in April and a separate case in California state court we filed to stop Apple's misuse and misappropriation of Qualcomm's trade secrets. We continue to believe that over the course of 2019, we will reach a resolution on the key outstanding issues in our disputes with Apple through settlement or litigation and we are prepared for both outcomes.","Yesterday, we concluded our arguments in the case with the FTC in the Northern District of California. As stated before, we believe that the FTC's case is based on a flawed antitrust theory and that it failed to meet its burden of proof for its claims. You can access the transcript of our closing arguments and the related slide presentation on our Web Site at qualcomm.com\/news.","Over the course of the trial, we made a strong showing that our licensing practices are consistent with industry norms have not harmed competition and in fact the industry is thriving. We have earned or maintained our leadership in the mobile wireless industry with superior foresight, investment and execution driving superior technology solutions compared with our competitors and we have never interrupted commercial shipments of modem chips to any customer in order to obtain unfair licensing rates.","Moreover, the evidence presented at trial proved that our agreements with Apple which expired over two years ago were run-of-the-mill incentive agreements that were actually demanded by Apple in order to win its business. The trial reinforce the important role we play in the mobile industry. This is especially critical now as we enter the early innings of 5G, the first mobile generation that is truly shaping industrial policy.","In summary, we are hopeful that the law and fact-based analysis will prevail in our FTC proceedings. In parallel, we continue to look for an opportunity to reach a negotiated settlement with the FTC.","Let me now spend some time providing you an update on how we are driving the transition to 5G. We are extremely pleased with the growing 5G momentum around the world. In December, we hosted our annual Snapdragon Tech Summit and we're joined by leading 5G ecosystem partners, infrastructure vendors as well as device manufacturers. This level of representation from the mobile ecosystem is a testament to our broad industry commitment to 5G, our solutions and our leadership position. At the summit, we announced our new Snapdragon 855 mobile platform, the world's first commercial platform supporting multi-gigabit 5G and demonstrate an end-to-end 5G consumer experiences with real demos over live millimeter wave 5G networks and devices.","We also announced that the Snapdragon 855 is gaining significant momentum with over 100 design wins in development. Since the summit, 5G service has begun to roll out in Korea and the United States and as 2019 progresses we anticipate continued 5G network launches in the United States, Europe, Japan, Australia and China. We are working with more than 20 operators toward commercial rollout starting this year and we expect to be the 5G modem supplier of choice for the majority of the first wave of 5G devices.","In addition to commercial 5G service, device manufacturers are also ramping production of consumer 5G devices. At CES, we announced 30-plus commercial 5G mobile design wins based on our 5G chipsets. The majority of these designs are smartphones from global OEM featuring the Snapdragon 855 mobile platform and the Snapdragon X50 5G modem family, which are expected to launch in the first half of 2019.","Notably, nearly all of the devices related to these 5G design wins use our RF front-end solutions and we expect these design wins to have a meaningful positive impact to our RF front-end product line. Consistent with the past, 3G and 4G transitions as 5G launches in 2019 across multiple geographies, we expect the carriers to play an active role in driving the transition to 5G devices.","Turning to our adjacent opportunities, in automotive, we announced our third generation Snapdragon Automotive Cockpit platforms, which provide a multi-tier scalable architecture across tiers to expand the addressable market for our infotainment solutions. Importantly, to an automotive manufacturer a scalable architecture delivers a consistent experience across budget to mid-tier to premium car lines.","We also launched the custom-built Snapdragon 8cx Compute Platform which represents the largest generational performance increase ever for Snapdragon product. We look forward to growing this category with Microsoft and expect more announcements throughout the year.","In summary, in a challenging market QCT is continuing to execute consistent with our expectations at the beginning of the year and we are looking forward to our upcoming product launches. Finally, I want to thank our employees for their hard work and focused execution. We continue to make great progress on our important strategic objectives. We are driving the transition to 5G and we are leveraging our core technologies to expand our reach into many exciting new industries.","I would like to now turn the call over to George.","George Davis","Thank you, Steve and good afternoon everyone.","We are pleased to report solid results in our fiscal first quarter. Our revenues were $4.8 billion in the first quarter in line with our prior guidance and non-GAAP EPS of $1.20 was $0.05 above the high-end of our guidance range. Importantly, our Q1 results include a new interim agreement with Huawei, which contributed $150 million of revenue in the quarter. As discussed last quarter, our Q1 guidance had not included any contribution from Huawei because the final payment under the previous interim agreement was recognized in retained earnings pursuant to our adoption of ASC 606 in Q1.","QCT delivered revenues of $3.7 billion and an EBT margin of 16% for the quarter above our prior guidance range of 13% to 15%. The operating margin reflects improvements in gross margins and lower operating expenses driven by our continued focus on driving operating efficiencies. MSM chip shipments of 186 million units came in modestly above the midpoint of our guidance range.","QTL generated revenues of $1 billion in the quarter including $150 million from the successful negotiation of the Huawei interim agreement. This new agreement was signed in our first fiscal quarter and runs through the third fiscal quarter of 2019.","Under the agreement, we will receive $150 million for each of those three quarters. Relative to our previous expectations, which had excluded any revenue from the interim agreement licensing revenues were lower by a $150 million to $200 million in the quarter. Given the headwinds facing the market broadly, we have reduced our global 3G, 4G device forecasts for the calendar year '18 to the low-end of our previous guidance range consistent with lower royalty units in the December quarter. Emerging regions and China were responsible for the largest shortfall in units relative to expectations although the lower levels of demand appear to be fairly widespread.","The weaker global unit market accounted for the majority of the revenue impact in the quarter along with some mix effects. Against this backdrop, we continued to demonstrate disciplined execution on our cost reduction plan. Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses were $1.56 billion down 15% sequentially and well below the low-end of the guidance range. Maintaining our focus on our OpEx efficiency remains a top priority and we're on track to deliver against our $1 billion cost reduction plan excluding excess litigation.","Expenses in the first quarter also benefited from lower than expected litigation spend due to timing and the effects of a weaker stock market on re-evaluation of deferred compensation allegation. As a reminder, there is a corresponding offset on the deferred compensation liabilities in our investment income. So there is no net EPS benefit.","Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was a benefit of 40%. This is in line with the benefit we included in our guidance for the quarter. Today, we have executed on $22.2 billion in share repurchases of the $30 billion authorization we announced last July. This includes $5.1 billion through a Dutch auction and $16 billion under our ongoing ASR programs executed in the fall of last year. As of today January 30, the ASRs are approaching 40% completion and the average repurchase price to-date is approximately $61. As a reminder, the ASR settle at the average trading price less a discount over the life of the agreements. The ASR agreements are scheduled to end in early September 2019.","Let's now turn to our financial outlook for the second fiscal quarter of 2019. We estimate fiscal second quarter revenues to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $5.2 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $0.65 to $0.75. We expect QTL revenues to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion including the $150 million under the interim agreement. We expect the market factors that we saw in Q1 to persist with continued softness in the handset market and weaker overall mix of devices.","We expect fiscal second quarter QTL EBT margin to be approximately 54% to 58%. In QCT, we estimate approximately $150 million to $170 million MSM chip shipments for the fiscal second quarter down sequentially as a result of typical volume seasonality, market weakness particularly in the low and mid tiers, timing of OEM product launches and overall competitive dynamics. Lower MSM units admit in low tiers is offset by favorable product mix due to seasonality and broader adoption of our newly launched Snapdragon 800 chipset. We expect this mix shift to drive significantly higher revenue per MSM in the fiscal second quarter. We expect QCT EBT margins to be between 13% and 15%.","We anticipate fiscal second quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses to increase by 6% to 8% sequentially due to higher litigation spend and the impact of the counter reset of normal employee tax costs. Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A sequential growth is also being impacted by the expected absence of the revaluation adjustment for our deferred compensation liabilities which benefited OpEx in Q1.","We remain on track to deliver $1 billion in cost savings from our $7.4 billion baseline. At present, we have achieved approximately $850 million of savings toward our $1 billion target. However, due to excess litigation, we are tracking somewhat above the $6.4 billon run rate. Nevertheless, we are on track to deliver the $1 billion in operating savings and expect additional savings post licensing resolution as litigation costs come down.","Non-GAAP interest expense, net of investment and other income in the fiscal second quarter is expected to be approximately $100 million, which is in line with our prior guidance and is a reasonable estimate for each of the remaining quarters in fiscal 2019.","Turning to fiscal 2019, we expect our non-GAAP annual effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 to be approximately 0% and reflects both the run rate impacts of tax reform and the fiscal first quarter impacts of our tax restructuring. Excluding the first quarter benefit, we estimate a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 12% for the rest of fiscal '19. We now expect calendar year 2018 3G, 4G device estimates to be at the low-end of our prior guidance range. For calendar year 2019, we are revising the device forecast to be in the range of 1.85 billion to 1.95 billion units which at the midpoint is a reduction of 50 million units from our prior forecast. This reduction is entirely attributable to handset market softness. We expect handsets shipments to be up 1% percent year-over-year with non-handset devices driving overall unit growth up 5% at the midpoint of guidance. Despite this, we anticipate improving conditions for our chip business in the second half of the year as a result of new product launches including devices with 5G chipsets and growth in our adjacent businesses.","That includes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Mauricio.","Mauricio Lopez-Hodoyan","Thank you, George. Operator, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Chris Caso with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Q - Chris Caso","Yes. Thank you. Just with regard to the MSM business and the guidance you provided, it looked like that had been running down about 20% year-on-year in December. I think your guidance reflects down 15% in March. Recognizing that that includes a rather large design loss, what would you characterize that the continuing business what would that be running on a year-on-year basis is perhaps a better indicator of the underlying business?","George Davis","This is George. Chris you're correct in citing that the real difference year-over-year in Q1 was driven by the thin modem business share change at Apple. We're actually seeing strong positioning in our products really everywhere else. And if we're seeing any weakness in the guide it's really in low tier units, which is partially seasonal and also just I think a reflection of the economy in China.","Cristiano Amon","This is Cristiano. We can add one thing. As George said we see that on the low end of the units, but we continue to see a favorable product mix towards the higher features smartphones and we expect that trend to continue especially important as we look at the launch of 5G technology towards the later part of '19 and 2020.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Walkley","Great thanks. I'm going to follow on to Cristiano's comments there at the end. Could you just update us about how we should think about revenue per MSM trends? Clearly a stronger mix implied in your guidance, but could you talk maybe about the RF attach rate and what this could do to the calculation of revenue per MSM or maybe just talk about the RF opportunity and how much your RF business could grow as 5G takes off over the next couple of years? Thank you.","George Davis","Hey, Mike. It's George. Maybe I'll cover off on the revenue per MSM. What we're seeing is even with a softness in the marketplace our premium tier devices continue to be strong and growing both year-over-year and quarterly, which is really a testament to the new products. And we're also seeing continued strength in the high-end mid tier overall. So, revenue per MSM and in what is normally seasonally challenging second quarter is going to be quite healthy as your back of the envelope calculation is correct. It should be a very strong revenue per MSM and quarter for us.","Steve Mollenkopf","Mike let me just answer your second part on the RF front-end. We see right now our RF front-end business excluding the impact of Apple. Outside Apple continue to see growth continue to see double-digit growth rates in their business as we head into 2019. But most important, this trend of moving towards higher end devices especially with the transition of 5G is was one data point that we like for the absolute majority of the 5G designs we have on the recently announced 855 or the x50 modem, we have RF front-end attach and we're very pleased with their metric.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Tim Wong with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Tim Wong","Thank you. If I could just ask a two parter on China. First, on the chip business there was some mention about macro and a challenging end markets would love your perspective on the market? And also, George I think you've mentioned for the QCT, the MSM sequential down competitive dynamics as one part of that. So, should we take that to read more low-end competition, or potential share loss in China?","And then, on the flip side, if we just get an update on the QTL business in China obviously the Huawei deal is pending, but could you talk a little bit about compliance and just how the licensing deals are going with the rest or the longer tail of Chinese OEMs? Thank you.","George Davis","Yes. So just to answer your question on the competitive dynamics. We continue to see pressure at some of the lower tier devices. And so, which we see down in Q2 some of it is we believe based on share loss and some is based on just the size of the market which you would typically see pullback seasonally on that. I would say China overall has been probably the -- while it's been extremely good for Qualcomm overall, if we look at '18, compared to our expectations going into '18, demand in China has been substantially lower than we would have estimated for total demand in China not speaking to our share in this case which has led us -- is one of the factors that led us to put the estimates for the calendar year '18 units down to the low-end of our guidance range from last quarter. I will let -- were you going to jump in\u2026","Steve Mollenkopf","Yes. I'm was just going to add one thing. So, Tim on the chip business, I think there is, as George outlined, there's competitive dynamics on the low end. But the biggest factor really seasonality of product launches. So many of our customers probably have product launches in in the coming quarter and it's just typical seasonality. We've seen overall China has been a good story for us. And again, the most important thing is they move towards the higher end devices.","Alex Rogers","This is Alex stepping in on the QTL question. The story with China also is good on the QTL outside. Under our new 5G FTC licensing program, we now have over 35 new licensees or licensees signed up to the new agreements and amendments and a good significant number of those are Chinese OEMs. So, the licensing program is doing well in China including with respect to compliance.","Tim Wong","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.","Stacy Rasgon","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the revisions to your market outlook. So, you're taking your global units down I guess to the low-end of the range a few points versus where you were. But your QTL revenues right now excluding the Huawei settlement are running 900 million give or take. That's more than 10% lower than your prior outlook which was like $1 billion to $1.1 billion. So how do I reconcile that I guess with your comments on where you're seeing the weakness in the market which seems to be more like a low end it seems to imply that ASPs would have to be down a lot given the revenue you're blushing since you're down more than the unit revision. I guess how do we think about the trends of units in ASPs playing out and what effect that's having on your QTL revenues right now.","George Davis","Yes. Really what you're seeing Stacy is the adjustment that comes from the change in reported units which is consistent with what we're seeing in the numbers that we're now using to revise our guide. I would also say in -- you get some of the dynamics in our outlook that relate to how much in a given quarter is reflected by OEMs that are not paying on their licenses and reporting and those that are. And so, one of the things that you'll see is, we're actually -- while we're seeing market conditions overall worsen in Q2 when you adjust for the Huawei payment. We're seeing modest improvement in the underlying revenue for QTL. And that really reflects the fact of the mix of the parties in there.","Stacy Rasgon","Are you seeing improvement, I mean, in Q2 of last year actual Huawei pavement you did like 965 and you're guiding [indiscernible] Huawei payment, this time 900, it is still down pretty, decently isn't it?","George Davis","You're talking about Q2 in terms of an apples to apples comparison factor.","Stacy Rasgon","Yes.","George Davis","Yes. I think again I would say the market if I did apples to apples comparison, I would say the market is down basically modestly compared to that quarter where we had that very low demand quarter out of China that we talked about. And I think that's the biggest factor, but it's -- we do see it down somewhat but not as much as you might have expected because of dynamics in -- what was effectively Q3 last year.","Stacy Rasgon","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.","Matt Ramsay","Thanks guys. Good afternoon. I guess a couple of things. The first just to follow on to Stacy's question. I guess a lot of the data that we're seeing is globally not related to your QTL revenues, but just globally out of the smartphone market isn't great. And I guess Cristiano talked about launches in the second quarter potentially that will help that. But an up 5% unit growth for the whole industry seems a bit aggressive. And maybe that embeds growth in auto and some other areas. So maybe you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the market that that leads you to think the smartphone market is going to grow this year?","And then, secondly, George any additional thoughts a lot of investors asking me about additional breakouts in QCT to reflect some of the adjacency businesses in the revenue versus just one line. Any thoughts that would be helpful. Thank you.","George Davis","Yes. This is George. I'm going to take the -- I'll take a little bit on the device forecast. Just to be clear the up 5% includes non-handsets as well and that's where you're getting the growth -- the real growth year-over-year. We've said 1% growth in handsets over '18. And '18 was down 1% over '17. We're still seeing in our forecast we see continued softness we expect the developed handset demand to be down. We think that's the replacement rates as people start to think about 5G devices coming into the marketplace. And then, you're not seeing as big a impact in '19 from China as you saw in '18. But you're also not seeing quite the growth in some of the other emerging markets including India. So, we see more modest growth out of the emerging markets in '19, but overall handsets. That puts you at about flat to 1%.","Cristiano Amon","This is Cristiano. Just want to add one important data point. So, you have the overall market dynamic, but then you have the chip business, one thing that we see happening when we think of our China business and we see that accelerating as many of our customers had expended globally outside China domestic especially now from Southeast Asia, India and LATAM going into Europe, we've seen our customers starting business in U.K., Germany, Spain, Italy, Portugal and France and that's an addition and it's a good trend to the chip business. Thank you.","George Davis","And we'll look to have I think a more robust discussion on the adjacent as we get to an analyst meeting which we think is the right environment to go into that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","James Faucette","Great. Thank you very much. I want to turn back to some of the comments that Steve made around licensing in asserting Qualcomm's IP portfolio. You talked about China [indiscernible] cases there. Can you just update us as to what -- how you're feeling about the need to assert and eventually put in place IP licensing over non-essential IP for the Chinese OEMs. And that is the case with Apple have any implications there? This is my first question and I guess kind of related to that how are you thinking about or specifically as it relates to Huawei and the interim payment they are been making. Can you give us an estimate of what Qualcomm estimates may be do under the previous licensing agreements? And help us understand what that delta might be. Thank you very much.","Donald Rosenberg","James. This is Don Rosenberg. I'll start, Alex may want to chime in. So, with respect you -- good point about the value of our NEPs as well as SEPs they often seem to get lost in the discussion. You probably know that actually a majority of those 130,000 or so patents that Steve -- applications that Steve referred to earlier are in fact NEPs. Also, all the lawsuits we brought around the world against Apple involve NEPs non-essential patents. And as Steve has indicated, we've been very successful so far and we've got a number of cases that are going to be rolling out over the course of this year almost every month. There's a significant milestone in terms of either hearings or final rulings in Germany and China and in the U.S. and the ITC and district courts here.","So, the value of our overall portfolio is extraordinarily high. And it's certainly something we constantly think about when we look at our licensing program. And one point that I think people often miss is that we started this licensing program what almost three decades ago and there were no standard essential patents in our portfolio at the time because we weren't even in the standard yet we were licensing that portfolio. We continued to license that portfolio essentially at the same terms as our patent portfolio grew with standard essential patents and non-standard essential patents into the numbers that Steve was talking about.","Alex Rogers","This is Alex. James let me just respond to some -- the first part of your question. I think Don is correct that we've demonstrated significant value in our non-essential patents. But I think again you have to step back and take a look at what we've done over the last four years or so. We have really done a very good job of establishing an SEP only portfolio licensing program both inside of China and now outside of China. But despite the fact that we continue to sign up significant numbers of SEP only licensees, we still have a very good number -- a very significant number of licensees that choose to keep portfolio wide agreements. And so that's a very significant mix in the overall licensing program. So, I think that the overall program is heading in the right direction. We've got a few issues to deal with in terms of the Apple litigation. But right now, I think the focus is on successfully establishing the 5G program which we have done over the course of the last 12 months.","In terms of the Huawei interim agreement that's a minimum non-refundable agreement. I don't know that I would get into the overall numbers in terms of what's at issue. I think we'll just leave it at that.","James Faucette","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Ross Seymore","Hi guys. Thanks for let me ask a question. I want to return to the QCT side, kind of a two-part question. First, last quarter when you guided, you cited not only the obvious issue sequentially with Apple, but also China inventory burns. So I want to see what the update was on that is the weakness you're pointing to in MSMs in 1Q. Just demand or is there inventory burn and if so how much longer will that last?","And then, the revenue per MSM side of the equation. obviously, a big pop up in your fiscal 2Q guide. How should we think about that continuing through the rest of the year? Just the 5G side obviously come in as a tailwind, and then, how does China and answer to the first part of the question potentially weigh against that. Thank you.","George Davis","Hey, Ross. This is George. Again, I think we've definitely seen sell-through ahead of sell-in continue in China. So, inventory continues to come down whether it reflects the new normal yet what we'll have to see, but that certainly was part of it. But again, the overwhelming year-over-year effect was just related to the one customer.","I think on revenue per MSM as we start to see 5G pickup and additional premium tier devices increase that's definitely going to be a tailwind for revenue per MSM. We haven't forecasted it out yet, but we think that'll certainly be a tailwind force both not only at the end of this year but as we go as we ramp 5G in 2021.","Ross Seymore","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Timothy Arcuri","Hi. Thanks. Question for Steve or George. There was a lot of testimony in the trial in the past couple of weeks that Apple wanted to buy your modem, but you would not sell it to them. That's for the current phones. But now, Intel is talking about the XMM 8160, which is going to ship in the back half of this year. So obviously there's going to be a performance difference, but that's a 5G modem. So, is that enough to get them to the table? Is the performance difference enough? And then, I guess as a follow-on to that what would the deadline be for them to settle, and then, be able to get your modem in their phone for the fall? Thanks.","Steve Mollenkopf","This is Steve. I would say -- we feel very, very comfortable with where our roadmap is relative to the competitors. It doesn't mean there aren't a lot of competitors out there but we feel like we have a very, very strong position across the board. And if you look at a feature set, you look at power size everything. We feel very strong about it. In terms of when a person would need to make a decision, it's hard for me to say typically you need to make decisions kind of in the first quarter of this year if you're going to impact products that are going into next year. That would be my typical side, but I couldn't speak for other folks. Some OEMs particularly the Asian OEMs move a little bit more quickly but that would be my general sense for what the timing is.","Timothy Arcuri","Okay, Steve. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Blayne Curtis","Thanks for taking the question. Actually, maybe just following on that in terms of the 5G landscape you mentioned you had the majority that early wins here. Just kind of curious your visibility into next year and you just comment on the landscape how diverse the 5G landscape would be next year in shipping phone?","Cristiano Amon","Thanks. This is Cristiano. One of the things we like about 5G; 5G it's not a static target, it's a moving target. There is a multiple variations of 5G capabilities. And as soon as we launch we continue to see that increasing from sub-six to millimeter wave to new cores and care aggregation and we have now basically line of sight to a number of devices that will be continuously being added to the market as we have most developed economies launching 5G in the second half of '19. So, we're very optimistic about how fiscal '20, how significant 5G will be for us.","Steve Mollenkopf","This is Steve. I might add one other thing to that which is -- don't -- there are a number of different mode changes. If you look at how the network will operate and the number of bands that you need to deal with between now and really the next 24 months. So -- and I think if you're not involved in that at the beginning you're going to have a very difficult time, I think fielding a solution that is competitive at any given time if you show up too late that's one of the advantages of being early and one of the reasons why we try to make sure that we're there. The other aspect I think that we should also acknowledge is that I think there's a lot of concern early on with 5G, as would the handsets be at the right size or would they be at a size that that people would find attractive particularly given all the RF complication that exists.","And what we have seen from early indications that is not something to be worried about. They are very, very attractive ideas. So, I think it's going to be really an important part of the industry. The other aspect that I just make sure people remember about 5G is the economics to the operator. They really have an incentive to push this. And I think you're going to not only see that in the handsets, you're going to see that in the people selling the devices, the channels that the salespeople will be incentivized to press 5G. And so, we look forward to having that happen over the next year or so.","Cristiano Amon","And please stay tuned to this year of Mobile World Congress. I think will be very exciting in this area.","Blayne Curtis","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","C.J. Muse","Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess if I could squeeze two in. First one, as you think about non-handset growth driving the up 5%. Could you share with us what the implied non-handset unit growth is and how you think about the implications to both royalties and MSM ASP. And then just as a quick follow-up question, based this question on QTL, I think you're guiding that up 3% at the midpoint. I'm a little surprised it's higher Q-on-Q given the FX headwinds and unit volumes out there, are there any sort of catch up payments or things like that we should be considering in there. Thank you.","George Davis","Now no real big anomalies in that respect. So, it's really more the mixed element that we talked about. In terms of non-handset growth again to get to 5% overall growth, you've got to see something like 27% growth in the non-handsets to get to that. That is largely driven by growth in IoT. Obviously, you still see growth in everything from automotive to compute. But, it's really IoT and we're certainly seeing strong growth in industrial IoT in our own business there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.","Srini Pajjuri","Thank you for taking my question. Steve, I want to go back to your comment about the FTC litigation. You said you're still negotiating with FTC. And given that the closing arguments are done, do you think you have enough time to reach a potential settlement, and then, how are you feeling about it? And then, hypothetically if the ruling were to go against you, what are some of the options that you have going forward? And then, in the interim, I do think -- do you anticipate any changes to your business model? Well if you are appealing or any other options that you're exploring?","Steve Mollenkopf","Sure. Well, I'll take the first part of that and then maybe ask Don to jump in on the second part. With respect to settlement talks with the FTC as you might imagine we have been engaged with them for some time. We continue to be engaged. And if we think that we can find a resolution we would take that to try to remove this risk off the table not a statement on how we feel about our case. But as you might imagine this is an important element and we continue to work it. I think the judge gave some direction at the end of trial in terms of when she might rule. And I would just point you to that in terms of timing, but we have the ability to continue to work this and as you would expect we are.","Donald Rosenberg","Yes. This is Don, Srini. With respect to the judge's comments at the end, she didn't actually say when she would rule, but she did indicate over the last couple of hearings that this is a complicated case and she'll probably take more time than she might otherwise. We think we've put on an extraordinarily strong case here, so we're not obviously going to comment or predict outcomes when a case is now before the judge for ruling. But I can only tell you that we think that the government failed to prove what we thought was an ill-conceived theory. They still had a burden. We don't think they supported it with any convincing evidence at all. Indeed, I think we made the case as this industry and these people know -- you people on this call know for a very competitive industry that we have facilitated over the years through our licensing program. And so, we are hoping for obviously a victory here. And that's what we are focused on and we are not going to talk about possibilities until we faced them.","I would say this, the judge, as she indicated this is the complicated case and based on what she has been asked and not asked by the FTC for in terms of a ruling. It's going to have to a weight a particular ruling if she would go the other way because there are multiple variations of what that ruling might be and so we couldn't comment on the possibilities.","Srini Pajjuri","Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This ends our allotted time for questions and answers. Mr. Mollenkopf, do you have anything further to add before adjourning the call.","Steve Mollenkopf","Yes. Thank you. Thanks everyone for joining us today. This would be I think a very important quarter not only due to legal milestones but also just continued innovation from the team and continued milestones for 5G. Thanks everybody from Qualcomm for working so hard. And we will talk to you again next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

I am sorry I can\u2019t be with you live today, but I did want to give you my comments before passing it on to the team. We are pleased with our strong results this quarter with revenues up 35% and non-GAAP EPS up 21% versus a year ago. Licensing revenues were driven by strong smartphone sales in the March quarter and our Snapdragon and Gobi products were featured in an extensive set of flagship devices. The tremendous success of the business puts us in a strong position to return capital to stockholders.","During the third fiscal quarter and up through today, we returned approximately $2.2 billion. This includes dividends paid and approximately $1.5 billion in stock repurchases made under our previously announced $5 billion stock repurchase program. We\u2019re confident in our business outlook and we will continue to return capital to stockholders consistent with this deal. I like to focus my comments today on smartphone innovation before turning it over to Steve for more comprehensive update on our QCT and QTL businesses.","I\u2019m often asked about the potential slowing pace of innovation in smartphone. I can assure that we do not see it here at Qualcomm. The breadth of technologies that are being developed and the demand for new features and device capabilities from our customers remains extremely strong. Though we have seven major technology areas in which significant advances are continuing to be made including the modem, including RF, the CPU, the graphics processing unit, digital signal processing and multi-media, connectivity, sensors and displays. Innovation such as LTE Advanced, LTE Broadcast, multi-band RF front ends, ultra-HD video, augmented reality, computational photography, continuous interaction user interfaces, H.265 video compression, HD audio, sensor monitoring, 802.11ac (inaudible), indoor position locations, proximity based communication, wireless charging, new display technologies, mobile payment capabilities, security features, remote device management are some of the many features that will increase the utility of 3G and 4G devices any one of which could provide a catalyst for a smartphone user to upgrade.","Throughout the history of the industry we\u2019ve a series of technology advancements that have driven new innovative devices which are fueled upgrade and replacement cycle. This has continued over the last several years as we have seen the introduction of many new technologies, including LTE, Dual and Quad Core processors, improved graphics, higher resolution displays and more capable operating system. In the near future we will see the broad adoption of LTE Advanced which doubles the peak data rate and provides higher average throughput.","That\u2019s not all, the scale of the smartphone platform is unparalleled and it is at the center of technology innovation. New technologies used to be commercialized through discreet consumer electronics products. Today we see innovations moving rapidly in the smartphones. For example the first place most consumers will see high-quality ultra-HD video recording, is on a Snapdragon enabled smartphone.","Looking at this now from a regional perspective, there seems to be some concern that developed regions are becoming saturated with smartphones. The fact is that these reasons have been primarily replacement cycle driven for some time as handset penetrations are already quite high. The strategies (ph) already been cycling through devices and are used to doing so. Certain large carriers routinely provide incentives for subscribers to purchase a new phone every two years, and although we may see different programs or replacement initiatives in the future. These types of programs are working successfully and competitive dynamics stay with their continuance in the future. Interestingly there has been some recent plans launched by operators that could actually accelerate the replacement cycle, so we will continue to monitor those. In some our long term plans continue to include a very modest decrease in the developed region replacement rate.","Turning to emerging regions we view the opportunity is very significant when you consider that according to our geographic definition approximately 80% of the world\u2019s population resides in these locations with a relatively youthful demographic, and the GDP in emerging region is expected to grow at an annual rate of approximately 6% for the next five years according to consensus estimates. And according to Gartner, in these countries at the end of 2012 the average penetration rate of smartphones relatively the install base and the handsets sits at approximately 18% or only 10% of the total population.","As we pointed out during the last couple of years, we\u2019re seeing the rapid adoption of mobile technologies and in fact rising average selling prices in these locations as a mix shift to smartphone. In these regions there are limited, fixed broadband alternatives and users are getting excellent utility from their wireless devices. So in summary although we expect to experience quarterly growth rate fluctuations for a variety of reasons, 3G, 4G mobile computing technology and device are still in an early stage of adoption in the majority of the world and have a very long runway of attractive growth potential. This adoption is feeling new innovation and perpetuating that cycle. Gartner estimates that approximately 700 million smartphones were sold in calendar 2012 and that number will grow to 1.7 billion in 2017 representing an approximately 20% compound annual growth rate. Building off fiscal year 2012, we believe we will experience a double-digit average annual growth in total reported device sales over our five-year planning period, which included an estimated average low single-digit percentage decline in average selling prices over this period.","So, again, I am sorry, I can\u2019t be on the call live today, but I am pleased with our results and outlook. And Steve and George will now comment on that. Thank you very much.","","Steven Mollenkopf","Good afternoon, everyone. I will provide some comments on our QTL and QCT businesses, which both delivered strong financial results this quarter. In QTL, total reported device sales by our licensees were up 18% year-over-year and above our prior expectations, driven by stronger than expected average selling prices. Average selling prices were up $13 sequentially at the midpoint despite $3 of foreign exchange unfavorability, reflecting an increased mix of mid-tier and high-tier handsets. The quarter-over-quarter increase was driven by ASP strength in both emerging and developed regions.","As Paul noted in his comments, although the developed regions have been primarily driven by replacements and smartphone penetration is relatively high, our calendar year 2013 unit shipment estimates include year-over-year growth of approximately 6% in developed regions well ahead of GDP estimates. This quarter we also continue to see an increasing mix of handsets at the mid and high tiers, and we expect this distribution to remain relatively stable going forward in developed regions.","In the emerging regions, we expect to continue to see strong unit growth and increasing average selling prices. We also continued to grow our licensee base, and now have over 240 CDMA licensees and more than 65 single-mode OFDMA licensees. Our patent portfolio continues to be the most widely licensed in the industry. QCT also had another strong quarter with record revenues. Results either met or exceeded each of our prior key guidance metrics with revenues and earnings before tax increasing 47% and 56% year-over-year respectively.","MSM shipments were up 22% year-over-year and at the high end of our prior guidance range. Implied revenue per MSM was higher sequentially as we increased our share of content in devices. Versus expectations, we had a greater mix of shipments of mid, low-tier products, and to Chinese emerging accounts offsetting a bit of softness we saw from some Tier 1 OEMs. Our scale and broad diversified customer base are key strengths to our business and allows us to deliver strong results, despite quarterly fluctuations in mix or OEM share.","Looking to the fourth fiscal quarter, we had a similar product mix shift versus prior expectations. We expect MSM shipments to be slightly higher sequentially driven by anticipated new device launches and a seasonality associated with this quarter. Similar to what we have seen in the last couple of years, it is important to note that our MSM volumes for each of the next two quarters are depended on timing and success of OEM product launches for the holiday selling seasons. We are encouraged by a strong pipeline of Snapdragon 800 and Snapdragon 200 products launching over the next two quarters, along with shipments for the China Mobile LTE trial beginning in September and ramping into the December quarter.","Our design traction remained strong. We have just crossed a new milestone with more than 1,000 designs announced or shipping with Snapdragon processors and have over 500 designs in the pipeline. We are also seeing increased momentum in tablets as OEMs leveraged phone designs for tablets with over 40 design wins in the pipeline, including the recently announced new Nexus 7 by Google. Our latest Snapdragon 800 processor has again raised the bar combining the industry\u2019s most advanced mobile application processor with the industry\u2019s most advanced multi-mode LTE modems.","Designs are in process and with many major OEMs for a very broad set of opportunities worldwide. Flagship devices announced with the Snapdragon 800, include the next generation LGG smartphone, Samsung Galaxy S4 LTE advanced, and the Sony Xperia Z Ultra. We remain confident in our LTE leadership position moving forward. Though LTE competition exist today and new suppliers are hoping to enter, the complexity of a multi-mode LTE modem feature set and the integration of a high-performance application processor into the same solutions is proving to be a technically challenging for many. The modem roadmap of the industry remains robust as carriers move to LTE advanced and utilize complicated spectrum allocations to meet the increasing data demands of mobile devices and support roaming. We\u2019re building (inaudible) in China and our emerging account shipments were up 35% sequentially in the June quarter. We continue to add new design wins. We expect competition for low cost solutions to remain strong; however we believe the expected launch of LTE in China will be a differentiator for us and enable us to gain broader access including into China Mobile.","Further many of the leading emerging account OEMs hope to expand their businesses internally which also aligns well with our tiered roadmap. We won 30 new designs in the China Mobile large scale LTE trial and including increasing share of new designs in the second way of the LTE Device Awards. Our connectivity and networking products continue to do well with record revenue and unit shipments in the June quarter. Connectivity design traction continues to be strong across the mobile networking and consumer electronics segment.","We\u2019re also pleased with the growing success of our new 802.11ac product the WCN3680 which was the first 11ac mobile solution in the industry to achieve WiFi certification and it's also featured in the Samsung Galaxy Mega. Our RF360 Front End Solution is an opportunity for us to solve further complexity at the chipset level and grow our content in the device.","The first product in this family of product is on-track and currently sampling to a major Tier 1 OEM. Though still early in the life cycle this new solution we\u2019re very encouraged by early OEM interest and design traction. Looking ahead we see very strong trends for both QTL and QCT with many exciting devices expected this holiday season. That concludes my remarks and I will now turn the call over to George.","","George Davis","Thank you Steve and good afternoon everyone. We\u2019re pleased to be reporting another quarter of strong financial results, reflecting significant year-over-year growth in both QCT and QTL. This performance also provides the basis for an increase in our financial outlook for fiscal 2013. Fiscal third quarter revenues were a record $6.2 billion up 35% year-over-year and 2%.","Non-GAAP operating income of $2 billion was up 18% year-over-year and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.03 was up 21% year-over-year and down 12% quarter-over-quarter. These results included a 158 million impairment charge or $0.06 per share related to QMT assets.","Without this impairment non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $1.09 well above the high end of our prior guidance range. Our major businesses performed quite well in the quarter on strong device ASPs and demand from emerging regions into QTL while higher implied revenue per MSM and strong volumes led to solid results for QCT.","In QTL total reported device sales by our licensees were $56.5 billion above the high end of our prior guidance range. We estimate that 244 million to 248 million 3G, 4G based devices were shipped by our licensees in the March quarter at an average selling price of $227 to $233 up approximately $13 sequentially at the midpoint. QCT had record revenues in the quarter, and MSM shipments were 172 million units towards the high end of our prior guidance range implied revenue per MSM was $24.55 which was higher sequentially as expected.","Fiscal third quarter QCT operating margin was 17% in line with our prior expectations, non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses grew 1% sequentially, slightly below our prior expectations. As Paul mentioned during the third fiscal quarter in the first few weeks of this current quarter, we returned approximately $2.15 billion to stockholders including $600 million of dividends paid and $1.55 billion in stock repurchases. We now have just under $3.5 billion two remaining on $5 billion authorization as a result of these activities.","Cash flow from operations was strong at 33% of revenues and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $30.4 billion. In other balance sheet matters I\u2019m pleased to report that we have taken another step forward in our partnership with Bharti in India. Consistent with our previous plans, Bharti funded repayment of $492 million in debt that QUALCOMM had previously guaranteed. The remaining $484 million in debt guaranteed by QUALCOMM was deconsolidated due to a change in control of the joint venture, which included Bharti subscribing to additional shares. We expect the remaining guarantee to be released prior to the end of this fiscal year.","Now, turning to our guidance, we are raising our financial outlook for fiscal 2013. We estimate fiscal 2013 revenues to be in the range of approximately $24.3 billion to $25 billion, up approximately 29% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect fiscal 2013 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $4.48 to $4.56, up approximately 22% year-over-year at the midpoint. We are increasing our forecast for this fiscal 2013 QTL average selling price to approximately $223 to $229, which is $6 above our prior $220 midpoint estimate reflecting higher handset prices in multiple regions. For calendar 2013 global 3G\/4G based device shipments, we continue to estimate that between 1.015 and 1.085 billion devices will be shipped by our licensees, up approximately 12% year-over-year at the midpoint. While our calendar year range is unchanged, we are more upwardly biased in our outlook than we were previously. Consistent with our prior expectations, we estimate fiscal 2013 QTL operating margins to be 85.5% to 87.5% and QCT operating margins to be 18.5% to 20.5%. We expect combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to grow approximately 22% to 23% year-over-year.","Now, turning to the fourth fiscal quarter, we estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $5.9 billion to $6.6 billion, up approximately 28% year-over-year at the midpoint. Our estimates reflect continued strength in QTL and QCT balanced by higher operating expenses and some uncertainty around the timing and success of product launches. As Steve mentioned, we are very confident in our positioning in these leading edge devices, it is more a matter of timing. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share in our fourth fiscal quarter to be approximately $1.02 to $1.10 per share, up approximately 19% year-over-year at the midpoint. We anticipate fourth fiscal quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will increase sequentially approximately 4% to 6% reflecting increased patent expense in QTL and R&D expense in QCT.","In QTL, we estimate that total reported device sales of $55 billion to $60 billion will be reported by our licensees in the September quarter for shipments they made in the June quarter, up approximately 24% year-over-year at the midpoint. In QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 171 million to 181 million units during the September quarter and QCT operating margin to be approximately 16% to 17%. We expect implied revenue per MSM to be flat to slightly down of a strong third quarter. Consistent with our prior view, we estimate that the 3G\/4G channel inventory will decline further in the September quarter as OEMs and operators prepare for new product launches for the holiday season though we continue to expect it to remain within the normal 11 to 16 week range. That concludes my comment.","I will now turn the call back to Warren.","","Warren Kneeshaw","Thank you, George. Operator, we are ready for questions.","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs","George I wanted to ask you a question first on your capital allocation strategy that was one of the highlights in Paul\u2019s prepared remarks as well and obviously the buyback is quite significantly here. Is your strategy here to basically continue to buy opportunistically especially when there is pull-back in the stock like we have seen recently or is there any thoughts, the borrowed level or in your office about something that is a little bit more structured and more significant and perhaps including leveling the balance sheet and then a question for Steve on chipset margins, seems like we continue to be in the high-teens there even though you're gaining quite significant content share and also volumes are coming up nicely in the next quarter. Can you just go through the puts and takes of what we\u2019re not seeing that move higher? Thank you.","","George Davis","I think what you\u2019re seeing is definitely a step up in the return of capital for the quarter and actually for the full year as you may have seen we have returned $3.3 million in buyback and dividends. We just feel at the levels of the stock today and the strength of the balance sheet and quite frankly the strength of the businesses that it's a good time to be buying. You can see that we continue to buy through the end of the quarter up about $500 million on top of the 1 billion that we did in the quarter. We have about $3.5 billion remaining on the current authorization and we\u2019re really not in a position at this point to make any broader statement about a change in capital policy. We\u2019ve always been supportive of returning capital shareholders and we have had a bias, and we will continue to have a bias to step up more heavily when the markets provide a good opportunity.","","Steve Mollenkopf","On your second question I think it was really, if you think about the mix it was a little bit, look at the June quarter probably a little weaker on the premium tier and it was offset by some strengths at the emerging accounts tier. We have forecasted a similar trend going into September, which is essential a little bit less premium. Of course it's always definitely is a weird quarter to predict sometimes because of the importance of flagship launches.","So I think you\u2019re probably seeing a little bit of just the maybe a little before we see flagships devices launch. Now we do have a fair bit of investment in the businesses as George mentioned, we continue to invest quite heavily actually in the modem and in those areas of innovation as Paul mentioned in his prepared remarks. We think we\u2019re actually very well-positioned at the premium tier moving forward and we consider ourselves to be really differentiated there, so we\u2019re continuing to drive that in the business and we think it will pay off long term.","","Operator","Matt Hoffman from Cowen. Please go ahead with your questions.","","Matt Hoffman - Cowen & Company","Strong ASPs were certainly one of the positives here in the quarter since the company highlighted the Snapdragon 800 in the release, can we assume that\u2019s the product which is really driving those ASPs up so sharply. I guess it was up 8% sequentially in the June quarter and also if you can just comment on mix moving forward. Thanks.","","Steve Mollenkopf ","Sure with the chip ASPs really the 800 is really haven't launched yet actually, so we\u2019re anticipating over the next two quarters to start see some exciting devices come out of the 800 but that really hasn\u2019t started launching yet. What we saw in the June quarter was really more of a mix toward relative to our expectation, it's a little bit less premium, little bit more emerging markets and we did have some improvements in gross margin primarily in the cost area.","","Matt Hoffman - Cowen & Company","Okay, so as you start to bring your mix back toward more than modems are some of the high-end smartphone guys bringing their shipments back up in the back half of the calendar year. Do ASPs, continue to move up?","","Steve Mollenkopf","Well I think we forecasted, as George mentioned that to be flat and really what you see in our product line because they're such a big mix, different there is a big difference in ASP between the premium devices and the mid-tier and low-tier devices. That can change a lot actually based on the mix now looking forward. Now in the holiday season as I think is behind your question, you tend to be more flagship launches and you tend to see more premium devices launch as well. Same thing following Mobile World Congress in the first half of the calendar year as well. So we will see how that plays out but we think we\u2019re well-positioned in terms of design wins. It\u2019s just a question of what happens.","","Operator","Tavis McCourt from Raymond James, please go ahead with your question.","","Tavis McCourt - Raymond James","Couple of questions. First on the license ASP reported the quarter of roughly $230 at the midpoint, I guess, it\u2019s a little surprising to me that we are talking about a March quarter here, which I would think would have a lower mix of flagship smartphones relative to December quarter and yet the ASP was up quite a bit. Is it just at the China low end or emerging market, low end market was so strong in that December quarter that it cause your ASPs to come down that $10 or so when you report at March?","","Derek Aberle","So, I think, this is Derek, I think we highlighted during the last call that we are starting to see a little more volatility in the quarter-over-quarter ASP changes. And we indicated our belief was that we were going to see an upward movement in the ASP this quarter which is in line with what happened is actually a little stronger than what we expected, but really that came from a strength in both developed and emerging regions as Steve noted in his remarks. In developed, I think we started to see an increasing mix this quarter of devices at the mid and high-tier while at the same time, the prices within those tiers remaining relatively stable and there were actually some new launches within the quarter, at the March quarter. And then in emerging regions, I think it\u2019s much of the same story in developed meaning we have an increasing percentage of devices going into the mid and high-tier, but also I think acceleration more so than we expected of feature phones moving over to smartphones. And as we pointed out in the past, the ASP uplift when moving from feature phones even to the lower tier smartphones is quite meaningful. So, we are continuing to see upward movement in emerging region ASP. So, really, all of those things came together to get us where we ended up this quarter.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Long from BMO Capital. Please go ahead with your question.","","Tim Long - BMO Capital","Two related ones on chips here. First, I think Steve you mentioned that the gross margin was up a little in the June quarter due to some cost savings there. Just give us a sense on kind of what\u2019s the strategy for pricing we still see some pretty aggressive competition in Asia given that gross margins for this business have come down meaningfully in the last two years. Do we think we are bumping along a level where we are not likely to see gross margins any lower? And then Steve the second one, just maybe you could just talk a little bit about there is a lot out there lately on benchmarking of different chips that has been pretty controversial topic. So, we just love your take on how we should look at kind of comparing a lot of these new chips and new features out there. What\u2019s the best way for us to look at how companies will be successful? Thanks.","","Steven Mollenkopf","Okay, Tim. So, on the pricing side, as I mentioned in my remarks, we saw some I think some sequential strength in the emerging accounts. And we are probably up 35% quarter-over-quarter there. Those products for us really could fall into two buckets. So, we do quite well from a margin as well as the unit\u2019s perspective kind of at the performance tier of the emerging accounts. And I think one of the misconceptions is that, that\u2019s all just at the bottom if not a lot of the OEMs there are turning to build both the brand as well as volume. Now, in the very low tier, it is a very, very aggressive time period. It\u2019s really the 2G to 3G conversion market and it\u2019s quite aggressive. We are continuing to price aggressively there.","Quite frankly, we don\u2019t have the best cost structure at that time. We are working to improve that. We hope that, that will improve over time. But we are pleased, because we think although our units are growing they still have further to go. And my guess is that our revenue share is probably pretty strong certainly stronger than our unit share in that area. Remember too, that we don\u2019t participate really in China Mobile yet, which is the largest carrier in the region, largest carrier in the world. So, we look at that and we say there is an opportunity there for us to grow the business and we look forward to it. That being said, it\u2019s very competitive market as you know.","With respect to benchmarks, good question, actually I am glad you asked, what\u2019s interesting about it is I think there is probably a little bit, I don\u2019t know the right word, basically I think it's a little bit dubious the way that some of these benchmarks have led to certain conclusions and then other conclusions, but at the end when we look at the results we conclude that we\u2019re definitely in the lead there. More importantly though when we look at our position at the OEM base and in the near-term, or even the midterm we\u2019re quite confident about how we fit. And I think it comes down from the fact that we think we have the best technology across all of the vectors that matter, but most importantly we have it together. We have the ability to put multiple things into one SoC and I think that has served us quite well and we expect that to serve us quite well moving forward. So we have a tough time understanding all the anxiety that people have regarding the conclusions people make from those benchmarks that we just don\u2019t see that in our customer base.","","Operator","Mike Walkley from Canaccord. Please go ahead with your question.","","Mike Walkley - Canaccord Genuity","Just want to go back to the margins and clearly there is some high end platforms that uncertain timing you\u2019re ramping some R&D ahead of that, but maybe in intermediate basis you\u2019ve have grown content share with those, some chipset aren\u2019t MSM related, are helping you grow your content and they have tended to be lower margins also. Can you just share with us kind of an intermediate-term how should we think about the margins as an investor, more content share opportunities versus mid-year longer term operating expenses margins plan you want to execute against.","","Steve Mollenkopf ","Sure maybe I can provide a little bit of color than George I think probably you could also jump in here as well. We look at our business right now and we definitely don't subscribe to the view that the high tier is going away in terms of innovation. In fact if you look at the speed at which we\u2019re being asked to cycle through chipsets I would argue that it's actually accelerating in terms of feature velocity. So we\u2019re driving that, we think that\u2019s a competitive strength for us, we also believe that moving forward over the next couple of years that will be really the thing that determines profitability as driving that tier and we think we have the ability to do that.","That being said today I would say we\u2019re probably at a point where we have some additional R&D because we\u2019re moving through the process notes faster than it's traditional in our business and complexity of doing that is actually increased and but we think that scale is actually a differentiator for us. So we\u2019re continuing to do that, if you see us over the years not have to do that. We hope that it makes it easier for us from a business perspective, but maybe George can comment a little bit on the other question.","","George Davis","The outlook for the margin is for the full-year obviously is right in line with where we started, the year overall. So a concern about something having changed in the marketplace that is driving a change in our outlook is I think exacerbated a little bit by the fact that we\u2019re looking at seasonal quarters here in terms of margin, so we will update the longer-term outlook at the November meeting, and again I think concerns about further erosion in margin are really overplayed.","","Operator","Brian Modoff from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank","So Steve couple of questions one just if you can elaborate a little bit on what you think your share is in the China market, when you see the impact. So you have TD-LTE in your devices for a little bit of time so when you start seeing the impact from that and then can you talk a little bit about your mid-range LTE chips coming into the market, you know the timing of it and how you see kind of a more of a mid-range line up of LTE devices impacting overall LTE volumes as we move into next year and particularly some of your competitors try to bring competing products to the market, albeit later than they may have thought.","","Steve Mollenkopf","Okay Brian on the share side of the China market it's interesting, when we look at where we really compete we really compete, we don't support an EDGE product, we don't support a low-tiered TD-SCDMA product. We think that by the time that we would have that out that market will transition to LTE and really intersect with the rest of our product line. So if you just look at kind of where we compete, we\u2019re quite pleased actually with how we've been able to develop what is essentially a new channel for us. All of the units that I mentioned that were sequentially strong those are new customers, customers that we wouldn\u2019t normally deal and I think we\u2019re intercepting those customers but at the same time that we\u2019re also getting I think the premium skews that are coming in that market. So we\u2019re actually fairly pleased with how we\u2019re doing there from a share perspective, probably more pleased from a revenue dollars perspective, but I think what that we are excited about is that when that business, when the China market starts to go toward LTE, which we think will start at the second half of this calendar year when they started the trial will be positioned even better, because that will really intercept our tiered roadmap from the 800 all the way down to some new products that we haven\u2019t announced, but we are clearly working on in that tier. So, we look at that as a disruptor for us.","The other aspect, which we think will be a good thing for us. We got a lot of the big OEM that has started to build their name through the transition to smartphones. In China, domestic OEMs are looking to go international. And we have we think a good on-ramp with them to drive their international business. So, as you may know, if you look at our product lines, one of the big advantages we have is that we have all of the band support, and that enables you to design a product in China and use that other places in the world, which we think is going to be something that\u2019s good for us to be able to intercept a number of the other OEMs that we haven\u2019t been strong in heretofore.","","Operator","Ehud Gelblum from Morgan Stanley, you may go ahead with your question.","","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley","I appreciate it. Thanks guys. Questions or clarifications, George, I don\u2019t hear you correctly at the end there that the QCT up margin guiding to 16% to 17% to down in the fiscal fourth quarter, I just want to make sure just clarification that I heard that right?","","George Davis","That\u2019s correct.","","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And I guess that has to do with mix.","","George Davis","Correct.","","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley","And the low before flagship the way Steve talked about it, okay.","","George Davis","Exactly.","","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley","Steve, and maybe this is actually combination between the two of you, what\u2019s the time between when you recognized revenue on a chip and you call it a natural shipment and the time the phone ends up in a stores, so if I say a phone is going to I walk into a store and that phone shows up there for the first time tomorrow, when did you actually ship that chip, I am just trying to get a sense as to the timing with respect to the difference from there? And then I ask this every quarter, but is there any way that you can give us a sense as to the chips that you ship into phones that are LTE phones used as LTE phones versus ones that are non-LTE phones, if you can take 172 million chips, give us a sense of that? What percent of the modems on those 172 are used for LTE, although probably more of them are capable with LTE, but how many that are actually in the LTE phones versus not and the same thing for Snapdragon versus thin modem and give us a sense of the ASP differential between those two? So, we can kind of go ahead, kind of model out what we think may happen with MSM revenue per \u2013 ASP per MSM chip?","","Steven Mollenkopf","Ehud, this is Steve. On the timing question, it\u2019s pretty difficult it varies from customer to customer. And I apologize I actually don\u2019t know even the range, but with some customers, they have the ability to move very, very rapidly other customers through their manufacturing, they may have a more complicated manufacturing process, other subcontractors what have you, and it may take them longer. So, I don\u2019t have a great sense as to what how long that would take for them to have sell-through some of my other colleagues perhaps could comment. But on the LTE mix, I also don\u2019t have that mix right now. I think we could probably provide some color in New York about that. I would say, directionally we are doing quite well in LTE, and it\u2019s clearly moving very rapidly throughout our portfolio, but we are also selling allowing customers or enabling customers to sell that same device in non-LTE markets as well. I just don\u2019t know the mix between those two.","","Operator","Stacy Rasgon from Sanford Bernstein, please go ahead with your question.","","Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein","Hi, guys. Thanks for my taking my questions. I have two quick ones. Firstly around your guidance for next quarter, you said that there was uncertainty around the timing of the flagship devices in that. Can you give us some feeling of what is actually baked into the guidance in terms of how conservative or not you might be on that timing? Second question around again the capital allocation and the buybacks, so you bought more than $10 billion in stock back over the last five years, your share count is actually up over that time. You said you are waiting for the markets to provide a good opportunity. Your valuation right now is lower than it ever has and why is it right now not the best opportunity to do may be a much bigger buyback than you have done historically?","","Steven Mollenkopf","So, let\u2019s start with the Q4 first, I think what you\u2019re seeing with Q4 is even though we\u2019re calling for MSMs to be up, if you look at our view of pricing it's suggesting the mix is going to be impacted by some of the emerging market volumes of more than the flagship volumes. So I think that\u2019s what we were talking about in terms of conservatism. But if you think about where we came in on MSMs in Q3 which was well ahead of our guidance, Q3 and Q4 together looked actually quite good and Q4 is a very similar overall in terms of the business for both QTL and QCT it's really some of the higher spending, eroding a little bit of the strong performance that we saw in Q3 but still very strong performance overall.","On the capital allocation front, we do agree it's a good time to buying stock and that\u2019s why we\u2019re we have ramped significantly the repurchase activity and it's continuing into Q4. As I said we have 3.5 billion outstanding, we don\u2019t forecast our share repurchase activity but as Paul said in his own quote we\u2019re confident in the business and we will continue to return capital consistent with that view. So we will stay in contact on that.","","Operator","Kulbinder Garcha from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","","Kulbinder Garcha - Credit Suisse","A question for Steve I guess, Steve a lot of things went on (inaudible) QCT whether it's flagship high end share gains, your LTE position is definitely coming your ASPs are, very highly QCT business and there is lots of reasons you\u2019ve given but I understand them in terms of pricing and what not but there is just not leverage in QCT. So I\u2019m curious as you looked over the next medium-term would you say this is an acceptable level of margin for that business? I\u2019m just curious how you see because I would have thought this year of all years especially with the revenue growth you saw they would have been a bit more leverage as seen of this (inaudible) and so can you speak a little bit about that dynamic and a question for Derek I guess on the licensing business it's quite clear in this last quarter especially the MediaTek and Spreadtrum and alike have seen very strong sequential and year-on-year volume increases, seven chips to the extreme low end of the smartphone market I would say. Is your ability to license in there and if so your volume number for the overall addressable market just seems a little bit conservative. So I\u2019m just kind of curious as to how you would reconcile that dynamics. Thanks.","","Steve Mollenkopf","Quick answer to your question on margin target, we actually would expect that business to do better and our plans are to make that happen. I think one of the things that when I listen to people talk about the competitive environment that there probably is a difference between our outlook and what other people see is that today it's already very competitive. I mean if you look at the market structure we essentially compete in Samsung against Samsung and that and we do quite well and so I don\u2019t think there is a much more competitive dynamic than that dynamic and we do I think quite well in that environment.","That being said, we believe that the investments that we\u2019re making and really it is our level of spending that I think is probably the easiest level to deal with that level of spending we think is creating technology distance between what our roadmap is providing and what I think other people get by doing their own chipsets and if you just look at over the last several years how much we\u2019ve started to at least in our minds move ahead from the competition both on an integrated scale but also individual technology vectors. We think that will play well to our strengths moving forward and there will be more leverage in the business moving forward. We\u2019re also not seeing additional markets in most of the I think tablet market in the revenue line but that is clearly in the cost line, I think it's too early to make a call on that but your outlook on that business I think also has a big lever in terms of what will happen long term.","","Derek Aberle","On your second question I think we have been pretty transparent that you know we\u2019re continuing to grow the licensing base and I think we went up another 10 licensees this quarter. Most of that growth has continued to come from China. So, we feel very confident that where we are collecting under our agreements, and that we have the main customers of Mediatek and Spectrum and others, as well as even the mid and smaller customers licensed and paying.","The one exception that we have discussed a number of times is TD-SCDMA and I think that maybe driving a little bit of the difference in the numbers that you are seeing versus the numbers that we are reporting to you as royalty bearing units. And as you know, we have had some difficulties collecting on TD-SCDMA in China. This year, in particular, we have seen pretty meaningful growth in TD-SCDMA units in China. And so as we go forward, that\u2019s having sort of a muted impact on the growth overall of the units reported to us, but as I look ahead, our expectation is though as China Mobile launches LTE that a significant portion of that volume will start to fairly quickly transition over to including the LTE and\/or UMTS and that will provide a basis for us to collect royalties on those devices, hopefully without the same types of challenges that we have had historically around TD-SCDMA. So, that would drive kind of accelerated growth year-over-year when you start looking out into \u201814 and \u201815 from a unit standpoint.","","Operator","Mark McKechnie from Evercore, please go ahead with your question.","","Mark McKechnie - Evercore","Thanks. Couple of questions. One for Steve, how big has your connectivity business grown to and maybe you could talk a bit about the tax rates, the MSMs versus how many standalone connectivity solutions you have?","","Steven Mollenkopf","Sure. Mark, if you look at our business, the connectivity business, I mentioned earlier that it was actually a record quarter in June for it. And now it\u2019s also not just a cellular connectivity business, it includes consumer electronics as networking in that as well. So, it\u2019s actually a little bit more diversified than probably what people think. Now, that being said, on the phones side, we have been I think done a good job in terms of getting pull-through for our connectivity solutions either through integrated or through standalone on our mid-tier and low-tier platforms. I gave some comments last year actually about how strong that was in terms of a tax rate.","What we are starting to see and one of the things we are excited about is that now we are starting to see Tier 1s start to use the products. And we think that\u2019s an on-ramp one of the necessary or first steps to getting us into the flagship devices as well. And that will be I think it\u2019s a long road to ahead of us on that, but we see the first signs of success there. We also believe that our integration story, which has served us well with RF, power management, Bluetooth and GPS will also serve us well in the connectivity space as well. So, we are continuing to invest in that area. We are bullish about it long-term.","","Operator","Romit Shah from Nomura, please go ahead with your question.","","Romit Shah - Nomura","Steve, you mentioned that your share of content improved in the quarter the factor driving chipset ASPs up, I know that it\u2019s coming down a little bit here in the September period, but can you just give us more color on what\u2019s driving that? And would you expect chipset ASPs to continue to grind higher after this period? I just wanted to also ask about LTE competition, Broadcom indicated yesterday that their LTE solution will be pushed out to the second half of next year. So, your assessment of the competitive landscape and how big of a lead do you guys think you have today? And then just finally for George, you mentioned on the buyback that you guys are being opportunistic here in July, the stock price, it feels like it\u2019s been out of favor for most of the years, so I am just curious what was it or what are you guys seeing here in July that pushed you to be more opportunistic with the share buyback? Thank you.","","Steven Mollenkopf","Romit, maybe I will start with the LTE question first. Yes, I think that\u2019s probably an accurate view of what we are seeing. If you look at our feedback from the OEMs, it seems like we don\u2019t see anyone sort of knocking on the door in the near-term door, kind of with the feature set they were already delivering. As you know we are on our third-generation and we\u2019re going to continue to move that forward into next year. So it looks like people are having trouble ramping this year or last year's feature set and we\u2019re going to be delivering next year's feature set next year. So we think we\u2019re continuing to be strong in the LTE space. I would point to people to the importance of a SoC strategy in LTE and essentially that\u2019s in the flagship tier you need to be able to deliver solutions in the developed world. The developed world because the spectrum constraints really needs to embrace LTE Advanced next year and should you be able to produce a product like that and compete with us on a modem space you will also need to do that in an integrated SoC which means that you need to make sure that you have a world-class application process and connectivity and graphics and we think we\u2019re differentiated across all of those vectors and certainly if you put them together we feel quite strong. On the first question I actually forgot what it was, could you remind me please?","Share content, yes, thank you. On share count essentially what\u2019s happened we\u2019re growing our position in the phone, as I\u2019ve mentioned on previous call sometimes that comes at less gross margin percentage than our traditional modem business but it comes at more dollars and I think a good growth business for us if you have seen in the year-over-year numbers, plus you\u2019re seeing some of that. We also from time to time are able to collect essentially value-added software fees for additional functionality that we can sell alongside the chip and you start to see that sometimes I move around from quarter-to-quarter.","So all in all I think it's a strong story for us although from a dollar perspective but not at the traditional gross margin percentages that you saw in the traditional model business but a good business for us.","","George Davis","Let me just cover your question on again on share buyback. What I talked about when I was using the term opportunistic it was really in response to the question, that the company has valued an opportunistic strategy over time and I still believe that to be the case. The decision to start purchasing in Q3 was clearly coming out of the earnings call, although the stock reacted and came down, and we felt it was an extremely attractive time to start buying back shares. So it kind of goes beyond opportunistic and really a view of valuation and again I think you can see from the Outlook and from performance in the quarter that the company is performing strongly, we think it's a good time to be buying.","","Operator","Rod Hall from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","","Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities","So I wanted to see Steve if you can comment again, I mean a question was asked earlier on WiFi, there have been some varied blog reports and so on suggesting that you guys have had some pretty good sized WiFi wins for standalone chips with the big vendors and I just wonder if you can comment on whether there has been anything I think the basic situation has been that the underlying driver software favored another large vendor that kind of dominates that space and that\u2019s why we hadn\u2019t seem as much attach. I wonder if you can comment on whether there has been any change there, do you think that there are more software support that might enable people to use the onboard Snapdragon connectivity solution as we move forward more.","I just be curious to get your comment on that. And then the other thing that I would like to get you guys to comment on is we have got these new replacement programs coming out from U.S. Carriers and there is a lot of speculation over whether that means people (inaudible) or replace more. I just wonder if you can comment on your thinking there, do you think it will impact consumer behavior at all and if so how does it impact it. Thanks.","","Steve Mollenkopf","On the connectivity piece essentially we\u2019ve been working quite hard to bring both the maturity and the feature set of our wireless LAN solution up to what is would be considered a leadership of position. We think we\u2019re at that point now, we have been able to also exploit a one of the benefits of our platform which essentially is that we have had the 11ac or end solution which is the 3660 and it\u2019s pin-for-pin compatible with the 36.80. So, I think it\u2019s been somewhat of misunderstood, but we are actually at the lead in terms of mobile AC. And it\u2019s a very easy migration for people to have. So, we do, I think quite well at the mid-tier in terms of design win percentages, and I think that\u2019s a great on-ramp to convince people that at the flagship tier can be used as well. And as I said earlier, those things won\u2019t switch overnight, but I think the integration story is quite strong on this technology as it is with many technologies. It\u2019s just the right thing to move the customer in that direction.","The other things, remember as well, is that eventually the modem, the wireless WAN modem and the wireless LAN modem actually have to coordinate to manage interference and manage offload in a very coordinated way. That particularly becomes important as networks get more dense. So, over time, the good technical reasons of integration are augmented by just that\u2019s the way the system is going to need to work to be successful. So, that\u2019s a good trend for us.","","Derek Aberle","Rod, this is Derek. Obviously, it\u2019s early days, and we\u2019ll have to see how some of these new programs play out, but I think our view is generally positive that they should have a positive impact on replacement cycles. There has been some concern about whether operators are going to step back a bit from subsidies and given the smartphone penetration that is in some of the developed regions. And I think we are going to see I believe we\u2019ll continue to see a number of different kinds of programs that will help drive replacements. If you look at AT&T, I think they just announced results and they said 35% of their smartphone users are on LTE, which is still relatively low and yet they are seeing higher data usage across the LTE subscribers. So, you would think that the operators will continue to be motivated even with the smartphone penetration where it is to drive replacement cycle. So, we will see how these play out, but I think generally a positive development.","","Operator","James Faucette from Pacific Crest, you may go ahead with your question.","","James Faucette - Pacific Crest","One quick question and a more elaborate question I guess on China, first quick question is that you mentioned and you would expect channel inventories to come down during the course of the September quarter even though you expect them to remain in their typical range, can you just talk about quickly where you think channel inventories or how big do you think channel inventories developed during the June quarter? And then on China, you mentioned that you expect to start to ramp into China Mobile for their testing later this quarter and to the end of this year, how are you thinking about the actual activation of the commercial network for TD LTE and its timing? And what about the other carriers and their eventual move to 4G and how you think about the chipset share opportunity on those migrations? Thank you very much.","","Derek Aberle","So, on channel inventory, the channel inventory peaked in our second fiscal quarter or the first calendar quarter in the 15-week to 16-week range. We saw it come down about a week in our fiscal third quarter and we think it will come down at least another week and a half or so in our fourth fiscal quarter. So, pretty continuous decline since the peak of Q2.","","Steven Mollenkopf","With respect to LTE in China, we are being driven quite hard to start supporting what are I think very large scale trials at the end of this year. And also as I understand the Spectrum situation, from a government perspective, has been a lot more clarity given over the last month or so with respect to that. So, we expect that to start in the second half of this year. And then I would expect the other carriers to follow I think it will start in LTE-TDD in China Mobile and then following the other carriers. But again, it\u2019s very difficult to predict what happens in China, but we are being pushed hard in that direction.","","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.

The playback reservation number is 13692366.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mauricio Lopez-Hodoyan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Lopez-Hodoyan, please go ahead.","Mauricio Lopez-Hodoyan","Thank you. And good afternoon everyone. Today\u2019s call will include prepared remarks by Steve Mollenkopf and Dave Wise. In addition, Cristiano Amon, Alex Rogers and Don Rosenberg will join the question-and-answer session.","You can access our earnings release and a slide presentation that accompany this call on our Investor Relations website. In addition, this call is being webcast on qualcomm.com. And a replay will be available on our website later today.","During the call, we will use non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G. And you can find the related reconciliations to GAAP on our website. We will also make forward-looking statements, including projections and estimates of future events, business or industry trends, or business or financial results.","Actual events or results could differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K, which contain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","And now to comments from, QUALCOMM's Chief Executive Officer, Steve Mollenkopf.","Steve Mollenkopf","Thank you, Mauricio. And good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We executed well this quarter, against challenging industry conditions. Despite weakening demand for our 4G solutions, fiscal third quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.80 per share was at the high end of our guidance range, driven by improved product margins, lower R&D and SG& A and a lower tax rate.","In QTL, following the district court's ruling, our licensees continue to perform under their agreements. In parallel, at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, we are pursuing a partial stay in appealing the ruling. Of note, with a statement of interest of the Department of Justice in support of our stay motion, stating that Qualcomm is likely to succeed on the merits in the appeal.","The Huawei export ban, along with the pivot from 4G to 5G which accelerated over the past couple of months, has contributed to industry conditions particularly in China that we expect will create headwinds in our next two fiscal quarters.","As a result of the export ban, Huawei shifted their emphasis to building market share in the domestic China market, where we do not see the corresponding benefit in product or licensing revenue.","In addition, our customers in the China market are working through their existing 4G inventory and deemphasizing their second half 2019 4G launches, as they shift their priorities to their 5G launches in early 2020. As a result, we do not expect the typical seasonal benefits given this unique market dynamics.","For the first calendar quarter of 2020, we anticipate reaching the inflection point as our financial results begin to reflect the benefits of our substantial efforts over the years to bring 5G to the market worldwide.","Let me walk you through the dynamics of 5G rollouts. 5G network rollouts are progressing at a much faster rate when compared to 4G. We expect over 20 operators to launch 5G service and over 20 OEMs to have 5G devices in the first 12 months after the first commercial launch. This compares to four operators and three OEMs with the launch of 4G with the major difference being that China is launching 5G in the first year.","In China, 5G commercial service was officially approved in early June and our current estimate is that by the end of this year, the three operators will deploy roughly 100,000 5G base stations, which to put in context is the equivalent of the scale of the entire network of a large US wireless operator.","And in the US, 5G is being deployed across sub-6 and millimeter wave for nationwide coverage. Verizon has noted that they expect three quarters of the phones they are launching next year will be 5G.","AT&T announced that they are on track for a nationwide 5G coverage in midyear 2020 and we expect the proposed T-Mobile-Sprint merger to result in an accelerated nationwide 5G rollout. I would add, that we expect the millimeter wave to be a mandatory requirement at all major carriers in the United States.","Also helping to drive this accelerated transition to 5G is dynamic spectrum sharing which enables carriers to dynamically repurpose 4G spectrum for 5G use. DSS is a game changer for the carriers and will result in a much more rapid proliferation of 5G than we have seen in prior G transitions.","Before I talk about our products, I would like to remind you of our contribution to develop the fundamental elements of 5G including innovations that enable massive MIMO, millimeter wave, security and the deployment of 5G technologies in networks across broad spectrum allocations.","This early work has resulted in a valuable IP portfolio and provided us with an early insight into what products need to be developed and commercialized at scale. This will continue as 5G expands beyond Release 15 and the feature sets continue to evolve.","Today, we are the only chipset vendor that has 5G system level solutions spanning both sub-6, gigahertz and millimeter wave bands. This is key to global deployment. Our 5G system level solutions span baseband, transceiver, RF front end and antenna elements as the components are tightly coupled together for best in class performance spanning multiple KPIs including power area and modem benchmarks.","Let me now give us an update on our OEM traction. All of the major Android OEMs have announced 5G devices for this year and as volume ramps in early 2020; device offerings will expand beyond premium tier devices.","As an example, China Mobile plans to drive 5G devices to price points under a US dollar equivalent of $300 by the end of 2020, representing about 40% of the Chinese smartphone segment by price band. Our Chinese customers have recently made product portfolio decisions consistent with that carrier objective to drive 5G into lower price bands.","On the product side, our 5G design wins have doubled since our last earnings call. We now have over 150 5G designs launched or in development using our 5G chipsets. In addition to core chipsets, virtually all our 5G design wins are powered by our complete RF front-end solutions for 5G sub-6 and millimetre wave.","We are the only company today delivering an end to end comprehensive modem to antenna solutions. The complexity of 5G and the value of innovative solutions enables us to expand our ASPs significantly from 4G.","Turning to more detail on our legal matters. On July 8, we filed our motion for a partial stay with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. And as you may have seen, the Department of Justice on behalf of the United States filed a statement of interest that supports our request. We cannot predict the exact timing, but we expect the Court of Appeals to rule in our stay motion in the near future.","In the meantime, as can be seen from our results this quarter, licensees continue to perform under their agreements, consistent with our view, that the District Court decision does not nullify the existing license agreements.","On our appeal on the merits of the FTC matter, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals granted their request for an expedited briefing schedule. We expect briefing to be complete by the end of the calendar year. And the court has said it will schedule the case for oral arguments on the next available hearing date, after briefing is completed. With regards to Huawei, we continue to pursue a negotiated resolution of the dispute, focused on a final agreement.","Turning to QCT, on July 15, we announced our Qualcomm Snapdragon, 855 Plus mobile platform, providing about 1 billion mobile gamers, a leading flagship option for pro-like gaming devices.","Expanding on our China relationships, we are pleased to announce a strategic cooperation with Tencent, to deliver premium 5G and gaming experiences to consumers and developers in China and other regions. This cooperation includes joint efforts on Snapdragon-based mobile gaming devices, Snapdragon Elite gaming, cloud gaming, AR, VR and always-connected PCs. We continue to execute on our growth opportunities across automotive, AR\/VR, connectivity and networking and IoT. In compute, we are on track to see the first Snapdragon 8cx based designs, to launch in the second half of calendar year 2019.","In summary, while near term demand trends are not surprisingly soft as the entire market and industry transitions to 5G, we are very excited with our design wins and growth in device content as 5G ramps, particularly into 2020. Put simply, our position at the center of developing this incredible technology represents a large opportunity for our stockholders.","I would now like to turn the call over to Dave.","Dave Wise","Thank you Steve. And good afternoon, everyone. We delivered third quarter GAAP revenues of $9.6 billion which included $4.7 billion related to the settlement with Apple and its contract manufacturers.","GAAP EPS was negatively impacted by a $2.5 billion non-cash charge to income tax expense due to a write-off of a deferred tax asset, resulting from recently issued US tax regulations.","Our non-GAAP revenues were $4.9 billion despite top line softness. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.80 at the high end of our guidance range due to better QCT gross margins, lower combined R&D and SG&A expenses and a better-than-expected tax rate.","During the quarter, SG&A expenses benefited from a faster than expected reduction in excess litigation expense. QCT delivered revenues of $3.6 billion on 156 million MSM shipments, below the midpoint of our guidance range given a larger-than-expected impact from market weakness. QCT's EBT margin was 14% in line with our guidance reflecting improvements in both gross margins and lower operating expenses. ","QTL's third quarter revenues of $1.3 billion came in slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range, and included both current period Apple royalties and the last $150 million interim payment from Huawei. Our third quarter QTL results reflect the view that post the ruling in the FTC case, our licensing agreements remain enforceable and our licensees are expected to perform under their agreements which they have done to date. QTL's EBT margin was 70% above the high end of our guidance range on lower operating expenses due to a faster than anticipated reduction in excess litigation expense.","Turning to our outlook. As Steve mentioned, as we look forward over the next couple of quarters, our business is being impacted by several factors in advance of the transition to 5G in early calendar 2020. We see continued weakness in China demand, Huawei gaining share inside of China and our Chinese OEMs managing their inventory ahead of 5G.","We are lowering our estimates for global 3G, 4G, 5G device shipments in calendar 2019 by 100 million units to a range of 1.7 billion to 1.8 billion. We now expect handsets shipments to be down mid-single digits year-over-year.","In China, through the June quarter, while device shipments from handset makers into the carriers and retailers was down only 5%, the device sell-through from carriers and retailers to consumers was more pronounced, down approximately 20% year-over-year, reflecting in part a pause by consumers ahead of 5G and an uncertain macro environment. As a result, we have seen a meaningful build in channel inventory during the first half of calendar year 2019.","Over the next two quarters, we expect a significant impact on device shipment as sell-in and sell-through growth rates realign and channel inventory levels are drawn down in China.","In other regions including North America and Europe, we are seeing lengthening of handset replacement rates impacting unit volumes, as well as some softness in India and in non-handset devices.","Further, as a result of the trade dispute, our business is being impacted by a shift in OEM share towards Huawei as they increase their focus on domestic China sales and to a lesser extent by the loss of the direct sales to Huawei affected by the trade ban.","Lastly, we are seeing our Chinese OEMs respond to these factors by pulling back on new 4G device orders and managing their inventory in advance of the transition to 5G in early calendar 2020.","Turning to our fiscal fourth quarter guidance. We expect revenues to be in the range of $4.3 billion to $5.1 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.65 to $0.75. For QCT, we estimate MSM shipments to be in the range of 140 million to 160 million units, down 4% sequentially at the midpoint.","Historically, we have seen mid teens percentage growth in MSM shipments from our third to fourth fiscal quarter reflecting normal seasonal strength in the latter part of the year as OEMs build for the upcoming holiday season. The estimated lower MSM shipments in our fourth quarter are being impacted by the factors I just described.","The China related weakness is particularly impactful to QCT revenue subject to our leading position with a Chinese OEMs in the premium and high tiers. We estimate QCT's EBT margins for the fourth fiscal quarter will be 13% to 15%, flat sequentially at the midpoint. We estimate QTL revenues will be in the range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion with EBT margins of 62% to 66%, down sequentially versus the third quarter.","Our fourth quarter forecast does not include any revenues from Huawei with the last interim $150 million payment, recognized in the third quarter. Similarly to QCT, QTL is not seeing the seasonal uptick in our fourth fiscal quarter, reflecting weaker device shipments.","We expect non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expense to be down 1% to 3% sequentially, reflecting the absence of the catch-up and employee bonus expense that occurred in our third quarter offset by an increase in R&D spend.","We plan to remain disciplined around cost management and expect operating expenses to increase slightly from our fourth quarter run rate as revenues ramp through fiscal 2020.","We estimate our fourth quarter a GAAP tax rate to be 16% and our non-GAAP tax rate to be 13%. We believe the 13% rate is a good proxy for both our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates going forward.","As an update on our share repurchase activity as of today, we have completed approximately 90% of the ASRs at an average price of approximately $64 per share. As a reminder, we expect to complete the ASRs in early September.","We are estimating 1.21 billion weighted average shares outstanding for the fourth fiscal quarter and expect to exit the fiscal year with approximately 1.16 billion shares outstanding post the completion of the ASRs.","Looking beyond the quarter, we expect these market headwinds impacting our business to continue through the remainder of the calendar year and expect our revenues and earnings in our fiscal first quarter of 2020 will be in a range similar to our fourth quarter forecast.","We are optimistic that 5G will be a catalyst to market improvement with broader rollouts of 5G networks globally, including the US, China, Europe, Korea, Japan and Australia. We expect 5G device volumes to ramp more meaningfully in early calendar 2020 with new flagship device launches from global and Chinese OEMs supporting 5G.","In QCT, as we transition to 5G, our addressable dollar content opportunity per device is up to 1.5 times greater than a comparable 4G device, given greater chipset complexity and our ability to capture 5G RF front-end content.","We remain confident in the incremental $2 of EPS related to the longer term contribution from the agreements signed with Apple as product shipments ramp. And one final comment, we will be hosting an Analyst and Investor Day in New York on November 19 this year. Please stay tuned for further details.","Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mauricio.","Mauricio Lopez-Hodoyan","Thank you, Dave. Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","James Faucette","Great. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask, you\u2019ve mentioned that a couple of different forces that are impacting demand for QCT right now, both Huawei's more internal focus on China as well as pause in demand ahead of 5G.","Can you talk a little bit about how that is impacting, not only unit volumes but the pricing and mix currently? And then how you're looking at the impact on at least qualitatively your anticipation for 5G volumes et cetera next year, especially since we seem to be coming off of a lower base?","Then as a follow-up, can you just talk a little bit more and give a little more color on how you may be handling any requests for renegotiation for the FTC ruling and what the roadmap is that you\u2019ve laid out for those licensees in terms of treating those requests and dealing with compliance in the interim? Thank you.","Dave Wise","This is Dave. Let me start and Cristiano will jump in. So if you think about the dynamics in the market we called down the market 100 million units, a meaningful portion of that is related to China where we\u2019re seeing softness. We referenced in the comments the sell-through market to consumers being down 20% year-over-year through the first half of calendar \u201819 and our sell-in down 5%. So we see the back half of the year, a conversion of those growth rates so the sell-in rates coming down more aggressively in the back half of the year.","That in the back half of the year is compounded by some runoff of channel inventory that's been built up over the first half as well. And so some pronounced impacts on really Q3 with respect to the channel inventory runoff. And so we think that the market dynamics in the market units flow out a little bit in Q3 and then hitting our Q4 and our fiscal Q1 as those dynamics play out.","And the way to think about how that impacts the business is first you think about QCT. We typically would see from a seasonal perspective maybe a 15% to 17% increase in MSM shipments as we move from Q3 to Q4. I mean, obviously, we guided down 4%.","So if you think about jumping off from 156 million MSMs in Q3 that gap from what we normally expect to see is about 35 million units. About two thirds of that is market related with China being a meaningful component of that. I would point out that a lot of the China dynamics and certainly the things related to pause before 5G are more premium and high tier dynamics that are more impactful from a revenue perspective for us.","And the other third would be really share shifts, there's OEM share shifts towards Huawei away from some of our OEMs, as well as a little bit of a share loss at the low tier, but that's not really sort of financially impactful. So that's I think the way to think about the impacts on the next quarter to hear.","Cristiano Amon","Jim, this is Cristiano. Just to add some additional color. So building what Dave had said, if you remember I think China got authorization to launch 5G back in the June. And so there was a lot of uncertainty whether they will launch or not given the environment they did the launch.","And what we\u2019re seeing to some counterintuitive, but actually building confidence on the 5G transition as we had some of the OEMs cancel some of the 4G launches and moving their portfolio towards 5G designs. We\u2019re seeing a lot of requests for pulling in and we see preparing for the 5G ramp at the next selling season. And one we do have this I would say onetime impact as Huawei demand got suddenly reduced in Europe there we saw an increased focus of Huawei in China. That kind of changed the OEM mix.","But the general sentiment and that's what we're seeing in the activity is to drive as fast as possible to the 5G ramp as we bleed this inventory on the premium and high end channel and we see 5G ramping across multiple tiers as Steve said even at the price points of $300 and above.","Alex Rogers","Jim, this is Alex. On the second part of your question, how we're handling requests for renegotiations. As you may have seen we had a number of request for renegotiations coming. We've also had license agreements that were in the process of renegotiation recently.","And with respect to those requests, we\u2019re ensuring essentially what we call a FRAND process that the licensee has an opportunity to drive to a fair reasonable and non-discriminatory result in any license agreement that's ultimately reached.","And so we\u2019re engaging as we always do very thoroughly with licensees to try to get to a process that recognizes the value of our portfolio. We think -- which we think is a very, very good as 5G ramps.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Caso","Yes. Thank you. I guess first question is on the sell-through versus the sell-in expectations over the next couple of quarters and understand what you guys said on the revenue expectations for you that take into account some of the inventory adjustment that's going on.","What are your expectations for sell-through? Does it stay at this sort of down 20% year-on-year rate as we get into the 5G transition at the beginning of next year? What's embedded in the guidance?","Steve Mollenkopf","Yeah. Essentially what's in our guide is we\u2019re not expecting to sell-through to remain low through the rest of the calendar year reflecting as we said sort of some of the macro environment, but also really some of the pause before 5G ramps more meaningfully next year.","So we expect that to remain low and then the sell-in to start to converge towards that over the remainder of the year. And then that's just as we said compounded by the fact that there's been some channel inventory build - built in the first half that will bleed off that\u2019s more of a Q3 probably factor.","Chris Caso","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. As a follow-up, I guess we all understand that you're hoping to get a stay in the FTC ruling. Could you lay out for us what the contingency plans are in the event that a stay is not granted? What are the steps that would need to be taken and what would be the financial impact of having to take those steps before appeal is finally decided?","Don Rosenberg","Hi. Chris, this is Don Rosenberg. As you know, we are smack in the middle of the Court of Appeals reviewing our motion for a stay. So we\u2019re limited in what we can say about that. But I should point out, I don't think it's missed your eyes that it's fairly widespread consensus that Judge Koh\u2019s order is erroneous in many, many respects. And the fact that United States, the Justice Department through the - with the support of the Department of Defense and Department of Energy have filed a brief - statement of interest rather in support of our motion to stay, in which among other things they objected both to the remedy, but also indicating that they think we\u2019re going to be successful on the merits.","In addition the Court of Appeals has expedited their review of our appeal on the merits. And so I think we\u2019re very encouraged by this kind of support, we think as I said that there is a widespread view that our chances are very good. So we\u2019re at the point where we want to wait for that decision on the stay and then proceed from there.","Alex Rogers","This is Alex. I\u2019ll just add very quickly. One of the, I think fundamental points that can't be missed is that the current agreements are valid and enforceable even the FTC has waited and said that the agreements are not nullified, and so that's very important.","In addition we have a couple of what I would call anchor agreements that are very good agreements that we're quite happy with and that's Samsung and the recently signed Apple agreement. And as I said our IP position is very, very strong through 4G and ramping into 5G.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Blayne Curtis","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could comment on Apple purchased Intel's modem and then as you think longer here, it sounds like Huawei's focusing more on post this ban \u2013 attempted ban here, focusing more internal on their modem. I know you shift to a portion of that, so I'm kind of curious.","Any view on how this Apple purchase affects the $2 you guys talked about? And then can you just comment on Huawei and if they gain share and do more in-sourcing, the opportunities for you as you go into 5G?","Steve Mollenkopf","Blayne this is Steve. I'll handle the first one and Christiano I think is going to jump in onto Huawei question. I would say in terms of the recent news flow, it's really - I think that was pretty highly anticipated. It was clearly anticipated in the agreement that we did. Remember we did two agreements a patent license agreement as well as a product agreement, multiyear product agreement.","We don't see anything changing in terms of our ability to deliver on those agreements and we think it still remains a pretty competitive at least attractive competitive dynamic for us when you look at industry and our roadmap versus others even after those agreements expire. And I think very clearly in answer to your question we don't see any impact to the $2 number that we have put out there.","Cristiano Amon","Hi. This is Cristiano. So on the Huawei, Huawei has been in a number of years that their premium and high tier has been focused on their own. And I think our shipments to Huawei so kind of that mid-to low tier pair. But I look at the Huawei focus on China a little different; I think it creates an opportunity for our customer base coming out of China companies like Vivo, Oppo, OnePlus, and Xiaomi, outside China especially in Europe that's accretive to us especially in the 5G transition. And we look that opportunity is probably permanent not one-time. I think the interest on the European carriers have been very high.","And when some data came out that we\u2019re very pleased that show since we're kind of generations ahead on our 5G chip, I think the latest report show that the Huawei modem is at least 50% bigger in area than the first generation QCT.","I think, we had compete with many other companies throughout the years and we\u2019re optimistic about that lead we have in 5G. And hopefully, that will drive a good transition for us to look for customers in China including competing with Huawei in domestic China as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Samik Chatterjee","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to start off with - kind of question on 5G. You're clearly excited about your position in 5G, but as you kind of think about the impact on the smartphone industry you\u2019re expecting volumes to improve, but lowering the cost of solution also there\u2019s probably going to a big driver. So how you are seeing kind of the progress on that front?","And just as a follow-up, I think you mentioned kind of plenty of operations you expect to launch 5G. Can you just help us think about the mix of sub-six versus millimetre wave?","And you mentioned you would expect the millimeter wave to be mandatory kind of what's driving your view there given what we hear is the infrastructure is not really ready to support millimeter-wave in most geographies yet? Thanks.","Steve Mollenkopf","Samik, this is Steve. Maybe I'll take the first one and Cristiano will jump in a bit on the RF components. I would say, I look at the 5G rollout in general has a higher intensity and a more global nature than what we saw even in 4G. So the pressure that we are getting to accelerate not only the premium tier, but also higher tier devices is pretty amazing.","If you were to look China Mobile came out with a data point that said essentially RMB 2,000 devices roughly $300 phone that will be where they're going to target the 5G line next year pretty substantial by the end of the year. That's pretty substantial move.","I would expect at the beginning of the year, which is what really focused on right now, you'll start to see that line be somewhere close to the RMB 3,000 so roughly $430 price point. That's pretty significant actually.","And it's anticipated in our roadmap in terms of our integration. You may have seen us and remember that we have talked about how we have been moving our 5G into an integrated roadmap even more quickly than we did in 4G.","Now two things happened to us that I think are beneficial in addition to just a good a dynamics that happen when you have transitions in technology. One is because the complexity of 5G goes up the ASP of the baseband, we tend to have an attractive move just from the ASP baseband alone tier-to-tier. So 4G same tier to 5G same tier. The ASP the baseband is good for us.","Secondly, we see a strong opportunity in the RF to grow the content of the device. As you know, we have had strong traction there in part because of the importance of wrapping the system design around the antenna.","You will see consistent with the design that I mentioned or the feature that I mentioned dynamic spectrum sharing you'll see an opportunity to extend of those 5G RF design opportunities into the legacy 4G bands as they are effectively dynamically reformed with that feature.","So we see a continued roadmap for us to continue \u2013 to grow content per device and that's why we've been investing so heavily to put that in place. It's in a place now, and the real activity is for us is how quickly can we get this to ramp and can we do it worldwide. So we are pleased with that, I would say the dynamics. And we have a lot of visibility to that. We have a lot of confidence that we think that we'll be able to do it.","Alex Rogers","Hi. So Cristiano, just to answer your question on sub-6 and millimeter wave mix. So millimeter wave right now is a requirement across all the main carriers in United States. I think we saw phones again launch the millimeter wave, and in 2020, we'll see that in Korea and Japan.","So if you look at developed economies, I think of Japan market, Korea market and the States market require millimeter wave. That will be no high attached in terms of the total 5G volumes. But it's not stopping there.","So Europe that is launching with sub-6 millimeter wave has already been auctioned in Italy. And it is a now likely to get license in the UK as well. So 5G's really been designed for the combination of sub-6 and millimeter wave. And we are optimistic about millimeter wave attach increasing.","One other thing to mention is, sub-6 in general, we will see in \u201820 a lot of reforming on existing spectrum because of the dynamic spectrum sharing technology. So that also create opportunity for us to expand our RF front-end that today is focused on 5G, these new sub-6 bands and millimeter wave to also add the reform bands and so that's how we think about the RF.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Tal Liani","Hi, guys. When you say that there is slowdown in the 4G versus 5G, is it only China-specific? Or can give the global context of this comment? It's just hard for me to believe that there is any slowdown in Europe or the US because of 5G. So I want to understand it?","Second can you comment on relationship with Apple, post the acquisition of Intel's modem business by Apple? How do you view it? And what\u2019s - where do you see yourself kind of in the future playing with Apple, kind of how do you work with Apple, given that they're going to have a modem asset in-house? Thanks.","Dave Wise","This is Dave. I'll start. So let me start with China. So we are seeing a pause or a slowing in terms of 4G orders in advance of 5G in China. Really there is a number of \u2013 as we reference a number of dynamics going on in China right now. There is sort of a realignment of the sell-in towards the lower sell-through growth rate, so some compression on growth rate in the back half of the year, the channel inventory being drawn down. And so headwinds for the OEMs in terms of the market in the China in the back half of the year.","And then what we're seeing is an element of the softness in the sell-through market, really being attributable to more high and premium tier segments of the market pausing before 5G. So we are seeing that - some of that pause before 5G and a desire by some of our OEMs try to accelerate efforts to bring 5G into the market, so seeing that there. ","Outside of China we referenced lengthening replacement rates in developed markets like the US and Europe. And so, we think a little bit at play there as well in terms of some pause again at sort of the higher tiers in advance of 5G. ","Steve Mollenkopf","And Tal, this is Steve. With respect to Apple, I think the relationship is quite good what really characterizes it now is the 100% of the intensity is how do we get products out together. Very natural I think for both companies.","We and I think both sides really anticipated that there would be some announcement like you've seen. But it hasn't changed the way in which we move forward. We\u2019re used to that and the real effort is how do we get products out together and I think that's very healthy relationship.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Ross Seymore","Hey, guys. I want to talk about the 5G side. You're clearly excited about the first half of next calendar year. Can you talk a little bit through do you think it's going to be more of a unit demand environment where that's really going to rise? Or is it going to be more of a substitution effect there? And people on the sell side and buy side should more or less focus on that 1.5x increasing content that you talked about Steve?","Steve Mollenkopf","Yeah, Ross. I think as we look out over the next year and the transition to 5G, we don't really look at it in terms of being a unit growth story, where the market units increase. What we really see is in a flat market, the transition over to 5G creating an opportunity for us by the fact that our monetization per phone is going up as Steve referenced. We see high rates ASPs associated with the complexity as well as the capture of the 5G RF front-end content. So it's really more about of that as a growth driver for us as we head into the first calendar quarter next year and on into rest of fiscal 2020.","Cristiano Amon","Ross, this is Cristiano. I'd like to add the following. When you look at the first half just the launch of the 5G by the operators and how unlimited data plan starts to move to the 5G devices you'll see that replacement and with that you do see this 1.5 factor coming in as we grow content and RF front end.","Overtime, it\u2019s hard to make predictions, but we've seen it with every different a transition. Some of the service of every a video or gaming or streaming gaming starts to become more popular and device form factor changes for a larger screen. You could see the market growing faster than single-digit. But we're not making that assumption for 2020.","Ross Seymore","That's helpful. I guess as my follow-up question sticking with China theme in general, can you give us whether its your QCT revenues or the MSMs any sort of even rough estimates about the percentage of those that are associated with China, because the year-over-year growth rates you're talking about, or decline in this instance are quite acute.","I know in the September quarter you had 14 weeks last year and some of things have changed and you walked through the inventory dynamics. But even if I adjust for those, it seems like you're down a better part of 15%, 20% year-over-year. So to the extent China is such a larger exposure for you, can you just talk about how big is it?","And is there anything that you can do to help mitigate these sorts of booms and busts as we go into that first half of 2020, when the count with the 5G ramp could lead to the same sort of volatility?","Dave Wise","Yeah. A quick comment on year-over-year, so if you take a look at where we are year-over-year there's a couple of thing \u2013 couple of factors that affect the decrease, or the reduced level of revenues. One, I would remind you that last year there was significantly more Apple in our business versus the current quarters.","So that's a meaningful portion of the decrease in revenues on a year-over-year basis. We also had some low end share loss over the last year that had some contribution to the reduction as well, but Apple a big part of it in terms of QCT.","On the QTL side, just to highlight it in the year ago quarter we had $500 million from Huawei compared to $150 million in the current quarter. So, overall that contributes to the comparison also.","Steve Mollenkopf","And I will just add one - this is Steve. I would just add one I think you have an unusual event here, which was the reaction of Huawei to the ban and how it retrenched into China. And I think that was a very unusual share shift that obviously we got impacted probably more than other folks probably because the tiers and the OEMs that were impacted are ones that we tend to monetize.","We think that gets back into more normal position kind of snaps back the other way with the launch of 5G. And hopefully, wouldn't have a one-time event like that, but it should be more stable post that big ramp with 5G.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.","Matt Ramsay","Yes. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. A couple of additional question on China, one from each side of the business. I know Steve or Cristiano, I know you've talked a little bit about the Huawei retrenchment and the impact on QCT units. It's been topical that obviously China after the Huawei entity list stuff and other factors has maybe focused more as a country on indigenous development.","Have there been any movements for high silicon to supply any other OEMs in China or for OEMs broadly source from China? And then on the QTL side, since Judge Koh's ruling any change in compliance with Chinese OEMs outside of Huawei that we should note? Thank you.","Steve Mollenkopf","Thanks for the question. Look, I think the way to think about it, Huawei had a sudden change in their phone landscape, especially what happened with Europe. I think there was a drastic reduction in demand. And I think that causes them to be very focused on China, because that's the place they could be focused on.","I think the big picture answer to your question is China has many initiatives and their initiative in China is not only about China domestic market, but also the Chinese mobile system growth outside China. And what we have seen, it's - our relationship with China remains a very healthy and is expanding, and in addition to the relationship with Vivo, Oppo and OnePlus as they range in Europe, we recently signed an agreement with Tencent talking about content in 5G use case development.","And I expect that the relationship between QCT and China in the 5G era will continue to be healthy, because we help the expansion outside China. And that's how we look at. We don't see any signs today that the dynamic is changing.","Alex Rogers","And then this is Alex. On the QTL side, there was as we referenced one incident that would have affected the compliance and we engaged very rapidly on that take to it very seriously. But as you can see as we ended the reporting here we've got good compliance.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.","Stacy Rasgon","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the QCT trajectory. So, I know you talked about inventory flash and some of the weakness in everything else. But at the same time, if I look at your forward guidance on chipsets, I mean you've been missing for the last several quarters. So why all of a sudden is the inventories in a pause in front of the 5G versus just a continuation of the trend that we've already been seeing for the last three or four quarters?","And for my follow-up, I just want to know do you guys think 5G overall is accretive to licensing revenues? I mean, you lowered the rate when you included it you have the ASPs capped, it doesn't sound like you\u2019re looking for incremental unit growth for the market for 5G. So, how do we think about 5G's impact on the run rate of royalty revenues as it is today? Thank you.","Dave Wise","Hey, Stacy. So, with respect to QCT side, first of all, I would make the comment that stepping back over the course of this year, I think with the recent 100 million unit reduction, we've seen a sort of a continuing erosion in the handset market over the course of this year. So, this has been something that has been a headwind for the business I think for the last several quarters. And so I think that's been a dynamic that has been impacting MSM units as well as sort of the overall business.","I think what we saw this -- what we're seeing now is maybe a little more pronounced growth impacts on the back half of the year as again we go back to the sort of sell-through rates remaining down in China and the sell-through -- sell-in rates not yet aligned with that.","So realignment there -- the fact that they weren't aligned in the first half resulting in some channel inventory build. So, really more market dynamic in terms of pressure on units.","As we said a little bit of share loss at the low end, not financially significant. And then the more I would say unique situation was Huawei really entrenching and focusing on the domestic China market and really putting their attention there and grabbing significant share.","So, that little bit more of a unique situation to what we're seeing right now. But I would say a lot of it is really attributable to the market headwinds that we've been frankly seeing all year long.","And then QTL, with respect to how to think about that as a 5G as an upside a lot of the agreements we signed are for 4G -- 3G, 4G, 5G. And so really we look at it as just a continuation and extending of the monetization of the handset market as it evolves from 4G to 5G just like we did from 3G to 4G.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Mitch Steves","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just had a quick one just kind of turning back to the ASP as expected if we're going to ramp 5G faster. So I guess two parts. So, first does this mean that essentially we're going to see kind of a bigger pause in smartphones shipments and then to increase demand for the kind of 5G shipments out in 2020? And then secondly, if that's not the case, what should we think about as a kind of a normalized unit base for the smartphone industry at this point?","Steve Mollenkopf","Yes. In our comments when we talked about the 100 million unit reduction, we kind of gave a sense it's 1.7 billion and 1.8 billion units in total. We indicated that now translates into a handset market being down sort of mid single digits year-over-year.","And so if you look - if you step back over the last number of years, it's been relatively flat handset market, so down a little bit as we see some of this pause and some of the macro environment impacts affecting us. So we don't really see any sort of it changes in the overall unit market beyond the comments that we made.","Mitch Steves","Yes, just to clarify a quick, I heard you guys, did a good job as a question referring more to 2020, so essentially, if people are pulling down the numbers for this year. Does that mean essentially 2020 should be up like 7% or 8% to kind of offset those as more of a down year or is it too early to call that?","Steve Mollenkopf","Probably too early for us to call what we\u2019ll see in \u201820. But I think we would expect to as we said see an inflection beginning in the first calendar. So it will be our second fiscal quarter with 5G launches happening more significantly in China, as well as other flagship device launches at Mobile World Congress and things like that and then sort of a building over the course of the year as we think about moving towards really more flagship launches happening in the fourth fiscal quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Rod Hall","Yeah. Thanks for squeezing me in guys. Just a couple of things, I wanted to ask kind of deviate from all the demand staff and just ask you if you could update us on the CFO search kind of what the status of that is? And then I also want to come back to just the demand stuff, just to kind of clarify what your -- what information you're acting on?","So are you seeing - did you see deterioration of demand through the quarter? Could you just kind of talk to us about what sort of data points you've seen here and how they came to you? Did things weaken toward the end of the quarter or they just remained weak or kind of give us some idea what trajectory look like to you? Thank you.","Steve Mollenkopf","Rod hi, it's Steve. We continue to look nothing to announce right now. But we'll keep you updated.","Dave Wise","Then with respect to sort of how things have unfolded I guess more recently. So one I think we tracked like the CMMR Report. I mean, we track that like probably a lot of others in terms of watching what's happening with the sell-through. And so we've seen that continue to be down even through the June quarter with really no significant movement away from that trend.","And then we'll look at that relative to kind of where we see handset demand coming in with respect to sort of our own data points around the markets. And so we look at it from that standpoint.","We look at our demand profile is coming in from customers in QCT and factor that into the mix as well. And that's why we've seen some of the pullback that we talked about with respect to 4G units.","Cristiano Amon","This is a Cristiano. Like we - I think I've mentioned it before. We saw some phone model cancellations, which is on the 4G segment second half launch. So that's an indication they wanted to accelerate the 5G and that\u2019s unusual metric having the phone model cancellation on the 4G side.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Mollenkopf, do you have anything further to add before adjourning the call?","Steve Mollenkopf","Thank you. I just want to thank everyone for joining us today. And maybe just to the employees of Qualcomm, thank you for a good quarter. We have a lot of work ahead to launch 5G. It's a big opportunity for the company and look forward to the next several quarters. And a lot of work to do, but I think a great opportunity for us. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded July 25, 2018. The playback number for today's call is 855-859-2056. International callers please dial 404-537-3406. The playback reservation number is 39466129.","I would now like to turn the call over to John Sinnott, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sinnott, please go ahead.","John T. Sinnott - Qualcomm, Inc.","Thank you and good afternoon, everyone.","Today's call will include prepared remarks by Steve Mollenkopf and George Davis. In addition, Cristiano Amon, Alex Rogers, and Don Rosenberg will join the question-and-answer session. You can access our earnings release and a slide presentation that accompany this call on our Investor Relations website. In addition, this call is being webcast on qualcomm.com, and a replay will be available on our website later today.","During the call today, we will use non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G, and you can find the related reconciliations to GAAP on our website.","We will also make forward-looking statements, including projections and estimates of future events, business or industry trends, or business or financial results. Actual events or results could differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q, which contain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","And now for comments from Qualcomm's Chief Executive Officer, Steve Mollenkopf.","Steven M. Mollenkopf - Qualcomm, Inc.","Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone.","We reported very strong results this quarter, which I will comment on shortly, but first I want to update you on the status of the NXP transaction. As you've seen from our press release, pending any new material developments, we intend to terminate our agreement to acquire NXP at the end of the day.","The decision for us to move forward without NXP was a difficult one. Continued uncertainty overhanging such a large acquisition introduces heightened risk. We weighed that risk against the likelihood of a change in the current geopolitical environment, which we didn't believe was a high probability outcome in the near future.","In the end, we determined this was the best path forward for our customers, partners, employees, and stockholders. To say the least, the 21 months since we announced the NXP acquisition have been volatile. In spite of all the potential distractions, Qualcomm and NXP leadership remained focused on laying the foundation for the successful integration of our two companies.","I want to personally thank Rick Clemmer and his management team for being tremendous partners and compliment them on the excellent company they have built at NXP.","Consistent with our prior commitment to return capital that was previously earmarked for the NXP acquisition, our board has approved a new $30 billion stock repurchase authorization. We intend to execute on a large majority of the authorization by the end of fiscal 2019.","The rationale for the NXP acquisition was to accelerate our strategy of growing into adjacent opportunities where mobile compute was becoming ubiquitous. This strategy remains unchanged. Over the past two years, we continued to leverage the powerful industry dynamics of mobile everywhere. The results of these efforts are strongly evidenced in the growth of our adjacencies and RF front-end opportunities, which we estimate will contribute to our fiscal year, ending this September, approximately $5 billion in revenue, up more than 70% in the last two years.","In key industries like auto, our pipeline of awarded design wins has expanded dramatically this year to $5 billion, up $2 billion from January, as auto makers and Tier 1 suppliers leverage the strength of our roadmap and begin gearing up for 5G-enabled cars in 2021. Our infotainment solutions account for more than half of the $5 billion pipeline, just four years after we announced our entry in this category.","We've continued to gain share in Wi-Fi and have now achieved leading positions in several Wi-Fi segments. Our Snapdragon franchise has moved well beyond mobile devices, becoming the leading platform in areas like AR and VR, and is positioned to be a critical enabler in AI and machine learning at the edge. We are also transforming the notebook segment to a true smartphone experience and are growing our ecosystem of partners, including recently adding Samsung.","Our industrial IoT product revenues are also growing rapidly and are on track to double this fiscal year versus two years ago. We anticipate our addressable opportunity in the industrial IoT space to grow at approximately a 20% CAGR over the next few years, and we expect to exceed that growth for our industrial IoT revenues.","In the past two years, we brought forward 5G R&D spending to ensure Qualcomm's sustained leadership in the next generation of mobile technologies. Today, with every passing week, carriers around the world are announcing an expansion of their 5G rollouts, and we are a partner in nearly all of them. Our significant investment in 5G leadership will become even more tangible with the early rollouts and device launches in 2019 along with larger deployments in 2020 and beyond.","As a complement to our 5G modem leadership, our RF front-end technology will continue to be differentiated in the market, as we bring a systems approach to solve many of the technical challenges of delivering a 5G experience. This transition presents a win-win for us and our customers, enabling us the opportunity to grow our dollar share of content in mobile devices while lowering the total cost for handset OEMs.","With continued execution on our growth strategy combined with systematic cost discipline and capital return, we are very well positioned to drive shareholder return in fiscal 2019 and beyond. As you can see from our quarterly results, our business continues to perform well, and the timelines we have previously highlighted to resolve our licensing disputes remain unchanged.","Our fiscal third quarter results were very strong, with non-GAAP earnings per share $0.31 above the midpoint of our prior guidance range. Our results reflect continued strong execution across our businesses and continued focus on expense management.","In QTL, our third quarter results reflect a $500 million payment from the other licensee that is in dispute with us. This is a partial payment made while the negotiations continue for past royalties due going back to the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The payment does not reflect the full amount of royalties due under their existing licensing agreement, but we believe it is a positive step as we continue the negotiations in an effort to reach a resolution.","Also within QTL, we continue to make progress on signing agreements under our new 5G licensing framework. Recently, we have concluded more than 10 multiyear 5G multi-mode handset license agreements, including agreements with Xiaomi and Sharp, and we are in active negotiations with many more OEMs.","In QCT, we shipped 199 million MSMs in our third fiscal quarter, above the midpoint of our guidance range, reflecting stronger than expected demand in China due to the strength of our roadmap, particularly our 700 and 800 series Snapdragon solutions.","Looking ahead, our fiscal fourth quarter guidance reflects continued favorable trends in our businesses. We estimate calendar 2018 global 3G\/4G device shipments to be approximately 1.8 billion to 1.9 billion units, consistent with our prior forecast, and continue to see handset selling prices trending stronger than expected.","In QCT, demand for our Snapdragon 845 continues to grow, and we now have more than 130 Snapdragon 845 device designs in development. Consistent with our prior statements, we continue to see our key Chinese OEM partners leveraging our Snapdragon roadmap to improve their products in the domestic Chinese region and grow share in new regions, including Europe.","We have also seen very favorable third-party test results with our Snapdragon 845 and X16, X20 modems significantly outperforming other merchant modem solutions in premium-tier devices. We are also seeing further momentum supporting our RF front-end growth strategy and product differentiation, with four design wins of our complete modem-to-antenna solutions. Our gallium arsenide, MMPA, and module solutions have launched in customer premium-tier devices, with more key Tier 1 launches coming this calendar year.","We have also made two RF product announcements earlier this week, which are extremely important Qualcomm innovations to help solve the challenging, complex antenna requirements for 5G devices. We announced commercial shipment of the world's first commercial 5G New Radio millimeter-wave RF solution and also announced a fully integrated sub-6 GHz RF solution. These announcements further expand our industry-leading 5G product and technology position, and there are 18 network operators and 20 manufacturers who have selected our X50 5G modem for trials in 5G devices.","We are leading the industry to 5G commercialization next year and are pleased to see our OEM partners finalizing their 2019 5G smartphone launch plans. Qualcomm's chipsets are now the leading 5G development platform of choice for operators, infrastructure suppliers, and smartphone OEMs.","In closing, we are pleased to report very strong results this quarter and look forward to continuing to update you on our progress across the key strategic areas we have outlined for shareholders. This is a very exciting time for Qualcomm. With 5G approaching, our core technologies of advanced computing, connectivity, and security are continuing to drive growth and disruption in mobile, automotive, IoT, and networking.","I will now turn the call over to George.","George S. Davis - Qualcomm, Inc.","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I discuss our quarterly results, I would like to join Steve and thank the NXP team for their partnership and collaboration over the past 21 months.","Now turning to the quarter. We are pleased to report very strong fiscal third quarter results with revenue of $5.6 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $1.01. As Steve mentioned, these results reflect $500 million of revenue in QTL related to an interim payment with the other licensee in dispute. This is a partial payment made while the negotiations continue for past royalties due going back to the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and does not reflect the full amount of royalties due from the underlying license agreement or our expectations of royalties that will be due once the dispute is settled. The interim agreement provides for an additional $200 million, with $100 million paid in each of the next two quarters.","Non-GAAP EPS of $1.01 was $0.31 above the $0.70 midpoint of our guidance range. The partial payment accounted for $0.26, with the remaining $0.05 above the midpoint driven by favorable interest expense, tax rate, and QTL OEM mix during the quarter.","QCT earnings before tax was up 6% year over year, representing the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in EBT. EBT margin was 15%, at the high end of our guidance range, on higher volume and favorable product cost initiatives. In QCT, MSM shipments were 199 million, above our 195 million guidance midpoint, on stronger-than-anticipated demand from Chinese OEMs. QCT revenue for the quarter was $4.1 billion, flat on a year-over-year basis, reflecting strong demand from Chinese OEMs, offset by lower demand from Apple. In QTL, excluding the $500 million payment from the other licensee in dispute, revenue was modestly above the midpoint of our prior guidance range on mix.","QTL EBT margin was 72%, including the partial payment. Excluding the partial payment, EBT margin was 57%, coming in above our prior guidance range of 50% to 54% on OEM mix as well as lower-than-expected litigation expenses.","In our fiscal third quarter, non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A was up approximately 1% sequentially, in line with the midpoint of our guidance range.","In the fiscal third quarter, excess litigation expenses were approximately $140 million, and we expect litigation expenses to be similar next quarter, as the cases against Apple continue, including hearings in several of our patent infringement cases in the U.S., Germany, and China.","We continue to execute on our $1 billion cost plan, and as a result incurred approximately $110 million in restructuring costs, primarily related to severance and asset impairments. These items were excluded from our non-GAAP results. For fiscal 2019, we remain on track to reduce total operating expenses by $1 billion from our prior baseline of $7.4 billion.","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was a 6% benefit, lower than our prior expectations, reflecting the change in our estimates of U.S. earnings, principally due to the interim payment in QTL.","We returned approximately $1.9 billion to stockholders during the quarter, including approximately $900 million in dividends paid and $1 billion in stock repurchases. Our Q3 cash and marketable securities balance was $36 billion, which excluded $2 billion held to collateralize letters of credit for the NXP acquisition and $2.8 billion restricted for our recent redemption of acquisition-related debt. We ended the quarter with total debt outstanding of $22.5 billion.","Turning to our fiscal fourth quarter guidance, we estimate revenue to be in the range of approximately $5.1 billion to $5.9 billion. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $0.75 to $0.85 per share. We expect non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be flat sequentially, including the impact of an extra week in our fiscal fourth quarter. Excluding the extra week of operations, we estimate that non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses would be down mid-single digits percentage sequentially, in line with the timing of our cost program despite the ramp in 5G development activities.","We expect QTL revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. This revenue guidance includes the expected $100 million payment from the other licensee in dispute while negotiations are ongoing. We expect QTL's EBT margin to be between 58% and 62%.","It is worth noting that beginning in our fiscal first quarter of 2019, we will implement the new ASC 606 revenue recognition guidance. This requires that we estimate QTL royalty revenues each quarter rather than recognizing them one quarter in arrears, and then make revenue adjustments in the following quarters once actual amounts are reported by our licensees.","Accordingly, the September quarter results for our Licensing business will not be reported in our fiscal Q1 results, but will be recorded on the balance sheet into retained earnings, with offsetting entries in accounts receivable. And our first fiscal quarter will now reflect estimated December royalty revenues for our Licensing business, consistent with the absence of a one-quarter lag.","This change will alter QTL typical seasonality, as the busy holiday quarter for our licensees will now be recognized in our fiscal first quarter rather than our fiscal second quarter each year. Of course, the impact of our two disputes, in particular Apple, has also impacted seasonality over the past year given the absence of the usual impact of the flagship launches of these large OEMs.","Turning to QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments in the fiscal fourth quarter to be in the range of 205 million to 225 million units, up approximately 8% sequentially at the midpoint, on seasonality and strength of our roadmap with Chinese OEMs. We expect QCT EBT margin to be approximately 16% to 18%, up 200 basis points at the midpoint sequentially, on a favorable mix toward Snapdragon 700 and 800 tiers, partially offset by lower shipments to Apple. We believe Apple intends to solely use our competitors' modems rather than our modems in its next iPhone release. We will continue to provide modems for Apple legacy devices.","We expect that non-GAAP interest expense net of investment income will be approximately flat sequentially. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate for the fiscal fourth quarter and the full year to be approximately 2% expense.","As Steve mentioned, we expect to terminate the NXP transaction after today's end date, subject only to receipt of evidence of a material change of circumstances related to the deal. Termination will trigger payment of the $2 billion termination fee.","Consistent with our previously announced Plan B alternative, following the termination of the agreement, our board has authorized the purchase of up to $30 billion of stock, replacing the existing $10 billion authorization. We intend to execute on a large majority of the authorization by the end of fiscal 2019. Our repurchases will be funded almost entirely from balance sheet cash, and we will update you on the specific plans as we come to market. Our fourth quarter guidance does not include any impact of this new stock repurchase program or the impact of the $2 billion termination fee. The termination fee is expected to have approximately a $1.35 impact on GAAP earnings when recorded.","We remain committed to a strong balance sheet, maintaining a strong investment-grade rating, and to ongoing growth in our dividend over time.","That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to John.","John T. Sinnott - Qualcomm, Inc.","Thank you, George. Operator, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets, please go ahead with your question.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. I guess just a question on the NXP dynamic. I guess, Steve, how do you think about M&A to achieve what you really wanted to get out of NXP going forward? And is your sense that Qualcomm can't really do any deals till the global macro tariff issues improve, or do you think NXP was perhaps something unique that you couldn't do and you could still go do other deals? I just want to understand. How do you go about the divorce that you talked about with NXP?","And then on buybacks, how do we think about the pace, and how do you execute such a large buyback in a short timeframe?","Steven M. Mollenkopf - Qualcomm, Inc.","Amit, this is Steve. I'll take the first one. George, why don't you take the second half of that? So I'm not sure there was anything particular about this transaction or any engagement around the transaction. I think it's probably more a statement of the overall macro environment that everyone's operating in right now.","For us, I don't know if it signals any difference in terms of our ability to do things in the future. We are obviously from a capital allocation point of view obviously moving very rapidly into a stock buyback, which is where the focus is right now. But I don't know if I see anything closed down outside of the fact that it's just an unusual window, I think, for everybody involved in the industry right now.","George S. Davis - Qualcomm, Inc.","On the pacing of the buybacks, we'll come out with some information on that soon. But obviously, if we're going to get a large majority done within 2019, there will have to be some form of accelerated buyback as a part of that plan.","Operator","Mike Walkley from Canaccord Genuity, please go ahead with your question.","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Thanks, George. And just following up on the buyback and your guidance, is there any changes to the $5.25 in 2019 that you expect to generate assuming that the two licensing agreements are not settled? Can you maybe just walk us through the puts and takes towards getting towards that number, if that's still the case?","George S. Davis - Qualcomm, Inc.","Let me just give you an update. So first off, we've not changed our FY 2019 guidance. And as a reminder, resolution of our licensing disputes will be critical to our $6.75 to $7.50 objective. And if you think about the legal milestones that we've talked about in the past in support of driving these disputes towards resolution, we believe those milestones are on track and fundamentally unchanged.","In terms of the timing and impact of the share repurchase accretion relative to NXP, obviously the share repurchase will depend on the timing of when the shares come in. It will also depend on the timing of the licensing resolution. You can get to actually a higher number than the NXP accretion that we talked about for 2019 of $1.50 with share repurchase. But of course that requires the licensing disputes to be completed. So right now, no change in our outlook of $6.75 to $7.50. On the $5.25, we'll have to look at really what the timing is on the share repurchase and the implications of that.","Operator","Tim Long from BMO Capital, please go ahead with your question.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you, just two, if I could. First, a lot of talk about 5G. Could you just update us on what you think that will mean to the Qualcomm model for both the chip and royalty businesses as far as ASP increases or market share gains you think that would result in?","And secondly on the chip business, it sounds like with thin modems going down and a pretty favorable mix, I'm assuming you're expecting a pretty good ASP and probably gross margin move the next few quarters. If you could, discuss that a little bit. Thank you.","Cristiano R. Amon - Qualcomm, Inc.","Hi, Tim. This is Cristiano. So I'll start with the 5G chip, and I'll shift to Alex for the license, and then we can come back and talk about the modem. We're very happy with what we've seen in 5G right now. 5G is accelerating. I think we said there are a large number of operators. And I can say that all of our Snapdragon 800 OEMs today are planning to launch a 5G device smartphone in 2019. I think that positions us well. It's early ramp of a technology. But while we have seen revenue generations, I think if we are in a good leadership position as the market moves, it could be a significant event in the later part of 2019 and 2020. And as you would expect, we see an opportunity for both revenue and margin expansion on the chip business.","Alexander Rogers - Qualcomm, Inc.","So this is Alex. On the QTL side, the 5G transition is very good for the QTL business. We have a strong IP leadership position, including within the standards arena and standard essential patents. We're also very well positioned with the licensing framework that we rolled out, as evidenced by the over 10 license agreements that we have just recently signed. And so we think that we're in a very good position for long-term stability through the 5G transition.","George S. Davis - Qualcomm, Inc.","Tim, on the gross margin, as you think about Q4, probably the biggest single impact pulling margin down is the absence of the other licensee payment which came in. What we're seeing is, despite lower Apple business, both quarter over quarter and year over year, you're seeing strength in the 700 and 800 tiers in China in the chip business, and that's actually really moderated what otherwise would have been a more difficult margin story.","Operator","Chris Caso from Raymond James, please go ahead with your question.","Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yes, thank you. Just a question on the 606 adoption and how that affects fiscal 2019 guidance. Was that already incorporated in the fiscal 2019 guidance that you have provided previously? Because I guess my understanding, as I'm thinking it through, is it would be a benefit to the fiscal first quarter against prior assumptions because that would capture the strong season. Am I thinking about that correctly?","George S. Davis - Qualcomm, Inc.","606 was always in our estimates for 2019. And really, if you think about it, it just affects the shape of the year, not the size of the year. You get all four seasonal quarters in.","Operator","Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research, please go ahead with your question.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Bernstein Research","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. First on the timing of the buyback, if the buyback was supposed to give $1.50 for the full year, but it's going to take you through the full year to actually execute on it, how does it give you the full $1.50 in 2019?","For my second question, the $100 million in revenue you have built into your guidance for next quarter and the quarter after, is that $100 million representative at all of your expectations for the run rate following settlement? And effectively, did you take down your QTL revenue guide? It used to be $1 billion to $1.1 billion. Now it's $1 billion to $1.2 billion, but it includes an additional $100 million. So it looks like ex-that $100 million, the core business was taken down. Is that in fact the case, or is that just some sort of seasonal or other issues that are going on? Thank you.","George S. Davis - Qualcomm, Inc.","Yeah. Let me maybe just start on the back end of it, on the numbers with respect to the $100 million. And maybe, Alex, after I'm finished with the answer, you can jump in. But the $100 million really does not represent a change, or the $1 billion to $1.2 billion guide is really not a change. We said that depending on seasonal factors, we expect to be roughly between $1 billion and $1.1 billion each quarter. And as you know, we're seeing the more seasonally weak quarter, although, quite frankly, a lot of the seasonality has come out as we look at the year because we're missing some of those flagship launches. So, the absolute market is generally pretty flat relative to that period. So, I think, overall, you're actually seeing a little bit better mix from QTL along with the $100 million.","In terms of the buyback, really you're going to need the \u2013 you would be below $1.50 absent any resolution, and you could be well above $1.50 with resolution, which is the dynamic between the accretion that would come from a full year of NXP with the synergies in place and the share repurchase program, no real change in the math.","Alexander Rogers - Qualcomm, Inc.","So, this is Alex. Really quickly, the $100 million in the quarter does not set an expectation for the licensing revenue should there be a resolution to the negotiation process. That is just a partial payment, but it does not reflect what's owed under the agreement.","And as we said before, we're in active negotiations. And this is just a partial payment, and the negotiations are ongoing. As long as we think the negotiations are heading in a positive direction, we'll keep driving them. And we think this payment is a good faith indication that they are heading in a positive direction.","Operator","James Faucette from Morgan Stanley, please go ahead with your question.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Steve, I wanted to ask you a big picture question back on the decision-making process, and hopefully we can help interpolate a little bit into how you're thinking about the future. But wonder if you could give a little more color as to where you saw the opportunity cost of continuing to wait for China to go through its process and, as you described it, that political window to change maybe back more favorably. How are you thinking about the opportunity cost of continuing to wait, and why make the decision to move on now? And how should we be thinking about that and how you're thinking about the future opportunities for Qualcomm, particularly in some of these new areas that you're pursuing? Thanks.","Steven M. Mollenkopf - Qualcomm, Inc.","Sure, James. So, I think the situation \u2013 a quick reminder. We signed the agreement about 21 months ago. We also had already extended the agreement once. And I think very good discussions, by the way, with the regulators worldwide and, in particular, in China.","It was very clear to us that the macro environment was a very difficult macro environment to get something of this size through. And it was not clear that that was going to change in the future dramatically, particularly in the time window that we saw that we had to really move, and I'd say move toward two things. One is, I think, the company needs to focus on the opportunities that are ahead. I think that's important. The other aspect is we just need to provide certainty, not only to our partners and shareholders, but also to the employees as to where we're going. And we looked at that all together in a big mix and basically decided the right thing to do was to move on. We obviously have some time left on the clock here today, to be exact, but hopefully that helps you understand where we're headed.","I think you should also view it as a statement of what we feel very good about the business, where we're headed and the forward aspects, and we want to move on and really deliver that to shareholders, as we said we would.","Operator","Romit Shah from Nomura Equity, please go ahead with your question.","Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet","Yes, thank you. George, going from 14 weeks in September to 13 weeks in the calendar fourth quarter, do you anticipate any impact to MSM shipments? Is that something we should contemplate?","And then can I just ask you about Apple and your thin modem share? Do you guys believe that you're locked out of that account indefinitely? What will it take for Qualcomm to win back that business? Thank you.","George S. Davis - Qualcomm, Inc.","Really, what we see with an extra week is more the purchasing dynamics and decisions tend to be more indifferent to whether there's an additional week in the quarter or not. It's really around timing of launches. So it's really the \u2013 we're seeing the major effect on the cost side of the extra week, really of the run rate.","Cristiano R. Amon - Qualcomm, Inc.","Hi, this is Cristiano. Talking about your question on Apple, look, this is a very dynamic industry. I think we've been very clear, and we don't expect to be in the next product launch, and we'll continue to support them with the legacy. And I think those are decisions that are made as the industry moves and design by design.","I think we continue to be focused on technology. We feel pretty good about our modem leadership. I think we disclosed there are some very interesting, I think, third-party customer reports that show our performance, and we will continue to be investing on the modem. And if the opportunity presents itself, I think we will be a supplier of Apple.","Operator","Matt Ramsey from Cowen, please go ahead with your question.","Matthew D. Ramsay - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you very much, good afternoon. Steve, I wanted to ask a little bit about the adjacencies. One of the big thesis points of doing the NXP transaction was to give you guys or sort of jump-start the scale, particularly in automotive and the micro-controller IoT businesses. And now that the deal seems to be off the table, if you could, talk a little bit about the scale that you currently have in the adjacent businesses that you're ramping and how you think about that competitively without getting NXP done. Thank you.","Steven M. Mollenkopf - Qualcomm, Inc.","Matt, I think maybe I'll differentiate it. The answer depends on which market you're in. So I think in the automobile segment, we already feel that we're a pretty large player. We benefited from the fact that we are strong in the technologies that are defining many of the new use cases, in particular telematics and the connected car through telematics as a product line, but also in our infotainment business. So we feel today we already have significant scale. Obviously, we'd have a much stronger scale with NXP, and we liked the transaction as a result. But our auto business is already a significant business, as I mentioned, $5 billion backlog and growing. So we're pleased with that, and I think we're well positioned in the technologies that will define the key excitement in the future as well.","In IoT, again, I think we're in the right place with the core technologies and the technologies that the industry is working toward. We do not have as strong an organic channel as would be brought to us by the NXP transaction. It's growing and it contributes to the business today, but we're going to have to augment that a bit here in the future. We hope to also move forward on that, but also deliver on the stock buyback in the interim as well. So this is a two-pronged capital allocation perspective I think from the company, but we feel lucky and pleased to have a strong position in the technologies, which we think are the key technologies to winning in those markets long term.","Operator","Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank, please go ahead with your question.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for letting me ask a question. Steve, just a follow-on to that is the first part of my question. How do you reconcile the $1 billion of cost-cutting where there's a number of press reports saying that adjacencies are exactly where the trimming is occurring with your goal to diversify?","And then my second question, which is somewhat unrelated is, George, it looks like your MSM guidance is at least seasonal if not above seasonal at up 8%. Considering what you said about Apple, is there something else going on there? Does the extra week benefit the revenue outlook for QCT? Any color on that would be helpful.","Steven M. Mollenkopf - Qualcomm, Inc.","Ross, this is Steve. Let me answer that first question about where the focus is. Our focus of the cost-cutting is really more about focusing the company's resources on these areas as opposed to taking R&D or resources away. As you know the history of the company, we've had a number of other bets that I think are a little bit further outside of the core competency of the company, and we're trying to focus on R&D in the areas where we think there are growth. Industrial IoT, automotive, networking are clearly above the line there for us, which we are excited about. We are moving some focused R&D toward those businesses versus away from them in total.","We are also looking at how we can spend money to execute on the licensing business with less spend. We hope to move into more of a peacetime situation with the licensing business, but rest assured we are very focused on focusing the company toward the areas that we've mentioned.","Cristiano R. Amon - Qualcomm, Inc.","Hi, Ross. On the MSM, I think there are a number of things that we see in our business, and I think that's reflected in the guide. I think number one is we see an extension of our key China customer going towards the premium tier. We mentioned I think we saw high demand on Snapdragon 700 and 800 as they expand into the segment. We also see large-scale Chinese OEM international expansion that's increasing the MSM sales for us. As an example, some of our key customers now have products in the UK, Germany, Spain, Italy, Portugal, and France, which is a new geographical region for them. And we expect that to continue, as China will bring large-scale 5G deployment in the later part of 2019.","Operator","Timothy Arcuri from UBS, please go ahead with your question.","Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. I have two. First of all, on the payments in the QTL, George, with the $100 million that you're going to get in September and the $100 million that you'll get in December, does that fully catch you up by the end of December? That's the first question.","And then the second question is on the potential to get an injunction in China against Apple. I think there's a practical process around you to validate your IP. So my question is what is the process and whether you've checked all the boxes so that if you did want to pursue that, you could? Thanks.","George S. Davis - Qualcomm, Inc.","Tim, in terms of the payments, the $700 million in total is a portion but does not represent the full amount that we would expect to receive. In fact, I would say it's a fraction of the full amount that we would expect to receive under an agreement. It's not meant to be a catch-up, it's meant to be a good faith payment while negotiations are going on.","Donald J. Rosenberg - Qualcomm, Inc.","Tim, this is Don. So I think your question was about China and our patent litigation there against Apple. And the answer is yes, we are seeking injunctive relief there. In some cases in China, you're not only entitled to permanent injunctions, but you're entitled to preliminary injunctions on occasion. But China is definitely a jurisdiction which is willing to enjoin infringers for patent infringement.","Operator","Chris Danely from Citigroup, please go ahead with your question.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, guys, just a couple quick ones. On the dispute with the $700 million in catch-up payments, I think before you've commented that you expect that to end or to close before the end of the year. Do you still expect that? And would you expect the royalty rate to decline there? And then could other customers get wind of that and have their royalty rates go lower? Then any update on when you think the Apple resolution will be settled.","Alexander Rogers - Qualcomm, Inc.","This is Alex. Again, I would not characterize this $700 million as catch-up payments because, as we've said, what these payments are, are partial payments during the context of a negotiation which we feel has been moving along somewhat slowly but in a positive direction. And the partial payments are an empirical data point that we're making progress in the negotiation. So it's not final by any means. It doesn't represent what is at issue in the agreement and what the values are at issue in the agreement and what the end result might be.","And so this is not a data point for other licensees to take and say somebody else is getting a different sort of deal. These negotiations are ongoing. We think they're positive. If they don't result in an amendment or a resolution, then as we've said in the past, there's an opportunity for dispute resolution. So again, I would just think about this as a good faith partial payment, not indicative of the value of the overall agreement. What was the question again on Apple?","John T. Sinnott - Qualcomm, Inc.","What the timing is, is there any timing question?","Alexander Rogers - Qualcomm, Inc.","Okay, got it. So with respect to Apple, the way you should think about it is we're on the same schedule we've laid out over the last several quarters. We continue to talk. We also have a number of legal strategies that are in flight. They're further in flight than they were the last time we spoke. And we hope that through the combination of either of those paths, we could get to a resolution, and we're confident that we will. No change in the timeline from what we've said previously.","Operator","Srini Pajjuri from Macquarie, please go ahead with your question.","Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","I have a clarification and a question. George, on the ASC 606, I think you said, the September quarter revenue for the devices that are shipped in the September quarter, you said that's going to go on the balance sheet. I think it's going to be more than $1 billion going on to the balance sheet. Just curious, when do you expect to recognize that? When will that flow through to the income statement?","And then my question is on the OpEx, the $1 billion savings, could you give us an update in terms of where you are in terms of achieving that $1 billion? And once we get to that level, what do you expect the OpEx on a non-GAAP basis excluding legal range to be? Thank you.","George S. Davis - Qualcomm, Inc.","So, under 606, the quarter that goes on to the balance sheet goes basically directly to retained earnings, never flows through the income statement. So, we shift ahead one quarter, which is where we talked about on the call the change in the seasonality. So, our old Q2 is now Q1, and then the Q4 the following year will be the old Q1 of the year after that. So, you're going to get all four quarters in the year under 606, but you basically lose one quarter on to the balance sheet. Obviously, we get all the cash flow and other elements associated with it, and we will just report the December quarter instead of the September quarter.","We continue to make progress on the timing of the cost program. We've said the baseline was $7.4 billion for OpEx and that we believe we'll be able to take out $1 billion in 2019, which would put it at $6.4 billion. We'd be down about 5% quarter over quarter in Q4 or mid-single digits, as we said, 5%-plus quarter over quarter, absent the extra week. So, that gives you an indication directionally. And we would expect another step down in the quarter following that as we make progress into the year. We believe we're on track and we're still confident we'll take $1 billion out relative to the baseline.","Operator","Brett Simpson from Arete, please go ahead with your question.","Brett Simpson - Arete Research Services LLP","Yes, thanks very much. Can you, perhaps, just talk us through the timing of the court cases you have with Apple, so the timing of the cases, but more importantly the timing of the judgments, and when you expect these to be finalized for Germany, for China, for ITC, for FTC, that would be very helpful? I've got a follow-up. Thank you.","Donald J. Rosenberg - Qualcomm, Inc.","Hi, this is Don. So, that's a tall order. I don't think I can give you all the precise dates, but we've got, as you said, in the ITC, for example, our first case has already had hearings. We're expecting what's called an initial determination in September and a final determination there in January. We've got another ITC case that will be going to hearings sometime very early in the year, I think in January as well.","In China, we have multiple patent cases running in at least three jurisdictions there. Each of those is on a different schedule, but they are moving along quite quickly. And so, we would expect something either by the end of this year in terms of hearings and trials or early in next year. In Germany, we've got a number of patent cases filed there as well in both Munich and Mannheim, and those are moving toward \u2013 same type of later this year, early next year in terms of trial dates.","Brett Simpson - Arete Research Services LLP","Okay, that's great. Thanks very much, Don. And then just maybe for Cristiano, on the RF business, you're talking a bit about design wins for the first time on 5G RF. Can you maybe just talk about what type of attach rates you're getting with 5G RF with your 5G modem wins? Could you talk about addressing system solution modem to antenna? And where do you think Qualcomm is really differentiating in 5G RF, specifically?","And I just wanted to circle back to the revenue targets for fiscal 2019 for RF. You talked about $2 billion to $3 billion, I think, of RF revenue in fiscal 2019. What's the revenue opportunity that 5G might give you on top of this, over time? Thank you.","Cristiano R. Amon - Qualcomm, Inc.","Thank you for the question. So, I think maybe I'll start by saying we are expanding RF today. We have a number of designs that we have been reporting throughout the year. I think those designs, some are getting to market; some will get into the market soon. We'll be able to see the teardowns, and we're happy that not only we're getting the complete end-to-end solutions in the low band, but also the mid and the high band, including the PAMiDs, and the filters, and we expect that will continue.","With 5G, the reason we're optimistic about the opportunity of increasing attach rate is, when you think of millimeter-wave, you have to design the front end in the antenna and the transceiver integrated into a package, and also you have to optimize performance of a new technology in a new environment, where we have a time-to-market leadership. Those things are great trends for us to expand the RF business, which we're actually pleased with the results we're starting to get right now.","Donald J. Rosenberg - Qualcomm, Inc.","This is Don again. I just wanted to correct something. I believe I said the ITC second case is going to hearing in January. In fact, it's going to hearing in September.","Operator","Edward Snyder from Charter Equity, please go ahead with your question.","Edward. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","Thank you very much. I'd like to hit, if I could, the QCT results, especially with regard to the Snapdragon 700 series. I'm sure you guys have seen the uptick in wins for MediaTek's P60. They've seemed to have abandoned the high end to you, which is obviously very good news for your Snapdragon 800 series. I know the Snapdragon 700 series has been positioned to fight back on that platform. The checks said they have gotten quite a few dozens of wins on that. Can you just help us out with the dynamic between your Snapdragon 700 series and their P60 series, especially in the mid-tier 4G market?","And then if I could also, China has lagged in 4G overall. They've really got basic 4G, and I know they've put a flag in the ground about commercial 5G deployments by next year. That would suggest they're going to have to cover a lot of ground between LTE Advanced and LTE Pro between now and then to make that target. Do you think there are some risks to their deploying 5G? Or maybe it will be delayed a bit beyond where they have targeted while they're trying to catch up? And what impact does LTE Pro or LTE Advanced increase in mix that China's going to have on your modem business especially? Thanks a lot.","Cristiano R. Amon - Qualcomm, Inc.","Thank you, Ed. So let me just start with the Snapdragon 700. The dynamic we saw in the China market with our key OEMs have been consistent with what we have said for probably the past two years is the market is moving up. And I'll answer two of your questions with the Snapdragon 700 series. The Snapdragon 700 series, it basically was an opportunity, as a lot of \u2013 some of the mid-tier devices \u2013 OEMs are more interested in bringing that to a more premium feature set. And one of the features that also drove a lot of the Snapdragon 700 is the advanced modem performance on LTE. In some other markets, especially outside China, you see some markets advertising that even as a 4.5G technology. We saw that, for example, in Latin America. That was how the Snapdragon 700 series got labeled in terms of performance. So this is a good sign.","But also the Snapdragon 800 series, we saw pickup as some of the key customers entered the market. So our view is the market continues to move into the right direction for us, and that bodes well with the expansion of our customers into other markets. Not to single anyone out in particular, but just looking at Xiaomi as an example, they're now in 70 countries, and they were the number four smartphone in Europe within one year. That's a good thing, and look at the global feature set of LTE as the design point for our customers in China, not only China domestic.","Going to 5G, that's where things become more interesting. The scale of the user-friendly trial of the largest operator in China, China Mobile, which everyone on the infrastructure side and the OEM side is working towards the second half, is very large. And that gave us an indication that the transition could be as meaningful as we saw with 4G, so that creates an opportunity for basically, jump in feature set in China towards the 5G with 5G in radio standalone, and we're excited about that as well.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Mollenkopf, do you have anything further to add before adjourning the call?","Steven M. Mollenkopf - Qualcomm, Inc.","Yes, thank you. Just an observation that obviously the company has been through a lot in the last year, but I also want to recognize that we've accomplished a lot as well, not only the strong quarter and outlook that we've put in, but also just the breadth and the depth of the product delivery that's occurred, the 845, the products Cristiano mentioned, as well as the leadership position in 5G.","I think it's a testament to the tenacity and the dedication and the competitive spirit that Qualcomm has been known for. And I just want to thank the employees and our partners and our customers for supporting us through this period and look forward to delivering for them in the future.

Actual events or results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q, which contain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","And now to comments from Qualcomm's Chief Executive Officer, Steve Mollenkopf.","Steve Mollenkopf","Thank you, Warren, and good afternoon everyone.","We delivered strong results this quarter with revenues at the high end of our guidance range and earnings per share well above the high end of our guidance range on strong operating performance and progress in licensing.","Our strong fiscal third quarter results reflect good execution across our businesses as we position the company for a return to growth. We are investing to expand our technology roadmap and lead in 5G, are pursuing new opportunities in fast growing areas that build on our core technologies and are committed to operational excellence.","In QTL, we are pleased to report that we made good progress on the outstanding license negotiations this quarter and receive reports for a significant amount of prior period sales. This is a good indication of the progress we are making and we expect that momentum to continue into our fourth fiscal quarter. We now have more than 110 companies that have signed licenses consistent with the terms of the NDRC resolution.","In QCT, the favorable demand trends for our new chipsets across the mid and high-end smartphone tier, especially with the top 10 vendors in China are helping to deliver improved financial performance. We are also seeing incremental demand for our lower tier chipsets in China versus our prior expectations driven in part by our differentiated all mode and modem leadership. In the premium tier, our Snapdragon 820 now has more than 150 premium smartphone and tablet designs and we have just announced the Snapdragon 821 which offers further performance enhancements and will help set a new bar for flagship smartphones increasingly popular mobile VR head mounted displays and other new devices.","Our updated Snapdragon 600 and 400 product families are becoming the preferred choice for OEMs driving growth in the high and mid-tiers as users seek more performance and features in these segments.","We continue to expand our presence in adjacent opportunities including automotive, networking, mobile compute and IOT. These industries are rapidly adopting smartphone technologies. Our leadership across 3G, 4G, 5G, WiFi, multimedia, graphics, processor and RF front-end technologies positions us well for these new growth areas. Collectively, the addressable opportunity for these adjacent areas is expected to grow at a CAGR of 18% over the next five years from $12 billion to $29 billion according to a combination of third-party and internal estimates.","In automotive, the pace of innovation is accelerating and we are seeing a strong alignment between the industry needs and Qualcomm's technologies. We continue to build momentum and strengthen our position through significant design wins at global automakers. This includes telematics where our modem leadership is well-recognized, infotainment with our Snapdragon automobile processors and in connectivity with our WiFi Bluetooth and location products.","Our momentum in IOT continues as customers turn to our broad offering of IOT development platforms to accelerate their product innovation. At CompuTech, we introduced the Qualcomm's Snapdragon Wear 1100 processor for the fast growing targeted purpose wearable segments such as watches, fitness trackers, smart headsets and wearable accessories.","Our Snapdragon flight platform as helped OEMs quickly commercialize new smaller, lighter drones leveraging Qualcomm's integrated SOC connectivity, GPS and drone software solutions.","We are also extending our proven leadership in modem solutions into the Internet of Things with over 100 design from more than 60 manufacturers using our low power LTE IOT modems. In networking, we continue to drive the transition to the new Wave 2 11ac standard for WiFi networks and now have over 350 home and enterprise products either in production or design across mainstream and premium segments.","We are on track to close our TDK JV by early calendar 2017 and to deliver our next generation Gallium arsenide and CMOS PAs in 2017. This will enable us to provide a comprehensive set of technologies and module capability for the RF front-end positioning us well for key industry trends, complexity increases within smartphones, the proliferation of radio bands in 4G and 5G and the growth of cellular in IOT.","We are on track to deliver operating margins of 16% or better in QCT in the fourth fiscal quarter and it is important to note that our planning assumptions incorporates second sourcing at our large modem customer.","Looking forward, our global scale technology leadership and differentiated chipset roadmap across multiple tiers and regions and dozens of spectrum bands continues to position us well for the future.","Our modem expertise continues to lead the industry and as we did in both 3G and 4G, we are leading the world to 5G. 5G will make wireless broadband indistinguishable from wireline requiring devices with ultra high-speed, ultra low-latency and ultra reliable connectivity. The technology roadmap required for 5G will drive significant advancements in modem and front-end features, the technologies in which Qualcomm excels.","Let me take a moment to review a few of our core strengths that will underscore our continued wireless broadband leadership. Our gigabit LTE leadership with the Snapdragon X16 modem will pave the way to 5G. Many of the technologies enabling gigabit LTE will be common to 5G, use of more antennas, use of multiple types of spectrum simultaneously, more sophisticated signal processing et cetera. And the mastery of these features in 4G will be essential to leadership in 5G. Many of these features are already being trialed or commercially deployed in phones using our Snapdragon 820 processor X12 LTE.","Qualcomm also pioneered 802.11ad operating at 60 gigahertz, which is shipping into access points and computing devices today. The design and commercialization of this technology into smartphones is enabling the company to build leadership and expertise in the high-band known as millimeter wave to be deployed broadly in 5G.","We are also designing a new OFDM based 5G air interface that will not only enhance mobile broadband services but also enable connectivity and management for the Internet of Things and new types of mission critical services. Our 5G design is intended to get the most out of the wide array of spectrum available across regulatory paradigms in bands from low bands below 1-gigahertz to mid bands from 1-gigahertz to 6-gigahertz to millimeter wave. 5G devices will bring the next level of convergence with the ability to work on licensed and shared spectrum concurrently. We are very pleased that regulators around the world are beginning to allocate spectrum for 5G consistent with our 5G design and development efforts.","Recent spectrum regulatory decisions and movement in the U.S. and Europe combined with progress on the spectrum regulatory front in China, Japan and Korea are good indications that the world is preparing for 5G.","We recently announced our new 5G prototype system and trial platform operating in spectrum band below 6-gigahertz and showcasing multi gigabit throughput at low latency. We demonstrated a prototype system at Mobile World Congress Shanghai in collaboration with China Mobile. The new prototype adds to our existing 5G millimeter wave prototype system operating at the 28-gigahertz millimeter wave band and is capable of robust mobile broadband communications in non-line-of-sight environments.","We are utilizing these prototype systems to test and demonstrate our innovative 5G designs to drive 3GPP, 5G, new radio standardization and enable timely 5G NR trials in anticipation of future commercial network launches.","To summarize, fiscal 2016 has been a transition year for Qualcomm, which has played out largely as expected. Our strong results this quarter reflect a good progress, we have made positioning the company for improved financial performance and continued technology leadership in mobile and the many exciting new industries and product enabled by our smartphone technologies.","We are continuing to make progress in our licensing business and expect that momentum to continue positioning us well for the future.","I will now turn the call over to Derek Aberle.","Derek Aberle","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone.","As Steve noted, we made significant progress in the licensing business this quarter both in terms of new agreement signed and catch up amounts reported. As a result, QTL had a very strong fiscal third quarter with total reported device sales of approximately $62.6 billion and revenues of $2 billion driven primarily by the catch-up reporting of certain prior period sales and revenue as well as stronger than expected 3G, 4G device ASPs.","As a reminder, as a result of the resolution of our dispute with LG in April, in the fiscal third quarter we recognized over $200 million in revenue for sales reported during the prior two fiscal quarters and resumed to recognizing quarterly LG revenues for sales reported in the third quarter consistent with our prior guidance.","We continued to make steady progress in China executing new license agreements. In addition, we are still actively negotiating with a small number of the key remaining Chinese OEMs and making progress in those discussions. Based on the progress we are making, those licensees agreed to report and pay a portion of the sales and royalties they have been withholding while we continued to negotiate their new agreements. These amounts plus additional catch-up payments we received from other licensees during the quarter resulted in more than $200 million in revenues in QTL for the third fiscal quarter related to prior period activity.","QTL revenue for the quarter therefore included a total of more than $400 million in revenue related to prior period activity as a result of the LG resolution and these catch-up payments.","As we have said in the past, we are prepared to take action against OEMs that are not negotiating in good faith to conclude license agreements or underreporting to royalties they owe us. Consistent with that approach in June, we filed complaints against Meizu in the Intellectual Property Courts in both Beijing and Shanghai, China. Regrettably, we have had to turn to litigation against Meizu in order to protect our rights and importantly to maintain fairness in a level playing field for the companies that are respectful of intellectual property rights and have entered into license agreements in accordance with the resolution reached by Qualcomm and the NDRC.","We are also continuing to work hard on a number of fronts to improve compliance. We are actively implementing our compliance plans and expect them to deliver a meaningful improvements over time.","Looking ahead, we continue to estimate calendar 2016 global 3G, 4G device shipments of 1.625 to 1.725 billion devices with year-over-year unit growth of approximately 8% at the mid-point. We continue to see a strong 4G ramp in China as each of the operators pursues aggressive subscribe growth targets with their 4G plus service offerings and design momentum continues to move rapidly towards all mode devices across China.","Other emerging regions continue to be negatively impacted by macroeconomic headwinds. Outside of handsets, growth in automotive telematics is offsetting weaker tablet volumes.","We continue to expect low single-digit growth in global 3G, 4G device sales in fiscal 2016 consistent with our prior guidance reflecting strong unit growth partially offset by ASP declines that are consistent with our prior expectations. We continue to expect that the rate at which handset ASPs will decline during the fiscal 2016 will be about 50% of the rate of decline experienced in fiscal 2015.","In terms of the outlook for QTL for the fiscal year, we now expect revenue to be between $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion. We have narrowed the range to align with our current view of expected progress in China for the remainder of the fiscal year including increased confidence that we will conclude additional agreements with some other remaining key OEMs within the fiscal year.","Although, we expect to continue to see quarterly fluctuations in the externally implied royalty rate for the reasons we have previously explained, we expect the rate for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of 2.9%.","With respect to the Korean Fair Trade Commission investigation of our licensing practices, we have now submitted an extensive response to the case teams report and have entered the hearing phase with the commissioners. During this phase, the commission will conduct a series of hearings over the next few months during which we expect to have the opportunity to further present our response. The first hearing was held earlier today in Korea in contrary to the recent press reports, the commission has not reached a decision in our case.","In conclusion, we continue to make good progress in China. We are keenly focused on concluding agreements with the remaining OEMs as well as improving compliance and are working towards continued progress in the fourth fiscal quarter.","That concludes my comments. And I will now turn the call over to George.","George Davis","Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon everyone.","We are pleased to report a very strong fiscal third quarter. Revenues were $6 billion up 4% year-over-year and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.16 up 17% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $31 billion reflecting strong operating cash flow of approximately 30% of revenue in the quarter and the acceleration of our share repurchase activity into the first half of the year.","Through our fiscal third quarter, we have returned approximately 120% of free cash flow or more than $5.9 billion to stockholders this fiscal year including the completion of the remainder of our 10 billion stock repurchase commitments. And we are on track to achieve our targeted 75% return to cash flow in fiscal 2016.","Our third quarter results reflect both our commitment to operational efficiency and the strong performance of our operating businesses. Performance above the high-end of our guidance range primarily came from continued progress in our licensing business in China.","In QCT, MSM shipments were $201 million approximately 9% above the mid-point of our prior guidance range reflecting greater than expected demand in the low-tier particularly in China.","QCT operating margin had 9.5% was inline with our prior expectations on higher volume and cost reductions with increased low-tier demand impacting our product mix and revenue per MSM versus expectations.","Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses overall were lower than forecast decreasing 2% sequentially reflecting continued cost initiatives. Our non-GAAP tax rate during the quarter was 19% up modestly against expectations as a result of a higher mix of licensing revenues in the quarter. We continued to expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 18% for fiscal 2016.","Turning to our fiscal fourth quarter, we estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $5.4 billion to $6.2 billion up approximately 6% year-over-year at the mid-point. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share in our fiscal fourth quarter to be approximately $1.05 to $1.15 per share up approximately 21% year-over-year at the mid-point.","We expect fiscal fourth quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be down approximately 2% to 4% sequentially reflecting further strategic realignment plan cost actions particularly in QCT.","In QTL, as Derek mentioned our fiscal year revenue outlook is $7.4 billion to $7.8 billion and we believe our recent licensing progress will continue throughout the remainder of the year. Aligned with that view, our revenue guidance for the fourth fiscal quarter assumes some additional progress in China. However, our fourth quarter guidance does not include the full potential benefit from the completion of all license agreements under negotiation and is consistent with the low-end of the QTL range for the full fiscal year.","For the fiscal fourth quarter, we estimate total reported device sales of between $57 billion and $65 billion. Our TRDS forecast reflects our estimate that global device sales will be lower year-over-year reflecting a decline in the premium tier at a large OEM partially offset by the impact of closing new licensing agreements and the resulting catch-up we expect to receive.","Like our revenue guidance, this forecast includes the impact of closing some but not all of the remaining agreements in China.","In QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 195 million to 215 million units and operating margin to improve sequentially to 16% or better consistent with our prior operating margin target.","Our QCT operating margin forecast reflects the strength of our new product cycle, our cost actions throughout the year as well as strong demand from mid and high-tier devices.","Now, turning to fiscal 2016. We remain on track to meet the $1.4 billion reduction in spending under our strategic realignment plan and we continue to expect more than $700 million of savings in fiscal 2016 relative to the SRP baseline, ahead of our original $600 million target.","A summary of the savings program is included in the Investor presentation for this call on our Web site. We continue to expect fiscal 2015 non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses to be down approximately 2% to 4% year-over-year, which includes the full year impact of acquisition related increases of approximately 5%. Adjusting for M&A, estimated spending in these areas will be down 7% to 9% year-over-year.","We are committed to maintaining a strong discipline of cost management, while remaining extremely focused on the important role Qualcomm will play as the leading innovator in mobile technology solutions.","That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren.","Warren Kneeshaw","Thank you, George.","Operator, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Simona Jankowski","Hi. Thank you for breaking out the benefit to QTL from the China catch-up royalties. Would you be able to also breakout the contribution to units and the level of ASPs for that catch up? And then, is there much left in terms of the already signed agreements that is yet to be recognized?","Derek Aberle","Simona, hey, it's Derek. Yes, I think we are not in a position today to breakout the split of TRDS kind of units in ASP that came in through the catch-up payments in Q3. I think, if you look at it, you sort of look at it for the year, you will be able to see that we are sort of making progress and closing the gap and if we continue to make progress and close these key remaining agreements. We talked at the Analyst Day of being in a position to capture about 75% of the global sales from the Chinese OEMs. I think we'll actually sort of on an exit rate basis, if we can close these remaining deals, it will be better than that.","So I think it's just a continued story of progress and you are starting to see the results were all through this quarter.","George Davis","Simona in terms of the upside to guidance as we indicated our Q4 guidance is really set at the low-end of the full year range for QTL. So the upside would be the agreements in addition to the ones that we expect to sign that we put into the guidance. There is still $400 million of revenue upside that is possible for the quarter and not in our guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","Mike Walkley","Hi. Thank you. Derek just another question on QTL, with the progress in China certainly encouraging and as you continue to make progress with a few of these other large Chinese OEMs, how should we maybe think about the exit rate basis in terms of maybe units you believe are being underreported entering fiscal 2017, do you think it's still more than maybe 10% of the market under reporting or are you getting close to those levels?","And then, just overall high level how is this progress as you exit the year relative to your expectations towards your longer term $10 billion in QTL revenue by 2020? Thank you.","Derek Aberle","Mike, this is Derek. So I think the way to think about it is sort of if I bridge back to the answer I was just giving to Simona's question we continue to believe that if we can close these remaining agreements that the exit rate actually on the China portion of the global sales -- Chinese OEM portion will now be north of 75%. And I think, if you look that also in terms of then the global sales, it would be less than 10% on a run rate basis going forward. And what we have seen actually is, some of these key Chinese OEMs have actually been gaining share. And so we will get an even larger benefit on a run rate basis, if we can close out the remaining couple of agreements we have here.","Warren Kneeshaw","The second question.","Derek Aberle","Oh, yes. And I would say, basically we are -- I think the progress we are making in China and the view in the market we see is consistent with what we talked about in terms of the $10 billion target.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim long with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Tim Long","Thank you. Just sticking on the same topic, it's hard to beat it too much. It looks like Derek, the markets units were only down about 4% sequential, so I'm assuming that's some prior period catch-up. So, if we were to normalize the full year 8% growth, would that be lower because of those aren't in there and maybe if you could just give us a sense, I don't know if that's breaking out those numbers too much?","And then, just on the chip side, I think I just wanted to hit on the gross margin. I guess, was it mix that caused it to be down even though the ASPs were up in the quarter and what's kind of the outlook for the next few quarters on the gross margin line for QCT? Thank you.","Derek Aberle","Hi, Tim. It's Derek. So on the first question, yes, the units in Q3 would have included some amount of catch up which rolled into the catch up number that we talked about. If we look back, you will see we have effectively held our unit call for calendar 2016, which is about as you said about an 8% year-over-year growth, obviously that has quarterly fluctuation given seasonality and other variability. I would say largely from a market standpoint things are tracking in line with what we would have expected last quarter. We talked about China being stronger, some softness in the premium tier and a little bit of weakness in some of the emerging markets but the net-net still giving us confidence that the 8% forecast was good. You may have seen China reported numbers out recently probably stronger than most people had expected and largely in line with what we thought would happen there.","George Davis","Hi, Tim. It's George. I think we don't break out the gross margin, but I think your point is on revenue per MSM. And yes, it was a little soft during the quarter than we had expected on mix. Obviously, the unit story was quite good and in particular we saw a lot of strength in the low-tier. Gross margin is going to be a good story for us as you look into the end of the year, you are going to see the impact of not only a very strong set of new products starting to get the lift in the marketplace in Q4. But, the adjacent business continues to do well, our adjacent businesses are continuing to do well. And of course, we reiterated the 16% op margin for QCT and that being said, it will also benefit from the OpEx actions that we are taking in the quarter as well. So, good story overall for QCT.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","James Faucette","Thanks. I just wanted to ask a follow-up question as it relates to the collection that you guys are doing or the payments et cetera. Derek maybe you can just talk a little bit about how we should think both timing, but also what maybe the long-term implications are. I guess just a little more color on anything that you can say as to why the negotiations with [indiscernible] the outstanding licensees are still there? And at what point do you feel like you end up having to do something along the lines of filings through with Meizu? Thank you.","Derek Aberle","Yes, James. It's Derek. So I think the way to look at it is, we have this small group of licensees that were withholding their reports and payments while they continue to negotiate. And that was inconsistent with what a lot of the other companies did. And I think the way to look at that is, given the progress that we have made within the last quarter with those companies towards closing agreements which aren't yet closed, but we are making progress towards that and sort of put them in a position to feel the right thing to do was to go ahead and report a portion of the prior period sales which is what roll through in the quarter.","Taking that up a level, as I said, for the year at the Analyst Day we talked about, if we could close these key deals, we would basically be sort of on an run rate basis collecting on about 75% of the total sales by the Chinese OEMs, and then, there would be additional compliance work we would need to do to kind of close the gap on the remainder.","I would say now as we look at that picture, if we accomplish the same goal this year meaning that closing the agreements, the exit rate will actually be north of that 75%. And then, of course, we are already actively moving on a number of fronts to improve the compliance in other areas.","So, I think that's largely tracking in line with our plans and as you can see if there are companies that we believe we are not making progress with and we won't conclude agreements with because they are not negotiating in good faith we will take action against them and that's what we did against Meizu. We don't feel like at the moment with other companies, but of course that could change in the future. Our current view though is we are making progress and we have higher confidence now than we did a quarter ago that we will be able to close those deals within the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Kulbinder Garcha","Thanks. Just a couple of quick ones. Derek for you, just a clarification on the licensing side. You said that it was $400 million worth of catch-up payments from Samsung and from the Chinese OEMs. There is going to be some catch-up payments already included in your Q4 guidance and [indiscernible] for QTL, I assume and eventually those catch-up payments tail-off to zero because it's an ongoing run rate. I just want to clarify if that's the way it works.","And the second part of the QTL, is that, this move from 75% compliance to move towards the 700% is it, as you exit this year, is that more about getting your existing licensees are reporting to 100% comply under all of their units or is it signing are still further you made your vendors? Thanks.","Derek Aberle","Kulbinder, it's Derek here. On the -- we basically said the combined catch-up amounts across is actually LG not Samsung. LG and the companies that then reported some prior period activity was in the quarter north of $400 million. If you think about Q4 as George mentioned, the way we looked at that kind of throughout the year we had a little bit of a difference in the way we treated guidance meaning the QTL full year revenue guidance as always included revenues associated with closing new deals. But that, when we were just guiding one quarter out, we have been cautious and not including the benefit of what would be required to close those deals within the quarter.","Now, as we get towards the end of the year with just Q4 remaining and we look at the progress we are making, we have effectively narrowed the range brought up the low-end of the range. And as George said, while we have included some amount of benefit from closing new deals but not the full benefit. So what's rolling through our Q4 guidance is really consistent with the low-end of the full year QTL revenue guidance. And then, there is incremental revenue that would come from closing additional deals in the quarter which we -- we believe is possible which is why we have continued to have a higher range for the full year on QTL.","Going forward, I think the way to think about the run rate is, again, if we get that done, we will be north of probably 75% of the Chinese OEM sales on a run rate basis, which would mean sort of the under reporting percentage of total global sales would be less than 10%. And then, to really close the gap on that is going to be a combination of -- I would say signing up some of the smaller players as well as obviously we have the dispute with Meizu. And then, driving higher compliance from some of the companies that are already licensed and just not reporting their full sales. So it will be a kind of a combination of a few different elements there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Rod Hall","Yes, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to come back to QTL in the mid-point. Your mid-point guidance in QTL is down $0.5 billion and so I get all the commentary around the puts and takes. But, I'm just trying to understand what caused that shift down in the mid-point, is it demand, is it ASPs, is it the catch-up payments for quite as much as you thought? And then, can you help me understand what's going on there? And then, I have one follow-up on that was well.","George Davis","Hi, Rod. It's George. So, yes, the mid-point, if you do the 73 to the 28 versus 740, yes, it's down a 500. I wouldn't read anything into it. There is a number of agreements that were put within that space. We have tired to every quarter give an update on where we think the range is going. And even last quarter we said it looks because of the market and some other issues, the range is probably had a little more downside, but we held the low-end of the range based on progress.","So, we are constantly adjusting to make sure that we reflect what's possible. You've also seen us take some litigation action which actually puts things outside the -- potentially outside the window for the year. But, there is a number of factors that went into the range. And so, I wouldn't over read a $50 million change. And again, we are guiding to the low-end of the range, which means we have significant upside to that, if we are able to sign more agreements.","Rod Hall","Okay. And then, I just also wanted to ask you the 16% exit rate, you said that's now -- it sounds like a minimum and I just wonder how conservative it is that margin exit rate now that you know more about market share changes et cetera in the back end of this year. Can you just comment a little bit about, do you feel that's a very conservative number now or is it as conservative as when you started out with that 16% exit rate, just give us some idea there.","George Davis","We are pleased with what we have seen in the marketplace. As you know, the year probably overall has been a little softer in the premium tier than we would have thought. So, but we have also made good progress on both market share and on the -- our cost efforts relative to expectations going in. So, I think overall, we feel comfortable reiterating but I really don't want to characterize it beyond that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Timothy Arcuri","Thank you. I had two questions. I guess the first one, Derek, I'm still trying to maybe get at what some people are asking about the pro forma royalty rate. So maybe can you -- maybe pro forma out for us, what the royalty rate was net off all the catch-up payments in June? And then, maybe what the pro forma royalty rate would be for September as well?","Derek Aberle","Yes, Tim. This is Derek. I think the way to think about it is, we -- on my script we included a statement for the full fiscal year that we believe for the full year will be around the 2.9% level. I think if you try to kind of normalize Q3 to adjust for the prior period activity things like the LG resolution which pushed the rate up. I think it would be in that range as well for the quarter.","Q4, we believe will be down sequentially but it's really hard to give you a forecast on that just because it will be fairly dependent on -- how many of the deals we get resolved within the quarter and how much catch-up comes in as you might remember some of the guys that were still negotiating with were larger -- historically larger three-mode players and the rate on three-mode devices is lower than on other devices. And so that could have within the quarter when that catch-up comes in could have a dilutive effect.","But, we are still comfortable with the longer term view on the rate that we talked about in February and also for the year that I mentioned today.","Timothy Arcuri","Got it. Thanks. And then, I guess just my follow-up is really for Steve and the team. Can you talk a little more about 5G and you guys were talking more about this every call. So, I guess the question is really about timing and your position in the standards and sort of when that will be finalized and what's your IP position will be for 5G relative to what it has been for 3G, 4G? Thanks.","Steve Mollenkopf","Sure. Time, its Steve. In general, we are obviously trying to drive 5G as quickly as we can. It's an area which we think to be a strong player in 5G, you have to be a strong player in 4G, 3G and WiFi and consequentially we think that we will maintain a very strong IP position moving forward. The standards bodies are working on that right now. So, I think we have a lot of visibility into the strength of our submissions as well as to how the industry is unfolding.","I think in general, if you'd have asked me that question, a year ago, I would have said that it would have happened closer to 2020. Certainly over the last year and accelerating here over the last quarter there has been a real pull to push that in or to pull that in closer to 2018\/2019 timeframe depending on what the deployment is. And of course, we are going to support that with our products and with our standards submissions and all the R&D that we are doing. And as you would expect we are accelerating as well as protecting that R&D as we are repositioning the company for growth. And I think it will be a good story for Qualcomm here over the next decade.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Blayne Curtis","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple on QCT, you talked about outside from the China market, it's been a lot of concerns about maybe some overbuilds, you have the best perspective knowing what you shift in versus what selling through. Just your perspective on China maybe seasonality as you get into December. And then, you said, you factored in some second sourcing out of marquee phone, do you think that share that you will have ultimately on this generation is sustainable?","Cristiano Amon","Okay. This is Cristiano. Thank you for your question. First, maybe addressing China, I think as we said in addition to seeing stronger demand for high and mid and even low tier units and then it also give us a higher unit in the quarter. I think we are seeing significant traction within our new product family not only the Snapdragon 800 but more important the 600 and 400 tiers. And we see that market in China is moving up, we spoke earlier in other calls about things such as all mode and care aggregation. We see that is materializing all-mode is becoming the preferred configuration which is a multi-mode solution across all the carriers in China and I think here, China exactly moving faster to higher speeds. So we see that exactly a positive trend for Qualcomm in particular as the market in China moving up.","With regards to how we view about second sourcing and one large customer, I think we said very, very clear that's our planning assumption and we stayed within -- driving towards to meet our commitments in 2016 and I think that has no impact in our 16% projection of operating margin for QCT.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.","Stacy Rasgon","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I was wondering if you could give us an indication of where you saw a revenue per MSM trending in Q4? And secondly, I wanted to get your thoughts on operating margins as we go into next year, do you think 15% in Q4 will be the trough for operating margins as we go through 2017, they should never drop below that?","George Davis","Hey, Stacy. It's George. Again, we would expect to see strong revenue per MSM again in the fourth quarter and so not giving a specific guide. But, if you look at the product mix and you look at where we are seeing an up tick and the positioning of our new products, it's all consistent with improved revenue per MSM, also of course the adjacent businesses contribute to that as well as they did in the third quarter.","We are not going to guide 2017 at this time and but we are pleased with the progress that we are making on the cost program and we think that will certainly carry into 2017 but we are not going to forecast margin at this time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amit Shah with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Amit Shah","Yes. Thank you. Just on the second sourcing with the key customer, just wondering if you guys can give us some feel for whether you were able to obtain majority share and looking into next year, you talked a little bit about gigabit LTE that you are going to have with the X16 Snapdragon. Is that an important factor as you all think about design wins in 2017, I think the feedback from some of the competition is that while it's ahead, 1-gigabit download this will be fairly rare in practice and not really a variable when it comes to design wins.","Cristiano Amon","Hey, Amit. Thanks for your question. This is Cristiano. So I will try to -- it's very difficult for us to comment specifically about our customer plans with regards to volume and share. I think what I can say as -- we always had second sourcing in our business in QCT throughout the year. And I think, we have always rely and to strengthen our product roadmap and technology transitions to drive value and volume from our solutions.","That I think that leads into your second question. I believe the gigabit LTE transition, it is going to get a lot of traction across all the developed markets. And also, you are going to see that as pre-deployment ahead of 5G. I think the ability to drive gigabit LTE technology with 4G using advance or other techniques is going to be key to drive a transition of 5G. And I think in addition to that we see both the WiFi and the LTE evolving at the same time across license in a licensed spectrum.","As in a licensed spectrum with 3GPP is standard, it's called LAA and license spectrum becomes available that's going to give many operators worldwide the ability to get to gigabit speeds. And we are very confident about the ability to build that with a roadmap.","Steve Mollenkopf","And this is Steve. The only thing I would add is, I think betting against feature leadership at the modem level has never been a good way to build a sustainable business. We think it continues to be a defensible franchise. And in fact, if you look at the strength that we are seeing in the business today in China, I think its good proof that that you do not want to be on a wrong side of modem feature leadership and we think that becomes continues to be important and becomes even more important as the industry transitions to 5G. So we feel like we are on a good support to maintain position on the modem franchise.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Tal Liani","Hi, guys. Is there any impact on pricing of the competition with Intel? And second about QCT, when should we see the bulk of the 820 RAM hitting the numbers? I'm trying to model this properly since the ASP so much higher than the average and I don't know if you expect -- you expect it to hit the certain time or more moderate growth kind of across many quarters. Thanks.","Steve Mollenkopf","Tal, obviously, we can't specifically talk about anyone customers pricing. But I can tell you or reiterate what I said about going Q3 to Q4, part of how we are going to be getting the operating margin to 16% is a strength that both the gross margin level and across our product suite. So I think we feel very good about the positioning of our products and the ASP implications to that.","Cristiano Amon","Hi. I think Tal and to comment on the 820 RAM, I think we will continue to see 820 launches throughout the year. I think you have the normal seasonality of the holiday season. But also, you have now different seasonality in China as well. So, I think, we will continue to see 820 launches throughout the year and when we get into 2017, you are going to start to see launches regarding the next generation platform.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","CJ Muse","Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. I guess two quick ones. First one, can you share what the dollar value of catch-up payment is embedded in your September Q revenue guide? And then, secondly, if I look at your EPS guide and your QCT operating margin guide, it seems to suggest that PBT margin for QTL closer to 74% versus 86% last Q. Curious, if you could walk through what's driving that down tech? Thank you.","Derek Aberle","So for QTL, we would expect obviously, we are coming down quarter-over-quarter relative to the -- because of the amount of -- kind of out of period items that were in Q3, spending, staying flat will impact operating margin not as much as certainly what you are forecasting. We haven't guided the amount of licensing that we anticipate assigning but, it's not a material amount, but there is some -- included in our guidance forecast.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Tavis McCourt","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Derek, I wonder you gave us the catch-up payments for the fiscal third quarter embedded in the $7.4 billion to $7.8 billion guidance for QTL, can you give us the full year estimate or if it's a range of catch up payments?","And then, secondly, Steve on the gigabit LTE, I missed it before, was that in the roadmap for next year's modem, have you said that specifically? And if so, what level of carrier aggregation would be needed for that? Thanks.","Derek Aberle","Tavis, its Derek. So, we are not going to break out specifically what's in the -- how much catch-up was in the sort of in the range. The way to think about it though is, sort of the two of the larger companies that we have been negotiating with have been withholding payments. This quarter reported and we recognized more than $200 million of catch-up payments related to them. That's not the entirety of the catch-up amount, but it's obviously a significant portion.","And then, as you think about what catch-up means, there is obviously some 2015 activity but now we are half way -- essentially half-way through 2016, so there will be additional catch-up. So you have in-quarter activity plus catch-up payments related to those agreements when they get signed and if that happens in the fourth quarter that would roll through there. But, pretty hard for us to give more color than that just given the timing and uncertainty of when they will get done and how much we will roll through in the quarter.","Cristiano Amon","Hi, Tavis. This is Cristiano. To your question on gigabit LTE; gigabit LTE I think we already sampled some of the first products of gigabit LTE, you are going to see this in product throughout next calendar year, maybe some of the early products could come as early as this calendar year. And you need a three or four carrier aggregation to be able to do this. One important thing is, you have a lot of carriers today doing three carrier aggregation today. I think that plus four carrier aggregation, you can get to gigabit speeds.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Simpson with Arete. Please go ahead.","Brett Simpson","Yes. Thanks very much. First question for Derek on QTL, so just looking at the China license agreement that you are signing off late, my understanding is, they don't include implementation patents anymore and you have an outlook for $10 billion of QTL revenue by 2020. Can you talk about how you might monetize your non-standard essential patents, your implementation patents in the future? Should we expect Qualcomm to consider separating implementation patents, are there separate license agreement with your customers as you move towards let's say 5G?","Derek Aberle","Hey, Brett. This is Derek. You are correct as it relates to China. So as part of the NDRC resolution, we committed to offer licenses to -- actually not even the entirety of our essential patent portfolio. But, the 3G, 4G standard essential patents in China. And so, in a sense that has resulted in us doing something different in China than we have done historically which is a disaggregation of the portfolio.","And as I said in the past, we do believe there is an opportunity to monetize the remainder of the portfolio. Our focus has been really sort of a sequenced approach meaning try to get through the all of the key deals covering the 3G\/4G portfolio and I think we are getting towards the finish line on that. And then, once we do that, I think there is a number of different opportunities and ways that we are thinking through monetizing the remainder of the portfolio.","And as you may recall that we mentioned that wasn't built in even to the $10 billion number that we have talked about in February. So, we do think there is an opportunity there over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ed Snyder with Charter Equity Research. Please go ahead.","Ed Snyder","Thanks a lot. Steve, you mentioned that to be strong in 5G, you really have to be strong in 4G given the legacy standard, isn't that also the case to some extent with 4G that you had to be fairly strong in 3G, and how does that impacted the second sourcing and some of your larger customers. Is this one of the things that's keep you in majority share and you think you are just going to play out that way for the rest of the 4G and then into 5G to. It's been the case, lot of folks have been in the modem business with great plans and almost all of them falling away, there seems to be most of it done because they are on the legacy software to do all the hand-off in the corner case if Qualcomm does?","So just trying to figure out, how that applies to some of the marquee phones are playing out now, and then into 5G, you see that being a big factor, we're going to go so far through reservation like IOT and all that legacy stuff is going to be as big of a deal? Thanks.","Steve Mollenkopf","Ed, you know, I actually agree with the way that you characterized it. It's been very difficult to build, I would say a high-quality modem business without having the ability to handle all the modes they come up. This becomes increasingly important when you are looking to get into SKUs that are sold, let's say worldwide because essentially you get the entire world feature set come into your product. And so what you tend to see is, people might split their products and go with one region with a particular solution, but it's difficult to get the lion share and certainly difficult I think over time to protect that those design wins. So we have seen that over a number of generations and I would say one of the reasons that we were successful in 4G besides just being ahead on 4G was the ability to make it very easy for multi-mode to occur at the chipset. Really, all the multi-mode work tends to be abstracted to the user by the chipset. That continues to be important and I would add in Wi-Fi and many different brands when you go to 5G.","So we think that's going to continue to be an important component of our business moving forward. And one of the reasons why we think it's important to invest not only in the modem but in the RF and all of the technologies that make that very easy to occur.","With IOT it even becomes more important in my opinion because the SKU that goes into these industrial applications, you're really trying to make it easy for someone to go and access cellular without having to learn about all of the complications that cellular provide. So, we think that's not only a defensible strategy for cellular products but also for the Internet of Things and the franchise moving forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","David Wong","Thanks very much. I had a question and a follow-up. The first one is that if you look at your royalty business, what is your license business China, what is your attitude to capturing all of the license business, will you in every case you can't come to an agreement seek a legal remedy or will there be many cases in which it's not worth the cost?","Steve Mollenkopf","The business in China obviously is pretty diverse. And I think we've approached it in the right way which is -- we have kind of a stage plan, the first is to get the key agreements done, I think we are making good progress as you've seen on that front. There is a number of in-country in China compliance initiatives, we have ongoing with existing licensees including active audit and other efforts to make sure we really have a clear understanding of the market landscape and who is doing what.","There will be I think a piece of the market that is sort of the long-tale piece that tends to be, lower ASP, low cost, lower featured devices. They might be a little bit harder to get after than some of the other pieces. But, we are seeing consolidation across the OEMs both in terms of share and also even some early M&A activity. So the number of players we believe will reduce over time. Beyond that, so obviously, legal proceedings will be an element of our compliance efforts and you have seen that with Meizu. But, there are many, many other things we are doing as well both in China and I talked about some of these at some length at our Analyst Day in February. But, there is a lot of activity we are also doing outside of China and a lot of the other regions in the world that we think have the ability to impact and change behavior for some of the players that have been less compliant in the past.","So litigation will be one tool, but it's not going to be the only tool. And there is other things that are less costly that we think we can do to drive higher compliance over time and big area focus obviously for the business right now.","David Wong","Okay, great. And for leading edge chip manufacturing technology in the future, do you plan to use a single foundry for any given advance mode or might you split your business between foundries, when do you expect to tape-out 10-nanometers and have the sampling?","Steve Mollenkopf","Well, I think in general, we tend to have a multi-sourcing strategy and that includes the leading node. We have already taped out 10-nanometer and sampled it to customer. So, our focus tends to be on the leading node even beyond 10 nanometers and because our business is so diverse we tend to use everything from the leading node all the down to analog processes. So it's a multi-sourcing tends to be one of the tenants of how we operate the business.","Operator","Thank you. This ends our allotted time for questions and answers. Mr. Mollenkopf, do you have anything further to add before adjourning the call?","Steve Mollenkopf","Thank you. I just wanted to thank everyone for attending the call today. We had a stronger than expected quarter and are executing well on our plans to position the company for the next phase and profitable growth. We continue to make good progress in the licensing business in China and have favorable new product momentum in QCT. Lastly, I want to thank all of the Qualcomm employees for their hard work, for the strong quarter and we look forward to the many exciting opportunities ahead. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"18402":["QUALCOMM, Inc.

In addition, Cristiano Amon, Alex Rogers, and Don Rosenberg will join the question-and-answer session.","You can access our earnings release and a slide presentation that accompany this call on our Investor Relations website. In addition, this call is being webcast on qualcomm.com, and a replay will be available on our website later today.","During the call today, we will use non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G, and you can find the related reconciliations to GAAP on our website.","We will also make forward-looking statements, including projections and estimates of future events, business or industry trends, or business or financial results. Actual events or results could differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K, which contain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","And now to comments from Qualcomm's Chief Executive Officer, Steve Mollenkopf, who is speaking from our offices in China.","Steven M. Mollenkopf - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone.","We are pleased to report a strong set of results this quarter, as we continued to execute on our strategic priorities to drive technology and product leadership, particularly in 5G, manage our operating expenses, and return capital to our stockholders.","Fiscal 2018 was an extraordinary year in the history of Qualcomm. We successfully navigated through many challenges, yet remained focused on execution and the significant opportunities in front of us. I believe we enter fiscal 2019 a stronger company and extremely well-positioned for the future. Our fiscal fourth quarter results reflect continued strong performance, with non-GAAP earnings of $0.90 per share, $0.05 above the high end of our guidance range, reflecting better than expected QCT performance and lower operating expenses.","The growth of our leading customers in China was a positive for the company in the fiscal fourth quarter, both on volume and improving mix of devices. We expect further growth from our China business in fiscal 2019, particularly in the second half of the fiscal year. The combined impact of Apple instructing their contract manufacturers to stop paying their contracted royalty payments and Apple's decision to use a competitor's modem for their latest device has had a significant impact to our financial performance. Notably, over 50% of the expected fiscal 2019 headwind related to Apple is reflected in our first fiscal quarter guidance and impacts our QCT business. As we progress through the year, this will become less impactful to our quarterly results.","Despite this, as you can see from our results, we are continuing to execute well with our customers. Importantly, we've laid a strong foundation for growth as we differentiate through our industry-leading innovation ahead of some very big opportunities, including the launch of 3G (sic) [5G] (4:00), the ramp of our RF front-end business, as well as industry transitions in Wi-Fi and the connected car.","Looking ahead to fiscal 2019, the entire company remains focused around these three key priorities. Priority number one is to drive the transition to 5G. When the world is introduced to 5G early next year, we believe we will be the technology partner in nearly all the commercial launches around the world. This position is no small accomplishment. Transitions in wireless like 3G, 4G, and 5G are unforgiving to companies and competitors that are late to these transitions, especially in the initial ramp years. Our focus and investment priorities over the last couple of years have enabled us to successfully establish a strong technology position and lead the 5G industry transition, which will represent a significant opportunity for Qualcomm to expand revenue and earnings as we exit fiscal 2019.","Just as 5G launch dates were accelerated by one year from the original timeline, we also expect the pace of 5G adoption to meet or exceed that of 4G. The first mobile 5G network launches will begin in the second calendar quarter next year, and there will be commercial launches occurring simultaneously across North America, Europe, China, Japan, South Korea, and Australia. In total, we are working with more than 18 OEMs who have committed to launch 5G handsets in 2019 based on our 5G and our X50 modems. We believe that Qualcomm is the leader in 5G, with the ability to launch sub-6-gigahertz, millimeter wave, standalone and non-standalone 5G.","Furthermore, 5G brings an order of magnitude increase of complexity over 4G across spectrum, network dark architecture, RF front-end, device form factors, especially the millimeter wave frequencies, power consumption and application and AI processors. This complexity plays directly to Qualcomm's strength as an innovator and systems provider.","Priority number two is resolving our dispute with Apple. Regarding Apple, our view on the timeline to resolve our licensing dispute has not changed. We have previously highlighted key litigation milestones in fiscal 2019 that we believe could help drive a resolution. Those litigation milestones have not changed, including the potential for multiple patent infringement rulings in China and Germany before the end of this calendar year.","Aside from infringement of unlicensed intellectual property and other claims, including the recent product-related claims, there are billions of dollars in damages in the breach of contract claims against Apple's manufacturers. We expect a trial date to be set for that matter in San Diego during the early part of next year.","We have continued to have discussions with Apple to try and reach a resolution, and we remain focused on driving the appropriate value for our stockholders, either through settlement or litigation. Resolution of the outstanding licensing disputes represents significant value to our shareholders and provides the foundation for very strong earnings growth, separate and apart from the 5G opportunities we have described.","Priority number three is to execute well across our core product businesses. The strategic decisions we made to diversify our revenue in our mobile channel while expanding into adjacent opportunities is working. Our engagement with customers across multiple industries continues to expand, and our QCT business outside of Apple continues to grow.","Our Snapdragon 800 solutions continue to define the premium tier benchmarks, and we expanded our leadership to the high tiers with Snapdragon 700. Consistent with our expectations, the product mix is improving in the China region, and key Qualcomm China-based customers are gaining share globally, most recently in India and Europe.","In fiscal 2018, our non-Apple RF front-end revenue nearly doubled year over year, reflecting the full-year impact of the TDK acquisition and revenue growth across all key OEMs, leveraging one of the broadest portfolios of RF front-end products in the industry. Given our strong design win pipeline, we expect to grow RF front-end revenues by double-digit percentage in fiscal 2019.","In 4G, our RF front-end traction includes 80 module design wins across key OEMs such as Samsung, Google, Sony, LG, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, and OnePlus. Importantly, current commercial devices such as the Pixel 3, Pixel 3XL, Samsung Galaxy Book 2, and Sony ZX3 all have our complete RF front-end modem to antenna solution. We are pleased to have established RF front-end design wins at major accounts in a mature 4G technology cycle going against more than four RF front-end suppliers. This validates the competitiveness of our components across PAs, filters, switches, tuners, and modules.","In 5G, we are well-positioned with design wins at all our key Snapdragon 800 customers. The added complexity of 5G is also driving additional RF content per device, including combinations of sub-6-gigahertz and millimeter wave. As an example, a large number of 5G smartphones in the United States will require millimeter wave capabilities at launch.","Across our adjacent opportunities, we are continuing to see exciting traction for our technologies and products in these new growth industries. In auto, our integrated platforms are driving leadership and growth across telematics, infotainment, and in-car connectivity, with an order pipeline of more than $5 billion, up from $3 billion earlier this year.","We are leading 5G innovation in cars and have secured the world's first major 5G design win with a leading automaker, and we are working with numerous other automakers and Tier 1 suppliers to bring 5G to vehicles. Infotainment is a particularly strong story for us given our very strong long-term order pipeline with a broad set of key global customers.","In networking, we remain the number one share leader in retail and enterprise channels and continue to gain share. We are also number one in mesh Wi-Fi, which accounted for 50% of all U.S. retail Wi-Fi network equipment sales during the first half of 2018. In fiscal 2018, leveraging our success with Wi-Fi mesh, we have expanded into the carrier segment and have significant design traction headed into fiscal 2019.","Historically, we have benefited from technology transitions, and we are now driving industry adoption of 802.11ax, now called Wi-Fi 6, with more than 50 design wins in the pipeline. Looking ahead to 60-gigahertz Wi-Fi, we just announced the industry's first 802.11ay chipset, recently-announced 802.11ad devices from NETGEAR and ASUS, and are working with Facebook on the Terragraph project.","Turning to QTL, fiscal 2018 results were impacted by the disputes with Apple and its contract manufacturers as well as the other licensee. However, global 3G\/4G device trends were favorable, driven by strong trends in average selling prices. Our number of 5G licensing agreements is growing, with more than 20 agreements signed to date based on our previously-announced 5G licensing framework, including Meizu and Motorola Lenovo, and we have significantly more manufacturers in discussions for 5G agreements and amendments, positioning QTL for stability as the 5G transition gains momentum.","On regulatory matters, we are pleased to announce in August that we reached a court-approved settlement with the Taiwan FTC. As a result, the underlying decision was revoked and replaced by the terms of the resolution.","Regarding the U.S. FTC, we continue our discussions to work toward a resolution outside of the current litigation. Yesterday, the court issued a ruling in the case regarding licensing practices of certain standards organizations. This is a partial summary judgment ruling on one of the issues, and a full trial is still to come next year. In our view, the ruling is incorrect.","In addition to the product and technology actions I have discussed, we are driving operating leverage into our business by delivering on our operating expense commitments. With the potential resolution of our dispute with Apple in front of us, we believe there is a very substantial opportunity to grow value for our stockholders that is incremental to the strength of the current business. The combination of these elements leaves us well-positioned to drive stockholder value throughout fiscal 2019 and beyond.","Finally, I want to thank our employees for their hard work and focused execution throughout the past year. Our team has made great progress on our important strategic objectives, and we are extremely well-positioned for the upcoming transition to 5G and to grow into the many exciting new industries that are adding our leading-edge technologies to their products in fiscal 2019 and beyond.","I would now like to turn the call over to George.","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I will begin with comments on our fiscal fourth quarter and 2018 results, followed by our fiscal first quarter of 2019 guidance and some additional perspective on 2019 overall.","In our fiscal fourth quarter, results were strong, with revenues of $5.8 billion, above the midpoint of our guidance range, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.90, above the high end of our prior guidance range. Revenues benefited primarily from stronger than expected demand for chips from Chinese customers.","Non-GAAP EPS results exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.10. $0.06 of that impact was driven by operating performance in QCT and QTL and from lower operating expenses. The remaining $0.04 was driven by favorable tax impacts and lower share count from our repurchase activity.","QCT delivered revenues of $4.6 billion and an EBT margin of 17%, driven by strength in MSM chip shipments of 232 million, above the high end of our guidance range on stronger than expected demand from Chinese OEMs.","In QTL, revenues were $1.14 billion, in line with the midpoint of our guidance range, and EBT margin was 65%, better than expected, reflecting lower operating expenses, largely from litigation spending. We also recognized $100 million of revenue from the other licensee in dispute under the interim agreement.","In our fiscal fourth quarter, non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses were down 1% sequentially on cost reduction actions and lower than expected excess litigation expense more than offsetting the impact of an extra week of operations in the fiscal fourth quarter.","Our non-GAAP tax rate was a 1% benefit in the quarter, lower than our prior expectations, reflecting a modest benefit related to tax restructuring completed in the quarter.","Now, turning to fiscal 2018, non-GAAP revenues for the year were $22.7 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.69. We returned $26 billion to stockholders in fiscal 2018, including approximately $3.5 billion of cash dividends paid, an increase of 7% year over year, and $22.6 billion in share repurchases, largely via our accelerated programs, including a $5.1 billion Dutch auction and a $16 billion ASR. In terms of average price realized under the ASR, that will be based on ratable pricing over the term of the ASRs, which will run through August 2019.","Turning to 3G\/4G devices, for calendar year 2018, we continue to forecast approximately 1.8 billion to 1.9 billion 3G\/4G device shipments, growth of approximately 5% year over year at the midpoint. Our forecast for handset unit shipment growth in the year is approximately 100 million units lower than our forecast at the outset of the year on lower demand in both developed and emerging regions, particularly in China. Global device sales have been less impacted, as global handset ASPs have been better than expected, growing more than 10% year over year in fiscal 2018.","In QCT, we saw strong performance in fiscal 2018, with 8% year-over-year growth in earnings before tax dollars and EBT margin at 17%, with strong demand trends in China, particularly in the mid and high tiers, offsetting the impact of lower share at Apple.","In QTL, results in fiscal 2018 were significantly impacted by the disputes with Apple and the other licensee and by the related litigation costs. These dynamics mask the strong global device sales growth in fiscal 2018, as higher handset ASPs across multiple price tiers made up for the modest handset unit growth. Looking at handsets in the fiscal year, we estimate that global sales grew 13%, driven by 1% unit growth and 11% ASP growth.","Let's now turn to our financial outlook for the first fiscal quarter of 2019. We estimate fiscal first quarter revenues to be in the range of approximately $4.5 billion to $5.3 billion. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $1.05 to $1.15 per share.","Our first quarter estimate assumes continuing nonpayment of royalties by Apple and the other licensee. As we have noted on previous calls, the impact of these nonpayment of royalties has largely eliminated the seasonal effects that we would normally see in QTL. Our fiscal first quarter outlook also reflects the change in our share in Apple from approximately 50% modem share in our fiscal first quarter 2018 to zero share in the flagship launches in our first fiscal quarter 2019. We have also seen our RF front-end share at Apple drop in the current launch. I will discuss the impacts here in more detail shortly.","More than offsetting the demand and share impacts in the quarter is a one-time estimated benefit of approximately $0.45 of deferred tax asset impacts resulting from tax elections made in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as part of our previously announced tax restructuring.","We anticipate fiscal first quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses to be down approximately 5% to 7% sequentially, primarily reflecting one less week of operations. Our cost management efforts will be somewhat muted in the quarter due to timing of certain divestitures expected to be completed later in the fiscal year.","In QTL, we expect revenues of $1 billion to $1.1 billion in the fiscal first quarter. As a reminder, we are adopting revenue accounting standard 606 in the first quarter, which results in us moving from reporting QTL revenue in arrears to estimating revenues in the period our licensees sell their products. ASC 606 requires us to report revenue in a manner that will include an estimate of our QTL royalty revenues before all information is received from our licensees. This will lead to quarterly true-ups against reported numbers.","Despite the change in revenue recognition method, we continue to expect revenues to range between $1 billion and $1.1 billion quarterly in the near term, as we see more muted seasonality on the absence of Apple licensing revenues. This range also excludes any payments from the other licensee in dispute under the $700 million interim agreement signed in fiscal 2018. As a reminder, the final $100 million payment received under that interim agreement is being taken to retained earnings and not reported in the P&L as a result of the transition to ASC 606.","We expect fiscal first quarter QTL EBT margin to be approximately 53% to 57%, lower sequentially, reflecting the absence of the $100 million interim payment and a change in R&D cost allocations, which I will discuss shortly.","In QCT, we expect approximately 175 million to 195 million MSM chip shipments for the fiscal first quarter, down 20% sequentially at the midpoint, which is a result of one less week in the quarter, lower Apple legacy shipments, and lower demand from China on weaker sell-through following very strong demand in fiscal Q4.","Year over year in the first fiscal quarter, we see a large decrease in units, which is fully explained from both a unit and EBT basis by the loss of share in the new Apple devices. We expect the Apple share reduction to be most impactful in our fiscal first quarter. In fiscal 2018, Q1 units represented approximately 50% of the full-year MSM orders from Apple. Compared to the same quarter last year, Apple volumes are expected to be down 50 million to 55 million units.","We expect QCT EBT margin to be between 13% to 15% in the quarter, reflecting the lower MSM volumes and the impact from a lower mix of modem sales. We expect a recovery to high teens percentage in the second half of the fiscal year on improved product mix, the initial 5G launches, growth in adjacencies, and the impact of cost actions. We expect QCT's demand profile and EBT in the fiscal second quarter to reflect more muted seasonality, as the normal pullback in Q2 versus Q1 was historically heavily driven by Apple.","Non-GAAP interest expense net of investment and other income in the fiscal first quarter is expected to be approximately $100 million, which is a reasonable estimate for each of the remaining quarters in fiscal 2019. We forecast diluted weighted average shares for the first fiscal quarter to be approximately 1.23 billion.","Turning to 2019, as Steve mentioned, resolving our two licensee disputes is a key driver for fiscal 2019 performance. Upon resolution, we continue to forecast significant positive revenue and EPS impacts.","For calendar year 2019 3G\/4G\/5G device shipments, we are estimating approximately 1.9 billion to 2 billion units, up approximately 5% at the midpoint, reflecting low single-digit handset growth, driven primarily by migrations to 3G and 4G in emerging regions, and strong double-digit growth for non-handsets.","We currently see limited macroeconomic risk to our outlook from the trade dispute between China and the U.S., as there are currently tariff-related impacts on only a limited number of our revenue drivers. For Chinese imports to the U.S., some networking products will be subject to U.S. tariffs, potentially impacting end market demand if the incremental cost is passed to consumers. Cellular phones at present are not currently subject to U.S. tariffs, and for U.S. imports to China, ICs are not currently on the China tariff list.","In fiscal 2019, we expect relatively flat global handset average selling prices and low to mid-single-digit percentage handset sales growth year over year, with strength coming from the emerging regions, providing solid end market trends for QTL once the licensing disputes are resolved.","We are making some changes with respect to our allocation of certain technology items, predominantly in our corporate R&D spending. With the commercialization of 5G devices in 2019, the spend for device development will be reflected in QCT, consistent with past practice, and the technology development currently in corporate will largely be reflected in QTL. Also moving into QTL is a minority share of some IP technology items previously shown in QCT, but which are related to future technology.","The net effect of these changes will be decreased spend in our corporate expenses by approximately $500 million and an increase in QTL expenses of approximately the same amount. The increases and decreases in these R&D changes are solely related to location of reporting in the segments and are not related to the cost reduction program.","The cost program remains on track to deliver $1 billion in savings from our $7.4 billion baseline spend. At present, we are trending somewhat above the $6.4 billion run rate, as excess litigation expenses have increased relative to the baseline. However, we are on track to deliver the $1 billion in operating savings and expect additional savings post-licensing resolution as litigation costs will come down significantly.","We expect the net effects of the cost reduction in corporate and other plus the change in corporate R&D expense allocation and increased interest expense to result in savings of approximately $300 million in our Other segment outside of our core businesses in fiscal 2019.","Our forecast for our non-GAAP tax rate in fiscal 2019 is approximately 3% to 4% and reflects both the run rate tax impacts of tax reform and the fiscal first quarter impacts of our tax restructuring. Excluding the impact of the deferred tax asset item, we expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 15% for the year.","We expect fiscal 2019 weighted average diluted shares to be approximately 1.19 billion to 1.2 billion, lower year over year by approximately 280 million shares or 19% of shares outstanding on the full impact of our ASR, the Dutch tender, and open market repurchases.","In summary, we expect fiscal 2019 earnings to be heavily weighted toward the back half of the year, as the impacts of a number of factors increase over the next several quarters. We expect QCT to return to year-over-year earnings growth in the second half on growing China OEM share, initial 5G shipments, growth in adjacencies, and margin expansion. Our additional cost actions and share repurchases over the year will further lever our second half performance.","That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to John.","John T. Sinnott - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Thank you, George. Operator, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura. Please proceed with your question.","Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet","Yes, thank you. I was hoping you could talk about the dispute with Apple. We've noticed during the quarter that there were judgments in your favor, ITC, for example, but those judgments are coming without any injunctive relief. I'm just curious why this hasn't changed your timeline on resolution. It would seem like this dynamic would allow Apple to kick the can down the road for as long as they can.","Donald J. Rosenberg - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Romit, this is Don. I think you got it a little off. So the ITC ruling that you're referring to was the recommendation of the administrative law judge. We've previously given the dates, so that was the initial determination. That now goes to a final determination before the commission. It's true that he found infringement, which we were very pleased with, but he also decided that from his perspective, there shouldn't be an exclusion order issued. We obviously disagree with that, and we have the opportunity before the commission to convince them otherwise.","Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet","In China, what do you expect? Do you think it's going to play out like it has in the U.S., or do you think there could be more punitive actions, for example?","Donald J. Rosenberg - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Yeah, sorry. Your first part of your question, I think, was in China. You were asking about our actions in China?","Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet","Just the process in China and how that might compare to what we've seen so far here in the U.S.","Donald J. Rosenberg - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Sure, so I think as I've said in the past, we've got over 20 patent infringement cases in multiple jurisdictions in China, where the IP courts have shown to be very good at protecting intellectual property rights and issuing in many cases injunctions. And so we continue to press those cases, and we remain optimistic about the results of those. We've also, I should say, gone through multiple reviews of the validity of our patents that are at issue in those cases, and we have won all but one, I believe, so there are many validity findings already through the CIPO, the Chinese Intellectual Property Office.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great, thanks. George, I just wondered if you could walk us through some of the changes in your guidance. Earlier in the year when Broadcom was trying to buy you, you shared some financial targets for fiscal 2019. Now you've given us some startup guidance for the year that's going to be lower than those targets. Can you just maybe walk us through some of the things that might have changed, whether it's higher legal costs, a weaker smartphone market, maybe less of a buyback given the timing of NXP? Can you help us reconcile your guidance relative to the one earlier in the year? Thank you.","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Hi, Mike. Let me generally characterize it for you. And as we've discussed previously, the extension of the NXP contract, first from April and then to July, and then of course the termination last quarter and then the implementation of our capital return program in August, accounts for a material part of the difference, as accretion is still the biggest single difference in the share repurchase case versus NXP, which came with accretion on day one. And under the share repurchases, we've said it's the combination of the licensing resolution and the share repurchase can actually bring higher accretion than we would have seen with NXP.","I think in terms of just looking back to what we see now versus the beginning of last year, clearly we see a weaker handset market in both 2018 and 2019 than we saw at the beginning of the year, and I think that's one of the major factors. I think there's other minor factors like interest rates being higher. You've got some other factors like operating expenses related to what we were referring to as excess litigation being higher.","But the key point is the same elements that drove our earnings performance at $5.25 and actually the higher range, which is really how we have discussed our performance post-dispute resolution, those things are all still in front of us, even with a weaker handset market overall.","So the key thing is going to be resolution with Apple, and then of course, obviously the various implications of that resolution, whether it includes possible reengagement on products, and then of course, the ultimate accretion that comes with that. We also see, quite frankly, 5G, which ramps in 2020 and 2021, as providing further underpinning to that strong earnings potential.","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. If I could just go back to Don, you mentioned, or maybe Steve mentioned in the initial remarks about the FTC complaint and the initial decision and not agreeing with it. Could you just talk a little bit? Just a few of the questions I had, one, I thought Qualcomm had previously been licensing to modem suppliers since they're shipping in the market. And then second, is this potentially risking the whole license royalty rate based on system rather than chip? And then third, if you can just maybe talk about how the FTC may impact or may not impact some of the other Apple or ODM cases that are out there, that would be helpful. Thank you.","Donald J. Rosenberg - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Yeah, sure. So the first \u2013 let me go back to the order. The first question was with respect to \u2013 no, the modem was the third question, wasn't it? Yeah, with respect to the ITC?","John T. Sinnott - QUALCOMM, Inc.","No, I think it was the FTC.","Donald J. Rosenberg - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Sorry, the FTC.","John T. Sinnott - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Could you go ahead and repeat your question so we make sure we get the proper answer?","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Sure, it was the FTC. Were you previously licensing to modem suppliers since they are selling to market, what's the impact of a potential decision on chip level versus device level? And then what's the relationship with this case potentially and anything with Apple or the other ODMs?","Donald J. Rosenberg - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Sorry, I've got it now. So on modem licensing, your assumption was right. That is to say that competitive chip makers have been free to sell their chips to device makers. Our practice has been because we license to device makers that competitive chip suppliers can sell to licensed device makers and not have to pay us a license fee, and that's been the case for many, many years. There was a time long ago when we provided some non-exhaustive licenses to some chip makers, but that was in the past.","So your point is well taken because there was no need for a license \u2013 there is no need for a license on the component level as long as the device makers are licensed, which the industry has practiced since the very beginning of industry practice here. The primary standards bodies have constantly reiterated device-level licensing is the norm, and every player in the industry has followed that process. So that's why I say I think the judge respectfully got it wrong here, and we're looking forward to an opportunity for a full trial later in January.","I think I've answered your second question as well, so I'll pass that one. And in terms of the impact, there really is, on ODMs and other Apple situations, there's no immediate impact here. We have licenses, as you know, which remain valid. This is a partial summary judgment, which the judge decided a particular issue in this case. It's not a final judgment, and so we'll just continue advocating our position in court and continue to have multiple licenses around the world, as you know.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, thank you.","Alexander Rogers - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Hey, Tim. This is Alex. I'm calling in remotely. Let me just jump in very quickly. On the royalty rate issue, one of the things I think is important to remember is that our licensing program with respect to essential patents in cellular is really properly valued at the system level and the device level. And so the value of this intellectual property is realized at that level, and that doesn't change by virtue of this particular partial summary judgment ruling.","The other thing I think is important to keep in mind is that we've dealt with similar issues like this before, for example, in the TFTC matter, and we found a way to resolve it there in a way that's not disruptive to the licensing business and satisfactory to the TFTC obviously. So I just wanted to add a couple of those additional points.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, thanks for the extra color.","Steven M. Mollenkopf - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Tim, this is Steve. Also, I would just add. In all of, I would say, the legal detail, I want to make sure the point is not lost. Really our focus here in the near term is really how do we settle the FTC case. It's been public that we've had some discussions in that regard. And that's really where the focus is right now, and there's nothing really in that order that we think complicates that or keeps us from doing that. And in the meantime, we're really not compelled to do anything differently with the business. But that's really where the focus is. Hopefully, that isn't lost in the discussion as well.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you, I have two as well. I guess first off, to get towards the high teens operating margin target for QCT, what sort of MSM unit expectations do you have on the back of this? I'm just trying to understand. To go from low teens to high teens, how much of this is going to be volume-driven versus some of the cost take-out benefits that you guys are already implementing? That would be helpful.","And then the second question, I think ahead of the FTC, ahead of the judge giving you this preliminary judgment, I think Qualcomm and the FTC had asked for a 30-day deferral to reach some sort of settlement. Does the ruling by the judge in any way prevent you guys from getting to some sort of settlement with the FTC away from the courts? And is that a likely option over the next six to nine months for you guys? Thank you.","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Amit, hi. This is George. I'll cover the MSM. We're seeing both benefits more from mix in our MSM outlook in the second half versus the first half, not so much a volume question, although it's good. But we're continuing to see a trend that we've seen before, which is a very strong volume move from low and mid up into the high and premium tiers, and that continues. And that also relates to the timing of launches in China, which Cristiano is probably better to comment on. Of course, we still expect to see some additional benefit from the cost program as well.","Cristiano R. Amon - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Maybe I'll just make a small comment and hand it over to I think Don on the FTC question. So, Amit, also at the very tail end of fiscal 2019, that's when we're going to start to see the ramp of some of the 5G devices. And it's meaningful volume in fiscal 2020, but the initial launches will also happen at the very end of 2019 fiscal for us. Thank you.","Donald J. Rosenberg - QUALCOMM, Inc.","And I think your question was does the partial summary judgment ruling affect our continuing settlement discussions. And I think as Steve just indicated, we have ongoing settlement discussions with the FTC and we will continue those discussions with the FTC.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I'd like to know why you're including a discrete tax benefit in your Q1 non-GAAP earnings. Did you know it was there when you gave the guidance for 2019 last year? And does that benefit, $0.45, go toward the $5.25 EPS target that your compensation is based on? And if so, why is that there?","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Hi, Stacy. The timing of the tax adjustment item relates to the timing of the tax restructuring that we've taken. And that's been a process that has been continually under review over the last several months, but it really relates and reflects the timing of the actions.","In terms of the compensation, we still are very focused on delivering the numbers that we have talked about and that the board has based the compensation plan for management. And I think the one-time items are not the driving factor in delivering that business or those business results.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Brett Simpson with Arete Research. Please proceed with your question.","Brett Simpson - Arete Research Services LLP","Yes, thanks very much, a question for George. I think earlier this year during the Broadcom situation, you guided on adjacency revenue for fiscal 2019 at $7 billion to $8 billion from QCT. Can you give us an update on this? Just give us some sense as to what the December quarter looks like for adjacencies and how you see fiscal 2019 now playing out.","And maybe, George, can you give us some insight in terms of QCT sales overall for fiscal 2019? Just now you've given some guidance for December quarter, why we can't get a revenue guide overall for fiscal 2019 for QCT. Thank you.","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","So adjacencies, when we look at the previous forecast, probably the biggest difference is we've seen slower adjacent growth in 2018 than we had forecasted. We start to see recovery to that growth rate in 2019. We also have seen our RF front-end business, which had an Apple component, which was in that forecast, all of that business has moved away from our front-end group. Despite that, absent that, there's been strong growth outside of Apple.","In terms of the mix, though, as we've seen some of the favorable business trends that Steve talked about, not only in the win area but in the IoT and in auto, we're actually seeing far less margin EBT impact from the slower growth than what we had forecasted as opposed to what we saw in 2018.","With respect to guidance on revenue, our practice, consistent with really what the rest of the industry does, is to give it a quarter out.","Brett Simpson - Arete Research Services LLP","And maybe just to confirm, can you give us any sense as to \u2013 you said $7 billion or $8 billion earlier this year. Can you give us a range or any insights on adjacencies for fiscal 2019 now? I understand it's slower growth.","And maybe just a separate question for Cristiano. On 5G, when you talk about Snapdragon 800 wins and the RF opportunity as well, can you maybe just frame? What is the revenue opportunity per 5G phone when you're selling a Snapdragon 800 and the RF, the complete RF front end for 5G? Thank you.","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Again, we're not providing an updated guide against the $7 billion to $8 billion. The biggest difference between the range and what we see today is really slower growth in IoT and the impact of the Apple change in our front-end business. But from \u2013 again, when I look at the EBT impact relative to our expectation to get to the earnings potential that we talked about, it's a very minor impact overall.","Cristiano R. Amon - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Hi, Brett. This is Cristiano. On 5G, we expect 5G to be a significant expansion, even on existing units, both in revenue and earnings for QCT, but also likely to be an expansion of share. And we see two drivers. One is we have a lot more content in the device. Besides the performance of a premium-tier application processor and the 5G modem, we also have high traction on the RF front-end design, including the incremental value you get from millimeter wave modules, which is going to be very important. Certain markets, for example, the United States, will require millimeter wave. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.","Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys. You gave guidance before for expense cuts of $1 billion. Can you discuss the linearity? Should we expect a drop in expenses early in the year, or is it going to be even throughout the year? That's for modeling purpose.","Second, your guidance for next quarter for MSM shipments was lower than expectations, I believe, that are in line with the Street. Can you discuss the areas of strength and the areas of weakness as you see it next quarter? And how do you refer to the reports about global weakness in demand for smartphones? Thanks.","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Great. So on the operating expense linearity, we expect to continue to see operating expenses coming down over the year and more in the back half than we would normally see in a cost reduction program just because of the timing of some of the divestitures that are a part of it but not a key and driving part of it. The other part is just the timing of some roadmap items and when it made sense to take certain actions. So overall, we're very confident that we're on track for that.","In terms of the MSM share, maybe I'll just comment on the big deltas. I think the year-over-year is, in some ways, most instructive because that's where you really see the Apple effect. And we're down in the first quarter 55 million units versus where we were last year in the same quarter with Apple, and that's really the effect of zero share.","One of the things that I think has made the impact of that harder to see is that, in 2018, we saw very strong demand increase in China, and at the same time, the mix of that demand improved in the high and premium tier. And so the impact of going from 100% to 50% share last year was really addressed by the growth of the non-Apple business. Obviously, this quarter we don't have that same benefit. So you're seeing a front-loaded \u2013 which is how Apple ordered last year \u2013 so comparatively, a front-loaded Apple environment that we're not participating in.","Cristiano R. Amon - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Maybe I'm just going to add one thing. This is Cristiano, Tal. So if you remove the Apple effect, the seasonality we see in 2019 is very similar to what we saw in 2018. And I think as George outlined, when you look on the MSM shipments versus Street, if you look at it \u2013 because, as George said, Apple front-loaded 50 million to 55 million units, you see the strength for the MSM is still with the growth on the non-Apple business. And that's why we're going to continue to see that as we go to the second half when we don't have that Apple impact anymore.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. I had two. George, so just going back to the guidance for fiscal 2019, so is the apples-to-apples number now $4.80 versus the original $5.25 baseline? Is that right?","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","So, Tim, we're not re-guiding 2019 against the numbers. Again, the largest delta as I look at where we are versus \u2013 and again, it depends on whether you're looking at a $5.25 case that had NXP coming in on day one or how do we get to the higher range that we talked about back in January of 2018. It comes down to, again, the largest part of that being the timing effect of when the share repurchase activity started, and also the impact of getting the accretion that comes with a resolution, which then I think we're in a much stronger position. Otherwise, the biggest difference is really the market is a little bit weaker than we had expected before, and the balance being things like, such as I said, the slower growth in adjacents, actually a little bit higher interest rates having an impact, and slightly higher tax rates having an impact.","Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, George. Thanks. And then there's a lot of moving parts obviously with Apple, but it seems like every call we hear more about a potential for an injunction in China. Maybe that's why they don't want to talk about units anymore, but I'm wondering. What is the catalyst for you to get an injunction? Is it a single one of these infringement cases going your way, which sounds like it might happen this quarter? So I guess the question is could you get an injunction before the end of this year? Thanks.","Donald J. Rosenberg - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Hi, this is Don. Yes, as I mentioned, there are over 20 cases that we've filed in various jurisdictions within China. And the vehicle for an injunction is we request an injunction as part of the case. China, unlike some other countries, actually will issue even preliminary injunctions and not wait through a full trial for permanent injunction. But as I said earlier too, they also have a parallel process where the patent office reviews patents for validity, and we've been very successful so far there. So as soon as we get an infringement judgment in our favor, there is a real chance of injunctive relief there.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I had two. First on the MSM side dropping 20%, George, you've said there were a number of things, Apple, extra week, et cetera. Can you just talk about \u2013 even if I took the Apple out, on a year-over-year basis it looks like the MSMs are flat to very slightly up. Given the dynamics of taking share in China, I'm surprised that it's not a little bit better than that, so any color on that.","And the second unrelated question is on your tax commentary, not for the quarter, but you indicated it would be 15%, I think, for the rest of the fiscal year after fiscal 1Q. Is that correct? And how does that tax rate of 15% change after you resolve the two outstanding disputes?","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","So let me \u2013 maybe I'll start with the tax rate first. You're correct. It's 15% on the remaining quarters, which gets you at roughly 3% to 4% for the full year given the tax benefit in the first quarter. Effectively, the tax restructuring is bringing our offshore revenue onshore, and most of that revenue is going to be subject to the FDII rate, the foreign-derived income rate, which is 13% as opposed to the statutory rate of 21%.","And so I think, as we said, I think the mid-teens is still a good number to think about in terms of modeling because of that. The 15% you get pulled up a little bit because not everything falls into that bucket, and so you get pulled up a little on rate from the FDII rate.","In terms of the MSMs, I want to make sure I understand. Are you talking about sequential or year over year? Because it's a very different story as we look at sequential versus year over year.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","On year-over-year you're guiding to 185 million units at the midpoint. And if my model is right, I think you did 237 million in the same quarter a year ago. So if I just did the math of taking the 50 million to 55 million units that you said from Apple out of the equation, it seems like you're still only talking 180 million \u2013 182 million units.","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Now I've got your question. So the difference \u2013 one of the differences, we're seeing some lower demand in China. As we said Q4, part of our outperformance in Q4 was high and premium tier devices in China. And so we're seeing that come down a little bit as sell-through for some of our customers was below expectations. So there's a little bit of a digestion period, and I think that's part of why it looks like we're not getting as much pickup year over year potentially from the growth in China. And by the way, Q1 last year was not a bad quarter for China units either.","Operator","Thank you. This ends our allotted time for questions and answers. Mr. Mollenkopf, do you have anything further to add before adjourning the call?","Steven M. Mollenkopf - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Thanks. I just wanted to thank everybody for joining us on the call today. We're on the cusp of I think some very big industry transitions that we're well-positioned for' 5G, the ramp of our RF front-end business, and of course, the ramp of the design-in pipeline, particularly in auto. I just want to thank the teams for their hard work. They never took their eye off the ball this year, and I think we're really well positioned as a result going into 5G. Thank you, everyone.

Jacobs","Thanks, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased to report record revenues, earnings per share and MSM shipments this quarter driven by increased demand for smartphones and data-centric devices across an expanding number of regions and price points. It was a very successful quarter, and we're pleased to be raising our financial outlook for fiscal 2012. QCT continues to execute and is well positioned to take advantage of the many opportunities ahead. ","We announced the expansion of our Snapdragon S4 processor road map, demonstrated Windows 8 running on an MSM8960-based device over LTE and had several partners launch noteworthy devices based on our solutions. Our Licensing business had another strong quarter as well, driven by the global adoption of smartphones and other connected devices. ","QTL continues to grow and expand its base of licensees. We now have over 205 CDMA licensees in more than 15 single-mode OFDMA licensees. The global migration from 2G to 3G, and the increase in the variety and number of smartphones and other device types at multiple price tiers positions QTL for strong growth in fiscal 2012. ","We continue to make advancements with our mirasol Display technology and announced the launch of eReader products with 4 different partners in the last 90 days. Now these products are being supported from our development fab. We're on track to bring our commercial fab online later this year. ","On the mobile health front, we announced the launch of Qualcomm Life in our 2net platform. We expect that this platform will help accelerate adoption of a variety of new mobile health-related devices and services. Further, the Qualcomm Foundation, partnering with the X PRIZE Foundation, also announced the launch of the $10 million Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize, which is a global competition with the goal of helping drive development of diagnostic devices that will give consumers access to their state of health in the palm of their hand. ","And just after the close of our first fiscal quarter, we completed the sale of our 700 MHz Spectrum in the United States to AT&T for $1.9 billion, and we're now working with them to provide supplemental downlink technology that they intend to deploy in that spectrum to deliver faster downloads in greater capacity on their LTE network. ","Looking forward, we continue to see favorable trends across the key growth drivers for our business. First, with respect to handsets, there continues to be strong consumer demand for smartphones across all key regions. According to Gartner, worldwide smartphone sales reached 477 million units in calendar year 2011, up approximately 60% year-over-year. Second, the 2G to 3G migration remains strong in emerging regions. According to Wireless Intelligence, in the December quarter, 3G connections in emerging regions grew greater than 45% year-over-year. ","They also forecast that China will surpass 1 billion mobile connections before the end of the March quarter, and that 3G will soon account for 25% of the country's connections, driven by increased operator subsidies, as well as increased availability and consumer demand for smartphones. According to Gartner, China is currently the world's #2 region in terms of quarterly smartphone sales and is poised to become the leading consumer of smartphones in the world. Now recently I attended China Telecom's annual supply chain conference where they announced that they expect demand for 80 million 3G handsets on their CDMA network in calendar year 2012, of which 45 million are expected to be EV-DO smartphones. ","A third growth driver is the opportunity beyond handsets, including the adoption of 3G, 4G connectivity and devices such as tablets, eReaders, machine-to-machine and gaming devices. According to certain industry analysts, non-handset mobile broadband device shipments are estimated to grow at a 40% compound annual growth rate from 2010 through 2015. ","We also see an exciting opportunity for the adoption of our Snapdragon processors in the mobile computing and the consumer electronics space. Lenovo's recent K91 smart TV announcement, powered by a Snapdragon processor, demonstrates the breadth of capability that our products have, and we continue to make significant investments in these areas.","The fourth key driver is to continue deployment of advanced network technologies to handle the accelerating consumer demand for wireless data. I have regular discussions with leading operators as they consider alternative ways to address the expected growth in data traffic on their networks. Across the world, we see operators continuing to invest in enhancements to their 3G networks, seek new spectrum, as well as deploy LTE. According to the GSA, LTE is now commercial in 49 networks across 29 countries. ","And finally, we see the expansion of connectivity as an important incremental growth driver for our business, consistent with our vision of a world where almost everything around us is connected. At CES, we demonstrated examples of our vision of a connected home. We announced expansions of our Qualcomm Atheros product portfolio to address these future opportunities. ","On the legal front, as we noted in our 10-Q, which was filed today, on January 27, 2012, we learned that the U.S. Attorney's office in San Diego and the DOJ have begun a preliminary investigation regarding the company's compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. We believe we are in compliance with the requirements of the FCPA, and we will continue to cooperate with this investigation and look forward to resolving this matter. ","To conclude, we have completed another outstanding quarter at Qualcomm, driven by a continued 2G to 3G migration, smartphone adoption and continued strong execution across our businesses. And looking forward, I'm pleased with our outlook for continued strong revenue and earnings growth in fiscal 2012. ","That concludes my comments, and I will now turn the call over to Steve Mollenkopf.","Steven M. Mollenkopf","Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. Our QCT business delivered another strong quarter with record MSM shipments, revenue and operating profit. Growth in global demand for 3G and 4G smartphones, along with share growth across our chipset portfolio, helped to drive these strong results. ","We shipped a record 156 million MSMs, up 32% year-over-year, and we are pleased to be shipping our chipset solutions to all major handset manufacturers. Our volumes continue to grow at a rate in excess of 4G, 3G device growth, and our strategy to drive smartphones further into all tiers through the expansion of our Snapdragon chipset road map continues to gain traction with our customer base. ","Snapdragon shipments grew by more than 120% year-over-year in the December quarter, and there are now more than 340 announced Snapdragon-based devices with over 400 more in design, and we continue to grow our design pipeline with increasing momentum at key Tier 1 multinational and developing OEM accounts. Our S1 Snapdragon products targeted for lower-priced smartphones showed strong growth during the quarter, particularly in China. ","Our shipments to developing Chinese accounts grew more than 10x year-over-year and in total, compare favorably to shipments to China-based multinational accounts, reflecting the overall growth and diversification of our customer base in the region. Our MSM 8960, the flagship of our Snapdragon S4 family, is now shipping commercially to customers as scheduled. Volume production is ramping, and we are seeing strong OEM demand for that chipset even above our prior expectations. We are starting to see the first 8960 device announcements by our partners, including the Lenovo IdeaTab and the ASUS Padfone, both announced at the Consumer Electronics Show last month, and there are now over 120 S4-based devices in design, and many more partner announcements are expected in the coming months. ","The majority of these OEMs are designing in our integrated connectivity, including Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth and FM into these devices. At CES last month, we demonstrated a prerelease version of Microsoft Windows 8 running on the S4 MSM 8960, showcasing the integrated multimode 3G LTE modem connected via AT&T's live network. Our technology breadth combined with our ability to integrate these technologies into a broad and deep road map is a clear competitive differentiator for us. We continue to make investments upstream of new opportunities, positioning us for leadership at the front end as they develop. We see that taking place now with our strength in LTE and believe we are investing to be positioned well for the Windows 8 opportunity. ","We are on track to sample the next two 28-nanometer chipsets in our Snapdragon S4 family of products. The dual-core MSM 8930, which will enable 3G LTE smartphones at high-volume price points, and the quad-core APQ 8064, which will support high-end smartphones, tablets and Windows 8 devices. These chipsets exemplify our strategy of rapidly extending new technologies and chipset features across multiple price tiers. ","Fiscal year 2012 is off to a strong start, and we are pleased with the demand profile and design pipeline that we have in place, as well as the opportunity that lies ahead in mobile computing. ","That concludes my remarks, and I would now like to turn the call over to Bill Keitel.","William E. Keitel","Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. We had another quarter of record results, and we are pleased to be raising our estimates for fiscal 2012 revenue and earnings per share. Our first quarter revenues of $4.7 billion were a record high, up 40% year-over-year and at the high end of our prior guidance. Non-GAAP operating income was a record $1.87 billion, up 32% year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share was a record $0.97, up 18% year-over-year, both exceeding the high end of our prior guidance. ","We shipped a record 156 million MSM chipsets during the quarter, also exceeding the high end of our prior guidance, and QCT's operating margin was 24%, driven by strong demand for our portfolio of smartphone chipsets. Total reported device sales from our licensees for the September quarter were a record $41.4 billion, at the high end of our prior guidance. We estimate that our licensees' total reported device sales was comprised of $191 million to $195 million 3G, 4G device shipments at an average selling price of $212 to $218 per unit. Based on the midpoint, the average selling price of such devices increased 4% sequentially, driven by higher average selling prices of handsets in emerging regions and data dongles comprising a lower percentage of total units, partially offset by approximately $4 per unit of unfavorable foreign exchange. ","QTL's operating margin was 88%, driven by record total reported device sales. Non-GAAP investment income was $191 million, including $45 million in gains from put options in our stock sold in fiscal 2011 as part of our stock repurchase program. Operating cash flow was approximately $1.8 billion during the first quarter, and cash and marketable securities totaled $22 billion. ","During the first quarter, we returned $461 million to stockholders, including cash dividends of $362 million and $99 million to repurchase 2 million shares. On January 10, we announced another cash dividend of $0.215 per share payable on March 23 to stockholders of record as of March 2.","First quarter non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.08, above the midpoint of our prior guidance. QCT contributed $0.05. QTL contributed $0.02, and the remaining $0.01 was primarily from better-than-expected investment income. We estimate that 770 million to 795 million 3G, 4G devices were shipped in calendar 2011. Based on the 783 million midpoint of that range, we estimate that calendar 2011 3G, 4G device shipments grew approximately 20% year-over-year. ","Now turning to our guidance. We are raising our estimate for 3G, 4G device shipments to between 875 million and 945 million in calendar 2012, an increase of approximately 10 million units over our prior guidance and up 16% year-over-year at the midpoint. We are raising our fiscal 2012 revenue guidance by approximately $700 million on the strength of our QTL and QCT business segments. We now expect fiscal 2012 revenues to be $18.7 billion to $19.7 billion, up approximately 27 -- 28% year-over-year at the midpoint. ","We are raising our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance by $0.13. We now anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.55 to $3.75, up approximately 14% year-over-year at the midpoint. We are also raising our guidance for GAAP earnings per share by $0.56, reflecting strength in our core operations, as well as the $1.2 billion gain on the sale of our spectrum to AT&T at the outset of the second fiscal quarter.","We now expect GAAP earnings per share of $3.36 to $3.56, up approximately 37% year-over-year at the midpoint. We estimate the average selling price of 3G, 4G devices would be approximately $204 to $216 in fiscal 2012, above our prior estimate of $197 to $209, reflecting higher-than-expected average selling prices in multiple regions, partially offset by approximately $1 per unit of unfavorable foreign exchange. ","We expect the combination of non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to increase approximately 18% year-over-year, driven primarily by increased R&D investments in our QCT business. For fiscal 2012, our guidance for QTL and QCT operating margins is unchanged. We expect QTL's operating margin for the fiscal year to be 86% to 88%, and we expect QCT's operating margin for this fiscal year to be 20% to 22%. We estimate our non-GAAP annual tax rate to be approximately 18% and 19% for fiscal 2012.","Now turning to the second fiscal quarter. We estimate revenues of $4.6 billion to $5 billion, up approximately 24% year-over-year at the midpoint, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.91 to $0.97, up approximately 9% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect GAAP earnings per share of $1.20 to $1.26, up approximately $0.42 sequentially at the midpoint, including approximately $0.44 from the gain of our spectrum sale to AT&T. ","We expect total reported device sales by our licensees to be $47.5 billion to $51.5 billion, up 24% year-over-year and up 20% sequentially at the midpoint. We anticipate QCT shipments of 146 million to 154 million MSM chips during the March quarter, down a bit sequentially at the midpoint coming off the busy holiday quarter, but up 27% year-over-year. Our estimate for CDMA channel inventory is consistent with our prior expectations remaining at the lower end of the 13 to 18-week range through fiscal 2012.","We anticipate second quarter non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses combined will increase approximately 9% sequentially, reflecting increased seasonal expenses, notably employer payroll taxes. As we said last quarter, while we estimate that the implied royalty rate you calculate based on the information we provide will be in the range of 3.4% to 3.5% for fiscal year 2012, you will continue to see quarterly variations in the rate based on a variety of factors that we have discussed in the past. At this time, we do expect that the implied rate will decline sequentially in Q2 based primarily on the fact that fixed Licensing fees and infrastructure royalties are growing at a much slower pace than the strong growth in total reported device sales by our licensees. ","We also estimate that QCT's operating margin for Q2 will be at the low end of the 20% to 22% range we have provided for fiscal 2012. The midpoint of our fiscal second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is $0.03 lower sequentially. Based on this midpoint, we estimate that QTL will be $0.08 better, reflecting strong device smartphone shipments for the holiday quarter, and we estimate that QCT will be lower by $0.05, reflecting typical seasonality. The remaining $0.06 decrease is driven by operating expense growth and lower forecasted investment income.","That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren Kneeshaw.","Warren Kneeshaw","Thank you, Bill. Operator, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Tim Long with Bank of Montreal.","Tim Long - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","On the Chipset business, if I could. First on the gross margins, Bill, it looks like, back of the envelope here, it looks like they declined again sequentially. Are we going to see continued gross margin pressure on the Chipset business? And then on the ASPs, if you could just touch on what drove them down in the December quarter, and should we expect the typical March -- I think you do some repricing where there's a price down in the March quarter?","William E. Keitel","Sure, Tim. On the gross margins, we're seeing both first quarter and second quarter unfold largely as we expected at the outset of the year and consistent with the strategy we've had in place now for a good year plus. There is some more pressure on the gross margin, but volume side is offsetting pretty well on the operating margin level. ASPs on average per chip, I don't expect a lot of change going into Q2 relative to what we reported here in Q1. There will be, I think, a modest change. But overall, I don't expect a lot of change, in fact, based on our outlook here for the rest of the year. We do expect QCT to report a sequential decrease in operating margin percent going into Q2 as we've seen in prior quarters. And as typical, I think everybody understands that this is a time of year when we typically have our pricing resets.","Operator","Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of follow-ups. First, Steve, I think you said that demand for the MSM 8960 is exceeding expectations, and I just wanted to clarify if that's because the customers that you've won are ordering higher volumes than you expected or if it's because you're getting more customer wins than you expected? And then, Bill, I just wanted to clarify in terms of your full year 3G, 4G unit, raised by about 10 million, if you can just expand a bit on the sources of that upside.","Steven M. Mollenkopf","It's really a combination of both. What we're seeing is, I think, consistent with my comments about increased demand for LTE across the portfolio. So we're seeing that being pulled through on the 8960, as well as the -- I think there's also demand for the new CPU core that we have in there as well. So it's become a very successful chip for us in terms of design pipeline.","William E. Keitel","Simona, on the full year 3G, 4G units. Yes, our range has increased approximately 10 million at the low and the high end. And that 10 million changes, the primary driver is China. As you noted in Paul's remarks, that market is particularly strong for smartphones here of late. But we're seeing strength elsewhere beyond that. Latin America -- I would say, first of all, more on the emerging regions. But Latin America, and parts of Middle East, Asia and Africa, we're seeing strength.","Operator","Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity.","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Steve, just building on that last question. With strong share gains for QCT during the December quarter, can you just update us on some areas for content share gains as you go through the year? For example, our checks are showing like Qualcomm's integrated solutions doing very well in kind of the mid-tier mass-market smartphones. How do you see kind of your apps profits pull through with the 8960? And then also if you could talk on your connectivity business for 8960, that would be great.","Steven M. Mollenkopf","Sure, Mike. It's really been across the board. We've been really telling a story in our strategy that we thought that the combination of the high-end modem feature set, which would be LTE and the high-end AP was something that we really felt would move together in the market, and we've seen evidence of that happening. We had the Fusion chipsets really strong at the high end of the product line. You've seen some of the big OEMs take that and really transition their product line toward us in that respect. We've also seen, particularly into emerging markets and some of the new accounts that we've been able to acquire, particularly in China, a demand for really mass-market smartphones, particularly in China across several different operators. And then in addition, we've been shipping really into some new larger accounts that have been important for the business as well. So it's really a case where things have been happening across the board. We think this broad technology play, as well as integration, will be something that will help us in the future as well. A good example of that was the comments that I made about the connectivity business in reference to your question. If you look at the number of 8960 design wins that we have, really the majority of them are going to be using our integrated connectivity as well. So we think that, that strategy continues to play in addition to what we've seen in the past. We think it's a good strategy moving forward as well.","Operator","Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank.","Brian T. Modoff - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A question for Steve. So the China business, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing from a design win standpoint. Our checks are indicating you're capturing over half the designs in China with regard to -- as those vendors shift over to 3G, can you kind of talk around that number? And Bill, how do you see, as you've seen more of these kind of mid and low-end smartphones hitting the market, how that might affect your gross and operating margins in that business overall. And then if I can get an update on the timing of your TD-SCDMA product for China as well, I'd appreciate that.","Steven M. Mollenkopf","Sure, Brian. In answer to your first question about the emerging accounts for us in China, we were first mover to integrated smartphone chipsets in the emerging markets, and I think that's been an area that's been able to -- what we've been able to sustain that in terms of design wins, which I mentioned in my remarks how those accounts have really been growing in terms of shipments. And now the size of them they really are pretty close to where we are with some of the larger multinationals in China. So we're quite pleased with how that's working. We think that continues to be a technology battle there. We have a pretty deep road map. Our strategy there will be to, as you know, to just continue to push our integration strategy. Integrated connectivity is also important in that market as well. So we're going to continue moving that forward and are pleased with the initial results though.","Donald J. Rosenberg","Brian, it's Don. On the mid to low-end smartphone space, obviously, that's been very much a target of ours for more than the last year now. Last year, we priced the chipset products pretty aggressively to help build up that space and seemed to work pretty well. And the year from a margin standpoint QCT pretty much unfolded as we had expected. So now we're starting to ramp more into that business, continue to be aggressive on the price, bringing the 28-nanometer mark to market, which hopefully, in future years, that's going to lead to a little bit better margin potential for us. On the Licensing side, this mid to low-end market in smartphones is thus far proving pretty positive for QTL, and it's not a small part of our optimism really with the strength of ASPs going forward for the rest of this year. So we're pretty pleased with this mid to low-end smartphone market.","Steven M. Mollenkopf","And, Brian, in answer to your question about TD-SCDMA, this is Steve again. It's really the same timing that we mentioned in New York in November. Our TD-SCDMA products, we think will be delivered at the end of this year in terms of products in the market. There's a couple different chipsets that have that including our S4 family of chipsets, as well as our 28-nanometer modem designs called 9x15. So those are on track and continue to move forward.","Operator","Tal Liani with Bank of America.","Eric A. Ghernati - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Eric Ghernati for Tal. A few questions here. First for Paul, we haven't talked to you since then, and since the Analyst Meeting that TS, Intel obviously, talked about some LTE [ph] and a couple of design wins and there were a few benchmarks. If you can just walk us through your thought process now that you've seen a few benchmarks from Intel. And then a couple of questions for Bill, if you don't mind. First if you can disclose what the ASPs did for QCT, sorry, for MSMs. And secondarily, off of the Q2 trough in QCT operating margins, how much do you think is coming from -- how much should we expect as far as gross margin improvements over next 2 or 3 quarters shall we say? Midpoint of your EBIT margin of 20%, 22%.","Paul E. Jacobs","So yes, we saw the announcements that were made by Intel at CES. And some of the guys got around to see some -- how the products were operating and talking to some of the -- some of the partners. So I think we still feel extremely strongly that we're in a good position relative to power and performance, relative to them. If you look at the difference in the number of design wins, I think that really does tell the story pretty directly. And the other thing that I think you may have seen at CES was us demonstrating 8960-based Windows 8 tablets. And when I said to the audience that it didn't have a fan, I think we got a lot of knowing chuckles. So we feel good about that opportunity. It's going to certainly be a lot of competition coming, but we're excited about what's ahead of us.","Operator","Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Steve, if I can try and dissect the -- your chips a little bit. X -- you have your largest customer, the fruit one, and we look at your baseband business. So x Snapdragon and x this new customer. Is that baseband business kind of growing -- still growing with the market? Or is that beginning to decline? And then when I do the math, it looks like your Snapdragon chips were still very strong but may have fallen sequentially, I calculate falling around 15% to 20% sequentially, yet your operating margin went up 2 points from 22 to 24. So does that mean that the profitability of your basebands, which seems to be a mix towards basebands this quarter, may have actually been stronger than people think and that with just basebands, you can keep your margins up higher? And then finally, the S4 platform, as that comes out, how should we be looking at this? Is this just the next version of your chips? Or is it really kind of a game changer in the sense that it puts you up ahead of -- from everyone and it will allow you to gain share? And how should we be thinking about the impact of all the S4 devices on the P&L?","Paul E. Jacobs","We're -- so forgive me if I don't touch all of it. The -- let me answer the first -- last part first, which is I think on the S4, you should really look at it as 2 things. One is, it's the next chip in our family. But as we've been saying over the years, each chipset becomes more integrated, more complex, probably more difficult to do, actually, unless you have a very broad set of technologies. In this case, we've combined really a full-scale modem upgrade, connectivity upgrade and computing upgrade, and we're really very pleased with how the market has received that. So we really look at it as a pretty big step up in terms of integration and functionality. And then on its heels, as I mentioned in my remarks, we're rapidly tiering that product family so that, well, now -- in addition to delivering at the high end, we're also delivering across multiple tiers, really above and below. That's the strategy we've had for many years across the modem, and now we're bringing that into mobile computing as well. I apologize. I actually can't recall the first half of your question.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","It was on, are your basebands, x, so I'll just say Apple, and x your Snapdragon chips. So just basebands. Is that growing with the market? Or is that declining? And your Snapdragon chips seem to have fallen sequentially, yet your total operating margin went up 2 points. Normally, we think of Snapdragon up sequentially, operating margin up and vice versa, yet now it seems as though your basebands were up versus Snapdragon's, and yet your operating margins still went up. So how should we be thinking about that relationship?","Paul E. Jacobs","Well, I think the baseband continues to grow -- or the Snapdragon platform really continues to grow quarter-to-quarter, and we still -- we saw the same thing in the units that we delivered this quarter. In addition, you should think of our results really as a combination of bringing on some new customers on, some of them being, or one of them being quite large, as well as continuing to grow outside, really. So your -- the traditional accounts, we've continued to either maintain share or grow share, as well as we're bringing on new customers as people transition to smartphones in emerging markets. So it's really a case for us as we've been able to grow the business while the landscape of the OEM market has really changed quite a bit. So we're pleased with how that's happened. And this quarter's a really good example of that.","Operator","Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Bill, I wanted to dig into the QCT margins. Clearly, your volumes, chipset volumes, are delivering higher than planned. Your device ASPs are higher than planned, which means a much better mix of devices as well. So -- and I understand that sequential decline in QCT margins into the second quarter doesn't make sense. But I guess the question is why still you can't raise your QCT margin target for the year. It seems like you're running ahead of plan, as was the case this past quarter and, it sounds like, the next quarter versus your original plan. So why can't we see the QCT margins rising?","William E. Keitel","Sure, Ittai. And by the way, after I answer your point, I didn't like my microphone, and I'm going to come back and finish Eric's questions from -- Eric from Merrill Lynch BofA. But on the QCT margins, Ittai, the -- if you back up a little bit, do recall, of course, the pricing strategy we've had in place. And then, of course, the acquisition of Atheros put some pressure, downward pressure, on our margins. But for -- relative to the guidance we gave at the outset of this year and where we are right now, we did -- in addition to the revenue increase, we did increase our operating expenses, and that's primarily R&D and primarily QCT. So there's -- the demand for more program from our customers is giving us reason to up that R&D spend. Back to the question that I didn't answer. ASPs for QCT, we did see a bit of a -- a slight dip here in the quarter we just reported relative to the fourth fiscal quarter of 2011. We do expect a modest uptick in Q2 and then kind of flattish from there given -- and this really reflects the wide array of chipset products that we've got. Having said that, one of the more challenging things for us to forecast in our business is the right mix of what we will actually ship. So just be prepared for likely some volatility in that average revenue per MSM. Okay?","Operator","Mark McKechnie with ThinkEquity.","Mark McKechnie - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division","I've got a couple questions for Bill and a quick one for Steve. So Bill, on the royalty base, I want to get a sense for how much of it is based on tablets. Is that becoming a meaningful percentage based on attach rates of 3G? Along with that, what kind of impact would you see, for instance, if a $400 smartphone went to $300? Would that -- is there a cap or something that would keep that overall ASP from coming in? Also, Bill, onshore cash, if you can give me that number. And then finally, for Steve, on the 8960 ramp, congrats, it sounds like you're seeing some good design work there. Any guess or guidance on what kind of mix you'd expect in fiscal '12? And also, what kind of battery life's relative to the bolt-on LTE? I mean, is LTE going to be ready for the mass market tier in the back half of the year?","Derek K. Aberle","Mark, this is Derek. Let me go ahead and address the first couple of questions. I think as the market continues to grow, we're seeing growth in the number of tablets quarter-over-quarter. But I think as a percentage of total units, it's been relatively stable. So we're not seeing them, at this point, increase as a percentage of total units, just more grow in line with the market. On your question on ASP, we do have caps that we've talked about generally. They tend to be -- on the higher side wouldn't necessarily impact the price points that you described on the smartphone side. But our feeling is that as the prices of these phones come down into the mid and lower tiers, as Bill said, it's going to be very -- continue to be very positive trends for the business, and we don't see those phones cannibalizing the devices at the high end where the pricing continues to remain fairly stable.","William E. Keitel","On the onshore cash, we finished the quarter with $6.1 billion in onshore cash.","Steven M. Mollenkopf","Mark, this is Steve. With respect to 8960, in terms of mix, what we think is happening is you're seeing a strong pull of multimode LTE in the portfolio. And if you look really -- we'll probably exit the year somewhere close to 1\/3 of our shipments on a run rate basis. We'll be including those -- including that technology. Obviously, not all of that would be on 8960. It takes a while for the OEMs to transition off of what they're using today. And in many cases, it's a 2-chip solution on to those products. But that's what you're seeing in the mix.","Operator","Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.","Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just one clarification. On that last question, Steve, do you say 1\/3 of your QCT volume exiting this year could be LTE? Is that what you were saying? I just want to be clear on that. And then my other question is for Bill. It's actually on the Licensing business and the ASP. You had -- so you've seen stronger volume growth in emerging markets, but you're also taking up ASPs as well. So I would have thought there's some geographic negative mix shift in there that's also being offset. So were you seeing people upgrade to higher price points? Is that what you're seeing in the industry right now? How sustainable is that? And then I guess a broader question on ASPs is it looks like you're going to see 2 years now, if your guidance comes through, in terms of ASPs in your Licensing business rising. I'm just wondering how should we think about that in the context of a $100 smartphone coming down in the market and this very aggressive move down market we're having amidst a very competitive smartphone market that still exists out there. So are we close to ASPs, would you say, an absolute level, whether it's $205, $210, peaking, goes up, how see it?","Derek K. Aberle","This is Derek. Let me go ahead and take this. I think if you look at the first quarter that we just reported, we actually saw higher ASPs pretty much across all the emerging regions. And so as we've kind of predicted and talked about previously, we do continue to see these positive trends that will drive ASPs up in emerging regions. We're also seeing relative stability in the developed markets as well, and that helped drive the ASP this quarter. As we look at Q2, I think we're expecting to see the ASP relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. And that's despite some trends that would normally push it down, including more volume coming from emerging markets and a higher percentage of the units expected to come from dongles and maybe even some FX unfavorability. And despite that, we think there's -- we expect that there are some positive trends that are going to push the -- against that and create stability. In the back half of the year, I think we're expecting that we're going to see even more volume from emerging regions, and so there will be some downward pressure on the overall ASP. But the long-term trend, as we've said, we believe are very positive, and our -- or really, as these prices come down into the $100 mark, are really going to help accelerate even further 2G to 3G migration in the emerging regions.","Steven M. Mollenkopf","And Kulbinder, this is Steve. Just -- that was a correct interpretation. We will -- it's really the exit -- how we exit the year. Again, not all of that will be 8960. It will be across a family of chipsets.","Operator","Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So you gave us a little bit of data on the -- what was driving the EPS increase for the Q2 guidance. But regarding the raise in the annual guidance, in the past you've given us some color on how much of the change in the outlook to revenues in particular is coming from QCT versus QTL. I was wondering if you can give us any sort of feelings for the relative contributors of both of those businesses to the $700 million increase in your guidance range that you've given us. And then just very briefly, what are you guys going to be doing with the $22 billion in cash and $6.1 billion onshore, which I think is at least $1 billion above your target of $5 billion?","William E. Keitel","So Stacy, on the raise for the year, we raised revenue approximately $700 million. The majority of that was QCT in a range of about $0.5 billion and then you've got a couple hundred million that is driven by QTL. On the cash, the $22 billion of cash, I mean, first of all, on the domestic side, $6 billion of domestic, I think you've heard us say in the past much less than $5 billion of liquidity, and we'll probably get a little nervous here. So we think it's an appropriate level of liquidity for our business. But we -- having said that -- we're a bit maybe in a little excess position now. So we'll see. We have a 10b5-1 on file, and we'll just see if that executes at all. On the offshore, the state of our tax, corporate taxes today, obviously there's a strong incentive not to bring that back into the U.S. Hopefully, we'll get a little more sensible on that in the next year or so to help the overall U.S. economy. But I think our mission, as long as the tax code stays as it is, is to keep that cash offshore and be patient looking for opportunities to get back into the business.","Operator","Rod Hall with JP Morgan.","Rod B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Bill, I just wanted to come back around to your economic assumptions in the new guidance. I know last time you gave it to us or since last time you gave it to us, the economic forecasts have been coming down a little bit. So I wonder if you can just give us some color around what your own assumptions have done with respect to the global economy. And then, Steve, I just wonder on the 8930 that you guys mentioned, you might be -- you're going to be sampling. Can you some idea of what sort of device ASP that kind of a chip would correspond to? And then I hope it's understandable what kind of capabilities it has as well. I mean, how close is it to the 8960? And then finally, in CES, Huawei came out and announced that they're going to make their own chips. I know you guys are a supplier there. Can you give us any color on your discussions with them? I mean, how does the fact that they're planning to make their own APs impact your relationship with them? Does it really materially change? How many chips are you shipping in there?","William E. Keitel","Rod, it's Bill. On the macroeconomic front, in November when we introduced our guidance for fiscal '12, we thought the macro, the world GDP growth would be in a range of about 3.5%, 3.6%. Today, as I'm sure everybody has kind of a similar view, Europe has deteriorated a bit. The U.S., I think, in our view, has partially offset that. And -- but our view today, this plan that we have is based on approximately 3.3% GDP growth in 2012. The -- obviously, the unit projection we gave you is maybe call it bucking that trend. As I said, the main driver to the increase in total units was China, which we really think is -- seems to be have entered into quite an inflection point on 3G, 4G smartphones. We did bring down the Europe component of that. But overall, the China strength, and a bit in Latin America as well, was such that we felt it was appropriate to raise that estimate a bit for the year.","Steven M. Mollenkopf","And Rod, this is Steve. The 8930 is really a replacement of the 8x55 and the 7x27A tier of device, which is really kind of mid-tier to lower mid-tier smartphone product. If you look at how it's configured in the marketplace, it has a fairly wide band in terms of ASPs in terms of device. But it really is the LTE-enabled feature phone replacement kind of at the mid-tier and below. With respect to customers announcing plans to do their own chips, we've dealt with that, I think, over the last probably 12, 15 years. Typically, what our experience has been is that it's difficult, really, to keep up in terms of investing across as many technologies as are required to be successful kind of long term or to be a real big concern for us as a business, but it's obviously an area that we watch. But we really think that it's very much a systems game across a number of technologies, and it's quite difficult, I think, to get that scale if you're only supplying yourself. But that's been our view for a long time, and it seems to have been the case and we don't think it's going to change.","Operator","Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Steve, maybe perhaps along those lines, are there any indications that it's getting a little bit more difficult, expensive for the 2 largest smartphone makers to kind of continue their own developments to only sell to themselves? How might that change this year? Any inclination that might be helpful? And then separately, as we look at the tablet market and how that evolves, perhaps your thoughts on how you might have recalibrated the unit assumptions for this year and how we might see the split between mobile and Wi-Fi-only devices.","Steven M. Mollenkopf","Sure. So I don't know if -- I think our comments or my previous comments apply to just about any account really. Today, if you look at the speed at which technology is changing, it's actually accelerating, both in the modem as well as the AP side. So I think it's becoming quite difficult to invest as much as you would need to and at the rate you would need to in order to do that. I think our 8960 and S4 traction is probably a good proof point for what we believe there. In terms of the tablet market, I think in general, the tablet market obviously has been really dominated by one player by and large. We continue to be bullish long term on that market. In fact, we look at it as a good means for us to transition into what has traditionally been the computing space. As we do that, we think the importance of having multiple technology connectivity as well as wide area connectivity in 3G and 4G modems becomes more important because by and large, those ecosystems that are going to be enabled over the next several years are going to demand more cloud connectivity and more -- the OS itself and the services that are being supplied by these tablets tend to assume that you're connected all the time. We think that's a good environment for us to be delivering chipsets into.","Operator","Jeffrey Kvaal with Barclays Capital.","Jeffrey T. Kvaal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","One on the Licensing side and then one, Steve, for you in QCT. On the Licensing side, 16% growth is your midpoint this year. I mean, could you give us some of the assumptions behind that? I know we're coming off a year where smartphone growth was about 60%, so it seems like there's a pretty big gap there. I know it's not apples-to-apples but still it's a large delta. And then, Steve, if you could help us a little bit on the attach rate for Snapdragon and what you think we will see over the course of 2012, that would be very helpful.","William E. Keitel","Yes, this is Bill. On your -- that 16% growth on units, 3G, 4G units, for calendar '12, I think your point is, if I understand correctly, it's a bit of a decrease from the growth that we think we saw in calendar 2011. The -- obviously, in our view, the macro economy is -- a depressant on that growth, concentrated in a few regions, notably Europe. So that's one of the reasons, I think, that, that growth is a bit lower. And then, two, just in a number of markets, the smartphone penetration has picked up markedly, whereas in another -- a number of other regions, it's really just beginning, China being one example. So I think we're a bit -- in a bit of a transition now where a number of markets smartphone penetration has gone quite high and now it's into a healthy replacement and upgrade cycle, whereas more of the emerging world is just beginning to get into a smartphone transition.","Paul E. Jacobs","And in terms of Snapdragon projections moving forward -- I'll try to stay away from a particular number, but the trend of smartphone growth as well as the ability for us to add new accounts with these integrated chipsets, we think, continues. It's had a little bit of an advantage because in the past, because our 6K products, future phone products, have been transitioning to smartphones rapidly, that will continue. However, those -- the raw number of those 6K units now are getting smaller in terms of the overall mix. But still, we expect it to grow faster than the overall device market, just consistent with Bill's comments about smartphones continuing to grow.","Operator","Matt Hoffman with Cowen and Company.","Matthew Hoffman - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Paul, a question for you on the market dynamics for LTE in the next version of HSPA at 42-2 here. Specifically, can you talk about operator road maps you're seeing for both technologies, especially in Europe and Asia where LTE is not fully licensed? Do you think we should expect HSPA will hold -- hang on longer in those geographies? And then drilling down on some of the LTE chip commentary you just gave. Do you anticipate the consumer demand side for LTE phones will match those 1\/3 of chip shipment commentary you're giving? Or is it the case of OEMs trying to stay ahead of the curve, shipping phones with LTE in the markets where there's no LTE there?","Paul E. Jacobs","If you look at the rollouts of LTE around the world, I mean, it's definitely mixed, obviously U.S. driving and the competition between the operators driving here. But also, Japan is -- we're seeing some aggression there as well. India and China, obviously we're still waiting, in our case, that we used to get the spectrum for LTE in India. I mean, that will happen. There's just not enough 3G spectrum around. Operators there, I think, will continue to upgrade their 3G networks pretty aggressively anyways. But -- then we'll see the -- then we'll finally see LTE roll out. China, it's a little bit of anybody's guess how it's going to roll out. Obviously, we'll see trials, probably large-scale trials. But then the question is, is it really a commercial -- is it going to be commercial? And in terms of demand for LTE going into the phones, I do think that we'll see increasingly that leading-edge smartphones will have LTE in it, and we've made it easy for people to have LTE in it with the way that we've integrated the technology into our chipsets. So yes, I do think, in some cases, they'll get sold into places where there isn't an LTE network necessarily, although probably those phones will come through other channels besides the operator channel. I don't really see the operators necessarily driving LTE phones unless they have a LTE network deployment coming up soon.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's conference. Dr. Jacobs, do you have any closing remarks before adjourning the call?","Paul E. Jacobs","Yes, thanks. I'm really pleased with the quarter, and I have to say the year looks pretty good going forward. And that's really because all of our growth drivers are really continuing to generate great results for us. Feeling good about the investments we're making for these opportunities that we see ahead of us, and I think 8960 is just a great example of our ability to execute because we're able to aggressively push the pace of technology in a lot of areas, microprocessor, graphics, connectivity, modem, location and, obviously, going to the 28-nanometer process node. And then we take that lead and we tier it, as we've done -- as our strategy in the past. So really, to kind of cement that lead. The other thing I'm very happy, although it wasn't reflected in this quarter's results, really happy to conclude the sale of the FLO spectrum to AT&T. And obviously, we wish FLO had been successful, but what we've been able to do with it is really pivot that spectrum to supplemental downlink technology and also drive broadcast video over LTE with it. So that's a pretty cool thing. And then in addition to supplemental downlink, we're working on a bunch of other really great technologies in the labs to help the operators deal with the continued growth in demand for data. So excited about our execution, excited about what's in front of us. And thanks, everybody, for being on the call, and I hope that we'll get the chance to see many of you in person at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.

","And now to comments from Qualcomm's Chief Executive Officer, Steve Mollenkopf.","Steve Mollenkopf","Thank you, Warren, and good afternoon everyone. I am pleased with Qualcomm\u2019s performance this past fiscal year. Despite challenges in the licensing business, we delivered record revenues of $26.5 billion and record non-GAAP earnings per share, up 17% versus last year.","Total reported device sales and MSM chipset shipments also set records, as our multimode 3G LTE and related technologies continue to enable the global growth of wireless data and our broad range of semiconductor solutions continue to be used in leading devices across all price tiers globally. We increased our dividend for the 12th consecutive year and returned approximately $7.1 billion to stockholders in the form of buybacks and cash dividends. ","Looking at the fourth fiscal quarter, we shipped a record number of MSMs, driven by broad-based demand for our 3G and multimode 3G\/4G chipsets, particularly in emerging regions. We continue to benefit from our tiered roadmap and diversified customer base as MSM chip shipments were up 24% year over year.","QTL was in line with expectations, as we continue to work through the issues facing the licensing business. Eric will discuss this more fully and update you on the ongoing NDRC investigation.","We made significant progress against our strategic and operational objectives this year. First, we set out to compete effectively across all tiers in LTE while driving the modem and AP roadmap to maintain our competitive lead. We are very pleased with our design activity in the premium tier, including the leading flagship devices.","The Snapdragon 805 is the first processor to offer system-level ultra HD support and 4K video capture and playback. In addition, our fourth generation modem, the Gobi 9x35, featuring CAT6 carrier aggregation, is now shipping.","Further, we introduced our new lower-cost architecture that debuted in the Snapdragon 410, which is now shipping in volume, and we recently announced the Snapdragon 210 processor, which will offer integrated multimode 3G\/4G LTE and LTE dual sim for entry-level smartphones. ","This effectively brings multimode LTE with carrier aggregation across all tiers of the roadmap. Second, we continue to focus our investments on adjacent opportunities that adopt our core technologies as well as technologies that address the 1000x data challenge and drive IOE adoption.","Notable milestones this past year include the extension of our wifi solutions with a comprehensive set of products that use multiuser MIMO to make 802.11 AC networks up to 3x faster and more efficient. Our overall wifi handset related revenues grew more than 40% in fiscal 2014. ","We acquired Wilocity, a leader in the development of 60 GHz chipsets based on the IEEE 802.11 AD standard, which provides us with a technology to address high bandwidth use cases. We announced our second generation RF360 products and now have over 225 devices launched or in design that incorporate one or more of our RF3560 components.","On the automotive front, we have very strong design traction with our LTE solutions, and have announced our automotive grade infotainment chipset, and we are now engaged with over 15 OEMs on 40 different programs. ","We completed the sale of our Omnitracs business and restructured our Mirasol business. And finally, we recently announced our offer to acquire CSR, which would complement our current offerings by adding products, channels, and customers in the important growth categories of IOE and automotive infotainment.","Third, we achieved our operating expense targets while continuing to invest in our leading roadmap and our long term supply chain initiatives. We believe that we are operating at scale and have exited fiscal year 2014 at a lower level of R&D and SG&A spending than last year.","And finally, we committed to significantly increase our return of capital to stockholders and finish the year well ahead of our target of returning 75% of free cash flow to stockholders.","Separately, as we note in the 10-K, two competition agencies have recently commenced investigations related to our licensing and\/or our chipset businesses. We are fully cooperating with these agencies and believe our practices comply with the laws of our countries, but given that these matters are in their early stages, it is difficult to predict what, if anything, will come of them.","Looking ahead, we have clear strategic priorities for fiscal 2015: resolve the QTL challenges in China, maintain QCT\u2019s technology leadership across all tiers, further expand our business into adjacent and new growth opportunities, continue to manage operating expenses, and continue to return capital to stockholders.","Our fiscal 2015 guidance reflects the following: continued healthy growth of global 3G\/4G devices, particularly in emerging regions, at the mid and low tiers, which impact the financial outlook for both QTL and QCT; continued QTL challenges in China, coupled with increased spending on compliance and enforcement efforts by QTL; prioritize QTC R&D investments to maintain our leadership and balance our long term competitive roadmap with scale efficiencies to succeed across all price tiers, particularly the rapidly growing lower cost segments in emerging regions; a reduction and refocusing of our spend outside of QTC and QTL to a smaller number of potentially larger opportunities; focused efforts on our expanded set of adjacent growth opportunities.","Key mobile technologies are increasingly becoming adopted into new categories, and we are well-positioned to use our design expertise in connectivity, compute, and other technologies to address these evolving opportunities. ","Fundamentally, our long term growth drivers remain on track and we are aligning our resources to continue to capture these opportunities. Gartner estimates that more than 8 billion smartphones will be sold over the next five year period through calendar 2018. The installed base will reach approximately 4.4 billion, representing the largest technology platform on which to innovate and drive upgrade opportunities.","We believe the smartphone will be central to the growing number of connected things around us, and our focus is on aligning our resources to continue to capture these opportunities. We will discuss the many growth opportunities that we see ahead and the strategies and actions we are pursuing to capitalize on them during our upcoming New York analyst day on November 19, and I look forward to seeing many of you there.","In conclusion, I would like to thank each of our employees and partners for their dedication, inventiveness, and leadership. Although our fiscal year 2015 guidance reflects some challenges, the growth in global 3G\/4G device demand remains strong, and our new opportunities are emerging.","In this environment, we remain well-positioned for long term growth while at the same time continuing to return significant amounts of capital to stockholders, consistent with our previous expectations.","That concludes my remarks, and I would now like to turn the call over to Qualcomm\u2019s president, Derek Aberle.","Derek Aberle ","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone. I would first like to provide an update on our view of global 3G\/4G device demand for the remainder of calendar 2014 and 2015. As a reminder, global 3G\/4G devices include not only those devices reported to us, but also our estimates of unreported and unlicensed device sales, but excludes TD-SCDMA devices that do not implement LTE.","Prior to calendar 2014, we believed that our estimates of global 3G\/4G devices and reported 3G\/4G devices were not materially different. Last quarter, however, we introduced the separate global and reported naming conventions in light of the challenges we are experiencing in China.","We think it is important and helpful to discuss both global and reported 3G\/4G device estimates so that we can separately explain our views on our overall demand trends versus the portion of that demand that we expect will be reported to us during the applicable periods. ","We believe that global demand for 3G\/4G devices continues to grow at a very healthy pace, particularly in the emerging regions at mid and low price tiers. The broad availability of compelling devices at these price tiers is driving demand for, and the migration to, 3G\/4G devices.","Although we are not increasing our calendar 2014 global 3G\/4G device shipment estimate at this time, we now have a positive bias to our prior estimate of approximately 1.3 billion units, up approximately 20% year over year. ","As we explained last quarter, several factors primarily related to challenges in China are creating a divergence between our estimates of the global 3G\/4G device that I just explained, and what is being, and what we expect to be, reported to us in the near term.","We estimate that approximately 258 million 3G\/4G devices were reported to us during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. For calendar year 2014, we continue to estimate reported 3G\/4G devices will be in the range of 1.04 billion to 1.13 billion units, which is approximately 215 million units below the global 3G\/4G device estimate of approximately 1.3 billion units at the midpoint. This is in line with our prior expectations. ","Look forward to calendar year 2015, we estimate global 3G\/4G device shipments to be approximately 1.5 billion units, up approximately 15% year over year. Turning to 3G\/4G device ASPs, the ASP of devices reported to QTL during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 was $223 at the midpoint and $225 at the midpoint for the full fiscal 2014.","We estimate that the reported ASP for fiscal 2014 was approximately 6% higher than it would have been if the full global 3G\/4G device demand had been reported to us during fiscal 2014, given that the ASP of the unreported units is estimated to be below the reported ASP.","We forecast that the global 3G\/4G ASP will further decline by approximately 9% to 10% in fiscal 2015. Although we forecasted a modest year over year decline in the global 3G\/4G device ASP at the outset of fiscal 2014, the global 3G\/4G device ASP decreased more than we expected in fiscal 2014, driven by accelerated migration from GSM and TD-SCDMA devices to low and midpriced 3G\/4G smartphones in emerging regions.","As price elasticity drives strong unit growth at lower tiers, we believe the total dollar amount of global 3G device sales grew by approximately 10% in fiscal 2014, despite the approximate 6% ASP decline at the midpoint, and we forecast approximately 7% to 8% year over year growth of such sales again in fiscal 2015.","Beyond fiscal 2015, we expect further declines in the 3G\/4G global ASP to moderate as the weighted impact of the factors that are driving the near term declines in ASP ease, and users in emerging regions trade up as they replace their low tier devices.","We will provide more detail on these trends during our upcoming analyst day in New York. I would now like to provide an update on the four issues impacting our licensing business in China that we discussed last quarter.","We are still in discussions with the licensee regarding a dispute that has resulted in a portion of that licensee\u2019s device shipments being excluded from our results. Like other disputes we have had in the past, we expect to resolve this situation in due course and have been making progress toward that end.","We now have signed more than 75 single mode LTE licenses with Chinese OEMs. Having said that, OEMs supplying a meaningful percentage of three-mode devices remain unlicensed. We remain in discussions with many of these OEMs, but the negotiations are being delayed, at least in part by the pending NDRC investigation. We also believe the volume of three-mode devices that will ship during calendar 2014 has increased from our prior expectations. ","Despite these near term challenges, we do expect to collect royalties over time on substantially all LTE device shipments, including three-mode devices sold in China. We continue to believe that some of our licensees are not reporting all of their license shipments. We are engaged in conducting audits of these licensees and attempting to identify and resolve instances of underreporting.","Of course, if these efforts are unsuccessful, we are fully prepared to enforce our rights under our license agreement. We have also seen an increase in sales of lower tier 3G connected tablets by a number of Chinese OEMs, and we expect sales of these devices to continue to grow.","This is a good trend from a market growth perspective, but we still need to conclude license agreements with many of these tablet suppliers in order for QTL to participate in that growth. We are continuing to pursue licenses with this new base of potential licensees, but those discussions will take some time to complete, and the timing may be impacted to some extent by the pending NDRC investigation.","As to the status of the NDRC investigation, we continue to meet with, and are fully cooperating with, the NDRC as it conducts its investigation and have discussed with the NDRC a number of proposals for addressing its concerns. But the timing and outcome of any resolution remains uncertain, as does the potential impact of our future business in China. ","We also believe that the timing of the resolution of some of our other challenges in China will be impacted by the timing of the conclusion of the investigation. Bringing this matter to closure remains a top priority for the management team.","Given the difficulty in predicting the timing and impact of resolving our China challenges, our QTL outlook for fiscal 2015 incorporates a wide range of potential outcomes. The low end of our guidance reflects the status quo [unintelligible], relative to the four China issues I just covered, in other words, no material resolution or change to these items, and the high end of the range reflects more favorable outcomes with respect to several of the items.","Due to the uncertain timing and range of potential outcomes, the potential for higher than normal quarterly variation in our results is possible. We have widened our guidance ranges as a result.","Finally, again it is important to remember that our forecast for reported TRDS units and ASPs reflect only that [unintelligible] 3G\/4G device demand that we currently expect will be reported to us, and will therefore vary from the global 3G\/4G device metrics we have described.","Although QTL revenue growth may be muted to some extent, as we work to resolve the current challenges in China and global device ASPs are expected to decline during fiscal 2015 at a faster pace than in recent years, we still expect reasonable growth in global 3G\/4G device sales driven by very strong unit growth.","That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to our chief financial officer, George Davis.","George Davis","Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. I will begin by covering our fiscal fourth quarter results, followed by a summary of fiscal year 2014 before discussing our outlook. ","In our fiscal fourth quarter, we delivered revenues of $6.7 billion, up 3% year over year, and non-GAAP operating income was $2.3 billion, up 20% year over year. Non-GAAP earnings per share grew 20% year over year to $1.26. ","In QTL, total reported device sales by our licensees were $57.4 billion, above the midpoint of our guidance range. QTL\u2019s reported ASP was $223 at the midpoint, and down $8 quarter over quarter.","QCT had record MSM shipments in the quarter, as forecasted, although the demand related to mid-tier chipsets was somewhat below our expectations. Implied revenue per MSM was down sequentially, reflecting an increased mix of thin modem chipsets in the premium tier.","QCT operating margin was 22%, achieving our target to exit fiscal 2014 above 20%. Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses were 5% lower sequentially, better than expected due to spending discipline across all businesses.","During the fiscal fourth quarter, we returned $1.9 billion to stockholders, including approximately $700 million of dividends paid and $1.2 billion in stock repurchases. As of the end of fiscal 2014, we had approximately $5.3 billion remaining on our stock repurchase authorization.","Cash flow from operations was $1.6 billion and 24% of revenues, and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $32 billion. ","Turning to our results for fiscal 2014, revenues were up 7% from last year, reflecting stronger than expected QCT shipments, partially offset by the impact of QTL\u2019s challenges in China. As a reminder, we sold our Omnitracs division in the first fiscal quarter and the impact of the absence of this business was just over 1 percentage point on our growth rate on the year over year comparison.","Non-GAAP operating income was $8.9 billion, up 3% year over year, led by strong performance in QCT, partially offset by certain impairments and higher spend in our emerging businesses, reported in other.","Non-GAAP earnings per share were $5.27, up 17% year over year, led by QCT performance, along with the benefit of gains on rebalancing of our treasury portfolio and the positive net impacts of the gain on the sale of Omnitracs and the ParkerVision reversal, partially offset by the writedown of [QMT] assets. ","QTL\u2019s fiscal 2014 revenues were flat year over year, as challenges in China offset strong global 3G\/4G device growth, and QTL\u2019s operating margin was 87% of revenue. QCT\u2019s fiscal 2014 revenues were up 12% year over year, and QCT\u2019s earnings before tax were up 19% year over year.","Operating margin was 20%, and at the high end of our full year guidance range, overall, a very strong year for our QCT team, where product leadership across all tiers led the stronger than expected top and bottom line growth in an environment where we saw increasing margin compression, particularly in the mid and low tiers.","In fiscal 2014, we generated $8.9 billion in cash flow from operations, or 34% of revenues. We exceeded our 75% of free cash flow commitment, returning approximately $7.1 billion or 93% of free cash flow to stockholders during the fiscal year.","Now turning to our guidance for fiscal 2015, we estimate total Qualcomm fiscal 2015 revenues to be in the range of approximately $26.8 billion to $28.8 billion, up 1% to 9% year over year. We expect QCT segment revenues to be in the range of $19.3 billion to $20.3 billion, up 6% year over year at the midpoint, and QTL segment revenues are expected to be in the range of $7.3 billion to $8.3 billion, up 3% year over year at the midpoint.","Our range for QTL is relatively wide, as it is difficult to forecast the timing and potential outcomes in China. We expect 2015 non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $9.2 billion to $10 billion, up 7.5% year over year at the midpoint. ","Overall, non-GAAP operating profit is expected to grow modestly as a percent of revenue. We estimate fiscal 2015 QTL operating margin will be approximately 85% to 86%. Consistent with the guidance provided over the past year, we estimate 2015 QCT operating margins will be in the range of 18% to 20%.","We expect fiscal 2015 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $5.05 to $5.35, down modestly at the midpoint versus fiscal 2014. Non-GAAP year over year EPS growth is expected to be impacted by the continuing challenges in QTL, lower QCT revenue per MSM and margin flow through, lower investment gains in our treasury portfolio, and to a lesser extent, negative foreign exchange impacts.","Our estimate is that revenue per MSM will be modestly lower year over year, down 3% to 5%, as a result of continuing pricing pressure, product mix, and increasing competitive dynamics. Combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses are expected to grow approximately 3% to 5% year over year, driven by continued investments in our multitiered chip roadmap and increasing compliance and enforcement initiatives in QTL.","We estimate our fiscal 2015 non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 17%, higher year over year due to business mix, the absence of the federal R&D tax credit, and other unique items in 2014. ","The impact from the potential CSR acquisition has been excluded from our fiscal 2015 forecast.","For the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $6.6 billion to $7.2 billion, up approximately 4% year over year at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share in our fiscal first quarter to be approximately $1.18 to $1.30 per share, down 2% year over year at the midpoint, as stronger chip performance is more than offset by the absence of favorable one-time items and lower licensing revenues related to China.","We anticipate first fiscal quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be up 5% to 6% sequentially, reflecting increased investment in QCT\u2019s product roadmap. In QTL, we estimate total reported device sales for the quarter will be in the range of $53 billion to $59 billion, as reported by our licensees in the December quarter for shipments they made in the September quarter.","QTL\u2019s reported ASP is estimated to be sequentially lower, reflecting competitive dynamics at the premium and high tier, and an increased mix of lower-priced handsets in emerging regions. In QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 250 million to 270 million units during the December quarter, up approximately 22% year over year at the midpoint and 10% sequentially.","We expect fiscal first quarter implied revenue per MSM to be down approximately 5% quarter over quarter and down approximately 10% year over year, reflecting a greater mix of thin modems and chipsets for lower cost smartphones.","That concludes my comments. I look forward to seeing many of you at the analyst day in New York, where we\u2019ll provide further detail supporting our financial outlook for fiscal 2015 and beyond. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Warren. ","Warren Kneeshaw","Thank you, George. Operator, we\u2019re ready for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Your first question comes from the line of Tim Long of BMO Capital.","Tim Long - BMO Capital Markets ","Derek, a clarification here. There\u2019s a discussion of a prior period catch up in the numbers for QTL this year. Could you just let us know what that is? And then for the whole team here, just curious, as we enter a new fiscal year, the previous guidance of 10% top and bottom line growth looks like for guidance it will be the second year that we don\u2019t hit that. Could you just re-address that, and maybe if you ex out China, do you think those targets are still realistic?","Derek Aberle ","I\u2019m a little bit confused on what you\u2019re referring to on the prior period catch up. In terms of our guidance for fiscal \u201915, as George mentioned, we have a relatively wide range on the QTL guidance given just the uncertainty on what\u2019s going on in China. ","And you know, I would say that sort of at the low end of that, we\u2019re assuming probably more or less a status quo scenario on the four items that we discussed last quarter and updated you on today, and then towards the high end of the range would anticipate that we actually reach resolution at various points in the year on several of those items. ","And certainly, part of that could include things like catch up payments, but that\u2019s sort of a probability adjusted set of assumptions that got us to this range. ","George Davis ","On your question about the longer term outlook, that\u2019s certainly going to be the focus of a lot of our discussion in New York. But I do think, as you look at \u201914, clearly our top line was impacted by what QTL experienced. They were flat year over year as opposed to growing with the market. And with 2015, I think again we\u2019re continuing to see the impacts of China. But we\u2019ll talk longer term about the things that we think will add to the growth rate for the company overall when we can go into more detail.  ","","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. ","James Faucette - Morgan Stanley","I just wanted to ask one more clarification from you, Derek. As far as resolution, getting to the high end of your range, I think you said that\u2019s probability weighted. So if I\u2019m understanding that correctly, that would mean that if it were in fact to happen, that you could actually exceed the high end of the range. Just a little clarification on how you\u2019re formulating that would, I think, be helpful.","And then back on QCT, maybe broader question for the team. Just wondering if the issues with the NDRC in particular, how that\u2019s impacting the demand for chips in China, with your Chinese customers, if it\u2019s impacting a relationship there and margins at all. And finally, just last question, can you just, a couple of comments on the new EC and FTC investigations might be useful as well.","Derek Aberle ","Just let me clarify on the range. So what I was saying is the low end of the range really basically assumes no resolution of the items that we\u2019ve discussed. And also, things like unreported activity wouldn\u2019t get worse. ","So it\u2019s sort of what we\u2019ve seen now, one quarter in, of reports and also the estimates on the September quarter sales. As I mentioned in my comments, we feel like we\u2019re sort of tracking in line with kind of what we expected, meaning the underreporting isn\u2019t getting worse. So assuming that holds, and we don\u2019t resolve things, that would get you to the low end of the range.","The high end of the range basically includes assumptions that several of the items would either be resolved or get better for us. And to be clear, the midpoint is basically sort of a probability adjusted version of several different scenarios that kind of put you in the middle.","Steven Mollenkopf ","With respect to the chipset question, I don\u2019t think the investigation helps the situation, but I think the team has done a good job really separating the issues between the product side and the licensing side. And I would characterize the demand in China as being fairly robust. It\u2019s probably a little bit more three mode than five mode, which is really a mix statement relative to what we would have thought a year ago. But it continues to be a significant part of the growth of the business moving forward, and we\u2019re pleased to be participating in it.","Don Rosenberg ","With respect to the investigation, the E.U. and the FTC, basically, we\u2019ve said in the K what we can say there, both very early stage. The E.U. relates to, as far as we can tell, the chip business and the FTC relates to, as far as we can tell, the licensing business. But important to note that these are very preliminary. They\u2019re in the information gathering stages in both cases. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity.","Mike Walkley - Canaccord Genuity ","Derek, just a little more clarification, what\u2019s embedded on your guidance, on QTL, maybe on the ASP front, one, on the high end, the high tier market, with Apple in a strong product cycle, and our surveys and work show them taking share from high end Android, how much does that impact your ASP outlook? ","And then second, assuming a lower mix of these emerging market units for the underreporting, if that could help the ASPs. And then thirdly, if some FX headwinds that could hurt Qualcomm. So how much of those factors may be impacting your ASP outlook, or is it more just the mix that is leading to the ASP outlook?","Derek Aberle ","I would say sort of elements of all of those things are kind of embedded in our guidance. You probably noticed that unlike prior years, where we gave a fiscal year ASP range, this year we decided to just give a new metric, which is the all-in TRDS. Because given the uncertainty in the timing of some of these resolutions, and in addition to the normal market dynamics that we need to forecast, trying to give a meaningful range on the ASP was pretty difficult. ","For example, if we get the dispute resolved and some of these underreporting issues resolved, and that comes with it catch up units that are at lower ASPs, that\u2019s going to have a distortive effect on the quarterly profile. So we\u2019ll kind of take you through that as the year progresses, depending on what comes out.","But yes, certainly as OEM share ships around at the high tier, that can impact the ASP as well, and we\u2019ve got a set of assumptions in there. And we do anticipate, both from a reported and kind of a global market dynamic, that the emerging market units will be an increasing portion of the units sold in 2015 compared to 2014.","Steven Mollenkopf ","Mike, I think you asked about FX as well, and I think it will have a modest impact driven by what we\u2019re seeing with the yen and the euro.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. ","Blayne Curtis - Barclays","Just first on QTL, the step off in the device ASPs, how much does the three-mode have to do with that, and just any expectation on the mix between five-mode and three-mode next year. And then George, just on the opex clicking up, you had said that you\u2019re just investing in products. This is kind of a change from trying to keep it more flattish. So what\u2019s driving that change as the top line seemingly is a little weaker.","Derek Aberle ","Yeah, so if you look at kind of what we referred to as the global ASP, if all the units have been reported to us this year, really a big part of the year over year decline is driven by growth in China, and in particular three-mode and Chinese OEMs I think gaining share over non-Chinese OEMs. So that\u2019s a big part, coupled with strong unit growth in other emerging regions as well.","I think we see similar dynamics playing out as we go from 2014 to 2015. Throughout the course of this year, the percentage of three-mode devices on China Mobile\u2019s network compared to five-mode has really continued to shift over time to more a three-mode. And we expect that will probably continue at least into 2015 as well. ","George Davis ","On opex, we are slowing the growth of opex. Last year we had forecasted 6% growth, we brought it at 5% this year. We\u2019re forecasting 4% at the midpoint. And really what you\u2019re seeing is continued investment in the QCT roadmap. What\u2019s maybe having a little bit higher effect that we would expect on an ongoing run rate is we are investing more in the enforcement side for QTL, so we\u2019ve embedded that growth year over year. But you\u2019ll see, again, moderate growth in QCT, and in our other segment you\u2019re seeing opex come down in that area. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank ","First, on the back to the long term growth rate, obviously the QTL, you are the market there, so single digit growth there is probably a given. But on the QCT side, you\u2019ve got a combination of things. You obviously have lower ASP product [scrolling] number faster than higher ASP, but you\u2019ve also got integration of functionality like wifi and RF360. So how do those two things play into the overall growth rate of QCT? ","Second, Steve, if you could talk about LTE competition, how you see that evolving as we move into next year. And then finally, given you have a couple of investigations going on, what are you assuming in your guidance relative to legal expense. Is it kind of the midrange, or is it high or low? Could you give some measure of that? That would be great. Thank you.","Steven Mollenkopf ","I think on the QCT model, I don\u2019t really see anything that\u2019s different than our long term model. We had a very strong 2014. I think we\u2019re seeing a little bit of a mix issue now in 2015, but still consistent with our long term. Remember, we had a really strong 2014, I think is important to remember.","Long term, I think all the growth vectors that we talked about that you mentioned, integration, a bunch of adjacent markets, just continual, actually even improvement of our cost structure, which we continue to focus on, contribute to that.","So I think we don\u2019t see really anything different in the QCT outlook, albeit it\u2019s a little bit weaker market from a mix perspective here sequentially in 2015. And I think some of our opex discipline that we\u2019ve had over the years has helped us actually maintain that.","With respect to LTE competition, you know, it\u2019s there. It\u2019s been there for some time. We feel fairly good about our competitive positioning right now. Most of that is because I think we\u2019re stronger across tiers. We are assuming that there\u2019s LTE competition in the way in which we are pricing our chipsets and the way in which we\u2019re defending our share, but you\u2019ve seen us do that in the past. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a real change in our strategy.","Maybe George could talk a little bit about the legal expense.","George Davis ","Sure, on the legal side, we\u2019re definitely increasing what we expect to spend more this year, not only for China, but for these other items that we talked about. But that\u2019s all in the forecast. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ehud Gelblum with Citigroup.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup ","The concept of three-mode versus five-mode comes up a lot in conversation, and you mentioned it today as well. Can you just give us a sense, in both modes, you have LTE. In three-mode you have TD-LTE and five-mode you have both TD and FD LTE. For you, is there a distinction between the two? Is there any reason we should be seeing a distinction between the two? ","Have any vendors or any carriers or anyone been able to make a distinction between the two that you can discern? Is there a reason that the royalties you eventually get on three-mode would be different from five-mode, as a percentage, other than the fact that three-mode will most likely have a lower ASP. ","If we can just kind of understand. I was always under the impression that LTE was LTE was LTE, so if you can kind of clarify that a little bit, as well as this large licensee that seems to be making a distinction between a portion of its devices, but they\u2019re not willing to pay royalties on, is that the distinction between three-mode and five-mode?","And then I just want a clarification, when you said the 9% to 10% ASP, that was including China, I assume, and the 1.5 billion units. If we exclude China, what is your estimate on ASP declines for the QTL in the TRDS that we\u2019re right now going to be looking at going forward, as opposed to hoping this thing gets resolved issue?","Derek Aberle ","The three-mode versus five-mode question, just to clarify. So three-mode, when we use that term, refers to devices that have GSM, TD-SCDMA, and TD LTE. And five-mode is both flavors of LTE as well as GSM and WCDMA. And so when you think about the five-mode devices, those are essentially covered by what we refer to as our 3G agreement. So you know, there\u2019s no need to go out for us and sign up new agreements to cover those products.","The three-mode, the reason that we\u2019ve drawn a distinction between those is, in many cases, either companies did not take licenses for TD-SCDMA or as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, we\u2019ve had challenges in China collecting on TD-SCDMA. ","So as they roll those TD-SCDMA devices to include LTE, we believe that really puts us in the position to collect royalties on all of the formerly TD-SCDMA volume. So in many cases, that requires us to actually negotiate and sign new license agreements. And those are the agreements that you\u2019ll hear us refer to as LTE only or single mode LTE agreements. ","Really, from an OEM perspective, we did have some concerns a while back about the issue of whether we\u2019re going to have challenges collecting on LTE TDD, similar to TD-SCDMA. We\u2019re not really seeing that to be a big issue. It\u2019s more around just getting the agreements in place.","And as I\u2019ve talked about, we were making very good progress on that up until recently, and I think we\u2019re experiencing some delays in those negotiations, primarily around the timing of the NDRC resolution.","The dispute we have with the licensee, we really haven\u2019t characterized that in too much detail, other than to say it is really the underreporting aspect of that is not necessarily related to a particular technology. It\u2019s really a different kind of dispute, similar to what we\u2019ve had in the past, where we just have companies taking position under the agreement in terms of what they have to pay. And we have to work through that. And we\u2019ve continued to be engaged with that particular licensee, and are trying to make progress towards a resolution. ","On the ASP, when I referred to the 9% to 10% estimated year over year decline, that was referring to the global ASP, which is sort of the all-in number that would include China. Yes, if you extracted out China, we would expect that ASP to be higher, but as I mentioned before, we\u2019ve decided not to provide guidance at this point on the fiscal year reported ASP. Instead, we gave you the TRDS range for fiscal 2015. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.","Kulbinder Garcha - Credit Suisse ","Derek, on the unit numbers, the 210 million unit shortfall, you\u2019d previously implied that the shortfall, a significant part was just this one licensee, and the rest of it was a bunch of underreporting. My question is what other remedies are possible for the licensee that you had? Because you obviously have or had an agreement with them, and they just suddenly stopped paying. And I would have thought that that would leave us there to bring that to some sort of close quite quickly. And what I was thinking of it, these other underreporting vendors is just much more complicated. Is that the right way of thinking of it? Or is this whole thing very uncertain?","Then for Steve, my question is despite the cash that you guys did pay out, you obviously ended the year with more cash than last year, and I\u2019m not sure that you\u2019d even agree that you need $30-odd billion cash on your balance sheet. So if you are confident of Qualcomm\u2019s LTE position and their chip position, which it sounds like you are, isn\u2019t this the time to step up the shareholder returns? ","Derek Aberle ","Let me try to kind of step through this. Remember, we gave a range last quarter. It was relatively wide, of potential units that would not be reported to us for calendar 2014, and the midpoint of that estimate was about 215 million units. And as we explained, that was made up of four elements. One of them was the dispute that you mentioned. Another was underreporting by licensees. A third was the unlicensed three-mode activity in China, and the fourth were these white box tablets.","And the white box tablets, although also meaningful, are probably the smallest out of the four, but we didn\u2019t otherwise kind of characterize the composition of what made up the 215. So I just wanted to clarify that. ","The dispute that we have currently with the licensee does involve a company that has an existing license agreement. And so our typical process, when we have these types of disputes, as you probably recall from years earlier, is our first and preferred approach is to try to engage with the licensee and resolve it amicably through negotiation. And that\u2019s the process that we\u2019re going ","through right now.","We\u2019ve had a lot of success doing that in the past, but from time to time, that doesn\u2019t work, and if that doesn\u2019t work, then you need to take the next step, which is typically seeking to enforce your rights under the agreement, which would either be in litigation or in arbitration, and you might recall for instance the arbitration that we had with Panasonic a few years back. That resolved quite favorably for us.","So I would say we\u2019re sort of in the pre-dispute resolution procedures, meaning we\u2019re continuing to be engaged with the licensee, and I think we\u2019re making some progress towards a resolution, but there\u2019s no guarantee that that will ultimately happen without the need for some other mechanism to resolve it. But those do take some time. Even when you resort to the contract remedies, that\u2019s a period of time as well. So it\u2019s not something you can just do overnight. ","Steven Mollenkopf ","I think the way you characterized our view of the business is consistent with our view. That being said, I think we talked about last fiscal year about how we increased our capital structure commitment to return 75% of free cash flow to the shareholders. Given our split of offshore and onshore balances and kind of the future view of what might happen with tax reform, we think that\u2019s probably the right split right now, but I\u2019m sure that we will hear a lot about that, and also provide our own perspective of that again in New York. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Tal Liani of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Tal Liani - Bank of America ","First is on the royalties. I\u2019m here in China this week, and I\u2019m getting confused with the information, because there\u2019s going to be about 70 million to 80 million 4G subscribers this year, and you\u2019re guiding to 215 million. And the majority of these 80 million to 90 million handsets will be paying royalties, just because they\u2019re five-mode or they\u2019re the other technologies that are supposed to pay royalties. ","So the dispute seems to be going. It\u2019s not about TD or local technology. It\u2019s more about the Chinese not willing to pay you, period, and there is something to do with technology, but it cuts across all technologies, and it\u2019s also for the exports, not just for the imports. So can you discuss this? What suddenly prompts this, after they paid for so many years according to the plan?","And the second question is about R&D. You referred to opex before, but R&D, if I look at the last five, six quarters, R&D, the growth rate had been constantly down from 36% year over year to 11% the previous two quarters, and this quarter it\u2019s only 1%. What is the outlook for R&D, and how do you manage to maintain the leadership with R&D only growing 1% year over year? ","Derek Aberle ","Just to clear up maybe the potential confusion there, last quarter when we described this, it\u2019s really the issue of unlicensed activity and underreporting is really one that\u2019s unique to Chinese OEMs at this point. But it is not limited to a particular technology. So I think we were pretty clear that the three-mode was sort of a unique issue that was a combination of probably underreporting and unlicensed activity.","But the underreporting itself, given the magnitude of the 215 million unit midpoint we talked about included more than just LTE. It was across 3G as well, and it wasn\u2019t limited to even sales in China, but it would likely include sales by Chinese OEMs that would be for export outside of China to some of the other emerging regions. So I think when you go back and maybe look at your numbers in that context, hopefully things will make a little more sense. ","In terms of timing, really, I think you can think about this from a couple of different perspectives. One is the unlicensed activity, it\u2019s not atypical to have a situation where product begins to ship before you can finally get agreements in place, so they come usually closer to the time of shipments. So that\u2019s why the three-mode is a bigger issue for us right now than the five-mode or other 3G devices.","But I think there\u2019s also an element, given the uncertainty in China right now, with the pending NDRC investigation, which we\u2019re obviously working very hard to resolve. There\u2019s a little bit of the licensees pushing the envelope. And it\u2019s not really a situation of companies just saying generally they\u2019re not going to pay us, but I think that they\u2019re sort of pushing the envelope in terms of thinking that they can get away with not reporting all of the activity that they\u2019re undertaking.","And you know, we are preparing to respond to that, and I think that\u2019s something we\u2019ve had to deal with in the past, and I think we\u2019ve had a pretty good track record of resolving it. We\u2019re probably approaching the problem a little bit differently than we have in the past, just given where we are in our current discussions on the investigation. But once that\u2019s behind us or we get a little further down the line, I think you\u2019ll see our stance on those types of things change. ","Steven Mollenkopf ","On the R&D, I think you\u2019re referring to the quarter numbers, which had more modest growth than we\u2019ve seen for a couple of quarters. And some of that is just timing of certain activities within the programs, but if you look at the full year of 2014, where we had a little more front end loading, we grew R&D at about 3 points higher than the top line rate of the company. If you look back over five years, R&D as a percent of revenues is about 18%, and that\u2019s the same level that we would expect to see in 2015. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon of Sanford Bernstein.","Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein ","You\u2019re talking about issues with China impacting the guidance next quarter, but let\u2019s talk about the rest of the business. You\u2019re guiding at the low end of your TRDS. That assumes China doesn\u2019t come back, but that also implies TRDS goes down year over year, which implies something must be going on in the rest of the business. So can you tell us about how you see the rest of the business trending ex-China?","Secondly, you\u2019re guiding your TRDS up 4.5%. You\u2019re guiding your QTL revenues up 3%, which implies royalty rate degradation next year. What\u2019s driving that? ","Thirdly, with the issues signing these China guys to three-mode licenses, I guess currently they\u2019re not in violation of anything yet, because they don\u2019t have agreements. So if they continue to refuse to sign, what are your options? Do you have to go into China and make the explicit decision to sue them for patent infringement?","Derek Aberle ","I think the first question was from a reported TRDS year over year. When you look at the numbers, that appears to be down. I think actually the midpoint would be up year over year, about 5%. So you should probably take a look at that one. I\u2019m not sure I fully caught the second part of that. ","Steven Mollenkopf ","Well, I think your point was that the growth rate for QTL\u2026 And I think it\u2019s one of the reasons why we gave a range of what the top line for QTL would be. But if you just took the midpoint of that, it would be up 3%, and we\u2019re saying TRDS up 5% on FY 2015 guidance. ","And again, I would say to draw a straight line between that and saying there\u2019s a specific royalty rate issue, I think there\u2019s so many moving pieces in the forecast right now that I wouldn\u2019t draw quite that straight a line.","Derek Aberle ","And then I guess on the last question, about three-mode, really I think that\u2019s the question. We have, I think 75-plus companies that have already signed agreements for three-mode in China. So obviously the way that we would ensure payment and compliance on those companies would be different than the companies that don\u2019t yet have agreements. ","So I think there\u2019s kind of a lot of factors involved in terms of if we run into problems getting companies to actually sign agreements for three-mode. And one of the potential actions would be to assert patents against them in China. There certainly are other avenues at our disposal as well, in particular, as these companies continue to grow their businesses and their aspirations outside of China as well. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri of Cowen & Company.","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Company ","First of all from me, the guidance takes into account the issues in China, but can you assess the potential for the new FTC and the E.U. investigations to maybe add some risk to the low end of the guidance? And then secondly, are the new FTC and E.U. investigations fully independent from the NDRC issues? Because it seems like in some other situations that the various global agencies are sort of working together on stuff like this. So I\u2019m wondering if one can be resolved totally separately from the other two.","Don Rosenberg ","The first question was in terms of the impact. Look, these are investigations that, as I said, are very preliminary. As you know from our experience and other experiences in the past, these take some time. As I said, these are informational at the moment. So there\u2019s going to be a lot of interaction and discussion before this leads anywhere, frankly. So I don\u2019t think we can predict with any degree of certainty where it\u2019s going to go, and it\u2019s certainly not going to be a short term kind of impact. ","Derek Aberle ","I think if you look back historically, we obviously had an investigation in Europe and in Korea previously. The European investigation went on for four years and ultimately resulted in no findings or actual complaints against us. Korea, that was a multiyear process as well.","I think in our experiences, it\u2019s not uncommon that if there\u2019s a high profile investigation by one competition agency, that potentially others might become interested and ask for information, but the regulatory regimes and the legal processes in each country are quite different, and in particular quite different than China.

Mr. Kneeshaw, please go ahead.","Warren Kneeshaw - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you and good afternoon. Today's call will include prepared remarks by Steve Mollenkopf, Derek Aberle, and George Davis. In addition, Cristiano Amon and Don Rosenberg will join the question-and-answer session. You can access our earnings release and an executive presentation that accompany this call on our Investor Relations website. This call is also being webcast on Qualcomm.com, and a replay will be available on the website later today.","During this conference call, we will use non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G, and you can find the related reconciliations to GAAP on our website. As well, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future business or results of the company. Actual events or results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q, which contain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","And now to comments from Qualcomm's Chief Executive Officer, Steve Mollenkopf.","Steven M. Mollenkopf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered a stronger than expected quarter as we continued to execute on our strategy to position the company for the next phase of profitable growth. Non-GAAP earnings per share were above the high end of our guidance range, driven by strength in both QTL and QCT.","QTL revenues reflect seasonably strong December quarter activity, and we are pleased with the progress we are making in China. We signed several new China licenses in the first few months, with more than 100 companies now having accepted the NDRC [National Development and Reform Commission] terms. We remain in active discussions with the few key Chinese OEMs that have not yet signed and believe we are making progress in those discussions. We are also pleased to have recently resolved our licensing dispute with LG.","In QCT, our chipset shipments were above the midpoint of our prior guidance range, driven by strong demand from Chinese OEMs, and we had favorable product costs.","During the quarter, we returned approximately $2.3 billion to stockholders through dividends and stock repurchases. We also announced a 10% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, reflecting our confidence in the strength of our ongoing cash flows and future earnings growth. We remain focused on improving our financial trajectory exiting the fiscal year, and we are on track in this regard.","In QCT, we have updated our roadmap across tiers, and our new products have been very well received. The flagship Snapdragon 820 is now available in leading devices such as the Samsung Galaxy S7, the LG G5, and the Xiaomi Mi5, along with devices from Sony, HTC, HP, and others. We now have over 115 Snapdragon 820 designs, and expect volume to ramp on this platform through the second half of the fiscal year.","Our strategy of offering differentiated all-mode modem solutions with carrier aggregation capability is extending our leadership and enabling strong design traction, particularly in China at the mid and high tiers. In China, new use cases for carrier aggregation are providing product differentiators for our customers and enhancing our design traction.","We are continuing to pursue additional content opportunities in the smartphone and recently announced a suite of next-generation Qualcomm RF360 technologies. We are on track to deliver our next-generation CMOS and Galliumarsenid PAs in 2017 and will extend our product offerings, including complete RF front-end module solutions once the TDK transaction closes.","Further, we are broadening our presence in adjacent opportunities, including automotive, networking, mobile compute, and IOT. Collectively, the serviceable addressable opportunity for these adjacent areas is expected to grow at a CAGR of 18% over the next five years, from $12 billion to $29 billion, according to a combination of third-party and internal estimates, and we are well positioned to benefit from this expanding opportunity. We expect these adjacent opportunities to drive approximately $2.5 billion in QCT revenues in fiscal year 2016.","We are seeing significant momentum across these areas. In automotive, we have very strong design traction in telematics across Tier 1 manufacturers. With the completion of our CSR acquisition, we now have a comprehensive connectivity portfolio, including Bluetooth Smart, Wi-Fi, and LTE, which allows us to offer a broader suite of products to our expanded set of customers.","In networking, we have a strong pipeline of over 240 designs with our 802.11ac solution across router, home gateway, and set-top box implementations. We continued to gain significant traction and win category-defining designs in IOT segments such as wearables, action cameras, security and surveillance cameras, virtual reality headsets, drones, and smart city infrastructure.","At MWC, we announced ecosystem expansion for our next-generation Snapdragon Wear platform, and we are pleased to report that there are now over 100 wearable devices using Qualcomm technology, which includes over 80% of all Android Wear smartwatch designs. Looking at the IOT more broadly, there are now over 1 billion IOT devices that have shipped using Qualcomm technology.","We continue to forecast QCT operating margins of 16% or better in the fourth fiscal quarter and are targeting 20%-plus operating margins longer term. It is important to note that for planning purposes, both our near-term and long-term margin targets have consistently factored in a range of second sourcing assumptions at our large customers, and we believe our margin targets are achievable under those scenarios.","We have strong confidence in our technology leadership, differentiated modem roadmap, and unique global scale. For instance, we recently demonstrated our Snapdragon X16 LTE modem, the first commercially announced gigabit-class LTE chipset, designed to deliver fiber-like LTE Category 16 download speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second, at least two generations ahead of the competition. This modem also supports Licensed Assisted Access, the global standard for LTE in unlicensed spectrum, becoming the mobile industry's first commercially announced LTE advanced pro modem and marks an important step towards 5G as we enable deeper unlicensed spectrum integration with LTE and more advanced MIMO techniques to support growing data consumption.","Further, we are leading the world to 5G, as we did in both 3G and 4G. To support this, we are designing a new OFDM-based 5G air interface that will not only enhance mobile broadband services but also enable connectivity and management for the Internet of Things and new types of mission-critical services that require lower latency, higher reliability, and robust security. We demonstrated our 5G millimeter wave 28 GHz prototype system at Mobile World Congress, showcasing robust and sustained mobile broadband communications at these higher spectrum bands.","Looking ahead, we continue to execute on our strategic plans to position us well for the future. Fiscal 2016 is a transition year, and we are making very good progress. We are taking decisive steps to enable us to capitalize on the significant opportunities ahead while delivering improving near-term performance.","I would now like to turn the call over to Derek.","Derek K. Aberle - President","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As Steve noted, QTL had a stronger than expected fiscal second quarter, with total reported device sales of approximately $70 billion, reflecting the seasonally strong holiday quarter.","I am pleased to report that we recently resolved our dispute with LG. As a result of the resolution, we will resume recognizing quarterly LG revenues in fiscal Q3 in addition to recording the revenues we deferred from the first two fiscal quarters. As a reminder, LG continued to report and pay during the dispute, so the sales they reported for the first two quarters of fiscal 2016 were included in the total reported device sales for those quarters, but we did not recognize revenues for those quarters given that the arbitration was underway.","We are also continuing to make steady progress in China, completing new China license agreements. We recently signed new agreements with Lenovo, EWPE, Yulong, and Hisense, and now have more than 100 companies that have accepted the NDRC terms, including the top five worldwide Chinese licensees. Yulong and Hisense were signed after the close of our second fiscal quarter and will be reflected in our third quarter results. In addition, we are still actively negotiating with several of the other remaining key Chinese OEMs and are making progress in those discussions.","As we explained at our Analyst Day in February, we are also working hard on a number of fronts to improve compliance with our licensees in China. We have begun implementing those plans and expect them to deliver meaningful improvements over time. The percentage of global units not reported to us during the second fiscal quarter increased modestly quarter over quarter, driven primarily by share gains from OEMs that have been withholding royalties during license negotiations.","Looking ahead, we continue to see growth in global 3G\/4G device shipments. LTE penetration is only approximately 16% of cellular connections globally, and cumulative smartphone unit shipments are forecast to be more than 8.7 billion from 2016 through 2020 according to GSM Intelligence and Gartner.","For calendar year 2015, we now estimate global 3G\/4G device shipments were approximately 1.55 billion units, slightly below the midpoint of our prior range and up approximately 13% year over year. We saw strong growth in emerging regions, particularly in China, and expect this trend to continue in calendar 2016.","We are adjusting our estimate of calendar 2016 global 3G\/4G device shipments to 1.625 billion to 1.725 billion devices, with year-over-year unit growth of approximately 8% at the midpoint, down from our previous midpoint estimate of approximately 10% growth. The strong 4G ramp in China continues, as each of the operators pursues aggressive subscriber growth targets with their 4G-plus service offerings, and design momentum is moving rapidly towards all-mode devices across China.","The strength in China, however, is being offset by a reduction in growth rates in other emerging regions, which we believe is attributable to macroeconomic headwinds. In addition, our forecast for premium-tier device shipments is down slightly versus our prior view, driven by slower than expected upgrades within one of the premium-tier ecosystems.","Global 3G\/4G handset ASPs are tracking slightly better than our prior expectations of an approximately 6% year-over-year decline for the fiscal year, driven primarily by stronger premium-tier ASPs. We continue to expect low single-digit growth in global 3G\/4G device sales in fiscal 2016, as unit growth is expected to more than offset ASP declines. Despite adjustments to near-term shipment estimates, we believe the long-term growth drivers for 3G\/4G device sales remain intact and provide a solid foundation for the licensing business to deliver greater than $10 billion in revenue in our fiscal 2020.","Turning to our QTL revenue outlook for fiscal 2016, despite weaker than expected unit shipments for the fiscal year, we continue to expect QTL revenues to be in the range of $7.3 billion to $8 billion. Given the weaker than expected 3G\/4G device demand, we will need to make some additional progress on signing the remaining license agreements in China in order to be within that range, but continue to feel that is achievable.","As we said at our Analyst Day, although there will be quarterly fluctuations in the externally implied royalty rate that you calculate based on the information we provide, we estimate a normalized rate for fiscal 2016 will be approximately 2.9%. This is based on adjusting for one-time items and other anomalies such as a difference in timing between when revenues for catch-up payments are recognized and when the related TRDS may be reported.","In conclusion, we continue to make good progress in China and are pleased to have resolved the LG dispute. We are keenly focused on concluding the right long-term agreements with the remaining China licensees as well as improving compliance, and expect continued progress throughout the rest of the fiscal year.","That concludes my comments, and I will now turn the call over to George.","George S. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal second quarter non-GAAP revenues were $5.5 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.04, up 7% sequentially and above the high end of our prior guidance range.","In QCT, MSM shipments were 189 million, 2% above the midpoint of our prior guidance, reflecting stronger demand in China. QCT revenues were $3.3 billion, with a sequentially higher implied revenue per MSM. QCT operating margin was 5%, toward the high end of our prior expectations.","In QTL, total reported device sales and revenues benefited from strength in both developed and emerging regions during the holiday quarter. As a reminder, we report QTL on a one-quarter lag, so these results reflect the strength of fourth calendar quarter holiday demand. QTL results also include a one-time revenue benefit of $266 million, resulting from the merger of two infrastructure licensees, as we forecasted on last quarter's call. This was partially offset by the end of a multiyear license fee amortization of approximately $100 million per quarter as well as the impact of the LG dispute revenue deferral, which will now be included in our fiscal third quarter results, consistent with the settlement announced today.","Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses decreased 1% sequentially, slightly less than our guidance range, due to an increase in legal and litigation related expenses.","We returned approximately $2.3 billion to stockholders in the quarter, including approximately $700 million of dividends paid and $1.5 billion in stock repurchases at an average price of approximately $49 per share. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $30 billion.","Our non-GAAP tax rate during the quarter was 18%, consistent with our expected rate for the full year.","Now turning to fiscal 2016, in QTL, as Derek indicated, we continue to forecast revenues will be between $7.3 billion to $8 billion despite a weaker overall TRDS outlook for the year. In QCT, we continue to see improving demand for premium and high-tier devices in the second half of the fiscal year, offset by reduced demand for thin modem products and low-tier chipsets. We remain on track for operating margin of 16% or better in the fourth fiscal quarter.","We also remain on track to meet the $1.4 billion reduction in spending under the strategic realignment plan, and we continue to expect at least $700 million of savings in fiscal 2016 relative to the SRP baseline, ahead of our original $600 million target. A summary of the savings program is included in the investor presentation for this call on our website.","We continue to expect fiscal 2016 non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be down approximately 2% to 4% year over year, which includes the full-year impact of acquisitions of approximately 5%. Adjusting for M&A, estimated spending in these areas would be down 7% to 9% year over year.","Turning to our fiscal third quarter, we estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $5.2 billion to $6 billion, up approximately 1% sequentially at the midpoint, driven by strong product mix in QCT and the favorable LG dispute resolution in QTL, including catch-up revenues from prior-period activity. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share in our fiscal third quarter to be approximately $0.90 to $1.00 per share, down approximately 4% year over year at the midpoint. We expect fiscal third quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be approximately flat sequentially.","In QTL, fiscal third quarter revenues will include recognition of more than $200 million that was deferred in the first fiscal and second quarters related to the LG dispute resolution.","Separately, we estimate total reported device sales between $52 billion and $60 billion will be reported by our licensees in the June quarter for shipments they made in the March quarter, down sequentially compared to the seasonally high holiday quarter shipments. We have not included any potential benefit from license agreements under negotiation, consistent with our prior practice.","We expect QTL's operating margin percentage to be down sequentially, in line with seasonal trends reflecting the first calendar quarter. In QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 175 million to 195 million units during the June quarter and expect revenue per MSM to be up more than 10% sequentially. We expect QCT operating margin to improve sequentially and be in the range of 9% to 10% for the fiscal third quarter. These expectations reflect the benefit of a stronger chip roadmap on both performance and cost leadership across tiers, favorable product mix, growth in adjacent opportunities, and lower operating expenses.","That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren.","Warren Kneeshaw - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, George. Operator, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. James, please make sure that your line is not on mute.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hello? Can you hear me now?","Warren Kneeshaw - Vice President-Investor Relations","Yes, we can hear you, James.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hello? Okay, I'm sorry. So I just had a couple of quick questions. First, I just want to clarify the comments around QTL and its potential licensing. Should we take from your comments that the risk of it potentially falling outside of or below the targeted range for this year have gone up, or are you just trying to clarify that?","And I guess my second question is related, and that is as you continue to pursue licensing agreements with some of the larger Chinese OEMs with whom you don't have agreements, does it reach a stage or when do we reach a stage that you may have to start to pursue legal options through the courts there, and what would that look like? Thanks.","George S. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Great. Thanks, James. On the range of $7.3 billion to $8 billion, our point was the range was initially defined solely by the outcomes based on our market assumptions at the beginning of the year if we were able to. If we weren't able to make much progress, we saw ourselves ending up at about $7.3 billion in QTL on the licensing agreements. If we made significant progress, that could take us to $8 billion.","Obviously, the LG issue from last quarter created some confusion. We said that was really outside the range. Now that that has been resolved, what we're saying is that the end market is softer than we had anticipated when we set the range up front, and that's pulled down the overall size of the market. So we would have to make up some of that in the form of some additional progress on the licensing agreements. And we feel that we're making progress there, so it would be premature to say that we don't believe that we'll end up somewhere in between the $7.3 billion and $8 billion that we started with.","Derek K. Aberle - President","James, this is Derek. On your second question, right now we're really focused on trying to conclude the remaining agreements through negotiation if that's possible. And I think as you've seen and Steve mentioned and I mentioned in my comments, we have been continuing to conclude additional agreements over time. So if we get to the point where we don't believe that that's possible through continued negotiation or the companies aren't negotiating in good faith, then we're certainly prepared to take the next step and enforce our rights. With most of the companies, it would really be more along the lines of an action to enforce their agreement that they have in place today. And like I said, we've been preparing for quite some time to do that if necessary, but so far have felt like we're still making enough progress with the licensees. And I think the progress that you're seeing through the announcements is supportive of that. And so we're going to keep at it and see if we can get across the finish line without the need for litigation. But of course, that's always an option for us if we need it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you, just two if I could. Steve, you mentioned chip margins with regard to thoughts about second-sourcing at large customers. Could you talk to us, just expand a little bit about that on timing, when you think you might see second-source at most of your major customers? And on the cost side of it, do there need to be OpEx cuts if there is a second sourcing going on, or can you handle it without that?","And then just one follow-up for Derek on the Chinese, could you just clarify? There have been a lot of announcements from these large players. Have they pretty much all been just adding three-mode to existing deals, or have any of those large ones announced been fully incremental? Or again, has it just been just three-mode additions? Thank you.","Steven M. Mollenkopf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Tim, this is Steve. So on the second-sourcing, I think the main point is that we have been assuming that in our plans really since the beginning of when we did our restructuring. Difficult for me to talk about timing related to that, but I think the point we wanted to communicate was that we are assuming for planning purposes that that is the case. And even with that, we are comfortable with our margin targets and our improving financials in the chip business in the second half.","Derek K. Aberle - President","Tim, on your second question, I would say we've commented on this a couple of times, and unfortunately there's still a little bit of confusion on the catch-up picture. As we've said, most of the companies that we've been negotiating with to try to conclude agreements on the non-three-mode part of the market have been continuing to report and pay under their agreements. And so when we sign them to the new NDRC terms, that doesn't result in most cases any significant catch-up on the non-three-mode part of the market. As you noted though, in many cases, it will result in them starting to pay royalties and pay past royalties on three-mode devices that were previously not licensed.","It's turned out so far that a number of the players have been the smaller players in the three-mode market. And so the contributions from that haven't been significant, or the way we've structured the deals and how the past royalties have been structured to be paid over time, those are things that will come into our P&L through probably a period of time later in 2016 and maybe even into 2017. And so we are getting agreements for those to be paid. It's just that they're being probably spread over a longer time than people anticipate.","There are less than a handful of companies that we're in negotiations with that are larger players also on three-mode and non-three-mode that have been not reporting while they're negotiating. And when we conclude those deals, you would expect to see more significant catch-up payments for prior-period sales compared to the ones that we've signed to date.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, thank you very much. Can you clarify for the June quarter, what is the royalty rate that we should be thinking about? I understand that 2.9% is the longer-term number. But just in the nearer term given the LG and the China catch-ups, how should we think about that for the June quarter?","Derek K. Aberle - President","Simona, this is Derek. At this point, we're not going to guide quarter by quarter on the implied rate, as I spent a fair amount of time at the Analyst Day going through, there are so many factors that impact it. And the timing of a number of these elements, some of which are in our guidance, some of which are not in our guidance because we haven't yet reached closure on it, can have an impact on the rate.","We do feel, continue to feel, as I noted in my script, that for the year, for the full fiscal year, that we will be in the range of around the 2.9% that I spoke about at the Analyst Day, so still consistent with that. But you are going to continue to see fluctuations quarter over quarter as some of these disputes get resolved or catch-up payments come in. That is going to move, so we're not going to be guiding one quarter out on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity","Great, thanks. Switching over to QCT, to hit your 16% margin, can you walk us through revenue per MSM trends? Is the step-up of 10%-plus going to continue to go higher based on mix shift? And then also, if you could, just talk about your momentum in China on the mid to high tier. How sustainable you think that is over a multi-quarter period, and what that might do to the revenue per MSM trends longer-term? Thank you.","George S. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Mike, it's George. We're seeing a lot of factors that support stronger revenue per MSM growth, not only in the third quarter but also in the fourth quarter, including the lower thin modem. You've got very attractive mix shift between the low tier to the mid and the high tier. All those things will play strongly in revenue per MSM, and we expect that to hold in the third and fourth quarters.","Cristiano R. Amon - EVP, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.-President, Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm, Inc.","Hey, Mike, this is Cristiano. I think to your question on China, I think if you remember, in the last earnings call and during the Analyst Day, I think we talked about an interesting trend in China that was very helpful, is the transition of the market to the new version of LTE with carrier aggregation and as well as all-mode. I think we're starting to see this strategy materialize not only in this quarter but as we think about the coming quarters. And this is driving also the mix improvement on the mid and the high tier. We see the mid and high and premium tier in China actually growing faster than the market. That helped drive the mix improvement for QCT. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I had two. One, I wanted go back to this change in the TRDS unit expectation for the calendar year versus the guidance range for QTL, and just understand. Is the reason that you're not changing the QTL guidance range because these puts and takes, you've signed some deals, the market's a little bit weaker than you thought, you just end up at the same midpoint? Or can you give us some more color around why those two things seem to differ from each other in terms of movement?","And then the second thing I wanted to do, Derek, you mentioned in your commentary I think an ecosystem player and expectations for slower upgrade cycle there. Is most of that expectation happening later this year, or are using it happening now? Can you just clarify what's your definition of ecosystem player? Is that a vendor or is that a particular region of the world? Just give us a little bit more clarity there. Thanks.","Derek K. Aberle - President","Rod, so let me try to take the first one on. So really what we're seeing is if we look at the market for calendar 2016, and 2015 came in just slightly lower than what we expected for the year. We are seeing some softness in the premium tier, some puts and takes, some other weakness in emerging regions, but actually improvement in China. China continues to be quite strong. And overall also, the ASP picture is looking good as well. We expected moderation in the ASP declines year over year, and that seems to be at least so far tracking better than our assumption.","So we do feel like there is \u2013 the net-net of that is a bit weaker market for the fiscal year, but we gave a pretty wide range on QTL revenue for the year just given all the different elements in there. And we felt with still some time left in the year, we do believe we can continue to make progress in China as we have been demonstrating over the last few months. And so as George mentioned, we just felt it was premature to adjust the range. We will need to make more progress relative to where we were before, just given the change in the market, but we still think the range is a reasonable range to hold for now.","On the second question, really I think what we're saying is we are seeing some continued softness in the premium tier. We saw that earlier, and our projections were based on that. It's a little bit more softness, and I think that plays out. It has played out through some of the previous quarters already and will continue through the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question, just two related questions. Just when you talked about with the second sourcing that you had a good idea and had right-sized the OpEx, the definition of second source, would you have an idea of what percentage you'll get?","And the second part is as you look forward into next year, you've always been ahead on the modem, but here is a top-tier phone using someone else's. Can you just talk about the sustainability at the leading edge and talk about what percentage of the market actually uses the Cat 12 modem and whether that can increase over time? Thanks.","Steven M. Mollenkopf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Blayne, this is Steve. I'll take the first part and maybe Cristiano can jump in on the long-term question. I think we took an appropriate planning assumption really for sizing the OpEx. We wanted to make sure that when we implemented our realignment in terms of cost structure that we comprehended, I think, the proper range of outcomes. I think we feel quite strong or quite good about our modem roadmap and where it's going, but I think we're doing the appropriate thing from the perspective of planning our OpEx. And maybe Cristiano could add some of the product details of that.","Cristiano R. Amon - EVP, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.-President, Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm, Inc.","Hi, this is Cristiano. Look, I think it's important to understand. When we think about technology, not only in the modem space but even on the MSM, I think we continue to maintain at least two generations lead over the competition. But I think more important is some of the transitions and trends we're seeing in the market.","I think one of the things is more the Internet is becoming wireless, and you see the 4G transition becoming more mature in developed markets. You see carriers now competing for premium customers. And the transition that we've been talking about, LTE to carrier aggregation, I think that's actually growing faster. So I think you're starting to see gigabit LTE modem that we demonstrated. And we will see from that one, the user from licensing spectrum with the global standard, I think was mentioned by Steve, the LAA, and maybe within the next two to three years an accelerated timeline of deployment of 5G. As we continue to invest and we see those technology transitions ahead of us, we feel very confident that the whole nature of the market is probably going to demand the latest technology and the key devices. So that's how we're feeling about the market and our modem business. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. I just have a couple of questions. For Derek first of all, at the analyst meeting, Derek, you laid out Chinese OEM revenue of $83 billion this year, and you guys really weren't collecting on I think about 44% of that between what was unlicensed and what was basically under-reported. Just given you've now got 100 of these deals done and you've got some of the negotiations and you're doing your compliance program and auditing as well, should we think about \u2013 is the hard work by the end of this fiscal year done that that level that you're not really collecting on today you would have at least addressed through deals and under-reporting, or is this a program and situation that could roll all the way into 2017?","And then for Steve and for Cristiano maybe, on the LTE modem probably the last comment you made, I take the point, by the way, that there's carrier aggregation and everything else. It looks like you lost market share last year in the chipset industry on the wireless side. It probably sounds like there's some risk as we go through this year as well, and I'm just wondering. Does it take till actually 5G comes out and carrier aggregation wouldn't really drive home your competitive advantage, or could the market share for you at some point start inflecting and you start gaining share in this industry again? Many thanks.","Derek K. Aberle - President","Kulbinder, this is Derek. On your first question, I think you got the numbers right. The chart that we showed at the Analyst Day was again for fiscal 2016, basically just in your revenue note catch-up from prior periods. And we said if we completed these remaining negotiations with the handful of companies we have left that that would get us to about 75%-ish collection rate on the TRDS, but that we would continue to have compliance issues that we were going to need to work through. And that really is going to be something that we hope to make progress on and expect to make progress on as we move through 2016, but certainly will also be a longer-term project. There's a fair amount of work involved and it's going to take some time. So I think the way to look at it is if we can achieve the results that we hope in the negotiations, we'll have a meaningful step function up on collections, but to get to the remainder of that 25% issue is going to take some time.","Cristiano R. Amon - EVP, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.-President, Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm, Inc.","This is Cristiano. I think maybe to address your question on share, I think it may be important to decompose that question into different segments. One, if you look on the premium tier, we have been \u2013 there have been a number of announcements. We've been very confident in the Snapdragon 820. I think we made a lot of progress there. I think even if you look with one of the large customers, both the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge that launched in the second fiscal quarter, they're using the Snapdragon 820. And I think we have about 117 designs. We feel good about that portfolio.","And in China, if you look at what happened, when China entered 4G \u2013 when we started the transition to 4G, we expected over time, we started with very high share. We expected that to normalize over time. But what we've seen actually in this year, we are doing better than we expected in share in China, and also seeing the impact of those technologies changing the product mix from growth being higher from the low to the mid and high tier, showing that modem continues to be a good point of differentiation even in a growth market like in China.","I think maybe to clarify this, I believe we had said early in the year as we went through the SRP that we were planning so that we could derisk the market concentration in our planning assumptions, I think that's what we're saying. We're planning that we have conservative planning assumptions. But at the end of the day, we're still designing a very competitive product roadmap, and we're seeing good traction in the marketplace, not only on the modem, but the MSM premium tier and the product portfolio that we have been commercializing in China. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, I had two. I guess first of all, a question for all of you. Do you worry that we're talking about share loss at the premium tier? And there's some consensus as to who you're going to lose that to on the chip side. And of course, they make their own chips. So do you worry that that becomes a competitive disadvantage over time, having access to world-class manufacturing that your foundry partners, just frankly, aren't able to just keep up?","Steven M. Mollenkopf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, Tim, this is Steve. I think a couple things. One is just to reiterate that for the purpose of when we plan OpEx and our margin trajectories, we do assume that something will happen, but we're quite confident in our roadmap.","Now right now, our products that we are competing against are really not manufactured by \u2013 it's not a vertical play in terms of who we're going after. And then specifically when you look at our foundry partners, they \u2013 we're very happy with what we're seeing from a transistor roadmap out in time, actually from multiple sources. So we feel not only can we compete in the modem tier and the connectivity tiers, but even more importantly in computing and even computing going into very high-performance computing, we have the transistors to be able to make that successful. So I think we feel very confident both in the transistor roadmap that we're seeing from our suppliers and also with the business model that we will be in a strong position.","I think also our scale within the fabless industry is actually helping us a lot in terms of pricing. I think that's one of the things you're seeing the benefit of in terms of some of the margin improvement that you're seeing embedded in the business in the second half and even delivered out here in the second quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Bernstein Research","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one on the QTL licensing guide, I've got to be honest. I still don't understand why you're guiding like you're guiding. I understand what you're saying. You need to get more collection out. But if your trends of collection, the range of collection right now was the same today as it was when you first gave the guidance, what would the guidance range be? What are we talking about here?","Secondly, it seems to me like you are implicitly guiding your QTL margins, your operating margins into the mid-70% for next quarter, which is lower than seasonal. And I know you said you had some increase in legal and litigation costs, which I assume is what's driving that. So are these compliance-related, or is there something else going on the legal and litigation front that's taking the QTL operating margins down next quarter?","Derek K. Aberle - President","Stacy, this is Derek. If you look at the Q3 guide, I think our view has been that we're not going to include in guidance in-quarter deals unless we have clear line of sight to those and they're essentially either done or close to done. And so we've been taking a more conservative approach maybe than we have in the past, and we've been doing that for a couple of quarters now. I think as you see, the guide in Q3 is consistent with that. And I think really if you step back and look at it, the difference may be just the terms of the assumptions and timing if I look at some of the other models out there in terms of what lands in Q3 versus Q4. Because of the way we're guiding, that would essentially mean that more is in Q4 versus Q3 as you look at the profile for the year, assuming we're able to conclude those remaining deals. So that may be part of it.","On the margin question, I just think you're \u2013 I'm not sure how you got to your number. That's not consistent with what we're modeling in the business.","George S. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I would add that that would be well below our assumption for QTL in any of the remaining quarters. And I think what we've seen is on some of these licensing arrangements, they can be large and lumpy, and trying to forecast what is inherently a negotiation process proved over a number of quarters to be something that either: one, was hard to do; or two, created unnecessary negotiating leverage. And so I think we'll stick with this process. But we have said for the full year in the $7.3 billion to $8 billion that we'll have to conclude some activity on the licensing front to get back within that range because of the softness in the market. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Tal Liani - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Hi, guys. I wanted to understand two things. First, the contribution of LG this quarter, when you guided the quarter, I think that LG was not in. And I'm trying to understand how much of the strength this quarter is related the addition of LG versus your previous expectations and how much is the underlying market.","And then second, this is a broader question. Your QTL is down 11.6% year over year, and I know there was a catch-up payment last year. But if I look at \u2013 think about things at a high level, China was not in last quarter outside of the catch-up payment I think from Huawei. This year, this quarter you do have China in. You also have LG in. So why are we seeing \u2013 we don't see much higher contribution of China just on a like-for-like basis. Again, the TRDS between the two quarters is down 7.5%, but your revenues are down 11.6%, so you're down more than the TRDS. That shouldn't happen given that China is kicking in this year. So I'm just trying to understand the dynamics of China contribution and why isn't it at a much stronger pace or a much stronger revenue level than we are seeing right now. Thanks.","George S. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Tal, just to be clear, the LG settlement happened in our third quarter, so it is not in the second quarter numbers. It will be roughly $200 million. We said it's a couple hundred \u2013 roughly $100 million a quarter for the first two quarters that will be catch-up that's embedded in our guidance. And then we'll be back to a run rate with LG. But that's all in Q3. Really, the Q2 item that we talked about was the fact that you had the ALU [Alcatel-Lucent] agreement, which added approximately $250 million. And then we had seen the discontinuation of a licensing amortization of about $100 million in that quarter. Derek, did you want to comment on...","Derek K. Aberle - President","Yes, I think just to add to what George said, I think really what we said about LG was it's in the quarters we've talked about, it's been more than $100 million per quarter. So as George said, that is not in Q2. That will be reflected in Q3, both the in-quarter activity for Q3 as well as two prior quarters of catch up.","In terms of trying to do the walk between last year Q2 to this year Q2, George hit on some of that. Obviously, we've got a one-time event in Q2 this quarter with the acceleration of the license fee that came in, the $266 million-ish payment, but then being offset by the fact that LG revenues are deferred, they're not in the quarter. And then we also have the end of this $100 million-ish a quarter amortization that's reflected in this quarter. Plus, as you mentioned, a year ago we had some catch-up payments, about $150 million from the resolution of a prior dispute.","And then the China contribution, China was reflected pretty strongly in a year-ago quarter, meaning that was the last quarter that was reported to us before the NDRC resolution. The effect of that took hold in January of 2015. And so one of the other issues you're dealing with, with the year-over-year comparison is you've got application of the NDRC terms now in this quarter that wasn't a factor a year ago, as well as we saw the amount of units that are being under-reported accelerate throughout the year last year, in particular related to these negotiations where licensees stopped paying. And that was not really a primary driver in a year-ago quarter. So I think that's the walk as probably best we can break it out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question, a couple of them here. First on the MSM guidance, unit guidance for next quarter, so if I look at that on a year-over-year basis, it's down high teens. And obviously you're gaining some share at a major customer. I assume all of that cannot be related to unit weakness at the other major customer. And yet everything I hear so far is China is good, China is good. So help me with that disconnect. What's driving that unit growth in light of some share gains at one of your \u2013 or unit decline year over year in light of some share gains at one of your larger customers?","And then secondly, to help me get to that 16% operating margin guidance for June, should we expect a more material change in the R&D or SG&A line item as we go from Q3 to Q4 than we've seen earlier this year? Thanks.","George S. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. On the MSMs, as you look at year over year, there's definitely a significant delta from one major customer that is contributing. And what you're seeing in China is a shift in low\/entry to mid and high, and so it's one of the reasons why you're seeing strong pickup in revenue per MSM in the quarter. So it's a story more of mix shift. It's pretty neutral outside of that. And so the low tier units, they tend to be more of those low-tier units that we're trading off, but we're picking up a significant amount of mid-high.","In terms of OpEx, we expect OpEx to continue to decrease into the fourth quarter, but I think some of the comparisons that you may be doing would be looking at R&D period over period. But in one period, we didn't have the CSR OpEx; in the other period we do. So just make sure you're doing an apples-to-apples comparison because we've already seen a fair amount of the reduction already in the base level OpEx.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks very much. A clarification, the LG resolution of the dispute, did it actually end up in any of the terms of the payments from LG changing? And if so, are there any adjustments to prior periods that you've already recognized payments from LG?","Derek K. Aberle - President","This is Derek. No, there are not any. The deal will not result in any modifications or changes to revenue that was previously recorded by the company. And as we said, really the results of this will be reflected in Q3, not in Q2.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess two questions. First on OpEx, your fiscal year guide implies OpEx down 7% in September. I'm curious if that's right, and what we should think about going into the December quarter.","And then secondly, with the nice uplift to ASPs for MSM in the June quarter, I'm curious how we should think about that heading into the back half of the calendar year as you layer in both the high-end as well as mid-level handsets. Thank you.","George S. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, we said for the full year on OpEx, if you just look at the reported numbers, we'll be down 2% to 4%, but we have about a 5% impact from acquisitions. So it would be down in the range of 7% to 9% year over year. And as I said, we would continue to expect some cost reduction continuing through the back half of the year just on some of the actions that have taken place.","In terms of revenue per MSM, as I said earlier, I think the dynamics that are driving the significant pickup that we are seeing in Q3 remain in place for Q4, very good mix, strong demand for our premium tier, again, a shift from low tier into the mid and high tier, and then some softness certainly comparatively year over year on thin modem volumes, which tend to depress revenues per MSM.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research. Please go ahead.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","Thanks. Steve, you said that the forecast for QCT margins include expectations for second-source at your largest customers. Are we to imply from that statement that the mere mention of it means that it will be material in either units or margins, or do you see it more as a headline risk?","And then along those same lines, since we are talking about Intel, it is true that every modem they've shipped so far has been fabbed at TSMC. But does your calculus on competition or market share change if they move that modem into their own process, or does it have no bearing at all on your outlook? Thanks.","Steven M. Mollenkopf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Ed, I think on the second question, it really doesn't bear much to it. The modem business is all about feature leadership and RF, and it's really about technology breadth and technology complexity. It tends to be less about die size and those things. And first to market, first to market with complexity tends to be the thing that leads the most.","I think on your first question, it's really a communication of a planning assumption and also confidence in us meeting our long-term trajectory, both in this year and outside of this year with that assumption. I think it's important to make sure people understand that. We do feel very confident, though, in our position in the modem segment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Dean Grumlose - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hello, this is Dean Grumlose calling in for Kevin. Thanks very much for taking my question. I have seen numerous announcements of infrastructure and ecosystem progress with ARM-based server effort. Can you provide any additional color of your progress in ARM-based servers at this time, and when we might possibly see products or initial revenues?","Derek K. Aberle - President","Kevin, this is Derek. We went into some detail on the server opportunity that we're pursuing a couple months ago at the Analyst Day. And so we feel very good about the opportunity there. Not only is it a big and growing opportunity, but we feel like we're very well positioned to be successful in going after it. We're looking \u2013 we have some development platform out that's in customers' hands today and we're getting feedback on that, and that's going quite well.","In terms of commercial product, basically our assumption is that we will be shipping samples towards the end of the year, and revenue would be something that would flow through mid to late next year.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Mollenkopf, do you have anything to add before adjourning the call?","Steven M. Mollenkopf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, thank you. I want to thank everyone for attending the call today. We had a stronger than expected quarter, and are executing well on our plans to position the company for the next phase of profitable growth.

We delivered a stronger than expected quarter, with earnings per share coming in above the high end of our initial guidance, driven by strong 3G\/4G device sales and lower operating expenses in QCT.","QCT chipset shipments were near the high end of expectations, with low tier strength across OEMs particularly in China, offsetting some weakness in thin modem sales at a key customer. QTL revenues were higher than expectations on strong 3G\/4G device volumes and ASPs and we continue to make progress in signing up Chinese licensees, although there is still more work to be done on that front.","During the quarter, we also returned approximately $2.8 billion to stockholders through dividends and stock repurchases which included the completion of the incremental $10 billion in stock repurchases we announced last March. This $10 billion is over and above our commitment to return a minimum of 75% of free cash flow to our stockholders.","We're also very pleased to have announced an agreement to form a joint venture with TDK to enable the delivery of RF front-end modules and RF filters into fully integrated systems for mobile devices and other IoT applications. Once closed, we will add TDK's capabilities in micro-acoustic RF filtering, packaging and module integration technologies to our RF 360 portfolio to offer leading-edge RF solutions in fully integrated systems that we believe will provide significant advantages in performance and time to launch across our Snapdragon product tiers.","The deal is expected to close in early 2017 and is forecasted to be accretive to non-GAAP earnings in its first year. We have a strong pipeline of new RF front-end products, including new generations of our envelope tracker, antenna tuner, switches and CMOS and gallium arsenide PAs. Our gas PAs are anticipated to enter production in 2017.","In addition, we continue to deepen our level of cooperation with an investment in China. We just announced a cooperation agreement with the province of Guizhou, including the formation of a joint venture that will design, develop and sell advanced server chipset technology in China. This builds on the announcement we made in October, detailing the availability of our server development platform which is now sampling to tier-one cloud customers and the strategic partnerships we have established with Xilinx and Mellanox. We continue to make good progress on the elements of our strategic realignment plan and are on track to achieve our cost-savings targets.","I would also like to welcome Jeff Henderson to the Board. Jeff brings extensive financial and operational management experience to his position as an Independent Director, including 10 years as CFO of Cardinal Health and past automotive industry experience. Following our annual meeting in March, assuming our slate of directors are elected, our Board size will be reduced to 12 members and the average tenure will be reduced to approximately five years.","I would also like to congratulate Cristiano Amon on his promotion to President of QCT. He provided exceptional leadership over his 18 years at Qualcomm and will play a critical role in expanding QCT's road map, enhancing our customer relationships, structuring our efforts for success in our adjacent opportunities and positioning the business for long term success.","On that note, we continue to be pleased with the performance and design traction of our Snapdragon 820 processor.","The first product announcement based on the 820 occurred at CES and we expect a number of exciting launches in the first half of this calendar year, including many at Mobile World Congress. We now have more than 100 design wins based on the 820 and the product is entering mass production using 14 nanometer LPP technology.","At the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this month, it was clear that many industries are looking to leverage mobile technology into their products and businesses are looking to the leaders in communications and computer systems, such as Qualcomm, to make the world more connected and smarter. Our many announcements at the show reflect our progress extending Qualcomm technology into adjacent and new areas, including automotive, IoT and networking.","In auto, we announced that Qualcomm Snapdragon 602A processors will be commercially available in 2017 Audi vehicles. We also introduced our next-generation Snapdragon 820 automotive processor, as well as several other products, including our wireless charging technology. For IoT, we announced a smart home-reference platform using the Snapdragon 212 processor, the new Qualcomm aptX HD solution for high-resolution audio over Bluetooth, a new Bluetooth smart SOC, the first commercial drone based on the QUALCOMM Snapdragon Flight platform and the Snapdragon X5 9X07 LTE modem which broadens our family of modem solutions for IoT.","In networking, we launched Qualcomm Wi-Fi SON which is a self-organizing network solution, to simplify Wi-Fi networking and optimize user experience. And we showed significant traction in multiband Wi-Fi 802.11 AC and 11 AD, enabling products across multiple segments.","As we did in both 3G and 4G, we're leading the industry in the development of a unified, more capable 5G platform that will take on a much larger role than previous generations and deliver new levels of efficiency. The foundation of this platform is an OFDM-based unified air interface, that will not only enhance mobile broadband services, but also enable connectivity for the Internet of Things and new types of mission-critical services that require lower latency, higher reliability and robust security. 5G will also include native support for advanced technologies, such as the use of unlicensed spectrum, multicast and device-to-device capabilities. We're pioneering these technologies today with our leadership in LTE Advanced and LTE Advanced Pro. These new technologies are paving the way for 5G and accelerating our path to a truly connected future.","Overall, we're pleased with our progress on key initiatives, execution of the strategic realignment plan, design traction for the Snapdragon 820, refreshing the QCT road map across tiers, broadening our presence in adjacent opportunities, progress on new licensing agreements in China, execution of our data center strategy and advancements that will extend our technology leadership position. I want to reiterate that we remain focused on execution to improve our financial trajectory, exiting the fiscal year.","Our industry and Company are undergoing rapid changes and we're enthusiastic about the opportunities ahead. We're extending our leadership in mobile and are driving our mobile technologies and core competencies in communication systems and high-performance low-power computing into significant new areas. We have taken action to enable us to seize these opportunities, while delivering improved performance.","I'm optimistic about the future and have great confidence in our employees to execute on our strategies and drive growth. I look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Analyst Day and would now like to turn the call over to Derek Aberle.","Derek Aberle","Thank you, Steve and good afternoon, everyone. QTL had a strong fiscal first quarter, with total reported device sales of $60.6 billion which was above expectations on both higher ASPs and reported units, as well as some catch-up reporting from recently concluded license agreements in China. QTL revenues in the quarter were higher than expectations and would have been even higher if not for a contract dispute with LG that resulted in us deferring revenue of more than $100 million for the quarter.","Although LG continues to report and pay, we're not recognizing revenue while the arbitration regarding the dispute proceeds. We believe LG's claims are without merit. The deferral of this revenue has the effect of depressing the implied royalty rate as you would calculate it, as their shipments are included in total reported device sales without the corresponding revenue. Assuming we conclude this matter successfully, as we have done with others in the past, we would expect to recognize the deferred revenues at that time.","Looking ahead, the outlook for global 3G\/4G device shipments continues to be strong. With respect to smartphones in particular, there continues to be a significant opportunity for Qualcomm. LTE penetration is only 14% of cellular connections globally and smartphone unit shipments are forecast to be more than 8.5 billion from 2015 through 2019, according to GSM Intelligence and Gartner.","Calendar 2015 global 3G\/4G device shipments are largely in line with our prior expectations, driven primarily by migrations to 4G in China, partially offset by some recent weakness in developed regions. We continue to estimate that calendar 2016 global 3G\/4G device shipments will grow approximately 10% at the midpoint, driven primarily by the migration to 3G\/4G devices in emerging regions, with particular strength in India.","Our estimate for premium tier shipments is down slightly versus our prior view, driven by slower-than-expected sell-through at a large OEM. But that is offset by a slightly stronger outlook for emerging region shipments. We continue to expect low single-digit growth in global 3G\/4G device sales in FY '16, as unit growth more than offsets ASP declines. We will provide further color on our long term outlook for the 3G\/4G device opportunity at our upcoming Analyst Day.","Now let me provide an update on our progress with licensing in China. We're continuing to aggressively seek to conclude new license agreements on the NDRC terms with the remaining Chinese OEMs and improve compliance. We're making progress with these negotiations and recently concluded new agreements with Xiaomi, Haier, QiKu and Tianyu. These agreements include royalty-bearing licenses for three-mode devices and contain terms that are consistent with the terms of the rectification plan submitted to the NDRC. Having said that, we still need to conclude agreements with a handful of key Chinese OEMs and those negotiations continue.","Our progress and our ongoing interactions with the NDRC and other parts of the Chinese government continue to give us confidence that we will be able to conclude agreements with the remaining key OEMs. While we're working to conclude new license agreements and improve compliance through commercial negotiations and audits, we're prepared to enforce our agreements and take other actions against certain OEMs that are not negotiating in good faith, underreporting royalties or refusing to conclude agreements in the near term.","Turning to our outlook for FY '16, we continue to expect QTL's revenues to be in the range of $7.3 billion to $8 billion. Although additional risk has been introduced as a result of the new LG dispute, given that it could be resolved outside of FY '16. In conclusion, although we're seeing some near term softness in the premium tier, the sales of smartphones remain healthy and should continue to grow. We remain confident that we will be able to resolve the dispute with LG, conclude new agreements with the remaining key Chinese OEMs and improve compliance over time.","That concludes my comments and I look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Analyst Day. I will now turn the call over to George.","George Davis","Thank you, Derek and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results reflect a strong quarter relative to November guidance and are consistent with our update a few weeks ago. Fiscal first quarter revenues were $5.8 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.97, $0.12 above the midpoint of our original guidance. The outperformance primarily reflected stronger revenues in our licensing business and accelerated cost reductions in QCT.","We also benefited at the end of the quarter from the permanent reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, impacting non-GAAP earnings per share by approximately $0.01 to $0.02. In QTL, higher-than-expected ASPs and shipments led to stronger revenues at $1.6 billion and more than offset the dispute impact in the quarter.","Total reported device sales include some reported devices without the corresponding revenue from the LG dispute that Derek described, as well as some deferred three-mode revenues. QCT shipped 242 million MSMs, with revenues of $4.1 billion and operating margin of 14%, reflecting stronger-than-expected demand in the low tier, particularly in China, partially offset by lower-than- expected shipments of thin modems.","For the Company, non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses were lower than our expectations, decreasing approximately 2% sequentially, reflecting an acceleration of some of our SRP cost initiatives originally forecasted to be taken later in the fiscal year. Operating cash flow was strong at $2.7 billion or 47% of revenue for the quarter and we returned $2.8 billion to stockholders in the form of dividends and buybacks.","As of the end of the fiscal first quarter, we had approximately $4.9 billion of our stock repurchase authorization remaining. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 17% in the fiscal first quarter and we now estimate that our FY '16 non-GAAP tax rate will be approximately 18%, including the impact of the permanently reinstated R&D tax credit, down from our previous estimate of 19% to 20%.","Now turning to FY '16, for QTL, we're not modifying the prior $7.3 billion to $8 billion revenue range for the year. However, that range did not anticipate deferral of revenues related to the LG dispute. While we're working hard to resolve this dispute and believe their claims are without merit, it is possible that the resolution will not occur in FY '16. In this case, the deferral of the LG revenue outside of the fiscal year could impact the range by several hundred miIlion dollars.","In QCT, we continue to expect improving trends in the second half of the fiscal year on new product traction. We also continued to expect to achieve a QCT operating margin of 16% or better in the fiscal fourth quarter.","We remain on track to meet the spending reduction objectives under the strategic realignment plan and now expect at least $700 million of savings in FY '16 and to exit the year at a savings run rate of $1.1 billion. We expect FY '16 non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be down approximately 2% to 4% year over year, down an additional 1% at the midpoint on earlier capture of cost savings relative to previous estimates.","Turning to our guidance for the second quarter of FY '16, our outlook reflects a seasonally strong December quarter for 3G\/4G device shipments for QTL and the seasonally lower first calendar quarter MSM shipments for QCT. Consistent with last quarter, our guidance does not include a forecast of potential revenue from signing new license agreements in China and we have excluded estimated revenue from LG as a result of the dispute.","We estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $4.9 billion to $5.7 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of approximately $0.90 to $1 per share. We anticipate fiscal second quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be down approximately 2% to 4% sequentially, reflecting continued progress on our SRP initiatives.","In QTL, we estimate total reported device sales of $65 billion to $73 billion will be reported by our licensees in the March quarter for shipments they made in the December quarter, up approximately 14% sequentially at the midpoint, reflecting the seasonal strength of the holiday quarter. If the dispute-related units continue to be reported and the matter is not resolved during the quarter, then we could again see units included in PRDS for which revenue would not be recognized.","Also in QTL, we're expecting a one-time benefit of approximately $250 million in revenue in the fiscal second quarter, based on termination of an infrastructure license agreement that resulted from one of our licensees acquiring another one of our licensees. This was partially offset by the end of a multi-year amortization of approximately $100 million in quarterly license fees. These events were expected and contemplated in our prior guidance.","In QCT, we expect MSM shipments of approximately 175 million to 195 million units, lower sequentially, reflecting seasonal trends, somewhat exaggerated by an above seasonal decline in demand for thin modem products. We also see some modest negative impact from mix shift across OEMs and devices in China.","We expect revenue per MSM to be higher quarter over quarter, reflecting stronger mix, including a lower mix of thin modem shipments. And consistent with our prior guidance, we expect QCT's fiscal second quarter operating margin percentage to be in the low to mid-single digits.","That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren.","Warren Kneeshaw","Thank you, George. Operator, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","MikeWalkley","George, just following up on the QTL guidance, is that $250 million from the merger of your infrastructure customers, is that included in the guidance? I just wanted to clarify that. And then overall, longer term, as you look at QTL with the royalty rate and more three-mode devices coming in, Derek, can you just help us think about maybe the implied royalty rate going forward? That would be very helpful.","GeorgeDavis","Sure, hi, Mike. This is George. Yes, the $250 million is included in the guidance. And remember, it is netted against the expiration of about $100 million a quarter from a previous multi-year agreement. Mike, this is Derek. On the implied royalty rate question, I think there are so many moving pieces on this, but let me give you a high-level view. I think there's going to be some lumpiness as we go forward just in terms of catch-up units coming in and some of those will be three-mode units for prior periods, as well as then as licensees start reporting more three-mode, that will put some pressure on the rate.","Although, actually what we're seeing in the market in China is more of a shift to five- and six-mode devices and away from three-mode devices. And so a lot of the design traction has moved and I think as you go into the second half of 2016, we will probably start seeing, as a percentage of units in China, a reduction in the amount of three-mode on a go-forward basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","TimLong","Just sticking on the royalty rate and the QTL business, Derek. First, I just wanted to make sure I understand. I guess there's the moving parts, but if the LG is a little more than $100 million and that number still seems like the calculated number would be 10 or 15 basis points under 3. So is that -- do we have a new reset to rate there or is there something else that dragged the number in the quarter down? And then, the unit numbers, the paid units were pretty good above what we've seen as normal seasonality. Can you break down for us how much of that was catch-up? Or maybe how much of that was contribution from some of these new deals that have been signed recently? Thank you.","DerekAberle","On the rate, there's a few things affecting it in the quarter. We gave $100 million, we said more than $100 million and so we're not being entirely precise on that number. So I think you need to be a little bit careful about just taking it to the $100 million. But we also had some catch-up units come through in the quarter, for which we didn't have revenue in the quarter, given the structure of the deal in terms of when it's going to get paid out. That revenue we expect will come in in future quarters, so that's also having a drag.","So you have got the disputed TRDS, as well as this three-mode element that is collectively putting some pressure on the rate. There are catch-up units in the quarter. I would say that they are not a huge contributor, but they are probably less than about 20 million units for the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","KulbinderGarcha","Can you just maybe talk through the drivers of the QCT modern decline into the next quarter? It seems like quite a severe drop. I know there's seasonality, but we haven't observed it to be that volatile in the past. That's the first question on QCT. And on QTL, Derek, maybe thinking about it another way, it looks like now, if my math is right, you've signed with vendors all -- with the new terms that account for almost 50%, 60% of the Chinese smartphone market.","And I would've thought at some point, the increasing compliance in China will drive an uptick to the QTL revenue profile. It doesn't seem to be doing that, even if I take out the impact of LG this year. So how should we think about the future compliance of more vendors you want to sign up? Should that QTL revenue [indiscernible] reflecting that or are there other factors at work that we should think about this year? Thanks.","GeorgeDavis","So on the margin decline quarter over quarter and again as a reminder, we actually guided this at last quarter's call as well. As you see, the big seasonal pull back in volumes and the mix change that we see, that has both an absorption of OpEx issue and a gross margin reduction element to it. And the combination of those at this level of revenue pulls it down to our forecast. I will say, as we've talked about, we see those dynamics actually reversing themselves and actually providing momentum into the back half of the year in terms of margin improvement. And we still see getting to 16% in Q4 in QCT.","DerekAberle","Again, I think you got to break down the TRDS picture in China. There's really three elements. One is the underreporting which I think is largely referred to as the compliance issue. Then there is three-mode volume that is unlicensed and we're working actively to get companies signed up so that they start paying on three-mode. And then the third thing that we talked about last quarter were actually a small number of companies, but actually meaningful in size that had actually started withholding reports and payment of licensed non-three-mode units. And so as we conclude new agreements with those companies, you'll see a meaningful improvement in the run rate collection because there also tend to be some of the larger three-mode players in China.","So you will capture the three-mode, plus you'll get them back reporting on the non-three-mode which will leave you really with this compliance question which will still be something we need to work through. But those two, I think it's really a relatively small number of companies that need to get signed and you'll see a pretty material improvement in the run rate in QTL.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","JamesFaucette","I just had a couple of questions related to royalty collections. First, in the contract dispute with LG, can you give a little color there as to is this at all connected to the KFTC process within Korea? Or is resolution somehow of one dependent on the other? And then along those same lines, maybe if you could give any update on your engagement and progress with the different governments that are looking at Qualcomm's practices in Korea, Taiwan and the EU? Thank you very much.","DerekAberle","I will take the first part of that. Really the dispute we have with LG is really unrelated to the issues that are before KFTC. We've had this throughout the history of the licensing program. It is just part of the business that will from time to time have disputes with our licensees. This is really a contract dispute under their agreement similar to a number of the ones we've had in the past which we have resolved successfully for the Company. And we feel very firmly that we're going to be able to do that again here. And so there will be a question of timing.","We decided for now not to adjust the QTL revenue guidance for the year, because we still have three quarters left to resolve it. And we think there is a chance that that can happen. If it goes all the way through the arbitration process, that will likely push it outside the fiscal year. But we feel very good in our position and again, we've been through a number of these in the past and they have worked out well.","DonRosenberg","In terms of the more color on some of the regulatory issues that we're dealing with, not much more color we can add other than to say our licensing model, as you know, has been in effect for quite a few decades. It's been modeled after others. Everybody in the industry follows the device-level licensing, for example. And we're very confident in the chances of trying to convince regulators that this model has not only been effective, but has enhanced competition.","We have through our licensing model of sharing our intellectual property, I think we have broadened the field and our immense investment in research and development and the core technologies which we patent and then share I think has contributed to the growth of this industry. And hopefully, we will be able to demonstrate that as we go through these regulatory matters.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","RodHall","I got a couple. First one I wanted to ask you, you talked about -- you said less than 20 million catch-up units in the quarter. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the potential timing of catch-up in China and what the outstanding unit number looks like. We have our estimates, but it would be nice to get some indication from you guys. And then I also wanted to talk a little bit about QTC margins again. Two questions within that. One is, can you give us some idea of what the fixed cost level there is? And should we be looking at fiscal Q1, fiscal Q2 and that margin move as some indication of where that number is?","The second question I had is those margins are pretty strong in Q1 and just wondered if you could talk a little bit about what is going on underlying that since the mix was shifted to the low end. I would've thought that would drag margins down, but they were actually quite strong. So could you just comment on that? Thank you.","DerekAberle","On the catch-up units and compliance, we've -- we gave some color on that in-- for the full-year FY '15. And if you looked at the delta between what we gave as the global device sales and the reported device sales, it was about 9% or $25 billion. So that was the range for 2015. For 2016, it's really going to be dependent, I think, highly on the timing of getting these additional agreements signed.","The underlying underreporting by licensees that have agreements, I would say has largely been in line over the last couple of quarters. It's not materially improving or worsening; it's really been more the dynamic of the people that have withheld payment and reporting which will get resolved upon signing the agreement. So I think the rough-sizing that we gave for 2015 with that color hopefully will get you there.","GeorgeDavis","On Q1, I think one of the things that you saw was better performance by QCT, particularly on OpEx pulling in some of the cost savings earlier into the year which actually helped that margin and improved that margin relative to our expectations going into the quarter. I would say that some of that has narrowed. In terms of the OpEx improvement quarter over quarter, you're not getting quite the move.","So on lower revenue, OpEx as a percent of revenue is obviously going to weigh on the margin. And then of course, you just have the natural gross margin impact when you see a big seasonal adjustment in units and that's really what we're seeing. So nothing more than that and again, those things tend to reverse themselves, as I said earlier, in the second half of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Simona Jankowski","Another question on the royalty rate, I just wanted to clarify again of the 2.65% implied rate in the quarter, if you took out the one-off impacts like the catch-up of the China licensees as well as the LG, what would that number have been? And then once we get past the March quarter and that one-time $250 million benefit from the infrastructure merger, did I understand you correctly that there is going to be a $100-million impact on the royalty rate collection on a go-forward basis past that? So effectively about a 15-basis-point hit to the implied rate? And then I have a follow-up.","Derek Aberle","So I think last quarter, basically what we said about the implied royalty rate for the year, we said, listen it's going to be highly dependent on the timing of signing up some of the new agreements in China and moving people over to the CPLA rates. But on balance, we expected it to be down modestly for the year. So I would say if you adjusted for the impact of the disputed revenue and the reported sales in the quarter that didn't have revenue coming along with it because of the catch-up units, we would be broadly in line with that.","You are correct, that once this amortization of the $100 million expires that will come out. We've talked about the fact that we have license fees and those are amortized over a period of time. So once those go way, that will become a drag. But that was anticipated. And so when we gave the color of what we expected the rate to do for the year with all of the moving pieces in mind, that was factored in.","Simona Jankowski","Okay, so the clean rate for the quarter was something close to 3%. And then looking out a couple of quarters, like for like, it would come down to something like 2.8% once you remove the infrastructure amortization.","Derek Aberle","Yes, that is generally correct. I would say that the second part of your question, it would imply no other changes. But we do think that there is some other things that could potentially play out throughout the year that would be a positive bias on the rate. So I think that's maybe the piece you're missing. But otherwise, I think that's generally right.","Simona Jankowski","Okay, understood. And then just a quick separate question was on the comment about your server chips sampling with the tier-one hyperscale customers. When would you expect to see production volumes? And when would you expect that to be something that can move the needle for QCT?","Derek Aberle","When we first started talking about this, we were pretty clear that we're going to be in investment mode for a period of time here before this becomes a meaningful contributor. We're very positive on the signs we're seeing, both in North America with the large cloud players, as well as in China. And so you'll start seeing some shipments within probably the next year or so. But really, when you think about it as a contributor, it's going to be out a few years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Timothy Arcuri","I had two the first one is on M&A. Obviously, you have a lot of offshore cash and I just wanted to get your opinion. I think that the TDK deal was great, but I wanted to get your opinion on maybe something bigger, some sort of transformational deal that maybe you could do in QCT. So, just wanted to get your general thoughts there.","Steve Mollenkopf","Sure Timothy, it's Steve Mollenkopf. The way we think about it is we obviously have the ability to execute on something like that. We don't feel like there's really a gun to our had to be able to have to do it. We feel we have a good growth path. But we're pleased to be able to return the cash that we have and will continue to do and have options to do that. As the industry consolidates, I think we're going to consider ourselves to be getting in a stronger position versus a weaker position to be able to take advantage of that trends that I spoke about it my script. So, we feel like we're in a good spot, but we don't feel like we have to do something in order to grow.","Timothy Arcuri","And then a question for George, on the 185 million MSMs in March, can you give maybe a sense in terms of how many of the new design wins for 820 are included in that number? Or is that more of a June event? Thanks.","George Davis","Yes, I can't give you the specifics too much on that. But what I can tell you is that we really see the 820 as more of a second half. We certainly see that we'll be shipping some devices in the latter part of this quarter, but it's really going to be more evident in the second half of the year. And maybe Cristiano, I'll let you jump in on that. It's -- we're seeing more -- it's more -- I would say Q2 is more of a strong season effect with an exaggerated effect, as I said in my prepared remarks, on thin modem.","Cristiano Amon","Just one comment, I think it's very optimistic about the 820 design traction. Right now, we're supporting key flagship designs through care recertification, then volume ramp will happen the second half of FY '16.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Tal Liani","Just one clarification before my question, you said in response to what Simona asked you, you said that there are positives on the rate that could come through the rest of the year. Outside of LG coming back, is there any other positive on the royalty rate that could -- any other positive that could impact the royalty rate? So that's question number one. Question number two is about the implications of 820 in the second half of the year. Can you discuss the implications on margins and the implications on ASPs? I think the ASPs are quite straightforward. But the question is, when you start ramping 820, does it have positive implications on margins right from the beginning? Or to the contrary, it has negative implications at first until you ramp to a certain level or you expense certain expenses and only then it goes up? Thank you.","Derek Aberle","On your first question, there are couple of things. Really the primary positive driver would be OEM mix. So share gain by companies that are paying a higher running royalty rate than others and we think there is some potential for that as the year progresses.","Cristiano Amon","On the 820, I think as we said is the volume ramp is going to be in the second half of the year, that's where we go into mass production. But I think we feel pretty good about the 820 and the overall economics. I also think we're on, as we said, on a 14 LPP process node. Another thing to think about [indiscernible] the second half is, we're seeing increased design traction across all tiers, not only the 820, in particular in China because of the acceleration of LTE Advanced which is 4G plus and the all mode that was mentioned by Derek earlier.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.","Stacy Rasgon","I have two, first on the chipset guide, I know you're pointing to a seasonal effect, obviously driven by -- exasperated by thin modems. At the same time, it's a 24% quarter-over quarter decline, 57 million units. I think this is your biggest sequential chipset decline ever. Can you give us or at least help us parse out the impact of the seasonal effect? Is there any inventory flushing going on? Do you think this is a normal run rate exiting the quarter? How should we be thinking about those other seasonal drivers impacting that guide? And for my second question, you have this $100 million license amortization rolling off. Do you have any other licensees with amortization that's rolling off, say within the next three years?","George Davis","Let me just respond to the chipset guide question. So I would say it, we're certainly seeing above normal seasonality in this quarter, in particular on the thin modem side. We have also seen some OEM mix in China having an effect. But I would say that is a deep third effect to what is a seasonal first, above seasonal in modem and then some modest OEM mix where customers of ours are ceding some share to customers that use other devices.","Derek Aberle","On the amortization question, we have over the years done different kinds of deals, some of which have license fees that are amortized over a period of time. And so there are things that come into the amortization and go out. That's just an ongoing basis, but beyond that, you saw an acceleration of $250 million of license fees that would've been amortized over a longer period of time that will come in next quarter. And those are really the two that we're highlighting this time.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Tavis McCourt","George, just to make sure I have -- the $250 million coming in, that is coming in through QTL, correct? And then, I think you mentioned in the prepared comments outside of the thin modem customer, I forget if the verbiage was you're seeing some strength or least stability in emerging markets in your chipset business. That is not completely obvious to me why that should be typically in a strong dollar environment, handset sales can really get hurt in emerging market. So I'm wondering if you're just not seeing that yet? Or is there some channel inventory issues going on? Or perhaps some market share gains as we exited last year and enter this year. And then a final one for you, Steve, on the TDK joint venture. You mentioned gas PAs and wasn't sure if you were referring to having them sampling in FY '17? Or we should see those in commercial products in FY '17? Thank you.","George Davis","So on the $250 million, that will be reported in QTL. In terms of what we're seeing in the channel, I would say we're not seeing an unusual inventory build like we saw a couple of quarters ago, with the exception, like I said, we're probably seeing a stronger-than-normal seasonal pullback in thin modems. But that's really what I would say is more of the outlier for our quarter.","Cristiano Amon","Just to add a comment, I think when you look at the Q2 $185 million midpoint of the guidance, I think what we said is the China was a very minor impact. It's not any unexpected design change. What it is the mix of OEMs in the marketplace. We saw a slight increase of volume for an OEM that is not used in QCT as a vertical OEM in China, but I think it's very minor. The main thing really is seasonality and the thin modem demand adjustment.","Steve Mollenkopf","This is Steve, just one other additional thing. Really what's driving worldwide unit demand for the products is just the transition to 4G. So you're still only seeing what something like 14% of the market is using 4G now and that continues to be a positive trend for us across tiers. With respect to TDK, the TDK commentary and the gallium arsenide PAs, we will be in production in 2017 and I think comfortably so. So we expect to see products in the market using those PAs in that timeframe.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Srini Pajjuri with CLSA Securities, please go ahead.","Srini Pajjuri","A couple of questions, first a clarification, George, on the annual guidance for licensing, I'm just curious if LG is impacting only $100 million or is it $100 million per quarter? And then a follow-up to Steve's question or answer on the gas PA and TDK deal. Steve, obviously RF market in general has been growing very nicely over the past few years and some would argue that actually that market is slowing down now. It grew very nicely last two years ago and it is beginning to slow down now. I'm just curious as to why the deal now? What do you see out there that gives you that this is the right time to invest more aggressively in this market?","George Davis","So the LG impact that we talked about of over $100 million is a quarterly number, so the annual impact, of course, is going to be dependent on what their royalty obligation would be for the year, relative to the guidance range. It was not anticipated or included in the $7.3 billion to $8 billion range. So it would be an adjustment to that and it really will be a function of when it is resolved as to what the potential impact would be until then.","Steve Mollenkopf","On the RF front-end business, I think it continues to be a very large TAM that for us, we haven't been participating in outside really largely by our envelope tracking business. And like all of our RF businesses or analog businesses, they are actually, that's a good, profitable business. So our ability to grow that, even within that TAM is, I think a good story for us. Our view of the market is that you're going to need to have all the pieces, filter, module, PA, base fans, switches to really be meaningful as a long term player.","And that that capability will continue to be important, not only in the handset market, but also across all of the connectivity markets that open up as everything becomes connected and certainly in 5G. So we think that's a good set of assets. We will be able to grow that moving forward. We've got some execution to do to prove that. But we feel like we're getting the right pieces and we're going to make it happen.","Operator","Your final question comes from line of Edward Snyder with Charter Equity. Please go ahead.","Edward Snyder","On the same theme on the RF, I think you launched RF 360 in early 2013 and now you've got the TDK [ph] relationship which expands upon that. Should we expect revenue from RF material to consolidate results in FY '17? Or is that something more of a 2018 event? And then with respect to the RF products you're selling now, do you anticipate that you'll be selling these RF modules into solutions that don't use your base -- obviously your solutions that do use base benefits, you would be a natural home for those. But do you think you are intending to reach beyond where you are, your baseband sockets wins move out to general markets? And then a follow-up if I could on makeshift in QCT","George Davis","We will consolidate as soon as we close the transaction, because we will have 51% and effective control from a reporting standpoint. In terms of supporting other devices and other customers, we would anticipate continuing to do that just as TDK does today.","Edward Snyder","Would this show up in one of the existing segments once the consolidated [indiscernible] are you considering breaking it out on its own group?","George Davis","It will be reported in QCT.","Edward Snyder","Okay. And finally, was the mix shift away from thin modems in the December period, was that a major component in this sequential increase in QCT margins? Or was it not really material?","Cristiano Amon","I think George answered that earlier. I think one of the things where we're ahead of the plan of delivering some of the cost savings that we had a part of our strategic realignment plan. I think that has been a key contributor of our stronger margin in Q1.","Operator","This is our allotted time for questions and answers. Mr. Mollenkopf, do you have any further to add before adjourning the call?","Steve Mollenkopf","Sure, I just want to thank everyone for attending the call today. We're executing on the plan to get the Company growing again. We're focused on improving licensing in China. I look forward to the second half of the year as our new products ramp. I also want to remind everyone that we will hold our Analyst Day in San Diego in two weeks, where we will go into more detail on our strategy and priorities. I will close by thanking all of the Qualcomm employees on their hard work and for delivering a stronger-than-expected Q1. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"18570":["QUALCOMM, Inc.

Mollenkopf - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered strong results this quarter with better than expected earnings per share reflecting continued disciplined execution on the strategy we outlined last year. We had a very productive year. QCT delivered the improved operating margin target we set last year and QTL made additional progress on new license agreements in China.","Last week, we announced our agreement to acquire an NXP, an established global leader in industrial grade computing, security, sensors, RF, and networking. The proposed NXP acquisition accelerates our strategy in growth areas with complementary and world-class technology, products, customer relationships, and strong sales channels across automotive, IoT, security and networking.","Our strategy and disciplined execution has put us in an excellent position to maintain our leading position in mobile, and strengthen it into the next wave of growth. And we continue to invest in technology leadership just as we led each mobile technology transition from 2G to 3G, 3G to 4G LTE, we are leading the way to 5G. Further, 5G will be the communications fabric for our emerging hyper-connected world.","In our licensing business, we continue to execute well as we enable the industry to benefit from the tremendous opportunities around the world, including in China. We have now signed license agreements with nine of the top 10 largest Chinese OEMs according to calendar second quarter 2016 global IDC data. We expect to continue to sign additional licenses with Chinese OEMs and increase the level of compliance throughout fiscal 2017.","Looking ahead we are very excited about the future. We have spent the last 30 years interconnecting people. We will spend the next 30 years interconnecting their worlds by building on our mobile technology leadership in advanced computing, connectivity and communications systems. Our priority growth segments, IoT, automotive and networking, are being transformed by mobile technologies and our proposed acquisition of NXP and our 5G leadership further accelerates our positions in these segments.","As evidenced by our fiscal fourth quarter results, we continue to drive operational and financial discipline to execute on our strategy to create a competitive cost structure, and we continue to focus our investments in new growth areas. As we've executed this strategy to drive profitable growth, we've maintained our strong balance sheet and commitment to attractive capital returns, returning $6.9 billion to stockholders this fiscal year and $21 billion over the last two years. We believe we are on a path to build QUALCOMM into the semiconductor engine for the connected world.","Turning to our QCT business, we continue to invest to lead the industry. In the premium tier, the Snapdragon 820 is in more than 150 smartphone and tablet designs, including iconic devices such as the Samsung Galaxy 7 and 7 Edge, the Xiaomi Mi 5, and the LG G5, and this past quarter we announced the follow-on Snapdragon 821 that was recently launched in Google's Pixel.","In October, we hosted our annual 4G\/5G Summit in Hong Kong, where we announced new products in the high and mid-tier segments with the Snapdragon 653, Snapdragon 626, and Snapdragon 427, designed for enhanced experiences and improved connectivity. All three processors feature the X9 LTE modem capable of 300 megabits per second on the downlink and 150 megabits per second on the uplink.","We continue to extend our modem leadership across tiers and lead the industry to 5G. Our Snapdragon X12 LTE modem with features such as carrier aggregation, 4x4 MIMO, and 256-QAM modulation is capable of supporting 600 megabits per second on the downlink. Recently T-Mobile launched the first 4x4 MIMO technology service with the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge and has publicly talked about plans for implementing 256-QAM in the near future. SKT and Telstra have launched similar capabilities, and we expect to soon see other operators do the same.","In February, we announced our Snapdragon X16 modem, capable of gigabit class LTE speeds, and we recently announced the world's first gigabit class LTE mobile device and gigabit-ready network in collaboration with Telstra, Ericsson and NETGEAR. This modem also includes support for LAA, the global standard for deploying LTE in unlicensed spectrum. The FCC recently began issuing equipment authorizations for LAA, and we received the first.","We also recently announced our first 5G modem, which will support early 5G trials and deployments. The Snapdragon X50 5G modem is designed to support peak download speeds of up to 5 gigabits per second and will initially support 28 gigahertz millimeter wave spectrum. The first 5G commercial products that will integrate the Snapdragon X55G modem are expected to be available during the first half of 2018.","In addition, QUALCOMM is accelerating the path to 5GNR, the global 5G standard for a 5G new radio standardized by 3GPP. 5GNR is expected to not only enhance mobile broadband services but also enable conductivity and management for the Internet of Things and new types of mission-critical services.","In January we announced our planned joint venture with TDK to enable delivery of RF front-end modules and RF filters into fully integrated systems for mobile devices and IoT. The joint venture will draw upon TDK's capabilities in micro-acoustic RF filtering, packaging and module integration technologies and our expertise in advanced wireless technologies to serve customers with leading-edge RF solutions into fully integrated systems.","In our adjacent businesses, fiscal 2016 revenues were up more than 40% year-over-year driven by growth in auto, networking and the addition of the CSR business. For IoT, we are leveraging our leadership in both connectivity and computing to deliver platforms to help accelerate adoption across multiple device types. We now offer over 25 platforms that help manufacturers quickly and cost-effectively deliver IoT products including the Snapdragon VR 820 virtual reality reference platform, and a suite of connected camera solutions.","Smartwatches using Snapdragon Wear processors continue to be launched or announced, and drones using our Snapdragon flight platform are already commercially available in the U.S. and China ahead of the holiday season.","There is also an increasing trend to use LTE connectivity for IoT. Building off the 100 plus designs we announced in June using the MDM 9x07 modems, we have recent traction among many ecosystem players where the MDM9206 category MB1 modems featuring a purpose-built design for IoT, with lower power consumption and longer-range connectivity than previous LTE generations. We are broadening distribution of Snapdragon processors with two announced parts, the 410E and 600E, available globally by third-party distributors.","In automotive, we expanded our design win momentum with global automakers across telematics, connectivity, and infotainment. We maintain our position as the leading supplier of modems for telematics, benefiting from increased cellular attach rates in cars and the transition to 4G LTE vehicle solutions. And with the pending addition of the NXP business, we will have the breadth of technology and products to capture even more of the opportunity in these rapidly growing adjacent areas.","To summarize, fiscal 2016 has been a very productive year for QUALCOMM. Our strong results this quarter reflect the progress on our strategy and disciplined execution for technology leadership in mobile and new growth areas. We are excited about the future as we continue to build QUALCOMM as the semiconductor engine for the connected world. I would now like to turn the call over to Derek.","Derek K. Aberle - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone. As Steve noted, QTL had a strong fiscal fourth quarter. Revenues were $1.9 billion, and total reported device sales were $74.2 billion, driven primarily by the conclusion of key license agreements in China as well as stronger than expected 3G\/4G device ASPs. QTL revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter was higher than our prior guidance based on the timing of concluding a key new license agreement in China.","Total reported device sales in the fiscal fourth quarter were also above our prior guidance with reported 3G\/4G device shipments at a record 403 million units and ASPs at $184. QTL continues to make good progress in China, both in terms of signing new license agreements and collecting catch-up amounts for prior period sales.","In our fiscal fourth quarter, we completed new agreements with both vivo and OPPO and recorded catch-up revenues related to prior quarter sales, including a significant amount for prior period 3-mode sales. The externally implied royalty rate in the fiscal fourth quarter was approximately 2.5%, reflecting the impact of the catch-up amounts in the quarter, which included significant royalties from 3-mode device shipments and other device shipments in China.","In fiscal 2016, QTL revenues were $7.66 billion, with total reported device sales of $267.4 billion, reflecting continued handset growth, particularly at Chinese OEMs, and catch-up amounts for prior period sales. The externally implied royalty rate for fiscal 2016 was approximately 2.9%, as expected.","Excluding catch-up amounts related to sales prior to fiscal 2016, the multi-year amortization from the agreement that expired after the first quarter of fiscal 2016, as well as the acceleration of the license fees for the terminated infrastructure agreement we previously disclosed, we estimate that fiscal year 2016 QTL revenues would have been approximately $7.2 billion. We estimate that we collected royalties on approximately 73% of both 3-mode and non 3-mode Chinese OEM global device sales in fiscal 2016.","As discussed last quarter, we initiated litigation against Meizu in order to protect our rights, and equally importantly, to prevent Meizu from continuing to compete unfairly against our other licensees that are respectful of intellectual property rights and have entered into license agreements with QUALCOMM, consistent with resolution we reached with the NDRC. In June, we filed complaints against Meizu in the intellectual property courts in both Beijing and Shanghai, China, and last month we filed a complaint with the United States ITC, a patent infringement action in Germany and an infringement seizure action in France.","Regarding the Korea Fair Trade Commission investigation of our licensing practices, we have submitted an extensive response to the case team's report and are currently in the hearing phase with the commissioners. We have been providing further responses to the case team's report.","Turning to our expectations for global 3G\/4G device shipments, in calendar 2016 we estimate 1.625 billion to 1.725 billion devices will be shipped, consistent with our prior forecast, with year-over-year unit growth of approximately 8% at the midpoint. We continue to see a strong 4G ramp in China as each of the operators pursues aggressive subscriber growth targets with their 4G plus service offerings, and design momentum continues to drive an increasing percentage of all mode devices across China.","We estimate that the global ASP for handsets shipped during our fiscal 2016 was approximately $185, reflecting an annual decline of approximately 6%, which is in line with our prior forecast. As we expected, the year-over-year handset ASP erosion moderated significantly in fiscal 2016 to approximately half of the rate we experienced during fiscal 2015.","Looking ahead to calendar 2017, we expect continued year-over-year 3G\/4G device shipment growth. We estimate 1.75 billion to 1.85 billion devices will be shipped during calendar 2017, with year-over-year unit growth of approximately 7% at the midpoint. We forecast healthy 3G\/4G handset shipment growth to continue in calendar 2017, driven primarily by emerging regions, particularly in India.","We expect that the annual erosion in the ASP for handsets shipped during fiscal 2017 will further moderate as compared to fiscal 2016, driving mid single digit year-over-year global handset sales growth.","We expect strong growth in 3G\/4G connected IoT device shipments in calendar 2017, driven by the increasing demands of industrial and commercial applications within the smart cities, connected home, wearables and consumer electronic segments. Additionally, several of the world's largest cellular providers are expected to launch commercial operations of scalable narrowband LTE platforms in the coming year.","To summarize, we are pleased with the progress we are making in China and continue to see favorable trends for global 3G\/4G device sales. We're focused on concluding additional licensing agreements and improving compliance in fiscal 2017.","That concludes my comments, and I will now turn the call over to George.","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon everyone. I will begin with comments on our fiscal fourth quarter and 2016 results, followed by our first fiscal quarter of 2017 guidance and some perspective on 2017 overall.","In our fiscal fourth quarter, we delivered revenues of $6.2 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.28. Our performance was strong in both QTL and QCT relative to expectations. The incremental EPS results that were above the high end of our guidance range were largely driven by the new license agreements and related catch-up payments Derek described along with stronger-than-expected performance in our investment portfolio.","In QTL, in addition to the new licenses and related catch-up, stronger-than-expected 3G\/4G device ASPs also contributed to the above expectation TRDS results.","QCT had revenues of $4.1 billion, reflecting MSM shipments modestly above the midpoint of expectations, driven by higher demand in thin modems and from OEMs in China. Revenue per MSM was modestly higher sequentially, primarily due to growth in adjacent businesses.","Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses were down 3% sequentially, as expected, on cost controls and spending reductions under our strategic realignment plan.","During the fiscal fourth quarter, we returned $1 billion to stockholders including approximately $780 million of dividends paid and $225 million in share repurchases. For the full year in 2016, we returned just over 100% of free cash flow to our stockholders on share repurchases of $3.9 billion and dividends of $3 billion.","Our goals for fiscal 2016 were designed to improve our cost structure while repositioning the company to capture the next phase of growth. We set three primary guidance points for 2016 as a result. First, we committed to making significant progress on signing new licenses under the approved terms in China, and provided a revenue target range of $7.3 billion to $8 billion for QTL. We executed well on that plan by signing key license agreements with leading Chinese OEMs and delivered approximately $7.66 billion in revenue in the year.","Second, we set an ambitious $1.4 billion spending reduction program which was comprised of $1.1 billion in savings and operating expenses, and engineering costs and COGS, and a $300 million reduction in the annual grant of share-based compensation. The program was fully realized by the end of fiscal 2016. A comparison of the program reductions against the SRP baseline is found on our website and our quarterly investor deck.","Finally, we targeted to exit fiscal 2016 with a minimum of 16% or better operating margin in QCT for the fourth quarter, which was met as we reported 16.6% in that quarter.","Let's now turn to our financial outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We estimate fiscal fourth quarter revenues to be in the range of approximately $5.7 billion to $6.5 billion, down approximately 1% sequentially at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $1.12 to $1.22 per share, down 9% sequentially at the midpoint. We anticipate fiscal first quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses to be approximately flat sequentially.","In QTL, we expect total reported device sales of approximately $58 billion to $66 billion in the first quarter, down approximately 16% sequentially at the midpoint, primarily as a result of the timing of signing new license agreements and related catch-up payments recorded in the fiscal 2016 fourth quarter.","In QCT, we expect approximately 205 million to 225 million MSM chip shipments for the fiscal first quarter, up 2% sequentially and reflecting seasonally strong demand, primarily from OEMs in China across a broad range of products. Share loss at a large thin modem customer is expected to moderate the normally strong seasonal MSM shipment trend in the December quarter.","We expect QCTs operating margin percentage to be within approximately 100 basis points of the fourth fiscal quarter. Both of our businesses are seeing a modest impact in their outlook for the quarter as a result of a major customer's product launch challenges.","Turning to 2017, we are providing selective guidance points for the year. We're estimating mid single digit percentage growth for global 3G\/4G handset sales for fiscal 2017, and 7% growth at the midpoint in calendar year 2017 3G\/4G global device shipments, as Derek described. Consistent with last fiscal year and aligned with our semiconductor and large-cap tech peers, we are not providing fiscal year revenue or earnings per share guidance.","We estimate our non-GAAP fiscal 2017 tax rate to be approximately 18%. As we discussed last week when we announce the proposed acquisition of NXP, we are modifying our capital return program ahead of the expected close of the transaction later in calendar 2017. However, we remain firmly committed to our current dividend program and to continuing to grow our dividend in the future.","We are also committed to share repurchases at a level that at least offsets dilution. Depending on the level of stock option exercises by our employees, we could return close to 75% of free cash flow to shareholders during fiscal 2017 as our outstanding stock options have approximately two years on average remaining on their lives.","We expect to delever quickly after the NXP transaction is closed, providing a strong foundation for future capital returns and enabling us to approach our pre-transaction leverage ratios within two years of transaction close.","That concludes my comments, I will now turn the call back to John.","John T. Sinnott - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Thank you, George. Operator, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Thank you. I guess I'll focus the question on the QCT segment with a nice increase in the revenue per MSM. Is this just mainly just stepping up a higher mix within the Chinese smartphone market? And then can you help us model into Q1 2017 given the Samsung Note recall and the better mix of the iPhone, how should we think about revenue per MSM on a sequential basis? Thank you.","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Hey, Mike. It's George. I'll take this and then maybe Cristiano will want to jump in. So if you look at Q4, I would say you saw some benefit from mix for sure. I would also add that you saw the impact of the adjacent businesses, which had a strong quarter both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Going into Q1, it's definitely the fact that you're seeing real strength in the high and mid-tier that's helping offset what might be some of the other impacts that we're seeing in the quarter. And also you're seeing some lower low tier, which helps the overall picture there.","Cristiano R. Amon - QUALCOMM, Inc.","And Mike, this is Cristiano Amon. Just an added comment, while we don't provide I think guidance for the year, I think within 2017 we expect to see the introduction of our new premium tier Snapdragon at 10 nanometer, the flagship. We also expect to continue to have growth in adjacent business, and that's going to have a positive impact and offset some seasonality we saw with OEM mix.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. I also wanted ask a couple of questions related to QCT. Steve, you talked about the performance advantages of your modems, but yet in the last couple of years, we've seen a couple of the highest profile phones opt at least in some regions to use modems that were somewhat inferior in performance. Can you talk a bit about what you can do encourage and make sure that at least the best phones are using the best modems and really playing to your advantage?","And then my second question is that, George, you talked a little bit about or your expectation that QCT margin should be within about 100 bps of what you put up for the September quarter in the December quarter. But how should we think about QCT margins on the more medium to long-term basis? Are we kind of at a new low or is this a new baseline? Or should we expect some volatility both up and down from current levels? Thanks.","Steven M. Mollenkopf - QUALCOMM, Inc.","James, this is Steve. I'll handle that, the first piece of it. I think it also depends on where you're looking the world. If you look in China, for example, I think the migration to uplink carrier aggregation in the 4G plus has really been helping the business actually. So I think that's an area where feature leadership in the modem has certainly been able to be highly correlated actually with success. But you're right. In some areas we have seen people either de-feature or go with a less advanced modem. Now the way we think about that is that the networks themselves are moving, and that's not a sustainable long-term position to be in.","When we look at tear downs are or we look at comparisons between competitors' parts, the tear downs are very consistent with our view in terms of modem leadership. We are getting feedback from operators that they do want to upgrade their modems, and actually that includes their end market devices. The pressure to go to gigabit-class modems as well as 5G we think set up a good environment for us. But we do like the position of having modem leadership in the future, and we think we are going to be able to maintain that. We did, as you know, have to make some changes to our cost structure to make sure that we can sustain an environment where maybe that isn't always the case at any particular moment, but we still think that's strong strategic ground to hold.","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","James, hi. It's George. On QCT margins, as we said, we expect to be within the 100 basis points of where we finished the year. And I think that's at a time, too, when we're dealing with the impact of the share loss at the modem customer. So I think that's a positive sign. It shows a couple things, one, the strength of our position in China and how that's been impacting us overall, the strength of the product portfolio coming out in the second half of the year of 2016.","In terms of looking forward, clearly we'll be up year-over-year in our expectations. We haven't guided what we think that will be for margin, but there's still going to be seasonality. Obviously there is usually a big movement seasonally between our Q1 and Q2 for QCT and then strengthen the second half of the year. I don't know, Cristiano, was there anything else you wanted to add?","Cristiano R. Amon - QUALCOMM, Inc.","No, I just wanted to add that when we look for 2017, we feel comfortable right now with the product roadmap and traction across our broad customer base. I think China definitely want to highlight. I think we expect to repeat in 2017 the success we had in China in 2016. And we're going to be upgrading all tiers across thin modems, the premium tier MSM and the mid-tier MSM while we maintain the operating discipline implemented during strategic realignment plan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. I wanted to shift the focus to QTL. I think last quarter you had suggested about $400 million in catch-up royalties that you had expected, which was basically the delta between the $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion in your full year revenue guidance for QTL. And it looks like you recognized about half of that in Q4. So is it fair to assume that there's another $200 million of catch-ups left? Or is that amount larger? And by when do you expect to collect all of the catch-up payments?","Derek K. Aberle - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Simona, this is Derek. Actually what we said was last quarter in Q3 we had about \u2013 we had north of $400 million in out-of-period revenue in QTL. Part of that was from the resolution of our dispute with LG, and the other chunk of it, about $200 million-ish was from licensees that we were still negotiating with began reporting some of the royalties even ahead of signing agreements. That was all in Q3, and it was reflected in the $7.4 billion to $7.8 billion annual fiscal year guidance.","When you fast-forward into Q4, we've got some additional catch-up payments, as I noted in my remarks, north of $200 million additional coming in in Q4, which gets us to \u2013 and if you might recall from last time, we guided some additional progress with license negotiations in Q4, but not all of it. And we kind of over-delivered on that in terms of concluding additional deals which brought us above our Q4 guide, and right around the midpoint of the annual fiscal year guidance.","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","And I would just add, we had said going into the fourth quarter that there was more risk to meeting the midpoint of our guide because the market had been softer than we would have thought at the time when we came up with the $7.3 billion to the $8.0 billion, and so \u2013 but we felt we were making enough progress that we could make the guide that we did, and it turns out we made even more progress.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, hi guys. I kind of want to follow up on that last question. So your underlying royalty rate calculated, as I think Derek had called out, or one of you guys had called out, is 2.5%. And you're talking about a couple hundred million of catch-up payments. Can you give us any idea what the underlying royalty rate here was ex the catch-up payments? Are we talking about rates as we look forward that are similar to the average for the full year? Or are we talking about something else? Just to help us think about what the underlying rates look like here.","And then the other question I had for you is related to the overall market demand. It's kind of hard because there's so many moving parts in terms of your TRDS, et cetera. It's a little bit hard to understand what's happening with the end market. So I just wonder if you could help us understand what you've seen in this last quarter with respect to end market demand and how you think that's trending as we look into next year. Thanks.","Derek K. Aberle - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Hey, Rod, this is Derek. So as we pointed out at the outset of the year, this year and probably even going forward into fiscal 2017, the externally implied rate is going to fluctuate quite a bit quarter-over-quarter. If you look back in Q3, we were north of 3.2%. Then this quarter it swings down to 2.5%. Really the main driver in this quarter was the amount of catch-up that came in within the quarter, both \u2013 all of it really coming from Chinese OEMs, a combination of folks reporting under the NDRC terms, but also a significant portion of that under the lower rates that apply to 3-mode.","So we think that's largely sort of a historical thing. If you look at the projections for 3-mode in China, they are expected to be below 30% of the volume at China Mobile by the end of 2016, end of calendar 2016. So we think this is just going to be kind of the fluctuation that we pointed out would happen as we signed agreements and brought in catch-up. For the year, we came pretty close to the 2.9% longer-term kind of normalized rate we talked about in February at the Analyst Day. I expect we're going to see some continued fluctuations through 2017, but structurally and in terms of how we see the future unfolding, I think you can sort of think of that normalized 2.9% as a good longer-term metric. And we do expect next quarter will be up, because even if we conclude some additional deals that we're making progress on, the amount of the prior period catch-up will likely be smaller.","And then on the end market, really, let me try to unpack it a couple of different ways. We're continuing to see good growth in units, so we're holding our guide for calendar 2016, which is about 8% year-over-year growth, and we put out a guide now for 2017, which is 7% year-over-year growth. And then the story that we really highlighted maybe three years ago is playing out very, very accurately to what we expected. The ASPs have continued to moderate in terms of erosion, and 2016 came in about where we called it at the beginning of the year, around 6% year-over-year erosion, and we expect that to further moderate into fiscal 2017.","So one of the guideposts we set out in my remarks is if you look at the unit growth and the expected ASP erosion, we think the handset piece of the market in fiscal 2017 will grow about mid single digit. And then of course on top of that, you have the non-handset piece as well as some continued improvement that we expect to drive in compliance, which means we expect to grow the business, the QTL business, at or above the handset growth in the market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. Derek, just a quick clarification and the question. On the catch-ups, I'm assuming you're saying that vivo and OPPO are things that have past. Those catch-ups are done, and anything next year in the future will be from new deals.","And then I just wanted to talk about that 5% to 11% for this year. Thanks for the color on the 2017 number. But IDC and others, IDC I think just lowered their number for smartphones from 3% to 1.5% for the year. So to get to this 5% to 11% range, could you help us out a little bit? Is it more of the non-handset stuff? And in there that's driving it higher, do you think there's some misunderstanding about China? And related to that, the QTL long-term goal of $10 billion I think by fiscal 2020, it sounded like normalized was about $7.2 billion. So maybe just walk us through the unit ASP or new markets that would get us to that longer-term number. Thank you.","Derek K. Aberle - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Tim, this is Derek. Yeah, the catch-up that came in over the last two quarters related to the signing of new deals. That's basically largely baked and behind us. We have signed nine of the top 10 Chinese OEMs now, so great progress throughout the year. We do have another one that we're continuing to negotiate with and continuing to make progress, as well as we've noted the litigation against Meizu, which we are hopeful will drive to an agreement at some point. So there will be some continued fluctuation in the revenue in QTL based on catch-up, both on combination of new deals as well as driving compliance resolutions. But the ones that we've talked about from the announced deals are I think basically behind us.","In terms of the market, I think if you look at the way the market has developed throughout the year, a number of industry analysts have been more pessimistic on handset growth than we were at the outset. But at least so far, I would say the market's trending more in line with our view than what they set out. China continues to be strong, and we saw another good quarter in the September quarter of 4G adds, and going forward we're expecting some pretty meaningful growth in 2017 coming from India and Southeast Asia, Middle East. So there's definitely big markets where we see the opportunity for a lot of continued growth.","On top of that, we do see a lot of good trends with operators focusing more attention on things like narrowband LTE and more of the industrial, and in addition to consumer launches of IoT devices. So that will be a growth opportunity as well, but the handset, underlying handset growth that we called for 2017 mid single digit I think is something we feel very comfortable with.","We're not going to update the sort of the $10 billion call that we gave in February, but guess what I can say there is in terms of the new agreements that we've signed, and the way that the market is playing out since February, there's nothing really that would change the long-term view for the business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Yes, thank you. Just could you help us understand what's driving the moderation of ASPs in 2017, Derek? You mentioned a higher mix of emerging markets. And I would just think India, Southeast Asia would put more downward pressure on ASP. So if you could talk about that. And then the timing of the NXPI deal closer for late 2017 seems conservative when you consider just the complementary nature of the asset. And if we look at other deals in the space over the last year or two, they have been closing within eight to nine months. So I'm just wondering if there's potential for this deal to close earlier than what you guys communicated a week ago.","Derek K. Aberle - QUALCOMM, Inc.","This is Derek. So on the first question, I don't think, it's really nothing new. I mean, we've been talking about the trends that we expected to play out in the handset market, like I said, for the last few years. We expected to see some pretty accelerated erosion in ASPs for a couple of years and then start to moderate. But what we are seeing in the emerging markets, although most of the growth going forward is coming from the emerging markets, it's the same trends that we had talked about we're continuing to see play out.","The Chinese OEMs are continuing to kind of move up tier as they gain share. Cristiano mentioned some of that in response to an earlier question. That's really been a good story. A lot of growth in China and across the Chinese OEMs even outside of China, in the mid to high tier, that volume is not just coming in at the low tier. And part of that's being driven by the replacement rate story that we expected as people started to replace their phones and move up tier. We believe those trends are playing out and they'll continue to play out as we go through 2017. And interestingly, if you look at the reported ASP in the business for fiscal 2016, it was down less than the global. So even though we're pulling in some of the catch-up amounts from prior period, and some that stuff tended to be at the lower tiers, there has still been some good stability across the ASP picture.","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","And let me comment on \u2013 this is George \u2013 I'll comment on the NXP closing date. We totally agree with your comment that this is a highly complementary deal, and the industrial logic for customers is quite attractive. So we didn't pick an outside date because we thought there would be a lot of regulatory push back. It was just designed to recognize that at the outside it would be by the end of the calendar year, but it could certainly be well before that depending on the regulatory reviews.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. I guess I had two questions on QTL. First of all, Derek, I think you had said that the gap in terms of dollars between TDS and TRDS exiting fiscal 2016 would be less than 10%. Obviously that gap is coming down, but can you give us some milepost in terms of where that gap will be exiting fiscal 2017? Could it be only 5% for example?","Derek K. Aberle - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Tim, so we've given a couple of guideposts. One is that as we continue to negotiate and close what we call the key Chinese license agreements that were remaining, that if we could get those done, we believed we would be around 75% of their global sales that would be reported. We're not quite there yet. We've got a lot of good progress and certainly the largest player is done, but we're still in negotiations with one more of those. So as I'd mentioned in my remarks, we're kind of at the 73% mark now, and we need to make some more progress to get closer to the 75%. But I do think that we're on track to get there.","And then from there, we'll have to drive some additional signings and some compliance improvements to get that number up. The 75% that we last gave, it sort of aligned with around a little less than 10% global sales that would be unreported. And so we don't, I'm really not in a position today to guide where we end up in 2017 other than to say we've been making steady progress, and we've got a number of initiatives underway in addition to just negotiating closing new agreements to drive the compliance in a more favorable picture for us. And we're going be working hard on that throughout fiscal 2017 and hope to continue to narrow that gap.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I had one and then a follow-up to it. The first, I guess Derek's comments on OPPO and vivo, what appeared to be catch-up in Q3, your comments that you just made seem to suggest that wasn't catch-up. That was actually run rate revenue they decided to report while they were negotiating. So can clarify, is that in fact true? Were OPPO and vivo actually in the run rate of revenues in Q3, starting in Q3 and obviously going forward from now?","And then to that end, how do you guys, how to I get your QTL guidance for next quarter? At the midpoint, $62 billion, it's only up about 2% year-over-year, and a year ago you should have been having very serious collection issues in China, much better than you're having now, and yet you're only guiding it up 2% year-over-year. So I guess are those two issues related and can clarify both of those, please?","Derek K. Aberle - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Stacy, this is Derek. Yeah, so the catch-up situation is a bit complicated. I guess the best way I can lay it out for you is we got some catch-up in from the licensees that we closed on in Q4 into Q3 that were for prior-period sales, and they were not in the run rate in Q3. We closed the deals in Q4, which brought an additional catch-up for prior periods, but then also brought them into the run rate into Q4. So it's a blend of the two. Now George, if you want to take the next one.","George S. Davis - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Yeah. In terms of trying to then guide to how you get to the outlook for Q1, which I believe was your second question, was it's really just fundamentally the step down in TRDS quarter-over-quarter. So it's, otherwise it's a fairly strong guide, and if you blend the two quarters, I think you're right on top of it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Are you still on track for closing the joint venture arrangement with TDK as expected? Does it look like this will be a March 2017 event?","Cristiano R. Amon - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Hi. This is Cristiano. I think we are still on track. We see some of the regulatory approvals getting near completion, and we're on track to close this towards the end of the year, beginning of 2017.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research. Please go ahead.","Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research","Thanks a lot. You mentioned that some of the offset to your QCT business was because of share loss in thin modems, and you made comments on the premium that QUALCOMM has enjoyed and still enjoys among performance isn't as valued by some of your OEM customers as it has the past. Do you see that reverting back to the mean in any of the product roadmap in the next year or two that you're looking at? Because I know that a lot of these phones are white boarded three years in advance. It suggests that there will be an increase on a premium for performance at some of those OEMs. Or is this going to be the state of the industry for some time on both competitor solutions, say like Intel, but also in internal solutions? So I'd get a feeling for that.","And then in terms of Note 7, I know the cancellation, how much of an impact did that have on the quarter? And I know there's probably some forecast for that into the March period. Is it all in now? Or do you think you will have a little bit more out in the first calendar quarter of next year? Thanks.","Steven M. Mollenkopf - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Yeah. This is Steve. I'll take the first piece and maybe George can jump in on the end. What I meant to say earlier was I think there's maybe points in time where you can get away with not the leading quality or the leading edge feature set, but I don't think that's good strategic ground to hold. And our view of where our roadmap is going, the speed at which the industry is moving, meaning the networks that are in the operators \u2013 what their plans are to upgrade the networks, we feel very good about where our modem roadmap and modem business is going.","I gave a couple of data points about people launching some of the more advanced either MIMO or 256-QAM networks. We see that happening. We see things like license assisted access happening, particularly in the United States, being a positive thing. The upgrade to 802.11ax, and the interconnection or the simultaneous operation between that and cellular being a good thing. And then just the general pressure on OEMs from other OEMs to use, let's say things like gigabit-class modems, we think is creating a positive design win, good feedback from our customers in terms of how that sets up.","So the individual, how that relates to an individual model and such and timing of that I think is really a better question for the OEMs. But we like where the modem business is headed, particularly as 5G happens and things like narrowband IoT come into the networks as well. So I think that's where we are.","Quickly, maybe on the Note 7 and other devices, I think we did comprehend a little bit of impact from that in the forward guide. I think you should think of that as if there's kind of a momentary hole in the market and we have a view as to how that's going to fill in. It may fill in maybe not perhaps in the entire first quarter, but it will fill in and we feel like we're well positioned for almost any scenario that you can think of. I mean a lot of different OEMs could fill it in, including just a product transition within the OEM that we're talking about. So we feel like we're well positioned in any of those scenarios, and we did comprehend some impact of that in the first quarter guide.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Daniel Joseph Bartus - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys, this is Dan Bartus on for Tal. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to understand the QCT opportunities for next year a little bit more. When we look to next year, the growth is mainly coming from India. So wondering if you guys could discuss the strategy there and how can you differentiate in such a low ASP market? And then just separately, I was wondering if the share loss at that key thin modem customer was greater than you guys had originally baked into your QCT planning and margin assumptions. Thanks.","Cristiano R. Amon - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Hi, Dan, it's Cristiano. Maybe let me just start talking about the growth. I think one of the things we had said priorly, that we have been quite successful with our product line in China and we see a lot of the Chinese OEMs, and particularly the market in China, you see some of the larger OEMs in China consolidating the volume. And they look to export that into growth opportunities in emerging markets. That is actually a differentiating position of QCT. So I think the more that the Chinese customer base export outside China, I think actually help our position both within China as well as the growth opportunities.","Specifically to India, we're actually excited about it. There has been a very large-scale LTE launch with Reliance that is moving the market towards \u2013 from feature phone accelerated path towards smartphone with 4G and technology such as Voice-over-LTE. All of the concepts of all mode that has been successful in China can also be a driver in India. So I think that's how we feel good about basically ability to generate growth in those market as well. I think your second question, you want to take the second question?","Derek K. Aberle - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Sure, be happy to. So we had talked actually the previous quarter about the fact that we had contemplated the impact of second sourcing in our full year guidance in terms of where we thought QCT would come out on margin. And actually if you look back on the year, QCT not only exceeded the new margin target that we set, but they did it in a year where quite frankly the market itself was weaker, particularly in the thin modem area. And it required us to recapture an important slot in the premium tier, which they did, but also rolled out a series of products across the low, mid and high tiers where we saw much stronger traction in China than we expected going in. So I think overall, it's a very strong year and our planning assumptions with respect to the second sourcing were always a part of that.","Operator","Thank you. This ends our allotted time for questions and answers. Mr. Mollenkopf, do you have anything further to add before adjourning the call?","Steven M. Mollenkopf - QUALCOMM, Inc.","Thank you.

I'd also like to direct you to our 10-Q and earnings release, which were filed and furnished respectively with the SEC today and are available on our website.","During this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future business or results of the company. Actual events or results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q, which contain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","And now to comments from Qualcomm\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Steve Mollenkopf.","Steve Mollenkopf","Thank you, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone. We just completed a solid quarter with record performance in QTL, as the global adoption of our broad set of technologies drove all-time high 3G\/4G device shipments by our licensees. In addition, we had several major accomplishments, including the resolution of the NDRC investigation, our announcement of a $15 billion stock buyback authorization, and a 14% increase in the dividend.","We are pleased that the NDRC investigation has been concluded and believe that our licensing business is now better positioned to participate in China\u2019s broad adoption of 3G\/4G technology. The impact of the resolution and the recent agreement with a large licensee in China announced on the January call are starting to positively impact the QTL business. Derek will discuss this in more detail in a few moments.","While we are ahead of our expectations in the first half of the fiscal year, we are guiding the second half lower due to a number of factors in QCT. First, the extent of the impact of OEM concentration at the premium tier and the impact of share loss in the Galaxy S6 and Note.","Second, the altered launch plans of the OEMs in the premium tier with some OEMs delaying launches and then OEM rationalizing their portfolio by deemphasizing designs using our legacy parts. We are not seeing a change design share or the competitive environment, but rather a change in timing of some 810 designs.","And finally, QCT continues to face competitive pressures in China. The China contribution to earnings is roughly flat to the previous outlook with more strength at the premium tier offsetting some expected share loss in the low tier in the fourth quarter. As I will explain later, we expect this near-term trend to improve as we launch new parts and China enters modem transition later in this calendar year.","Based on our current customer engagements and our future product roadmap, we do not believe these product cycle issues reflect the long-term change in QCT\u2019s competitive positioning. However, we do believe the impact of the current product cycle will extend into next fiscal year.","Clearly, we are not pleased with our reduced outlook. Accordingly, we have initiated a comprehensive review of our cost structure in QCT and throughout the company. The goals of this review are to align our cost structure with the changing marketplace and improve efficiency. We have begun a comprehensive assessment of costs and opportunities for greater efficiency company-wide with the help of an outside expert and will be reporting on those initiatives on the Q3 earnings call.","With respect to the roadmap, we remain confident that our differentiated Snapdragon processor and modem leadership positions us well across multiple price tiers and customer segments entering the next product cycle. In the premium tier, we are very pleased with the design traction on the Snapdragon 810 with over 60 designs having won the key premium design slots with the exception of Samsung.","Since our last earnings call, LG has begun shipping the innovative G Flex2, Sony has announced the incredibly thin Xperia Z4 phone and tablet, and Xiaomi has announced the Mi Note 4 with category 9 carrier aggregation. Recently teardowns and press reports correctly highlight the advantages delivered by our integrated approach.","We are also encouraged by the customer interest in our new Snapdragon 820, which is on track to ship in the second half of this calendar year and is built on the latest FinFET node. The Snapdragon 820 represents a new design point for our SoC architecture and will be the first to include our new custom 64-bit CPU microarchitecture.","Since our last call and in response to the competitive environment in China, we have also enhanced the Snapdragon 615, which will be commercial this year. In addition, we expect a modem transition in China later this year and we are seeing signals to the OEMs from the operators consistent with this view. Our Snapdragon 425 with industry leading uplink carrier aggregation and a new low-cost RF front-end is well positioned for this opportunity and is on track to be in devices later this calendar year, well ahead of our competition.","Turning to the longer-term outlook, the smartphone opportunity remains a strong positive for Qualcomm and we forecast continued healthy global demand in the near-term and over the next several years. IDC estimates that over 8.5 billion smartphones will be sold from 2015 through 2019. We also continue to gain traction in adjacent areas where our mobile technologies and capabilities can deliver next generation solutions. Areas such as automotive, the Internet of Things, mobile computing, and networking, these areas are expected to represent large new opportunities for Qualcomm with over 5 billion new non-phone connected device shipments expected in calendar year 2018.","Further, shipments in these areas are contributing over 10% of QCT\u2019s fiscal year 2015 estimated revenue. In automotive, for instance, we have over 40 connected car programs with 15 plus OEMs and we recently announced two new modems, the Snapdragon X12 and X12 that augment our portfolio to support connectivity across all tiers of the automotive industry.","Our scale and position in mobile makes us well positioned to capitalize on these opportunities. In summary, we are well positioned to address the significant opportunities ahead given the strength in our core businesses and traction in new growth opportunities. We are focused on completing our implementation of the rectification plan in China, concluding new license agreements in China and improving compliance. We\u2019re also investing in the future generations of the modem and connectivity, including 4G enhancements such as LTE-U and 5G, as well as future evolutions of Wi-Fi and the convergence of Wi-Fi and Cellular. We are confident in our QCT roadmap for the reasons I just explained, but intend to take a comprehensive look at our cost structure in-light of the changing industry dynamics and structure.","I would now like to turn the call over to Qualcomm\u2019s President Derek Aberle.","Derek Aberle ","Thank you Steve and good afternoon everyone. As Steve noted, we delivered a solid quarter achieving record non-GAAP operating income. QCT operating performance was in-line with expectations as favourable operating expense offset slightly weaker mix. QTL performance was ahead of expectations with revenues, earnings before tax, and total reported device sales all setting records driven by strong 3G, 4G device shipments, improved compliance in China and a catch up amount for prior period sales from the licensee with which we recently resolved the dispute.","Fiscal Q2 revenue for QTL was up approximately 17% year-over-year even without this catch up amount and in the face of foreign exchange headwinds, QTL would have delivered a record quarter across these same metrics. As you are aware, we recently announced a resolution with China's National Development and Reform Commission regarding the investigation of us under the China antimonopoly law. As part of this resolution, we agreed to implement a rectification plan that modifies certain of our business practices with respect to the licensing of our 3G and 4G essential Chinese patterns for branded devices sold for use in China.","Since that time we have been implementing the plan and offered the revised license terms for our current 3G and 4G essential Chinese patterns to both our current licensees and to a number of unlicensed OEMs and manufacturers. Following the offers we have met with a large number of licensees both in and outside of China to discuss the revised terms. Although we are still relatively early in the process, we are making good progress to date as over 35 licensees have accepted the revised terms so far, including with respect to 3-mode devices sold in China.","The rate at which licensees are accepting the new terms and signing new license agreements has been accelerating throughout the process. We now have 125 licensees in total with licences covering 3-mode devices with more than 85 in China, including Huawei and ZTE. We are making progress on the underreporting issues in China as well. We estimate that approximately 200 million units were sold during calendar 2014, but not reported to us by our licensees in line with our prior guidance.","To put this in greater context, we have also increased our estimates for the calendar 2014 global 3G 4G market by approximately 20 million units versus our prior guidance and now believe that a larger percentage of the units shipped in 2014 where 3-mode devices where we had a low collection rate during the year. In other words, the percentage of calendar 2014 units that were reported to us came in higher than previously expected. As we continue to implement our compliance and audit plans, as well as conclude new 3-mode license agreements we believe that this collection percentage will continue to increase and we are seeing early evidence of that in the March quarter sales. ","While we are making good progress we do expect this process to extend beyond this fiscal year. It is also possible that in some cases it may require litigation and\/or actions to compel certain licensees to honour the contracts and for unlicensed companies to execute new licences. We are prepared to pursue that path if it becomes necessary. We are raising our fiscal year outlook for QTL based on favourable total reported device sales in the second fiscal quarter, in addition to higher forecasted total reported device sales for the second half of the fiscal year. Total reported device sales for the second fiscal quarter came in above the high-end of our guidance range, a portion of which was driven by higher than expected catch up amounts.","Our outlook for the second half of the fiscal year reflects updated favourable reported device sales trend, improved compliance in China, and expected continued progress on concluding license agreements in China, offset by foreign exchange headwinds. We now expect QTL revenues to grow approximately 8% at the midpoint year-over-year. This includes the favourable effect of some catch up payments for prior sales offset by the negative effect of foreign exchange, without including these two effects we estimate that QTL revenues would grow by more than 8% in fiscal 2015, as we believe the negative foreign exchange impact is larger than the catch up benefit.","Turning to our view of global 3G, 4G device demand we continue to see very healthy growth and have increased our calendar 2014 global 3G, 4G device shipment estimate to approximately 1.37 billion units, up approximately 27% year-over-year. As a reminder, this includes those devices we expect to be reported to us, as well as our estimates of unreported and unlicensed device sales, but excludes TD-SCDMA devices that do not implement LTE.","We saw strength in both developed and emerging regions during 2014 and finished the year with favourable replacement rate trends in developed regions, as well as LTE volume strength, particularly in China. We expect these growth trends to continue throughout calendar 2015. We now expect global 3G, 4G device shipments to be 1.25 billion units to 1.6 billion units in calendar 2015, up approximately 11% to 17% with our buyers continuing to be towards the high end of that range.","It\u2019s worth noting that we are still in the very early days of LTE adoption. According to GSMA intelligence only 8% of global connections are LTE. In February, China granted nationwide FTD-LTE licenses to both China Telecom and China Unicom, each of the Chinese operators has announced significant investments in LTE network build-outs and has set aggressive targets for subscriber additions this year. For calendar year 2014, we are increasing our estimate of reported 3G, 4G devices to between 1.17 4 billion units and 1.19 billion units.","Turning to estimated 3G, 4G device ASPs, the ASP of devices reported to QTL during the second quarter of fiscal 2015 was approximately $196 at the mid-point. Absent the effect of prior period catch up units the reported ASP would have been approximately $211 at the mid-point up $14 sequentially, driven by stronger ASPs in both emerging and developed regions, reflecting a favourable mix of higher tier handsets.","We are now forecasting global 3G, 4G device DSPs to the decline approximately 11% to 12% year-over-year in fiscal 2015, an improvement to our previous estimate of 12% to 13%, despite an increase in negative foreign exchange effects. The improvement is primarily due to a favourable mix of higher tier handsets and stronger pricing in the low to mid-tiers of LTE devices in China. We now expect global 3G, 4G total device sales in fiscal 2015 to be up approximately 8% to 11% over fiscal 2014, despite foreign exchange headwinds, driven by both stronger units and ASP, particularly in emerging regions.","Turning to the regulatory issues, we have been notified that the Korean fair trade commission is conducting a new investigation of the company. We believe this new investigation relates primarily to our licensing business and we are cooperating with the agency. To conclude, QTL is making good progress on our efforts in China, while experiencing strength in underlying demand where we continue to see strong global 3G, 4G device sales and stronger global ASP trends.","That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to George Davis.","George Davis ","Thank you Derek and good afternoon everyone. Fiscal second-quarter revenues were $6.9 billion, up 8% year-over-year and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.40, up 7% year-over-year at the high end of for prior guidance range. In QCT, MSM shipments were $233 million in-line with expectation with revenue of $4.4 billion. Implied revenue for MSM was approximately $19, down slightly quarter-over-quarter, reflecting a lower mix of premium tier shipments than previously expected. ","QCT operating margin was 17% in-line with our prior expectations. In QTL, total reported device sales for our licensees were a record $75.8 billion, up 14% year-over-year and at the high end of our guidance range, including the impact of our higher than expected catch up report. Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses increased 2% sequentially, driven primarily by seasonal increases in payroll taxes.","We continue our aggressive capital return program, returning approximately $2.6 billion to stockholders in the quarter, including $689 million of dividends paid and $1.9 billion in stock repurchases.","And as you will recall, in March we announced a major increase in our capital return program, including an increase in our stock repurchase authorization to $15 billion and our plans for a $10 billion buyback in the next 12 months, which is incremental to our ongoing return of a minimum of 75% of free cash flow.","Fiscal second quarter cash flow from operations was negative at approximately $650 million this quarter reflecting a long-term capacity prepayment of approximately $950 million made by QCT as part of our supply chain cost reduction initiatives and the payment of the approximately $975 million NDRC fine.","We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $29.6 billion. Our non-GAAP tax rate during the quarter was 20% above expectations due to business mix. We now expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 19% for fiscal 2015.","Looking ahead, as we already indicated, we are reducing our financial forecast for fiscal 2015 primarily due to lower excepted and profitability in the premium tier for the QCT business. We now estimate fiscal 2015 revenues overall to be in the range of approximately $25 billion to $27 billion, down approximately 2% year-over-year at the midpoint. The increased impact of the product cycle issues in QCT is affecting our revenue and margin outlook for the chip business. We now expect QCT revenue for the fiscal year to be down approximately 6% year-over-year with operating margin for fiscal 2015 between 14% and 17%.","We expect combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to be up 1% to 3% year-over-year. This represents a reduction of 2% overall relative to our prior guidance, however, this outlook does not factor in potential reductions to be identified as part of the cost assessment that Steve discussed.","On the QTL, as Derek indicated, we are raising our fiscal 2015 revenue outlook to approximately 8% growth year-over-year reflecting higher total reported device sales as well as the larger than forecasted catch up royalties reported this past quarter. We continue to expect QTL operating margins will be within our prior 85% to 86% guidance range.","We expect fiscal 2015 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $4.60 to $5, down approximately 9% year-over-year at the midpoint relative to fiscal 2015 and down $0.15 at the midpoint from our prior guidance.","Turning to our fiscal third quarter, we estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $5.4 billion to $6.2 billion, down approximately 15% year-over-year and 16% sequentially at the midpoint. The sequential changes reflect both the chip revenue challenges and the normal seasonal effects of QTL coming of its seasonal peak quarter.","We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share in our fiscal third quarter to be in the range of $0.85 to $1 dollar per share, down approximately 36% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect fiscal third quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be up 6% to 8% sequentially, primarily driven by QCT product roadmap spend that back half loaded, certain supply chain initiatives, as well as cost related to marketing and legal.","In QTL, we estimate total reported device sales of $61 billion to $67 billion will be reported by our licensees in the June quarter for shipments they made in the March quarter, up approximately 10% year-over-year at the midpoint, but lower sequentially as compared to the seasonally higher holiday quarter shipments in Q2.","We estimate that the QTL reported device ASP will be modestly up versus the second fiscal quarter, which included higher-than-expected lower price catch up units. We expect QTL\u2019s operating margin percentage to be between 83% and 85%, lower sequentially due to seasonal factors, OEM mix, as well as increases in marketing and legal expenses. We expect that the implied royalty rate as we calculate it will be lower quarter-over-quarter, reflecting licensee mix, as well as the impact of the new licensing terms in China.","In QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 210 million to 230 million units during the June quarter, down approximately 6% sequentially and down approximately 2% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect revenue per MSM to be down 8% to 9% sequentially due to unfavorable mix in the premium tier and price competition in the mid tier.","We expect QCT operating margin for this product cycle to bottom in the fiscal third quarter at approximately 7% to 10% of revenue, reflecting lower volumes, weaker mix, and timing of roadmap spending pushed into the quarter.","That concludes my comments and will now turn the call back to Warren.","Warren Kneeshaw","Thank you, George. Operator, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Tim Long","Thank you. Just a question on the chip side, I guess you mentioned before the GS6, you also mentioned the Note, so just curious is that this upcoming one later this year? And maybe talk a little bit about how we should think about the rest of Samsung\u2019s portfolio? And clearly, it\u2019s hit the revenue numbers, I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s also been something that looks like the gross margin is down again for the division. So if you could just maybe touch on Samsung impact across the model? Thanks.","Steve Mollenkopf","Hi, Tim, it\u2019s Steve. So you should think of the current generation of flagship products at Samsung. We anticipate a similar share picture than what you see today on the GS6. I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. Now, next design cycle, as I mentioned in my remarks, I think we feel that we have a very competitive roadmap. We are also seeing OEMs and I think the supplies to that OEM, looking at their portfolio and rationalizing, what that really means is putting more concentration on the newer products and less on the legacy products as you would typically see in a particular year and that obviously given our design and share impacts the outlook as well. So, those product cycle issues I think we\u2019re seeing being compounded by the fact that the premium tier is very concentrated really in two players right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Brian Modoff","Hi, guys. Can you perhaps talk about some of the cost synergies or cost saving that you might see as you go through this kind of evaluation of your cost structure? Are you targeting things like wafer design cycle times? Or can you maybe talk about it and how do you see that potentially helping your operating margins particularly in QCT as move forward? Thanks.","George Davis","Hi, Brian, it\u2019s George. I would call it an acceleration of many of the things that we started in 2014, which were fairly comprehensive. We brought down the rate of spending substantially in 2014 exiting the year lower than the run rate we had coming into 2014. We then forecasted to bring it down further in 2015 and we\u2019ve actually are a couple of points below our original guidance on OpEx as well. But we will be looking pretty comprehensively across the board and certainly that touches everything from how can we be \u2013 become more efficient testing projects once again for ROI and things like that. So, as you would expect, it will be comprehensive and we look forward to reporting on it next quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead with your question.","Mike Walkley","Great, thanks. Just down on the last two questions, on the QCT with operating margins potentially bottoming out below 10% in the third quarter, September quarter, and you talked about it extending into the first half of fiscal 2016. Other than looking at operating cost, how does the gross margin improve given the competitive cost environment? Or to ask it another way what\u2019s the timeframe in the thought process to maybe get back to high-teens to 20% operating margins in QCT? Thank you.","George Davis","I think we view it as a bottom because, first, Q3 really is an incredibly concentrated quarter when you look at the premium tier and it has within that meaningful Samsung GS6 impact. We expect to see some improvement with the premium tier launches of other leading OEMs that use our Snapdragon. We also expect cost and efficiency activities to start to moderate some of the market structure impacts over time, but ultimately we are going to continue to invest strongly in the roadmap and we think that's the basis for having a competitive position in the next product cycle that is different than what we are experiencing now.","Steve Mollenkopf","Mike this is Steve, I think also if you look up and down the product line, the current product cycle that we are in at the top tier, we think it turns over with the 820, at the bottom tier you tend to see a modem transition, particularly in China, which is advantageous we think to us. We are also moving rapidly toward advanced notes which we think will actually help us in terms of delivering products to market at better costs. There is a little bit of a trough right now in the cost equation because we are at 20 nanometre. As we move on to further notes we think we get into a better cost perspective and I think we are differentiated also in our ability to do it.","We are also - just to follow up on the cost side, cost structure of the company, we want to make sure that we put ourselves in the position, we are a little bit less sensitive to the these market dynamics and then we can write them out easier as well. One other thing element on that also is that the adjacent markets as they start to contribute more, again I said they were about 10% of QCT this year that tends to help us as well. They tend to be fairly highly leveraged from the same investment on the selling space.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ehud Gelblum with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.","Ehud Gelblum","Hey guys appreciate it. I know Derek you are not going to totally tell us, but trying to try and give a couple of data points you gave us with respect to the catch up and how large that was, any other information you can give us in terms of the access TRDS this quarter that the catch up helped would help kind of bridge the gap between the TRDS this quarter and next quarter. So, whatever you can do to give us a sense as to the size of the catch up period in this quarter would be helpful. ","Then Steve question on GS 6 and note going forward, I understand of the revolution of using your custom core and moving them to 14 nanometre et cetera with everything you said about concentration at the premium tier, if in a situation you don't get back into Samsung, where does that leave you? If your share in the GS 6 and note going forward is roughly the same as where it is now when it is back-and-forth, is there enough other market to make the margins work back into the 20% plus range at QCT?","Derek Aberle","Hey this is Derek. Yes we are not, as you suspect we weren't planning on breaking out exactly the amount of the catch up. One of the points I wanted to highlight was we had 17% year-over-year growth in QTL this quarter and that was in the face of some meaningful foreign exchange headwinds. And so when you sort of looked at that impact netted against the catch up amount, you know the foreign exchange impact was actually for the year will be greater and would be for the quarter as well. So still even if you strip out the ketchup would be a record quarter for QTL and really strong growth.","Steve Mollenkopf","And Ehud on the question about the premium tier and the concentration. First of all when we look at customer interest we don\u2019t think that that is the scenario to plan for. We do think that our roadmap is very compelling, we like the impact that we are getting, the interest that we are getting from the OEMs, I think broadly we also think our business, which is also supported by our modem leadership also we think is in a good position when you look at the competitive dynamics as well. That being said, it would help us a lot if the industry structure was to be different. We don't have a lot of control over that, but I would say the history of that is that it does move around quite a bit. We want to be in a position to participate in that and I think one of the reasons that we are looking at our cost structure is to make that easier to handle, should we have to ride out a product cycle or not.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.","Blaine Curtis","Yes a [indiscernible], just maybe from a very high level you obviously already reduced full-year guidance based upon kind of same factors and Apples place generally hasn\u2019t changed that much since December they had a knock out quarter and it\u2019s been kind of holding in. Samsung has been very public about their AP plans for a longer time here for a change. So, I am just trying to figure out what has changed really since the end of the last year and definitely spend your first negative revision of maybe a billion dollars, now that you are doing again. And then when you look at gross margin, clearly the GS6 that shouldn\u2019t have an impact on gross margin, I\u2019m just curious it looks like it is down again in June. What\u2019s really the driver for another step down over a couple hundred basis points? Thanks.","Derek Aberle","So, the change in the guidance is really more a change in our view of the sizing and concentration in the third quarter compared to our original estimates. And you know Steve talked about some things about some of the OEMS pushing out their timing based on what they were seeing in the marketplace and other factors. There is some gross margin impact actually that we see going into Q3 and then I think the balance of the impact is really the timing roadmap spending is heavier in the second half. I don\u2019t know, if Steve, you want to say something.","Steve Mollenkopf","I was just going to say, just a little bit of color from a perspective of an OEM, OEMs typically have a pretty broad portfolio and they may put emphasis in one place or another depending on the reaction of a flagship launch and the timing of a flagship launch. I think this year is probably characterised a bit by the first calendar quarter of 2015 was probably a little stronger in quarter for U.S. based flagship company. And then people move around I think based off of big launch. So, I think when the Galaxy S6 came out people moved around their plans a little bit, including Samsung. So, that tends to ripple through to us beyond our control. Those things can also change a lot during the year, but I think this is our best estimate of where we are today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Kulbinder Garcha ","Thanks. My question is for Derek on the licensing side, what I'm trying to understand is I think you said you had signed 35 licensees on these new terms since you\u2019ve started discussing with them recently, can you give us some kind of broad indications to, does that actually cover a significant part of the forms that you weren't licensing the 200 million or so run rate. That\u2019s just one question, because I\u2019m trying to think about the visibility you might have as we head into fiscal year 2016 of recapturing some of those licensing revenues. That's my kind of first question. The second one is as I think about what you weren\u2019t collecting on last year that 200 million number this year would have grown I assume given the market shares the Chinese vendors have gained and they would have grown revenues quite meaningfully as well. So, should we think about at some point over the next whether it is one two or three years? That 200 million unit number which has a revenue number attached to it in TDRS, so you then license against and it should be significantly higher when it starts coming in or is that the wrong way of thinking about it. Thanks.","Derek Aberle ","Kulbinder this is Derek. So just to be clear the 200 million number that we put out for 2014 is sort of a combination of units that we think are actually being sold by licensees who didn't report them, as well as basically unlicensed activity, you know the most prominent one we talked about is 3-mode. So, it is a little bit hard to translate that over into the \u2013 kind of the new terms. If you think about the new terms that we are going out to offer, if the licensees accept them after we offer them and discuss them with them they will impact both the 3G volumes which would be sort of how we\u2019ve thought about the under reported amounts, as well as then impact the 3-mode, which we had kind of bucketed at unlicensed. ","So it is a little bit hard to split that out in terms of what percentage get picked up that we weren't collecting anything on at all, but we are, well I think we are making good progress, we've got relatively significant number that kind of run the spectrum of very large to small companies that have already accepted the terms and generally when they\u2019ve accepted them they\u2019ve applied to the 3-mode devices sold for use in China. So, I think that has been a positive trend for us. There have been a couple of other positive things. One is as I try to explain the market we think actually came in larger in 2014 than we thought when we originally gave out that 200 million unit number, which means by that holding steady effectively our collection percentage went up. It also went up in the face of kind of a worse or a more difficult market shift because more of the market also we believe was three-mode where there is a larger portion of unlicensed activity."," So kind of in a worsening marketing environment and a growing market, we were able to kind of hold the number flat, which means we are making progress. We believe that that\u2019s going to better even going into the March quarter based on the early evidence we\u2019re seeing. And we do have kind of a plan as we\u2019ve talked about that \u2013 that the past sales will be things that we are working on to drive collection, but it\u2019s going to take some time and I think we\u2019ve indicated just where we sit in the fiscal year with kind of the June cut off for shipments flowing into our fiscal year. It\u2019s likely that more of that will come-in in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.","Stacy Rasgon","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First of all, if I sort of back into the royalty rate trajectory, you seem to be guiding royalty rates or implied rates next quarter to maybe 3%, probably down 20 basis points and maybe even a little more in fiscal Q4. So I\u2019m assuming that is mix as the China volume starts to come back in which it actually is coming at the lower rate, how should I think about the trajectory of royalty rates as I go into 2016 and beyond is presumably the Chinese volume should be the piece that\u2019s growing the biggest and it will be under the new royalty rate terms?","Derek Aberle","Hey, Stacy, this is Derek. Yeah, I mean we\u2019ve indicated that. If you look at sort of quarter-over-quarter Q1 to Q2 relatively speaking sort of in line in terms of the implied rate that you guys calculate, we do see that taking a step down in the back half of the year and I think you pretty much hit it on the head that really the primary drivers, there\u2019s some OEM mix in there and a number of the other factors that always move it around. But we do expect a couple of things impacting the back half, two of which are the licensees, kind of the impact of the licensees accepting the China terms in China, but also with us concluding agreements on three-mode where we were collecting before. ","As we bring that revenue into the program that will come in at a lower rate as we talked about when we announced the resolution. So kind of the combination of those factors will push it down. Really hard to say longer-term beyond kind of this year where that goes just for all the reasons I\u2019ve previously explained in terms of market share of OEMs and ASPs and caps and all the other drivers that moving around.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","James Faucette","Great. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask two follow-up questions on a lot of those that have already been asked. First, can you talk a little bit about from a visibility standpoint, I think one of the things that may be concerning to some investors is, I guess, the poor or lack of visibility relative to new product launches. They seem to taking a little bit by surprise. Can you talk about it if that indeed has been the case et cetera on the chip side? And then on the royalty side, Derek, I just wanted to ask about, as you are addressing the new licensing structure how are you handling the non-essential IP licensing and how we should think about the impact of that and can you give us any sense of \u2013 I know that you weren\u2019t very specific in terms of like what the \u2013 the rate at which things are \u2013 or you are signing up new licensees, but that it\u2019s improving. But in the long run how should we think about your \u2013 what a reasonable alternate capture rate should be and that kind of thing? Thank you.","Steve Mollenkopf","James on the chip side, the way I think about it \u2013 one of the big OEMs what they tend to do, in fact the one that you are probably concerned with, they tend to hold two designs until very late in the process and make a decision very late in the process. And in some cases, actually might go to market with multiple designs, one with our chip, one not with our chip, and then make a decision regionally even during the ramp of the design. So it can be quite difficult to project share and units as a result of doing that much later in the process than I think people typically think. The other element which is mix of OEMs and who wins in the marketplace and whether an OEM decides to rationalize their portfolio by no longer focusing on SKUs in the n-1 product cycle for example. That tends to be something that we don\u2019t have great visibility into and it tends to be something that the market controls. So I think we are all trying to figure out how to get a better handle on that.","Derek Aberle","And then \u2013 it\u2019s Derek. So, on the first question, which really was around how we are going to deal with the patents that are sort of outside the scope of the commitment we made to the NDRC. As you know, we\u2019ve typically licensed generally our whole portfolio together, but one of the things that we agreed to as part of the rectification plan in China is that we would separately offer to license just the 3G\/4G essential Chinese patents and then we would negotiate agreements for the rest of the portfolio kind of separate from that.","So really the first order of business for us is to go out and really implement the commitment that we made which is to offer these terms and around the essential portfolio and get those concluded. And then as part of those discussions, it could involve some of the other patents or we could end up dealing with the need for licenses to the rest of the portfolio down the road a little bit. What we\u2019ve included in our guidance and are thinking around fiscal 2015 really just is based on what we would expect to collect on the essential portfolio and doesn\u2019t build in incremental revenue at this point for the remainder of the portfolio, although we do believe there is an opportunity there.","On compliance, we think that we are in a position really to kind of drive the business back more to normal course before we had the investigation and I think we are pleased with some of the early trends we are seeing. It\u2019s going to take some time to get there, but we do believe that we can get back to a high compliance environment in China with some of the tools that we have available to us and now with the investigation behind us.","We do also think there is going to be some industry dynamics that will help, I do think there is going to be consolidation around the OEM base in China, so you\u2019ll have a fewer number of larger payers, which I think is just an easier thing to deal with from compliance standpoint than a lot of smaller players. And they are going to build successful export businesses where there is a need to play by international rules both inside and outside of China. So I think over time those trends really point in a positive direction for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.","Tal Liani","Hi, guys. I just have two questions quick questions kind of big one. First, when it comes to exchange rate, are we \u2013 what\u2019s the mechanism for exchange rate? Is there a risk that actually you see the impact of exchange rate next quarter because of the mechanism that you can clarify? And then the weird question I have is really for next year and this question was asked many times, but may be a different way, is it all \u2013 if you think about competition, I mean you think about MediaTek and Intel and Marvell and the local Chinese, how does it get better from here? I understand that this one is a trough from an expense point of view and margin point of view, but on the business, how does it get better from here? What needs to happen for you to see growth in revenues on the semiconductor side? And let me stop here [indiscernible]. Thanks.","Derek Aberle","Tal, this is Derek. Maybe I will answer your first question on the FX. Really the primary FX effect on the company is really around the licensing business. And couple of things to remember there I think that you know is that obviously the sales are reported to us one quarter in arrears. But the basic \u2013 probably the most significant exposure for us is really the euro and basically when the licensees and not all of them do it the same, so it\u2019s somewhat difficult to always estimate precisely the impacts, but I think we have a pretty good sense of it at a higher magnitude. But basically there is a mechanism for them to convert their sales in local euro back into dollars for purposes to calculate in the royalties and that creates an impact to the business. If you think about this year, in particular, there is probably at least a couple of percentage points of revenue growth that QTL has been impacted by just on FX alone.","Steve Mollenkopf","And on next year and to the forward-looking view in terms of the competitive environment, it\u2019s \u2013 I would say for us, it\u2019s \u2013 we don\u2019t see it changing that much and I would say our view of the current competitive environment may be different than what you see, you know we look at the modem tier and modem leadership and the accounts where that\u2019s important and we pretty good about our position there. I think that\u2019s an important differentiator for us. We have also moved quickly to advanced nodes. One of the things we did this year and we are currently investing in is moving rapidly across the tiers to the advanced nodes, which we think is a good strategy and enables us to leverage our feature leadership in the premium tier down and that I think has good results.","It's being offset a little bit now because of the concentration in the premium tier, so you're not seeing that maybe as broadly as you would think. The product cycle is quite fast in China as I mentioned. The modem transition later this year, I think a number of OEM, our competitors are having a difficult time producing five more designs and certainly have in the ability to do multi-SIM and all of the VOIP and international features that allow them to grow, at the same time we are changing the table stakes across the tiers on the modem. So we actually view our roadmap as getting stronger over time at least based on our view of the competitive environment. I don't think at the premium tier with the exception of the vertical threat at one of the OEMs. We don\u2019t see that dynamic being as threatening as perhaps was implied in the question. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead with your question.","Timothy Arcuri","Thank you very much I had two. First of all Steve, can you again just from a higher level, can you remind us or maybe discuss the high level merits for keeping the two businesses together. You had filed previously to spit the business up in the past, but you are being hit with these investigations and this new one from Korea. So again just getting your view there would be good. And then secondly I noted that George talked about having to pre-pay 950 million for some capacity and that\u2019s in the space of declining economics in the ship business. So, I was wondering if you can just discuss how we should be thinking about that pre-payment is this opportunistic or is it more of a defensive I guess?","Steve Mollenkopf","So, on the business structure it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve looked out throughout the company\u2019s history, I think a couple of times even publically it is something that is constantly and periodically discussed at the management team and at the board level. There are lot of puts and takes and those puts and takes change over time depending on the situation, but I would say just broadly you should think of the businesses as having significant synergies in the ability to deliver products to market. ","So, for example the channel of QCT is very, very important to be able to introduce new technology into the industry and share it\u2019s scale and be able to work. There are many things like that, but that is one of the ones that we want to make sure we can maintain, particularly given that we are driving into an environment where you\u2019re going to see convergence between Wi-Fi and Cellular and the modem itself is moving much more rapidly then I think people are thinking. At the same time the industry, the number of players who are investing in those technologies and that breadth of technology is decreasing. So we think we have an opportunity for us to continue to deliver modem innovation. That being said, it is something that we actively evaluate and it\u2019s obviously something that is one the minds of investors and something that we spend time talking to them actively about getting their perspective. ","George Davis","Hey Tim, it\u2019s George. On the capacity pre-payment it\u2019s really part of our overall supply chain initiative to drive more cost effective supply chain and it\u2019s an opportunity that we saw and that our partners saw to bring them a little bit more certainly and for them to provide us with a better long term cost roadmap. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.","C.J. Muse","Yes good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, in terms of QCT, can you walk through implied PBT [ph] margins into September and your long term outlook for MSM pricing and then a little bit bigger picture thanking on the chipset side. As you think about adjacent growth, particularly hyper connected areas like IOT and Auto, do you have the scale across technology customer relationships and distribution to succeed or do you need to look at acquisitions, and if yes, would you consider large scale M&A, or would you continue to focus solely bolt-on acquisitions. Thank you.","George Davis","It\u2019s George. On our margin you are seeing the effects both of the positioning within the premium tier which is having some impact on the gross margin, but also primarily it\u2019s the increase in Opex in the quarter having a little bit of an effect as well. So, it is a combination of mix of the Opex effects and just the market overall in the third quarter.","A \u2013 Steve Mollenkopf","And with respect to the adjacent businesses, there are a lot of technologies that are leveraged from the mobile space. There are some things that are not, for example, we got things like networking from the Atheros acquisition and we believe we are going to get a strong portfolio of technologies with the announced acquisition of CSR, which we hope will close here in this year. I think one of the things you get besides technology is the sales channel and the ability to sell into different types of customer then our current slate in the handset business. And we actively plan that out and that\u2019s one of the reasons why we have done M&A. It is also I think an environment in the industry right now where there is a lot of consolidation, particularly in the semi-conductor space and it is something that we think about and I think we can potentially have an opportunity to de-risk some of those things if we continue down through our strategy and we are trying to keep our strategic options open at the same maintain our capital structure. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question.","Srini Pajjuri","Thank you. Steve, this question has been asked, but I just want to ask a little differently, you said in the modem differentiation is your key competitive advantage and you seem to be banking on that, you know to regain some of the business, I am just curious you know given that in a lead that you have, it appears that Samsung is using an internal modem even now, even though I guess they could have used your modem with their own processor, I am just wonder, is the modem technology that mature that customers don\u2019t care as much about the differentiation or in a - what do you think cause that.","Steve Mollenkopf","Well I think when you have a vertical decision there could be many more elements in the decision than just technical merits or what might have happened outside of that environment. They have the ability to share one place or the other. When we look at the tier downs of those decisions we tend to see that it compares at least from a feature and a geography point of view to a product that we probably delivered two generations ago. So, I would actually view it as more evidence of our modem lead. ","Now it is possible to portions of the SKUs without having the modem expertise, but I think you are always better off having in the application processor and the modem together and have that worldwide scale, particularly given the industry structure today. We are seeing that the very attractive in the case of the internal OEMs or the Chinese OEMs that want to go international. So, we still think that modem is an important component. If you look what\u2019s in the head of any modem player they have enormous number of [indiscernible] they have to sink up Wi-Fi and the cellular network. Just recently the FCC gave a very positive ruling on the spectrum that will be used for LTE-U. ","So, we think the modem still has an enormous migration and then upstream and then beyond that you are going to have 5G. So the modem continues to be big. In addition, hopefully we are not downplaying the strength of our application process. So, we have \u2013 we think the best mobile CPU coming and that\u2019s going to be a portfolio of products, not just one product and our strength in the GPU is, I think quite strong, we are market leader in terms of mobile GPU shipments and look at the performance of the 89, 94 I think you would see it\u2019s quite strong. So, we feel like we are in a good position. We just need to get through this product cycle, maintain the investment in the roadmap and at the same time sort of get ourselves in a position where we can weather out these storms a little bit easier and I think we are going to have a reasonable business there. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.","Tavis McCourt","Thanks for taking my question. Derek you ran through a few numbers, now I want to make sure I had them right, they are not addition up to me. I think you said QTL ASP this year would be down 11% to 12% in the fiscal year. Device sales would be up 8% to 11% but revenues will be up 8% or so, was that the right numbers for fiscal 2015?","George Davis","So I think we probably \u2013 we kind of mix-and-match a little bit. The units are for calendar year. The ASP that we gave was a global ASP, that\u2019s remember not the one that necessarily will get reported to us, that sort of the all-in number assuming we were getting 100% compliance. We haven\u2019t given guidance on a reported ASP for fiscal 2015 for a number of reasons, including it\u2019s probably going to get bounced around by things like catch up payments and the timing of signing some of these new agreements. So I think that may be your difficulty in trying to triangulate the numbers back to the 8% revenue guide for QTL.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Sue with RBC. Please go ahead with your question.","Mark Sue","Thank you. In the past [indiscernible], it didn\u2019t make economic sense where some of the smartphone makers do spend money to develop their own chipsets just for their internal consumption. However, it doesn\u2019t seem that would change anytime soon because the market is maturing and Samsung, Apple, they all want to focus on improving their margins. So within those confines, how should we think about the automation in terms of pushing it to new markets outside of smartphones and how to fund those investments so that we can actually see a better return on the invested capital in other segments of the business? Thank you, gentlemen.","Steve Mollenkopf","Mark, you are breaking up a little bit. So I will try to answer what the question was and I think it was related to how we can continue to invest and have confidence given that some people are trying to go internal. Our evaluation of the efforts to go internal, they actually tend to be more expensive than if you had bought them externally, particularly when you amortize the R&D investment across all of the many different technologies that are required to produce and integrate it or a mobile smartphone offering. In fact, I would say, particularly, given the fact that in some cases people are launching very early in the node, you really pay a penalty for yield. And our estimate is that it would be quite expensive right now to be launching without good yield.","I think you will also see if you look at teardowns, the difference between the size both footprint on the board as well as cost to assemble all of the components that we have in Snapdragon using external partners, it tends to be fairly expensive. For example, Snapdragon has GPS integrated inside of it and putting that on externally tends to be fairly expensive. There are number of things, codec, a number of things that sit there and become more expensive. So our view of the trend is that things are moving more toward integrated versus less toward integrated. And when we look at the economics, it\u2019s quite difficult we think to have people compete, have the same internal offering unless you have a fairly large scale, R&D scale.","Operator","This ends our allotted time for questions and answers. Mr. Mollenkopf, do you have anything further to add before adjourning the call?","Steve Mollenkopf","Thank you very much for your attention. We look forward to a call next quarter and will give you an update on our cost initiative at the time. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Today's call will include prepared remarks by Steve Mollenkopf and George Davis. In addition, Dr. Paul Jacobs, Derek Aberle, Cristiano Amon, Murthy Renduchintala, and Don Rosenberg will join the question-and-answer session.","I would like to highlight that we issued two press releases today, our fiscal third quarter earnings release as well as a release announcing our strategic realignment plan. Both are available on our website along with associated slide presentations. Please visit our website at qualcomm.com to access these along with the audio broadcast that accompanies this call.","During this conference call, we will use non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G, and you can find the related reconciliations to GAAP on our website.","As well, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future business or results of the company. Actual events or results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q, which contain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","And now to comments from Qualcomm's Chief Executive Officer, Steve Mollenkopf.","Steven M. Mollenkopf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Warren, and thank you all for joining us. Today's call will have a different structure than prior calls given the significant announcements we made today. I will focus my remarks on the strategic realignment plan and some brief updates to the business and industry environment. George will then spend a few minutes reviewing our third quarter financial results and outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. We will then take your questions.","Today, we are announcing a broad package of initiatives designed to increase stockholder value and position the company for success in an ever-changing industry environment. These initiatives are focused on areas within our control, including making sure we have the right cost structure for the future, a corporate structure that maximizes value and will best position us for the strategic opportunities ahead within a dynamic industry landscape, the appropriate capital structure and level of dividends and share repurchases, the optimal board composition and management incentives, and a capital allocation plan that ensures that our investment dollars are spent in areas with the most promising risk-adjusted returns.","We are also pleased to be adding two new directors today. We intend to add a third new director promptly, pursuant to an agreement with JANA Partners. I will speak in more detail about our two new directors, Mark McLaughlin and Tony Vinciquerra, in a moment.","We are committed to driving meaningful change to improve our near-term performance while preserving our ability to create sustainable value over the long term. These steps are being implemented on an accelerated timeline and are designed to help us improve execution, enhance financial performance, and drive more profitable growth across the company without jeopardizing our ability to retain and build upon our technology leadership position in both our core and new businesses.","Over the last three decades, Qualcomm has thrived as both the company and the mobile industry have grown and gone through a number of significant transformations. We have demonstrated the ability to successfully adapt and change, and that ability will continue to serve as well as we implement our strategic realignment plan and continue to examine any and all ways to maximize shareholder value.","Our strategic realignment plan is designed to enable us to extend our core strengths and deliver value for our customers and stockholders in more efficient and powerful ways. The plan has six key initiatives: number one, aggressively right-sizing our cost structure; number two, reviewing financial and structural alternatives that are available to us that may create stockholder value; number three, reaffirming our intent to return significant capital to stockholders; number four, adding new directors with complementary skill sets while reducing the average tenure of our board; number five, further aligning executive compensation with performance and stockholder return objectives; and number six, making disciplined investments to further our leadership positions and build upon our core technologies and capabilities.","First, I want to address costs. As you know, we have been working with an independent third-party consultant to conduct a comprehensive review of our cost structure across the company. Based on the results of this review, we are taking actions to substantially reduce costs, taking our fiscal 2015 spending base down by approximately $1.1 billion annually. We expect to be operating at this run rate by the end of fiscal 2016.","QCT expenses will come down by approximately $800 million annually, and we expect our QCT operating margin to be 16% or better by Q4 of fiscal 2016 without assuming meaningful improvement in the current industry environment. For the long term, we are continuing to target a QCT operating margin of at least 20%, and our strategic realignment plan provides the basis for us to get there. I will go into more detail on our plan to achieve this in just a moment.","We will also eliminate approximately $300 million annually of spend outside of QCT and QTL, and we'll focus our investments there on a smaller number of the largest, most profitable opportunities, including data centers, small cells, and certain IoE verticals.","This plan still allows for significant R&D in the company. We will continue to spend over $4 billion annually on R&D, focused on continuing to drive the next wave of growth in the mobile industry as well as other opportunities.","Implementation of the plan has begun, and we expect to realize at least $600 million of the plan's annual gross savings in fiscal 2016 and to achieve the full savings run rate by the end of fiscal 2016.","Additionally, we are reducing share-based compensation grants across the company. Annual share-based awards will come down by $300 million. To be clear, this $300 million reduction in share-based awards is in addition to the $1.1 billion in other cost reductions. We expect to incur approximately $350 million to $450 million in restructuring charges associated with these actions.","We have a dedicated team and a detailed plan to achieve the cost targets I just described. We will be updating you on the progress we are making on each quarterly earnings call until it is completed.","First, in QCT, our goal is straightforward, to take down costs without sacrificing our technology leadership, customer commitments, or valuable IP roadmap. Through the comprehensive cost review, we have identified a number of ways to resize and realign our investments so they are directed at achieving that goal. Full-time head count in QCT will be reduced by approximately 15%, which is in alignment with the overall company reductions. Our company resources are being realigned to our highest return businesses, and we'll also make significant reductions in our temporary work force. Our team and organization will be streamlined. We will have fewer office locations overall, and we'll shift some of our resources to lower-cost regions.","We are also reducing our QCT R&D spend. Going forward in QCT overall, we are committing to focused investments on the most differentiated technologies and products that can deliver the highest return on investment. We will be managing costs while maintaining technology leadership, a strong product roadmap, and investment in the most promising growth opportunities.","Second, we continue to see significant opportunities for growth in new areas outside of QTL and QCT. While we are sharply focused on managing costs, we are not sacrificing the future for the present. We are taking a highly disciplined approach to our investments. We will invest in areas where we can apply our existing technology, such as small cells, or areas that are natural extensions of our capabilities, such as data centers.","The third element of our cost reduction program is in SG&A. We are increasing SG&A efficiencies across the company. In the near term, we are combining corporate functions and reorganizing to gain efficiencies from scale. While these specific cost initiatives are expected to be fully implemented by the end of fiscal 2016, the company will continue to examine its cost structure for additional efficiency opportunities.","As you know, we do not provide our outlook for the next fiscal year until our November call, but I do want to share our thinking behind our Q4 fiscal 2016 QCT targeted operating margin of 16% or better. Simply put, we are assuming that industry conditions remain similar to the current environment. Our planning assumptions for this target do not factor in more favorable industry and customer dynamics, particularly related to the back half of next year, that could materialize, nor do they factor in the impact of our pending CSR acquisition. George will review this in more detail shortly.","In light of recent industry developments and other elements of our strategic realignment plan, our board and management team are conducting a fresh review of our corporate structure and financial alternatives to create stockholder value. This review, which is being done with the assistance of outside financial advisors, will include a review of possible business separation alternatives and the potential strategic and capital structure opportunities they may enable as well as additional capital return opportunities and other potential strategic and financial alternatives that may be available to the company to create stockholder value. We expect to complete the review before the end of the calendar year, and we do not expect to publicly comment on this review prior to its completion.","A key element of the strategic realignment plan is our continued commitment to our significant capital return program. We are reaffirming our intention to execute the largest capital return program in the history of Qualcomm. Our objective is to maintain a balance sheet that supports our commitment to stockholder returns while preserving the strategic flexibility needed to compete and drive growth in a rapidly evolving industry. We remain committed to returning at least 75% of free cash flow to stockholders through dividends and buybacks. In March, we announced that we will repurchase $10 billion of common stock before March 2016. This buyback is in addition to our existing commitment to return at least 75% of free cash flow to stockholders going forward. As of today, we have repurchased $6.4 billion of our 12-month commitment, including the $5 billion ASR.","Capital allocation is a subject on which the board and management have been intensely focused, and we will continue that focus going forward. As part of the review of financial and structural alternatives, the board and management will consider changes to the capital return program.","We have a high-caliber board with exceptionally qualified directors who have been actively implementing changes to drive stockholder value. Today we announced that we have added Mark McLaughlin and Tony Vinciquerra to the board. Mark is the Chairman, President and CEO of Palo Alto Networks and was previously the President and CEO of VeriSign, where he helped improve the cost structure and rationalize their portfolio of businesses. Tony was formerly the Chairman and CEO of FOX Networks and Lead Independent Director of Motorola Mobility, where he oversaw a meaningful cost rationalization program. He was also a director of its predecessor company, Motorola, where he was involved in evaluating and implementing its separation. We also expect to appoint a third new independent director. These new directors bring skills, expertise, and experience that will be helpful as we implement our strategic realignment plan.","In addition, the average tenure of the board will come down. General Brent Scowcroft and Duane Nelles have retired from the board. As we previously announced, Sir Donald Cruickshank will not stand for reelection to the board in 2016. Raymond Dittamore has also informed the company that he does not intend to stand for reelection in 2017, assuming he is reelected at the 2016 meeting. On behalf of the company, the Qualcomm board sincerely thanks these valued directors for their years of service. Without question, we are a better company as result of their dedication to Qualcomm and their service to the stockholders.","The board also plans to make changes to our compensation program to strengthen the connection between compensation decisions and the goals of our strategic realignment plan. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee plans to change our executive compensation program so that it is more closely aligned with our operational performance and stockholder return objectives. That means adding return on invested capital as a metric for determining performance-based equity awards. The Compensation Committee also intends to use earnings per share results in determining additional cash bonuses and plans to take stock-based compensation awarded to all employees into account when calculating EPS.","Fiscal 2016 will be a transition year as we continue to implement these initiatives, but we intend to build upon our technology leadership position. Our balance sheet is strong and we have the right assets in place. We have been through industry transformations before, and Qualcomm has always thrived coming out of them. In the process, we have delivered substantial stockholder value. After pioneering digital cellular communications, we pioneered mobile computing, and now also have world-class technology in a number of important areas such as graphics and connectivity.","We successfully evolved our chip business from providing just modems to providing a smartphone SoC platform with a multitude of industry-leading technologies. We are now the number three semiconductor company in the world, with broad presence across mobile, networking, connectivity, and other industry segments. We also navigated the transition from CDMA through the introduction of WCDMA and 3G to the launch and ongoing enhancement of 4G\/LTE. We intend to drive the evolution of 5G next.","There are big opportunities in front of us to build upon our technology leadership, and we believe that the plan we are announcing today will set us up well to capitalize on these opportunities. We have recently concluded the NDRC investigation and announced several investments in China that position us well to grow our businesses in China going forward. In addition, we are investing in adjacent opportunities that are already delivering significant revenue for QCT today and which we expect to drive meaningful growth for QCT in the coming years. Finally, our disciplined investments outside of QCT and QTL and our technical capabilities provide the opportunity for us to participate in new high-growth segments such as the data center.","QTL remains a source of strength for Qualcomm, where our IP and technology leadership is unrivaled, with more than 275 3G licensees and more than 140 4G single-mode licensees. QTL will remain a growth driver for the company. We are continuing to invest in leading-edge technologies for the future, wireless technologies as well as a broad set of other device technologies. We also are investing in new technology areas designed to grow and diversify the licensing business beyond 3G\/4G devices, and equipment.","We expect strong global 3G\/4G device growth to continue, with device sales expected to increase at a mid to high single-digit CAGR over the next five years. We also continue to expect modest declines in global 3G\/4G device ASPs over the longer term, consistent with our previous commentary. Finally, we continue to target longer-term QTL margins in the range of 86% to 88%.","We have a growing technology leadership position in QCT. Our product roadmap, which was developed in tandem with leading global network operators, remains at the forefront of the industry. We are an industry-leading innovator with worldwide scale. Our footprint and scale position provides cost savings and leading global support capabilities. We have strong design win traction for new handsets at the premium tier, including among Chinese OEMs.","The current industry environment has seen OEM share shift in the highly profitable premium tier, where the top player continues to take share and where, according to IDC, the top two manufacturers together now have more than 85% share of premium tier shipments.","The current product cycle also has seen certain OEMs pursue vertically integrated strategies at increased levels compared to the past. These developments along with other product cycle issues are currently impacting our business. We have a plan that we believe will allow us to deliver profitable growth in this challenging environment moving forward while we continue to execute on the technology and product roadmaps that position us for future success.","Now turning to our significant opportunities for QCT growth, even as we take down companywide costs, we are equally committed to continuing to strengthen our position in key technologies and capitalize on additional silicon opportunities in smartphones. Cumulative smartphone unit shipments are forecast to be more than 8.5 billion between 2015 and 2019, according to IDC, and we are growing our share of content within devices with new technologies. That requires investments in modem and differentiated IP leadership, technologies that scale across the core smartphone and adjacent growth businesses, and process node leadership with multi-fab support. And we have the scale and technology leadership to drive profitable growth.","We have the best modem roadmap and team, application processor leadership across tiers, and tremendous scale. We are applying our core smartphone technologies into rapidly expanding adjacent opportunities in a disciplined way, carefully selecting the opportunities where we can create the most value and generate the best returns. We already have a significant business in these areas, with fiscal 2015 revenues estimated to be approximately $1.6 billion.","We have identified networking, mobile computing, IoT, and automotive as the highest return areas and will focus our investments there. In fact, we continue to expand our investment in these growth areas. These areas have an addressable opportunity of more than $10 billion today. Based on a mix of third-party estimates and our own forecasts, the serviceable addressable opportunity for these four areas is expected to double by 2020 to more than $20 billion. Our strategic realignment plan combined with execution on growth opportunities and product design improvements provides the basis for our long-term operating margin target of at least 20%.","In summary, with the strategic realignment plan, we have taken actions designed to drive stockholder value, improve performance and execution, and position Qualcomm for long-term success. These steps are being implemented on an accelerated basis, and we will continue to explore additional steps to enhance stockholder value. Our balance sheet remains strong. And with the NDRC review behind us, we moved quickly to significantly increase our capital return program, the largest in our company's history. Shortly thereafter, we commenced a comprehensive cost review that resulted in a $1.1 billion cost-cutting plan that is detailed and actionable and will be at its full run rate by the end of fiscal year 2016.","Investments outside QTL and QCT will be refocused on the highest return areas and reduced by approximately $300 million. Annual share-based compensation grants are also being reduced by $300 million. Our board and management are taking a fresh look at financial and structural alternatives to enhance stockholder value. We are further aligning executive compensation with our performance and stockholder return objectives. We have added new directors and reduced the average tenure of the board, and we are refocusing our investment spend to drive growth while delivering attractive returns.","We have significant opportunities before us, and we are executing on a strategy to realize these opportunities. We are absolutely committed to leading the next wave of mobile computing and delivering profitable growth in new areas beyond the smartphone in order to deliver significant value to Qualcomm stockholders.","I want to thank the Qualcomm employees around the world whose dedication and focus will be critical as we work to implement this plan. Our long-term opportunities are significant, and we have complete confidence in our ability to realize our vision.","With that, I will pass it over to George.","George S. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon to everyone.","Our fiscal third quarter results were in line with our expectations, with both revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share within our prior guidance ranges. In QCT, revenue was in line with expectations at $3.85 billion. And the operating margin at 7.5% was at the low end of the guidance range as stronger than expected share and units in the low tier in China were more than offset by weaker mix in the premium tier. We believe that in addition to reduced demand, sell-through for some of our premium tier customers was weaker than expected, leading to an inventory build, which we now expect to impact QCT MSM demand in the fiscal fourth quarter.","In QTL, total reported device sales by our licensees were $60.4 billion, up 4% year over year, but below the low end of our prior guidance range, reflecting lower than expected reported device shipments. The lower-than-expected reported device shipments were primarily driven by a higher mix of unlicensed three-mode units and the fact that it is taking us longer than previously expected to conclude new license agreements with certain Chinese OEMs.","QTL revenues were up 7% year over year and modestly ahead of our expectations. Audit recoveries and other payments for prior-period activity recognized in the quarter more than offset the impact of lower reported device sales. We estimate that the average selling price of reported devices sold during the third fiscal quarter was approximately $208, up approximately $12 sequentially at the midpoint.","Turning to capital structure, we continued our aggressive capital return program, returning a record $6.2 billion to stockholders in the quarter, including $757 million of dividends paid and $5.4 billion in stock repurchases. These amounts include a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase, which we expect to be completed no later than November. Our shares outstanding were reduced by 3% in the last quarter and 6% since the start of fiscal 2014.","Turning to our fiscal fourth quarter, we estimate revenues to be in the range of $4.7 billion to $5.7 billion, down approximately 22% year over year and 11% sequentially at the midpoint. This outlook puts us at the low end of our previous revenue guidance for the full fiscal year. We expect sequential QTL revenues to be flat to up slightly in the fourth quarter, driven by increased 3G\/4G total reported device sales, including from the execution of new agreements with Chinese OEMs, offsetting the absence of audit recoveries and prior-period revenues recognized in our third fiscal quarter. Our outlook also incorporates a continuing foreign exchange headwind.","Let me comment further on our progress implementing the revised licensing terms in China. We are adding new agreements and continue to expect improvement over time in the underreporting we have been experiencing, including collecting on three-mode shipments. However, the timing of executing new agreements and improving the underreporting is likely to remain somewhat difficult to predict. As we evaluate TRDS for the second half of fiscal 2015, we now estimate that TRDS will be lower than previously expected, primarily driven by a higher mix of three-mode devices in China, an increase in share by Chinese OEMs globally, as well as the timing uncertainty relating to new agreements and compliance I just discussed.","Having said that, our outlook for global device sales remains strong, and we continue to believe we will successfully conclude new agreements in China and improve collections over time, consistent with our prior views.","Turning to QCT, we have reduced our outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter on lower shipments, which I will discuss in a moment. We now expect QCT operating margins to be approximately 2% to 4%. The revenue and margin downside to our previous expectations for the fourth quarter are driven primarily by three factors weighing on premium tier demand.","First, we are seeing share concentration in the premium tier impact demand for certain OEM devices that use our chipsets more than our previous expectations. This dynamic led to inventory build in the fiscal third quarter for these OEMs, which is driving reduced demand for our chipsets in the near term on inventory drawdown. Second, we are seeing weakness in demand for our premium tier chipsets from a vertical customer based on a change in the mix of devices that are selling through. And third, lower than expected sell through in China of certain handset models using our premium tier chipsets is impacting demand in the fourth quarter.","Product costs are expected to be modestly higher than previous expectations, as some of the yield-related benefits forecasted on higher volumes will not be realized. We are pleased with our design traction across all tiers, and our view on fourth quarter low-tier unit volume and share in China is consistent with prior expectations.","Let me spend a moment on the sequential change in units. We are guiding to a 45 million unit sequential decline in MSM shipments. This decline is explained by two factors. First, our previous guidance expected MSMs to be down sequentially by 10 million to 15 million units in the fourth quarter. And the addition of 5 million units into the third fiscal quarter brings the anticipated impact closer to 20 million units. Second, the remaining approximately 25 million unit reduction is largely explained by the premium tier developments I explained a few minutes ago.","Turning to our earnings outlook, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share in our fiscal fourth quarter to be approximately $0.75 to $0.95 per share. Fiscal 2015 full-year earnings guidance range is $4.50 to $4.70 per share.","While it is too early to forecast fiscal 2016, the strategic realignment plan is designed to deliver significantly improved QCT margins, even assuming the industry trends experienced in the second half of fiscal 2015 persist and does not assume the potential upsides from market improvement or recovery of premium tier share at a leading vertical OEM. We believe these actions position the company well going forward and will require our complete focus over the next year to ensure we execute well on our customer commitments and technology roadmaps while delivering on the plan.","That concludes my remarks. I will now turn the call back to Warren.","Warren Kneeshaw - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, George. Operator, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great, thank you. Steve and George, maybe you can just share with us a little more on the cost reductions. Can you help us think about the cadence to reach this run rate? Is it more linear through fiscal 2016, or is it more front-end loaded? And then could you talk on maybe any program that you might be shutting down? Thank you.","George S. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. Hi, Mike. This is George. The cost savings will come in over time, as you would expect, throughout the year. We'll have some front loading, but we see costs actually based on the timing that's required for meeting the roadmap requirements and other factors spreading it out. But we expect the cost savings to be fully realized by the end of the year. And if you average out what we expect, we think about $600 million will come out in the fiscal year.","Steven M. Mollenkopf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Mike, this is Steve. Just very quickly on programs. Essentially what we're doing is we're going to protect our IP roadmaps. We are not going to withdraw from tiers. We're going to do some changes to how we're doing things and where we're putting employees, and obviously, we'll be out talking to customers and making sure they're comfortable with that as well. But I think you're looking at a case where we've had some significant growth and we're trying to get our cost structure in advance or trying to react to what's happening in the industry and get ahead of it, and I think we'll be healthier as a result. But we're going to definitely be continuing to invest in the roadmap.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Timothy Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. I just want to get back into the chip business here. I get the moving parts around units and market share, and it sounds like a little build this quarter and a little burn next quarter. But if I average the two of them and just divide by the TRDS units and compare that to the few quarters before that, it looks like about 10 full points of market share reduction. And at the same time, it looks like ASPs have come down and gross margins dip into 40% or maybe even lower for that segment. So is there something else going on competitively, other than the Samsung vertical integration and the channel build? It seems like we're at a step function down in market share above and beyond the high end at that one customer.","Steven M. Mollenkopf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Tim. If you look at the fourth quarter effects that we're talking about, they're effectively all premium tier. I know Derek may want to jump in, in a minute, on the TRDS point. So our design traction in the premium tier has not had any change. So we did cite that we had lower volumes at one vertical OEM, which you could describe it as share loss. But overall, it's really the fact that we have this concentrated environment and a very large impact on a number of our premium tier customers as a result of that. The other piece is we cited in China that certain handset models using our chipsets had lower demand than was forecasted going into the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, thanks for taking my question. Steve, I was wondering if there's any way you could quantify the impact of the Snapdragon 810 issues, whether it's some of your customers choosing to use prior-generation chips or any expenses that you've had to incur that are abnormal related to that.","And then secondly, I know you've looked at the separation in the past. Can you remind us the logic of having QTL and QCT together, at least the major points that came to a conclusion in the past to keep these together? Thanks.","Steven M. Mollenkopf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Why don't I ask George to handle the first one? I'll be happy to do the second part about separation.","George S. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. In terms of the Snapdragon 810, I think probably the biggest single impact as we look at the year \u2013 first off, again, much like the fourth quarter, it's almost entirely attributable to changes in the premium tier and certainly the socket loss at a major vertical customer. And so that would typically have been a customer for the Snapdragon 810 for their new-generation devices. But it's also been a factor of the impacts that are happening in the premium tier overall, that we're seeing SKUs other than the leading SKUs that are not selling through at the levels that customers thought that are impacting some of our premium tier chipsets as well. So the only other thing from a cost standpoint is we have had some increased E&O and certainly some portion of Snapdragon 810 is a part of that. But overall, it's really been more a function of the significant shift in demand that we've seen throughout the year.","Steven M. Mollenkopf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And with regards to the separation, I think each individual time that we've looked at this, the circumstances were different. I think we've looked at it a number of times over the last decade and a half. Today, given that we're on the other side of the NDRC investigation, the structure of the industry, how we're looking at the market, I think it's time to take a fresh look, and I think that's what we're describing. There's no foregone conclusion either way here. But we want to make sure we do a thorough look to make sure that we're looking at all ways to drive shareholder value. One of the reasons that we look at our board composition, we do have some new eyes coming in that can help us look at that as well with some unique experience, so we're going to go through the process and we will update you shortly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, thanks for taking my question. George, I just wanted to clarify on the timing of the OpEx cuts. I thought I heard you say $600 million this year. I just want to make sure that it was \u2013 obviously, the fiscal year ends in September. When did those cuts start and how linear is that?","And then I just wanted to better understand the inventory picture here. You mentioned 25 million units. Does that clean up this issue? And then I just wanted to \u2013 as you look into China, in terms of differentiating your \u2013 you said you're investing in your modem. I think one of the issues is that you haven't had the market move to carrier aggregation. Just any progress on moving the market ahead in terms of getting the carriers to actually roll out more carrier aggregation to create an advantage?","George S. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Blayne. This is George. On the $600 million, my point there is that we'll take $600 million of the $1.1 billion run rate out in fiscal 2016. I didn't mean to imply 2015, if that's how it came across.","In terms of the inventory, we're really going to have to see how it plays out. We certainly are coming into the quarter with a significant overhang that we didn't forecast coming into the quarter. And so we will \u2013 I mean in the previous guide. So it will really depend on how our customer sell-through plays out in the quarter.","Steven M. Mollenkopf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","With respect to the carrier aggregation question in China, China Telecom has already launched. It's starting to work its way through the design cycle and through the ecosystem. China Mobile is expected to launch at the end of this calendar year. And we think this will be a good dynamic and has been anticipated in our roadmap, as you may know. The other dynamic that's happening in China is just also is just the desire for the Chinese OEMs to be exporters, and that's also been a good trend for us. But we're looking forward to this carrier aggregation launch happening in China.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Just a couple of questions. One just on clarification on the cost savings. All these are gross numbers. So are you guys going to be reinvesting some part? And I'm trying to figure out of the $1.1 billion how much will actually drop to the bottom line that might enhance profits over the longer term. Can you just speak about how you think about reinvestments?","And then for Paul or for Steve, on the separation point of QTL and QCT, I just want to understand what the basic arguments are because in the sense that previously I was under the impression that there's joint R&D and there's clear synergy between it. What are the dyssynergies of separating these businesses now, especially I think one thing that is maybe very different versus the past is that the QTL business has achieved...","George S. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Kulbinder, we can barely hear you. Can you speak more closely to your...","Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Sorry, let me start again. I was just saying that first of all on the cost savings side, how much of them will be reinvested? And furthermore, will some of the $1.1 billion, that's a gross number I think, how much drops to the bottom line, how should we think about that?","And then on the separation point, can you please just give us the pros and cons of separating in the sense that right now QTL license is so much of the handset industry, it's almost achieved a large part of what you needed to do to be with QCT in the first place? Is now the right time to separate? What's the dyssynergy of separating, for example? I'm not asking for a number, but what are the arguments we should think about? Thanks.","George S. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Kulbinder, the cost reductions are meant to be reductions relative to the run rate that we had in 2015, so they are effectively net reductions in that sense. We'll certainly spend some more in certain areas of the company, but it's a pretty broad-based reduction, and the $1.1 billion is meant to be the amount of savings that are coming out pre-tax.","Paul E. Jacobs - Executive Chairman","Kulbinder, this is Paul. We don't want to get into a lot of the details on separation arguments because we're going to do a fresh review, and there are really no preconceived notions right now. So I think it's best if we leave that situation as it stands and allow the new directors, the outside advisors to make some decisions on their own.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. I wanted to touch on the cost reductions. You've talked about OpEx reductions, and I am wondering how much improvement in cost of goods and gross margin, particularly on the chip business, may be attainable. I guess I'm interested in that simply because if I look at what you're targeting for a run rate exiting next fiscal year and apply that to just the QCT gross profit you put through this quarter, it would indicate a better operating margin then you've even targeted for next year. So I was just wondering how we should think about COGS and that as a cost reduction effort.","And my second question is back on the demand. I guess I'm wondering how long you think it will take to work through this inventory because 25 million units roughly, as George outlined, is a huge proportion of the customers that you have in that high-end segment. And so I'm just wondering how long you think it will take to put through and get through that inventory adjustment? Thank you.","George S. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So most of the cost savings that we've talked about are coming out of OpEx, although there are engineering activities within cost of sales that are part of the overall $7.3 billion base that we've talked to.","In terms of COGS, we've had, as you know, for some time a significant focus on improvements in our supply chain, including some long-term agreements, some prepayment activities. We've said that we expected to start to see the fruits of those things after 2015 and getting through the initial ramp of 20-nanometer. So most of the savings we're focusing on here are really OpEx related, but we will continue to look for opportunities to improve COGS. And we have not forecasted margin improvements as part of this exercise, but of course that's something that we'll be focused on as well.","In terms of the demand, the 25 million is really the number of units that is below what we had anticipated in the fourth quarter, which accounts for really the bulk of the revenue and margin decline that we're seeing. It's not necessarily just the inventory balance. So it's not \u2013 as you know, the inventory, we can look into the channel and we can certainly clearly see significant build across that channel, but to know exactly how it will come out would be hard to forecast. We just know it's going to have a significant impact in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Mr. Arcuri, please make sure that your line is not on mute. Mr. Arcuri, please make sure that your line has not been muted. Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question, I just wanted to clarify. It doesn't look like you took your global unit forecast for QTL for calendar year 2015 down. That's still sitting at 1.560 billion, which suggests you're not seeing any further degradation in the second half versus your prior outlook for the global market. I just wanted to verify that and ask you how confident you are that there are no impending headwinds building in the market itself in the second half of the year.","And for my second question, on chipsets and the 16% margin guidance, I know you said you're not factoring in anything improving in the market. But at this point, why shouldn't we be factoring in the prospect for the market getting worse, given a lot of the issues that seem to be hitting here on margins in terms of competition and mix and everything else, at least to me, would appear to be structural rather than something that would be fully in your control?","Derek K. Aberle - President","Stacy, this is Derek. Why don't I take the first one? I think we looked across the market. There are obviously some puts and takes, a little softness we're seeing in the premium tier and a little bit slower early parts in China for the year. But as we look at the full year, we do think that will reaccelerate in China in particular. And the net-net of the overall reevaluation of the market we still feel confident in the prior forecast that we put out there, so we're not going to adjust it at this time.","Steven M. Mollenkopf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Stacy, on the planning assumptions that we used, we think that the second half gives you a pretty balanced view. We saw weak mix in the third quarter. We obviously see a very difficult environment in the fourth quarter. And really it's meant to be a planning assumption so that we can give some sense of where we see the company and QCT in particular on margins coming out at the end of next year. We believe there are certainly upsides and downsides to that planning assumption, but to try and forecast what that means for 2016 until we get closer is too difficult at this point. So we'll do that in November, and we'll have a better view whether we're in a weaker or stronger situation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. I had two. First of all, George, relative to the new QCT operating margin targets by the end of next year, when you say that that doesn't assume any improvement in the industry, does that mean to say that it assumes that QCT revenues stay in this low $3 billion per quarter range?","George S. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Tim, what we've said is that we're assuming that the conditions of the second half of fiscal 2015 continue. And so you can \u2013 but saying I'm not going to guide 2016 revenues.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys. You've said in the past that you may consider acquisitions in order to grow to the markets. The fact that there is a business change as well as a big restructuring plan and you need to deal with all these issues, does it mean that they're going to put any M&A aspirations on the back burner more and focus internally on the other things you announced? So that's question number one.","And question number two, when I calculate the implied price for MSM, what are the puts and takes this quarter when it comes to the price? I'm trying to reconcile your verbal comments with the price change. That is not very different from what we expected. So what are the puts and takes there? And then what's your best guess \u2013 again, not in terms of numbers, but in terms of the drivers \u2013 what's your best guess for what's going to impact this implied price in the coming quarters? Thanks.","Steven M. Mollenkopf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Tal, this is Steve. I'll give my answer to the first one. Perhaps my colleagues can jump in on the second one. With regards to M&A, we obviously have CSR outstanding and getting to the point soon here where we hope to be talking about that as something that influences earnings, obviously something that's accretive to our fiscal year 2016 plan.","I don't think we've made a change in terms of our M&A stance. I will say that when we look at the management team and what we're focused on, we're very focused on delivering this cost plan. I think right now, we look at that and we say that really positions the business in a way that will really benefit the shareholders and drive value. So that's what we're focused on.","George S. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Tal, on the revenue per MSM in the third quarter, you're right. It wasn't terribly different than expectations as the quarter pretty much on an operating basis came in where we thought it would. But you did see higher MSMs. Those are really part of the story of us having stronger than expected share in the low tier in China in the third quarter. That just created a little bit weaker mix. We're actually seeing some of that. As we said, we expect to see lower low-tier volumes in China in Q4. That was already in our forecast in our prior guidance. So we actually get a little bit of mix benefit in the fourth quarter even though overall it's not as strong as we would have thought because we had a much better premium tier mix in our original expectations.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So I just had two. I guess the first one is back to the MSM chip unit guidance. Even once you reconcile this back, the difference between the guidance and last quarter or this quarter you just reported, we're still flat quarter on quarter, which is abnormal seasonality. Typically in fiscal Q4, you see unit volumes on MSM up. And it doesn't sound like, even after all the reconciliation, you're expecting that. So I just wanted to just ask you guys if you could talk a little bit about why the seasonality is somewhat abnormal this year. Is it a demand issue? What's going on with seasonality once you make all the adjustments?","And then the second thing I want to ask you is maybe just a little bit longer-term question, which is we know about the vertical integration into one ODM. I'm just curious. What probability, Steve, would you assign to further vertical integration, especially up in the high tier? Thanks.","George S. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So on the seasonality, again, I think the effects that we're seeing in the marketplace of concentration and again, as we said, the pullback in unit share that we're seeing in the low tier in China, I think those things dominate our view of the MSM situation I think much more than the seasonality adjustment would explain.","Steven M. Mollenkopf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","This is Steve. My view on the vertical aspect, I would argue that what you're seeing was probably more of a product cycle issue versus a general trend. The overall difficulty of delivering MSMs or delivering something like our MSM is actually getting harder. And the same dynamics, particularly with concentration in the industry, the same dynamics that occurred over the last decade and a half to people like Nokia or Motorola with a vertical strategy, I think still happen with chipsets today. So I think I don't see that as a trend that's going forward now. Clearly with our planning assumptions for planning our OpEx, we wanted to put the business in a position where it is less susceptible to those individual design wins, which I think is part of our cost program, but I think it's going to get harder and harder.","The other thing I would note too is that feedback from customers and particularly customers who you may be worried about with respect to vertical aspirations have been strong with respect to our Snapdragon 820 and other designs. So I feel like our roadmap is getting a warm reception broadly, and we just have to continue develop on it and get our cost structure in the right spot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you, gentlemen. I understand the OpEx issue and also the potential split, maybe some consideration for the issue related to the maturing smartphone market and the change, possibly permanent change, in your customers who want to do their own chipsets. So perhaps how Qualcomm can quickly move into new markets to find a home for new chipsets, and are they large enough to replace the substantive smartphone market?","Steven M. Mollenkopf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","This is Steve. I think our challenges are \u2013 the smartphone and the handset business continues to be an attractive market. I think we need to get our profitability up in that opportunity, which is why we're taking these changes to our cost structure and get ahead of what we see happening in the market.","But equally, I think there's significant growth available to us as we leverage the IP roadmap that you develop in smartphone SoCs and take that and really fan that out into a number of new markets. If you look at what's happening across the board from every major consumer electronics industry, they're all trying to embrace the smartphone, and part of what we are doing is moving resources off of the phone space into supporting those new markets. So if we can boost profitability in our home market and take opportunity of these new or take advantage of these new opportunities in adjacent markets, I think we'll have the business back on a good track for growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you very much. The cost cuts that you are contemplating for QCT, do they have any effect on the number of foundries that you might consider working with or on future technologies that you might be putting chips currently in design?","Steven M. Mollenkopf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","This is Steve. No, really we're trying to protect our IP roadmap. And obviously with the scale that we have, getting changes and making sure that we're optimal from the supply chain point of view, particularly COGS, is very important in terms of driving value. So we're continuing to protect those opportunities.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Simpson with Arete Research. Please go ahead.","Brett Simpson - Arete Research Services LLP","Thanks very much. You mentioned, Steve, that you won't be withdrawing from certain tiers in QCT. But can you share with us with your business activities on the low end consistently make money as we continue to hear about aggressive price cuts in this segment, particularly in the last couple of quarters? So just can you give your perspective there?","And, George, just following on from the last question, on COGS savings in QCT, that wasn't mentioned as part of the cost review. I'm just wondering whether you think there's an opportunity to improve gross margins in QCT since your scale is way more than any of your rivals and you are diversifying with different foundries. Should we expect any savings at the COGS line? Thank you.","George S. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So let me take the COGS savings question first. We have had, like I said previously, we've had a keen focus on leveraging our scale throughout the industry to make sure that we have competition for the volumes among our foundry partners, and we believe we have a very good roadmap to maximize the cost of our use of that supply chain over time. And we had cited as part of the reason we would be off on margins at the start of this year that we are really coming out of a situation where we had, at 20-nanometer, a less than optimal COGS situation.","That being said, volume matters, and we've seen some of the issues that came with lower than expected volumes, so we're not quite seeing some of the benefits. As volume recovers, we would expect to see that. But the basic structural changes that we need to make in terms of working with a broad range of very capable foundry partners is part of our existing plan, so we're not really making a change to that. That being said, of course, it's critical that we get both margin expansion as well as improvement in the OpEx areas, and we'll be very focused on that. And as we make progress beyond what is in our base plan already, we'll keep you informed.","Steven M. Mollenkopf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Brett, this is Steve. With respect to the low tier, I think the entire industry is actually challenged in terms of making money at the low tier. We're probably in a better position than most because of the ability to leverage our IP roadmap across the tiers. We're making some changes in this realignment plan where we're doing work to try to get the cost per head more in alignment with some of our competitors. But we still think it's an interesting opportunity for us to go after. And as George mentioned, we are assuming that this aggressive price environment continues with respect to our planning assumption on the realignment plan.","So we're probably better than most in terms of where we're going, and we think it's an important market to contribute in. It will also be a market that will move more toward 4G. Today, it is split between 3G single-mode. It will move to multi-mode 4G, which should advantage us worldwide. We just need to get ourselves better set up to address it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research. Please go ahead.","Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.","Thank you very much. There have been several mentions of a more focused look at expanding into markets that are already in prices you have or very closely adjacent products you are going to develop. It seems to make sense. Where does that put you on the RF side of the business? I know RF360 has been a big initiative for you for the last several years, and you're still working on that. Does that change your view of moving into that vertical?","And then in terms of investment in QTL, I know that you put out a notice about more regulatory action from Europe. What's your thinking now on the settlement you had in China spreading to other geographies? Although the laws are different, it seems like there's still a lot of interest from other regulatory agencies in maybe changing Qualcomm's licensing agreements. If you can comment on that, I'd appreciate it. Thank you.","Steven M. Mollenkopf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Ed, this is Steve. The opportunity to grow content in the device we think still exists, particularly in an environment where the LTE band proliferation continues to be very wide. We're actually quite pleased with the RF360. It's still early days. I think we have something like 350 OEM designs already on the parts, and we think that that will build over time as we start to add more capability. But the environment for growing content in the phone we still think is a good opportunity for us.","Derek K. Aberle - President","Ed, this is Derek. On the regulatory question, actually the European Union investigations that were I think announced this last week or so, really it's just a new phase of the proceeding, and it's still relatively early in their process. But it's focused really not on the licensing program of the company. It's really focused on chipset pricing and rebate type agreements. So again, as we look at it, we've commented on this quite a bit over the last couple of calls. We do believe that the result in China is unique to China. And although we could very well have other regulatory proceedings to deal with, we're very confident in our ability to defend against those.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with CLSA Securities. Please go ahead.","Srini R. Pajjuri - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you, just a question on the China comment. You said it's taking a little longer than expected to improve the collections. I'm just curious. What actions, if any, can you take locally in China to improve collections going forward?","Derek K. Aberle - President","This is Derek. Actually, there are a couple of drivers here. As we said coming out of the resolution with NDRC, we were going to need to go through this process of offering new terms to our licensees. We're getting pretty far along in that process. We've made progress. But as we noted last time, this is going to take some time, and it's a bit hard to predict. We've given you our best view on the timing of when we'll be able to conclude agreements. But some of these things take a bit longer than others, and so that's going to probably have some impact. We now think that just pushing some units out of our fiscal year into next year that we thought we may be able to get earlier, but again, it's not a change in our view as to whether we'll be able to ultimately collect royalties on those units. It's just more a question of timing.","So really the process is to get these new agreements in place and get companies that were previously unlicensed for three-mode devices signed up. And again, we're going through that process now and have companies that have signed agreements and are reporting royalties to us now on three-mode, but we still have some work to do there. And then beyond that, it's a lot of the things we've talked about in the past in terms of ratcheting up the level of auditing and compliance activities in China. And ultimately, if necessary, which we always try to do everything we can to avoid this, but if we have to, enforcing the terms of our contracts that are in place there. So we're going through that process now, and we'll be updating you as we continue to progress there.","Operator","This ends our allotted time for questions and answers. Mr. Mollenkopf, do you have anything further to add before adjourning the call?","Steven M. Mollenkopf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'd like to thank everyone for being on the call today. We are excited about our growth prospects, and the major initiatives announced today will put us in an even better position to lead the next wave of growth for the company and our industry and enhance value for our stockholders. Implementation of the plan is underway, and I look forward to updating you on our progress on a regular basis.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

The playback reservation number is 38395118.","I would now like to turn the call over to John Sinnott, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sinnott, please go ahead.","John Sinnott","Thank you and good afternoon everyone. Today's call will include prepared remarks by Steve Mollenkopf, Derek Aberle and George Davis. In addition, Cristiano Amon and Don Rosenberg will join the question-and-answer session. You can access our earnings release and a slide presentation that accompany this call on our investor relations website. This call is also being webcast on qualcomm.com, and a replay will be available on our website later today.","During the call today, we will use non-GAAP financial measures, as defined in Regulation G. And you can find the related reconciliations to GAAP on our website. We will also make forward-looking statements, including projections and estimates of future events, business, or industry trends, or our business or financial results. Actual events or results could differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q, which contain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.","And now, the comments from Qualcomm's Chief Executive Officer, Steve Mollenkopf.","Steve Mollenkopf","Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to first take a few minutes to discuss the performance of the company both in the quarter and against our longer term goals before providing my perspective on the legal and regulatory matters impacting the company. I'm very pleased that in the time of these external challenges our employees are executing well on our expansion into new opportunities and at the same time improving the competitive strength and profitability of our industry leading product.","We reported fiscal third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share and revenues consistent with our revised guidance and above the guidance range midpoint driven by better than expected product mix in our semiconductor business. Our QCT business is executing very well with profitability up both sequentially and year-over-year. QCT has now delivered improved year-over-year quarterly profitability for five consecutive quarters on the strong execution, as we have continued to refresh our product roadmap, delivered improved product cost and grow EBT margins despite the impact of second sourcing at Apple over this same time period.","In Mobile, QCT continues to see strength in the highly competitive China region and is executing well across all price gears. Our gigabit LTE and 5G leadership combined with our Snapdragon 835 and new Snapdragon 600 product are well ahead of our competitive solutions. We continue to see good traction in our QCT adjacent opportunities of automotive, networking, mobile compute and IoT, where our efforts deliver, our technologies are gaining momentum.","We saw a strong revenue growth in those adjacent businesses in fiscal 2016 and forecast growth of more than 25% in fiscal 2017. As reflected in our fourth quarter MSM guidance, we expect QCT's strong performance to continue. We are ramping investments necessary to extend our leadership position in 5G as operators and customers seek to accelerate their launch date.","We now believe that both millimeter ways and sub-6 gigahertz capability will be table stakes for 2019 5G launches. The modem technology and complexity is increasing and we believe we can continue to outperform our competitors with our level of 5G innovation. It is clear that our technology position and product roadmap are strong as they have ever been.","In addition, we believe the pending NXP acquisition will provide us greater scale in automotive IoT security and networking with their highly complementary product and world class sales channel, serving the long tale of customers that are driving growth. The combined company will be a technology and semiconductor leader with future annual revenues projected to be more than $30 billion.","The NXP transaction remains on track to close by the end of calendar 2017. We have regulatory clearance in four jurisdictions including here in the U.S. and Taiwan and we continue to make progress in our work with regulators in five remaining regions.","In QTL, third quarter results and fourth fiscal quarter guidance reflect the impact of our dispute with Apple and the licensee dispute that we disclosed last quarter. Despite the near term financial impact to our business by the actions of a small number of powerful industry players, the long-term outlook for our licensing business continues to remain strong. With more than 300 freely negotiated global license agreements and a technology portfolio that is fundamental to the performance of wireless and mobile computing devices today and for many years to come. The licensing business will continue to be a significant revenue and profitability generator for the company longer term.","Moreover it is important to remember that 3G, 4G device trends which are a key driver of QTL financial performance remain very healthy. We are forecasting 3G, 4G device shipments to grow by approximately 6% in calendar 2017. The long-term growth outlook for units combined with moderating ASP decline, are consistent with our prior expectations for longer term globally 3G, 4G device sales growth.","Turning to the current legal matter, we believe we hold the high ground with regard to the dispute with Apple. We will take the actions that are needed and appropriately defend the tremendous value that our innovations bring to this industry, innovations which enable a competitive ecosystem to thrive. You have now seen some of the steps we have taken in our dispute with Apple, including the filing of patented actions in the U.S. ITC and in U.S. and Germany court to address the use of our unlicensed IP in their devices.","We do not take these challenges lightly and we are focused on achieving the right long-term results for the licensing business, which also is in the best interest of our stockholders. We know that fundamentally these issues are driven by commercial interests and contract negotiations and we will continue to work to reach resolutions as we have done in the past.","As you know, we have a strong relationship with Apple for many years and they have been a long standing and valued customer. We intend to continue to provide them with our industry leading products and technologies as we always have and do our best to remain a good supplier to Apple even while this dispute continues.","Derek will provide further detail on the actions we have taken in connection with our dispute with Apple as well as the specific steps we have taken in the other matters to defend the value of our innovations and our business model.","Looking ahead, our innovations driven by decades our R&D investments are at the forefront of multiple new industries and product categories. Our intellectual property as never been more valuable and relevant and opportunities ahead for Qualcomm have never been greater. Our breadth of technologies and products continues to benefit from our ongoing strategy to invest ahead of the industry and combined with our global scale and partnerships, we are extremely well positioned to grow into an expanding step of new opportunity.","Further with the pending NXP acquisition we will further accelerate our move into these exciting industries. I will now turn the call over to Derek.","Derek Aberle","Thank you, Steve and good afternoon, everyone. QTL fiscal third quarter revenues were $1.2 billion with earnings before tax as $854 million. As Steve mentioned, QTL fiscal third quarter results reflect non-payment of royalties on Apple products by Apple's contract manufacturers, as well as the non-payment of royalties by the licensee with which we have a dispute that was disclosed last quarter.","During the fiscal second quarter, the licensee reported and paid only a portion of the royalties it owed under its license agreement and at that time, we expected the licensee to continue to report and pay sum, but not all of the royalties they owe for the fiscal third quarter. Although, we remain in discussions with this licensee in an effort to resolve the dispute, the licensee did not report or pay any royalties during the fiscal third quarter.","This is a dispute as per the terms of the licensee's existing agreement that is similar to a number of the ones we have resolved in the past and we expect to be able to do that again here. With Apple's contract manufacturers refusing to fully report their total reported device sales for Apple products and the licensee with which we have a dispute also with holding reporting, we are not providing quarterly actuals or guidance for total reported device sales and related unit shipments and ASPs by our licensee. Because the significant portion of quarterly activity is not available and would not be included in those metric, making them incomplete in a limited value.","We are however, providing quarterly QTL revenue guidance to help our investors model our expectations for the licensing business going forward. Despite the near term impact of these items, which we believe we will be able to resolve over time to QTL financial performance it is important to note that 3G, 4G global sales and device trends remain very positive.","For fiscal 2017, global 3G, 4G handset ASPs continue to track consistent with our prior expectations of low single digit percentage declines year-over-year. Global ASP trends continue to be strong this year with ASPs continuing to increase in China and for devices sold by Chinese OEMs globally. We also continue to see healthy growth in global device sales for the fiscal year, consistent with our longer term growth expectations of mid-single digit annual percentage increases.","For calendar 2017 3G, 4G device shipments, we continue to estimate shipment of 1.75 billion to 1.85 billion devices globally, up approximately 6% year-over-year at the midpoint. Our licensing and compliance initiatives remain on track and continue to bear fruit. Excluding the effect of the underreporting caused by the disputes with Apple and its contract manufacturers as well as the licensee I just described which we do not view as compliance issue. We estimate that the level of compliance by our licensees were sales during the March was in line with sales by our licensees during the December quarter.","As you have seen from our recent announcements, we continue to actively pursue resolutions of the challenges to our licensing business that have been orchestrated by a few of the most profitable and powerful companies in the world. And to defend a well-established value of our patented technologies in the regulatory and other legal matters in which we are involved. And our appeal of the Korean FTC decision hearings were held last week in the Seoul High Court on our motion to say that remedial portion of the KFTC's order while we proceed with the appeal. We expect to get a decision on the request per se in the coming month.","The U.S. FTC lawsuit is on track to be tried at the beginning of 2019. We look forward to demonstrating that many of the facts are wedged in the complaint are wrong. And the FTC's legal theories are without merit. As to the Taiwan FTC investigations, we continue to work to find a resolution and we are continuing to cooperate with the TFTC. We also continue to work through additional investigations in Europe. However, those investigations do not target Qualcomm's licensing business or practices.","Finally as Steve mentioned, we have now filed patent infringement complaints against Apple with both the International Trade Commission and in Federal Court in the US. The six patents are assorted in those actions enable high performance in a variety of areas of the smartphone while extending battery life. Each of the patents does so in a different way for different popular smartphone features. While the technologies covered by the patents are central for the performance of the iPhone including internal performance, graphics, higher data rates and network capacity, flashless boot and power management.","The assorted patents are not essential to practice any standards in a mobile device or subject to a commitment to offer to license those patents. We expect that the ITC investigation will commence in August and that the case will be tried next year. We expect the Federal Court case to trail the ITC action will be stayed pending the conclusion of the ITC act.","This week we also filed two patent infringement lawsuits in Germany against the Apple seeking damages and injunctive relief for iPhones imported into or sold in Germany. The patents we are asserting in these cases represent two technologies important to iPhone functions. But again they are not standard essential patent and are not subject to end commitments to license those patent.","Similar to the ITC process here in the US, we expect this litigation in Germany will move on a fairly fast timeline with an outcome likely in approximately 12 months. In addition, we have filed a motion asking the Federal Court in San Diego to require Apple's contract manufacturers to comply with the terms of their license agreement with respect to Apple product, while the various cases are heard.","Before it instructed its contract manufacturers to stop paying royalties to Qualcomm, Apple had been indirectly paying royalties on its products based on the contract manufacturer agreement for 10 years. Nothing has changed Apple continues to generate substantial profit by using our technology in the contract manufacturer agreement remain valid. There will be a hearing on that motion in mid-August.","Yesterday, Apple's contract manufacturers responded to our claims against them and the motion I just described. In addition Apple start to oppose our motion in the contract manufacturer cases, as well as to consolidate the contract manufacturer cases with the Apple cases. These filings by Apple and its contract manufacturers prove what we have been saying all along. Apple has interfered with our license agreement with its contract manufacturers by instructing them not to pay the royalties they owe for sales of apple product and then agreed to indemnify and protect the contract manufacturers against any damages and payments they would owe to Qualcomm as a result of Apple instructing them to breach their license agreement.","It is clear that Apple is controlling all of the contract manufacturers\u2019 statement and actions in the litigation. If Apple hadn't interfered with the licenses and instructed the contract manufacturers to take these actions, the contract manufacturers would not be contesting the licenses now. It is important to remember that in most cases our license agreements were negotiated and entered into with the contract manufacturers before Apple ever entered the smartphone market. And then Apple decided to rely on them for a decade, before now trying to disrupt them.","One of Apple's claims has been that this is just a dispute about how much they should pay for using our valuable intellectual property and that they have stopped paying because, they don't know how much to pay us. This is quite obviously wrong. As I just explained the long standing and valid contract manufacturer licenses clearly specify the royalties that are due and payable on Apple products, yet Apple is interfering with those contracts.","Further, we have made several offers to Apple to have an independent third-party result of parties best agreement over the value of Qualcomm's technology and set the royalty terms of a direct license between Qualcomm and Apple once in for all. Apple has refused those offers each time, which shows they are more interested in pursuing the strategy the way rather than good paid resolution.","We will continue to vigorously defend the value of our innovation and our pro-competitive business model. Turning to our datacenter business, we remain on track for commercial shipments of the Qualcomm Centriq 2400 processor family by the end of the calendar year and we have already shipped more than 1000 evaluation platforms to leading customers and partners.","We continue to be very encouraged by the engagement with and feedback from a variety of our growing list of customers and partners as to the performance of our product. In parallel, we are working hard to continue to build the datacenter ecosystem for Centriq-based server. This quarter we announced the collaboration with Packet a leading bare metal cloud provider to deliver a consumable cloud platform based on the Qualcomm Centriq 2400 processor for access by the software development community.","We demonstrated with Canonical a highly scalable OpenStack NFV infrastructure running on a Qualcomm Centriq 2400 platform. And we announced the collaboration with MariaDB to implement MariaDB's enterprise grade, database architecture on the Qualcomm Centriq 2400 processor to drive performance and compute that scale.","That concludes my comments. And I will now turn the call over to George.","George Davis","Thank you, Derek and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report a solid fiscal third quarter consistent with our revised expectations. Revenues were $5.4 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.83. Our results were above the midpoint of guidance driven by better than expected QCT results on higher revenue and stronger margins. QCT EBT margin was 14.2% for the quarter at the high-end of expectations driven by favorable mobile product mix. We are continuing to see strong traction in QCT adjacent opportunities with quarterly revenues from these areas in total up approximately 30% year-over-year. As a reminder our adjacent opportunities include our chip sales into automotive IoT networking and compute.","In QCT MSM shipments were 187 million up 4% sequentially and modestly below the midpoint of our expectations, on softness in mid and low tier devices. In QTL, revenues were $1.2 billion largely in line with expectations. Consistent with our revised guidance, the quarter was negatively impacted by our dispute with Apple, as they instructed their contract manufacturers to not fully report and to not pay royalties due on sales of Apple products.","In addition, we did not report QTL revenues from the ongoing dispute with the licensee that we disclosed last quarter, as that entity did not report or pay royalties this quarter. Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses overall this quarter were up 6% sequentially, which was above our prior guidance of up 3% at the midpoint.","Our prior guidance reflected the impact of a full quarter of the RF360 joint venture spending being included in our results. The increase in spend relative to our original expectations was driven by higher than expected litigation expenses, as actions related to our dispute with Apple escalated and from accelerating investment related to pending 5G trials and related technology development.","We believe these priorities are critical for value creation and preservation, but are contributing to higher than model spending in the near-term, which we will address as we get through this period. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 5%, reflecting the prior period impact of our revised April guidance of a full year non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 14%. As a reminder, our effective tax rate is influenced by the mix of onshore and offshore earnings. The result of a lower mix of licensing revenues which are onshore impacts that a full U.S. rate is a reduction to our overall blended tax rate.","Turning to our balance sheet, in May we issued $11 billion of debt in the capital market. The funds from this offering will be used to finance a portion of our proposed acquisition of NXP and for general corporate purposes. With this financing, we have now completed our prefunding for the NXP transaction.","We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $38 billion and total debt outstanding of $22 billion. Our non-GAAP operating cash flow in the fiscal third quarter, which excludes the impact of the KFTC fine and the BlackBerry arbitration was approximately $2 billion or 39% of non-GAAP revenue. As a reminder, while a charge related to the KFTC fine was recorded on our income statement in our fiscal first quarter and the charge related to the BlackBerry arbitration was recorded in our fiscal second quarter. The related cash payments for both were made in our fiscal third quarter.","Through our fiscal third quarter, we have returned approximately $3.4 billion to stockholders this fiscal year, including $2.4 billion in dividends paid and $1 billion in share repurchases. This is consistent with our continued commitment to the dividend program and dividend growth and our intent to repurchase shares to offset dilution.","Turning to our fiscal fourth quarter guidance, we estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $5.4 billion to $6.2 billion down approximately 6% year-over-year at the midpoint. Our revenue and EPS estimates exclude QTL revenues for Apple related products and for the other licensee in dispute. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share in our fiscal fourth quarter to be approximately $0.75 to $0.85 per share.","We expect fiscal fourth quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be approximately 1% to 3% sequentially driven primarily by increased litigation related expenses and 5G investment. As Derek explained, we are providing guidance for QTL's segment revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter, which we expect to be in the range of $1.0 billion to $1.3 billion. We expect QTL's EBT margin percentage to decrease sequentially and be between 64% and 68% reflecting lower revenues at the midpoint and increase litigation related expenses as we continue to defend our business model in various forms.","Turning to QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments in the fiscal fourth quarter of approximately 205 million to 225 million units up 15% sequentially at the midpoint driven by OEM product launches and continued traction with OEMs in China. We expect QCT EBT margin to be approximately 17% to 19% in the fiscal fourth quarter increasing from 16.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 favorable mobile product mix and growth in adjacent opportunities year-over-year.","For our Snapdragon 835 premium tier chipset, we expect to supply of 10 nanometer to largely meet demand in the fiscal fourth quarter consistent with our prior expectations. We expect that interest expense will be up sequentially in the fiscal fourth quarter reflecting a full quarter's impact related to the $11 billion of debt issued in late May. For fiscal 2017 overall, we now expect the combination of investment and other income and interest expense to be roughly flat versus fiscal 2016.","Lower interest income year-over-year has been supplemented with gains on the sale of higher risk assets in our portfolio, as we move into highly liquid short-term investments in preparation for funding the NXP acquisition.","That concludes my comments and I'll now turn the call back to John.","John Sinnott","Thank you, George. Operator, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","Mike Walkley","Thank you very much. Just really trying to get a clarification, so for the licensing dispute outside of Apple, can you just walk us through what from that licensee maybe was included in your Q3 results and what's excluded for Q4 guidance maybe you can help us on a sequential basis, just on that licensee maybe in ballpark that dealt between Q3 and Q4? Thank you.","Derek Aberle","Hey Mike, this is Derek. So, I think when we reported last quarter, we had some amount of revenue from that licensee in Q2, but it was an underpayment, they didn't pay the full amount. And we at that time had expected Q3 to include an underpayment, but include some payment. And basically the way things turned out, they did not report or pay anything for Q3 and that's consistent with the way that we have guided for Q4. So, basically both of the quarters exclude any revenue from the licensee that's in dispute.","George Davis","Mike, hi it's George. Let me just add to that, I think one of the things that we've seen people struggle with is, the - there is no constant since this is an individual OEM. So in Q2 going to Q3 is typically a step down in the level of revenues and then you have a seasonal uptick picking up for Q3 and Q4. So, I think it\u2019s going to be hard to model a flat level of impact. And so it's one of the reasons why in the guidance for this quarter we guided QTL revenue overall, because we understand using the old method of trying to get their TRDS's can be too difficult.","Operator","Our next question is from Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Rod Hall","Yes great, thanks guys. I guess, I had one clarification and one question. So, I wanted to on that last question with regards to this licensee, it looks like, I mean are detailed your guidance deviating another 100 million from what we were forecasting and even though I get that you guys don't want us forecasting or it\u2019s hard to forecast using your methodologies most of our models to run that way. So, I'm just wondering, can you give us any idea whether the full with holding us payments from that licensee is in the ballpark of say $250 million or something like that? Just so we can think about what the deviation from our model looking forward might be? And then, the real question I've got is on the European review NXPI that's moved a full review, can you, Derek could you just give us any color on what is happening there, why reportedly anyway you guys have not decided not to go along with remedies that have been suggested and now we are into a more detailed review, was that always the expectation in Europe or has something changed in regards to your discussions with the regulators there. So could you just give us a little bit more color on what's happening there? Thanks.","George Davis","So hey Rod, let me comment. I think one of the things I would remind people as they look at particularly the year-over-year comparisons for the licensing business, both in Q3 and Q4 comparatively. We saw good market underlying market in both of those, so there is no the - any shortfall in your estimates are not really related to the market. What we saw is there was catch up from the settlement of Chinese agreement in Q3 and Q4 of 16 that are impacting year-over-year comparisons. And so, one of the things that the models would need to show is the lower catch up in Q1 or should be in Q4 up 17 relative to 16. And then the rest is really just Apple and the other licensee and the impact of the specific dollars related to those OEMs. But those are really the only factors impacting the underlying estimate.","Derek Aberle","Hey Rod, this is Derek, let me just add that, our practice historically has been not to disclose the identity of licensees when we're trying to resolve dispute and it hasn't yet gone to litigation. And so, we're going to go ahead and stick to that practice and so, we're not going to give specific color on the amount of underpayment coming from any particular licensee. I think one of things just to think about in terms of volume, we have had catch up payment kind of flowing through QTL from prior period sort of quarter-to-quarter, we said that's going to be lumpy and will be hard to predict in coming over time. And there were some those amounts, meaningful amounts in Q3,but I would say the midpoint of our -- QTL revenue in Q4 doesn't really include a significant amount of that so, that maybe another kind of deviation when you look into your model.","Don Rosenberg","And Rod, this is Don. I'll take your question about NXP in Europe. There is not a lot to say about that at all, but phase I process as you know is fairly short. We're dealing with significant acquisition here in both with both the U.S-based company and a major European-based company. So it\u2019s not surprising that we are moving into phase II, we are engaged in phase II, we will listen to any concerns that maybe expressed and we'll respond to them, we think within the time period that should be the normal run of phase II process. Obviously can't predict, but we're very optimistic about our ability to continue to demonstrate the complementary nature of this acquisition with four regulatory approvals already we think - we're on a pretty good track there.","Rod Hall","Great. Okay, thank you guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Kulbinder Garcha","Thank you. My question is for Derek, well just on the dispute with the licensee, which is not, just to be clear not like a regular audit type which is a fundamental disagreement, on the both parties in terms of how the licensing agreement how that is being interpreted. So, this may come last for some time is that the right way of thinking about it?","And the second question is, in a world in which the smartphone market in revenue terms is building up growing very much, I would say 2% or 3%, if Apple do gain meaningful market share in the next two years it's reasonable to assume that even this licensing run rate would contract or the other drivers that we should think about, can we just think there is obviously a super cycle coming up there and Apple getting a lot of share in the [complete process] [ph]? And based on your [Technical Difficulty] these are right way to thinking about it?","Derek Aberle","Kulbinder, this is Derek. I think on the first one, I would characterize it this way, I mean we have -- the dispute we have with this licensee is a dispute over the terms of their agreement, not to just similar to ones that we've had in the past. They've resolved themselves in a variety of different ways historically, some of them, most of them frankly we've been able to resolve through some period of negotiation.","We're still in that phase with this licensee and then you might recall back even just most recently with LG that did escalate even arbitration but, then we were able to resolve it fairly quickly even after the arbitration is to, was resolved. So, I don't think we can predict with any certainty that exact timing, but I don't think it's a full drawn conclusion that this will be something that takes a long time to resolve either. I think it\u2019s highly dependent on the circumstances.","I think you might have some, let me try to reframe kind of the second question, our view, I'll give you some data points to support this is that the license business has the ability to continue to grow with the end market. We see end market growth continuing going forward, once we have these disputes resolved, and, I think even if you look at this quarter, we would have seen year-over-year growth in licensing business that you adjusted for kind of all the anomalies of the disputes and some of the one-time payment.","But, if you step back and look longer term at the end market, the units continue to grow in line with our projections last year, unit growth was about 10% in our current forecast, which were holding in calendar 2017 is about 6% unit growth, and you combine that with the moderating declines in ASPs and we still believe, the TRDS independent of any particular OEM. So even if Apple were to gain share is something that we'll grow in the mid-single digits.","And I think the, the thing that's been very positive for us this year is that ASPs probably a moderating even the ASP declines are moderating even more than we expected meaning the declines are less than we would have expected going into the year. And that's largely being driven by strength in China as well as increasing ASPs by many of the Chinese OEMs as they build their businesses outside of China, which are couple of the important trends that we highlighted starting 2 or 3 years ago of why we believe we would see long term growth in the market. So again, if you wrap that all up end market will continue to grow, we think it can continue to grow meaningful. And we think once we get through these disputes we can continue to grow the licensing business in line with that.","Kulbinder Garcha","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Doug Clark","Thanks. This is Doug Clark on behalf of Simona. One follow-up question to kind of the historical context of disputes with some licensees, I mean putting all of those together is there any generalization or kind of role that you've come to notice as a result of the resolution of these disputes they've either resulted in kind of deflationary to the royalty rate or as in certain cases you've been able to hold those royalty rate constant. I want to know if there is kind of any conclusion that you've drawn from those.","Derek Aberle","Doug, this is Derek. It's pretty hard to answer, in kind of at a high level. I think each individual deal is different, I would say through any of the negotiations and dispute resolutions we -- I think we've been successful historically and obtaining, what we believe is a fair value for the portfolio. Some of those deals have taken different forms and different structures over the years, but I think by enlarge, that sort of the principle that we operate by, it's the same principle that we operated by as we resolved the remaining agreements we negotiated in China over the last couple of years and it\u2019s really the same principle that we'll be applying to our dispute with Apple as we look for trying to achieve the right long-term agreement for the company and consistent with the value of our intellectual property.","Doug Clark","Okay. Got it. And then my follow up question is, as we move to kind of the key market product launches particularly upcoming iPhone, have any of the disputes in your opinion had any impact on how share will shakeout from a chipset standpoint?","Cristiano Amon","Hi Doug, this is Cristiano. Look I think we had said, I think the things go back in time that we have planned for multi-sourcing. And I think at this time, I think what we see will continue to be engaged with them on the product side, we feel very confident about, I think the capability of the product, I would argue that generation-to-generation our differentiation is actually increasing. And right now we see continue to receive orders from the CMs. So, I don't think we can at this point identify anything different than what we have been expecting.","Doug Clark","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","James Faucette","Great. Thank you very much. Firstly Don, I know you touched on [Technical Difficulty] how since the NXPI acquisition was announced or the intension to acquire NXPI, how are your conversation with kind of these opportunity with [Technical Difficulty]? Thanks.","Don Rosenberg","Hi, this is Don. So, on your NXP question to remind you there were nine jurisdictions originally that had to approve, we've -- as I said had four approved the U.S, Mexico, Russia and Taiwan, those that are left are the EU, China, Japan, South Korea and Philippine. We are proceeding in each case by engaging with the regulatory bodies and each to a restriction we are, we think on track in terms of following their processes and as we've indicated, Steve indicated earlier, we expect that the timeline as we've outlined it will continue and we're shooting for the end of 17. And I don't think there is really, there is really much to say about those other regulatory bodies other than that, as I said we're cooperating with them and haven't seen any issues at the moment.","Steve Mollenkopf","James, this is Steve. I would say the discussions with the customers have been good, I mean obviously we have limitations, since that agreed to which we can have discussion given that we are pretty close. I've been pretty pleased with what we are hearing with respect to kind of the industrial logic behind the deal. So some of the -- the, I think the bringing together of the Qualcomm IP roadmap and technology roadmap to the channel of and the broader portfolio of products at auto has been, I think positively received by the customers as far as my discussions. And I think also the, importance of increasing the scale and the channel in the IoT spaces is definitely being validated in terms of our view of the market. And, I think also if you look at the last two quarters of the product business here for us, it really seems to be headed in the same direction, or headed in a way that is consistent with the industrial logic behind the acquisition, which is that, has things get connected, you're going to start to see more overlap in terms of the required technologies across these business. I think that's actually good for the end markets and we've been hearing comments consistent with that from the customer.","So, we're planning for, actually planning for the integration and working through the regulatory issues and moving quickly before the closing at the end of the year, before the end of the year.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets.","Tim Long","If we could maybe switch over to the chip business, George you mentioned in the guidance for MSMs next quarter some product launches and China strength, it's a little bit of more stronger than normal seasonal. So, could you talk a little bit about were, was inventory a little low heading in, China has been a pretty touch end market so far this year, so do you think there is going to be a turnaround in the business there, is there is market share, is it more exports. So maybe talk a little bit about that strength and maybe sustainability and then related to that, I would assume that we might be up for a little bit weaker of ASP calculated in that division in the September quarter? Thank you.","Cristiano Amon","Hi Tim, this is Cristiano. Look I think, it's probably important to understand the trends in China market. China has been a growth, strong story for us and I think we see that continuing. So, first your point about what we thought about the product mix, I think we see the market moving up and we see that consistently, we saw that, the ASP market matures, they pierced on the devices we see higher low freights in the higher tiers than in the lower tiers. And I think Snapdragon 600 and the Snapdragon 800 are doing very well; in particularly the Snapdragon 600 has been a very good story for us. When you ask about the going forward, I would maybe remind you we -- we've said in the past about things like Al Mode in caraggregation now 70% of every single device in China is Al Mode 4G plus is now well understood by consumer as a caraggregation. And we speak things, moving towards higher speeds both on our integrated WiFi as well as cellular leading to gigabit LTE. And I think 5G is likely going to be one of the largest market that China would not want to be behind all the other economies. So, I think the story in China is very good. In your last point about growth, we saw the top ten Chinese OEMs, which I think that we are very well-positioned going aggressively outside China. And I think that is enabling our China business to grow faster than the market. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Ross Seymore","I have two questions. The first one on the OpEx side of the equation, George, obviously the litigation coming in [to the extent] [ph] so why the spending will be a bit higher in the quarter and the guide? But, the other side of the equation the 5G acceleration, can you talk a little bit about the sustainability of that, is it kind of last for a couple of quarters and then fall-off generally the strategy behind that.","And then, the second question I had was on the NXT deal, the regulatory environment a lot of people have asked about that roadmap. But, I'm receiving a lot of questions with people debating that the price that you paid given the move in the semiconductor market may appear to be low. So, I was wondering if we could just get your thoughts on the price that you guys have agreed upon with NXT.","George Davis","Ross, let me start with the OpEx question. Clearly, as you said we are escalating the activity with respect to litigation and so that you will continue to see growth in the spend there. But, on the 5G side and I may have Cristiano add some thoughts on this as well. We are seeing polling of activity by customers. And the number of trials increasing and we feel is very important to be seen and continue to be seen as leading those activities of course and on top of that that just means that the roadmap for 5G is getting pulled in more rapidly.","So, it's not clear to me that this is a one or two quarter type event, I think we are going to see some elevated spending here over the next year to two as we get through these 5G trials and the beginning of commercial 5G launches. I will stop there for a minute and Cristiano if you want to add something.","Cristiano Amon","No. I'm just going to say that I think more and more we see 19 as a reality for 5G commercialization.","George Davis","Great. Thanks. And then, on the NXT deal, I will just reemphasize, our focus is really on the regulatory matters and getting those closed out along with the integration planning and we are confident we are going to go ahead and close this on the terms that we've agreed to by year-end.","Ross Seymore","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.","Tal Liani","Hi. Few questions, first, puts and takes if you can discuss puts and takes of gross margin of QTL next quarter? And is there anything outside of lower revenue of level in the litigation expense? That's number one.","And then, the second question is, now you lost big QCT business with your largest customer Apple. You lost -- there are some disputes with one of your largest customers on licensing. And the question is, does it will make more sense now to break up the company into two pieces or you are in the same position as before. I want to understand if you think there is any correlation between your ability to maximize the value of each segment separately in light of these disputes and these arguments with customers? Thanks.","George Davis","Tal, its George. What you are seeing in the gross margin effect or really the margin effect that we guided for QTL is really revenue and revenue coming down based on these disputes that we have discussed actually the market is quite healthy, so all the other dynamics are very attractive. And then, the fact that we are ramping spending into that lower revenue for litigation matters. So, its combination of the two just pulled the margin down. It's not like a product business where you have a variable cost as revenue comes down where your cost come down. So, this one where until we get through this period of higher litigation spending and the dispute period, you will see lower than historic but the fundamentals behind the business outside of these disputes are quite attractive.","George Davis","It's also Steve with respect to the business structure, I think we have looked at it pretty heavily in the past and it's still an area that we look at as the environment changes and make sure that we are -- we are making sure that we are putting the business in the right place to maximize value. But, at this point I think we feel like we have the right structure to resolve this dispute as well as the position the business for the future in terms of the transition into 5G as well as the growth into driving the cellular roadmap into new technology areas or new end opportunities.","So, again, we look at this from time to time, continue to look at it the way to maximize value but I think we feel like we have the right business structure to resolve it.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Stacy Rasgon","Here are my questions. First, regarding this other licensee dispute, is it safe to say that this other dispute is not with the Chinese OEM given that you have already settled with the large Chinese OEMs, or is that not a leap of logic that it would be appropriate for me to make?","Secondly, given the escalation here and given everything else has been going on, how do we gain conviction that we don't see further contagion, further spreading of this to other customers given this as soon as we bleeding out across the rest of your business?","Derek Aberle","Stacy, this is Derek. As I said in response to an earlier question, we are not going to at this point disclose the identity of the licensee that we have the dispute with. So, not going to comment on that one further.","I think on the question of contagion, if you think about we are working very hard across a number of fronts to really stabilize the regulatory environment and that remains a priority for us. Historically, we've had disputes with licensees large and small going back all the way to even with Nokia where they had 40% to 50% of the market and we are not being as for a period of time and that did not translate into our other licensees stopping payment. That's just one data point. But, as we sit here we are focused on resolving the issues we have, the current dispute with the licensee beyond. Apple is focused on their agreement, the contract dispute under their agreement. We are going to focus on getting those things resolved and I don't think as we sit here, we have any indication that that this somehow going to result in the bunch of other licensees deciding not to report and pay royalty.","Stacy Rasgon","But, you never have any indication do you?","Derek Aberle","If we didn't ever know -- which you ever know, but I'm saying historically -- if you look at it historically we haven't had that problem as we had disputes, we have been able to work through and resolve them without other licensees necessarily just deciding that they are not going to comply with their agreements. So, I think that's the best we can tell you at this point.","Stacy Rasgon","But that's exactly what's happening right now, isn't it?","Derek Aberle","No. That's not what's happening. We have a dispute with Apple and their contract manufacturers and we have dispute with one other licensee.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Please go ahead with your question.","Vijay Rakesh","Thanks guys. Just going back on that other licensee, am I need to understand that it went from a partial non-payment to a full non-payment for the next quarter, is that what you are assuming in the guide?","And on the Apple side, with the new litigation that you announced which is non-spend IT, can you give us some timelines from that, how does that stand? Thanks.","George Davis","This is George. I will take the first question. Our guide in Q3 assumed a partial payment which we did not receive and we assume no payment or report in Q4 guidance.","Don Rosenberg","And this is Don. On the -- I think you are referring to the two in the U.S. that we brought, and one recently in Germany. As we've said before the ITC case in the U.S. generally takes about 18 months, so we are hoping it will stay along that timeline. The cases in Germany could go as quickly as one year. But, obviously every case is somewhat different, but that's a good estimate, I would say.","Vijay Rakesh","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead with your question.","Romit Shah","Thank you very much. George just want to follow up on Rod's question regarding the NXT deal, with semiconductor stocks broadly up 30% to 40% since you announced your intension to buy the company. There has been uncertainty more recently on just whether or not you will get the 80% approval.","And I know you are confident but I'm just curious like what's the -- how is the process work if you were to reevaluate your offer price. Would you only do so after the shareholders have voted or does it work differently?","George Davis","Romit, I will just repeat, really our focus is on getting through regulatory and getting prepared for the close of the end of the year. I think everything else here is just speculation and I'm not going to comment further.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.","Tavis McCourt","I think my question have a couple. First one into to make sure that the closing of the TDK joint venture, did the June quarter have a full quarter of revenues and cost from that, or is that just partial? And then, Derek, I think you mentioned in the answer to a previous question if there were some catch-up payments in the Q3 QTL revenues, can you dimensionalize that or give us an indication that if you back those out, it would be pretty similar to their Q4 guide.","And then, a question I guess for Steve, I think there was a lawsuit threat by Intel during the quarter related to Windows 10 and X80 simulation and I'm just wondering as it moved beyond a threat and does it change your opinion on that in market opportunity for you? Thanks.","Steve Mollenkopf","On the -- for the third quarter we had a full quarter of the TDK joint venture. It\u2019s ever since they are gone, on the catch-up payments they were, for Q3 I don't think we gave a specific number. They were meaningful and I think the way to think about the guide on Q4 is that the midpoint for the QTL revenue guidance, it doesn't have significant amount of catch-ups. So if you kind of look at it, quarter-over-quarter Q3 to Q4 relatively flat based on our guide. But, you are coming off a Q3 that had some meaningful catch up in it.","George Davis","And with respect to the lawsuit and I think it was actually just a press report that I had heard and I think if anything, if I remember correctly wasn't directly toward us, it is probably directed toward the customers and the ecosystem involved in the PC space. We haven't heard anything about that since then. I will say that we are actively engaged with customers who are interested in that opportunity and that opportunity is coming here per the schedule that we gave in the past. So, it's a -- I think it is building some excitement, and we are pretty excited about what we are seeing there.","Operator","This ends our allotted time for questions and answers. Mr. Mollenkopf, do you have anything further to add before adjourning the call?","Steve Mollenkopf","Yes. Thank you. First of all, I just want to thank all the employees for their hard work and maybe I will finish up with four final thoughts. The first one is, given the environment that we are in just want to recognize and thank everybody for the strong results on the product side. It's really an indication of the strategy playing forward and we are pleased to see the results here in the business.","Second one is the timing of NXT, it's on track. And I think building momentum and looking forward to that happening. We mentioned that on the third point that we are -- we believe we have the high ground on Apple in terms of our legal dispute we obviously ask for some patience in terms of us getting through that. So, we do feel good about our positioning there and hope you will be able to report people or we able to provide status as we report it.","And finally, I just want to acknowledge the team for putting together a great roadmap and consistently showing up not only in the results, but also in some of the 5G excitement.","And with that, I will just close and look forward to talking with you all next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
