[Operator Instructions]","I'd now like to turn the call over to Garrett Gabel, Avery Dennison's Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Garrett Gabel","Thank you, Pemma. Today, we will discuss our preliminary unaudited second quarter results. The non-GAAP financial measures that we use are defined, qualified and reconciled with GAAP on schedules A-4 to A-8 of the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release.","We remind you that we\u2019ll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. These forward-looking statements are made subject to the Safe Harbor statement included in today's earnings release.","On the call today are Mitch Butier, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Lovins, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Also joining us today is Cindy Guenther, how has recently picked up responsibility for the treasury function for the company and will also be resuming her former role as IRO, while I take on the Divisional CFO role for the Label and Graphic Materials segment.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mitch.","Mitchell Butier","Good day, everyone. And Garrett, congratulations on your new role as Head of Finance for LGM, you've done a great job leading Investor Relations and FP&A over the last few quarters. And Cindy, welcome back. Greg and I and the rest of the investment community we're looking forward to partnering with you again.","Cynthia Guenther","Thanks a lot. It\u2019s good to be back.","Mitchell Butier","Now focusing on our results. Q2 was another strong quarter with excellent progress on many strategic fronts in each of our operating segments. Adjusted EPS was up 20% for the quarter, and we raised our earnings guidance to also reflect the 20% increase for the year, reflecting both strong operating performance and a sustainably lower tax rate.","Our continued strong performance speaks the strength of our market positions and the strategic foundations we have laid. LGM, our largest business continued to exhibit strong profitability and solid sales growth.","The transformation in RBS is clearly resonating with customers and delivering solid sales growth, while we accelerate the pace of margin expansion as promised, and we are building a stronger position in IHM, which offers great promise for long-term value creation as we leverage LGM\u2019s strength to target attractive end markets where we are underpenetrated.","As you know, M&A is becoming a more important part of our story as we use it to accelerate our strategy to expand in high-value segments. To that end, we completed two acquisitions in the quarter Yongle, an industrial tapes business in China that serves global markets, and Finesse, a small supply of advanced wound care products in Ireland.","These acquisitions are consistent with our stated strategy, expanding our position in high-growth segments to offer above average profitability and leverage our core capabilities.","Now let me give you the headlines for the last quarter for each of the segments. LGM delivered nearly 7% sales growth ex-currency including the benefit of the Mactac and Hanita acquisitions. Consistent with our strategy, LGM\u2019s high value product lines continue to grow faster than the base business with broad-based strength in specialty and durable labels with modest growth in graphics. We also had modest growth within our base businesses in the quarter.","In aggregate following a strong Q1, the pace of organic topline growth moderated in the quarter. Now we believe this moderation will be short-lived, reflecting a few factors that cause sales to shift into both the first and third quarters. Greg will give more color on that here in a moment.","We do expect a near-term rebound and have in fact already seen a pick-up over the last few weeks. Importantly, particularly in light of the sales contribution from acquisitions, operating margin for the segment remains strong in line with last year's Q2 result.","Shifting now to RBIS. The team delivered outstanding results across the board in Q2. Organic sales growth accelerated the 6% reflecting strong growth of RFID products, as well a solid above market growth for the base business. Adjusted operating margin expanded by an impressive 120 basis points. These strong results reflected success of our business model transformation, becoming more competitive, faster and simpler.","The team continues to execute extremely well on this transformation, enabling market share gains, while driving significant margin expansion. Specifically, we have moved decision making closer to the market and improve local accountability, speed and flexibility for our customers are now competitive advantages and we continue to build a more cost effective cost structure.","And finally, turning to the IHM segment. As mentioned we completed two acquisitions in the quarter, bringing our annual sales run rate to roughly $680 million in this segment. While operating margins will be below our long-term target in the near-term, we continue to see great opportunity for profitable growth in this segment.","For the quarter, operating profit came in line with our expectations with revenue stronger and margins softer than we had anticipated. Organic sales growth for the industrial categories continued a strong pace, offsetting the anticipated sales decline in the healthcare categories. We expect this segment to return to a solid organic growth here in the second half, as we\u2019ve discussed before, as the bulk of these headwinds in the healthcare are now behind us.","Now operating margin declined by four points in the segment, largely reflecting the healthcare category headwinds. While most of this decline was anticipated, we are a bit behind on the productivity front, but I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll overcome these challenges by leveraging the strength of LGM\u2019s execution capabilities.","Coming back to the total company view. We anticipate sequentially stronger growth, both ex-currency and organically, as we move into the second half the year with healthy profitability. This continued strong performance as well as the benefit from the lower tax rate supports the $0.25 increase in the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance for the year.","We\u2019re highly confident in our ability to consistently deliver exceptional value over the long-run based on the execution of our four key strategies, that is driving outsized growth in high-value product categories, growing profitably in our base businesses, relentlessly pursuing productivity improvement and remaining disciplined in our approach to capital management.","Now another key success has been and will continue to be the depth of talent we have in the company. And Greg\u2019s promotion to CFO, as well as the other organizational moves we made over the last couple years attest to the depth and strength of that talent pool.","Greg, it\u2019s great to have you on the senior leadership team, the rest of the team and I are looking forward to partnering with you in the years ahead, so congratulations.","Gregory Lovins","Thanks Mitch, I appreciate that, and I\u2019m really excited to be in the role and I\u2019m looking forward to continue in partnering with you and the rest of our leadership as well. And hello to everybody in the call, and with that let we jump into the quarter.","As Mitch mentioned, we delivered another solid quarter with earnings coming in ahead of our expectations. We grew sales by 7%, excluding currency and 3% on an organic basis and we delivered a 20% increase in adjusted earnings per share. Strong operating performance and a lower tax rate both contributed to the year-on-year change.","Currency translation reduced reported sales by about 1% in the second quarter, was an approximately $0.02 negative impact to EPS. Our adjusted operating margin in the second quarter of 10.8% was up slightly versus the prior-year, as productivity and higher volumes more than offset higher employee related costs and a modest headwind from the net impact of pricing and raw material costs.","Productivity gains this quarter included approximately $15 million of net restructuring savings, most of which benefited the RBS segment. Our adjusted tax rate was 26% in the quarter, down from 30% in the first quarter and reflective of our revised expectation of 28% for the full year. The reduction to the full-year tax rate is driven by continued favorable geographic income mix and a net favorability from discrete items. We now expect our sustainable tax rate to be in the upper 20s large reflecting that continued favorable geographic mix.","Year-to-date we\u2019ve generated free cash flow of $93 million, $59 million less than the same period last year as 2016 included a significant improvement in our working capital ratio. While we\u2019ve largely sustained last year\u2019s working capital efficiency gain, the cash flow benefit from that improvement doesn\u2019t repeat.","Higher capital spending also contributed to lower free cash flow relative to prior year, and we continue to expect free cash flow conversion for the year of nearly 100% of GAAP net income.","Our balance sheet remains strong. We have ample capacity to invest in the business including funding our M&A strategy, as well as continuing to return cash to shareholders in a disciplined manner. Our net note in late April released our quarterly dividend rate by 10%, and received authorization from our board to repurchase an additional $650 million of stock.","In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 400,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $36 million, and our share count declined modestly. We also paid $40 million in dividends in the quarter.","On the acquisition front, we closed the previously announced Yongle deal in June, and the integration of that business is underway. While we expect this acquisition to have an immaterial impact on EPS for the full year, one-time transition cost will have a meaningful impact on margins in the IHM segment in the third quarter.","As Mitch mentioned, we also acquired Finesse Medical, an Ireland based wound care manufacture with approximately \u20ac15 million in annual revenue. And we continue to expect that Mactac will contribute close to $0.10 of EPS improvement in 2017. And we expect the newly completed deals to contribute more than $0.10 to EPS next year.","Following the acquisitions, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio temporarily increased, and is now closer to the high end of our target range. With that said, we have ample capacity to continue pursuing our disciplined capital allocation strategy.","So let me turn to the segment results for the quarter. Label and Graphic Material sales were up 7% excluding currency, bolstered by the Mactac and Hanita acquisitions. Organic sales growth was 2% in the quarter, with high-value categories up mid-single digits and modest growth in base categories.","As Mitch indicated, this represented a moderation of our performance over the last few quarters, largely reflecting timing effects, including the Q1 benefit from the pull forward of sales to the price increase in China, which we discussed last quarter, as well as the timing of various holidays between quarters and inventory destocking related to implementation of the new goods and services tax in India.","And looking at the regions, in North America, we grew in low single digits, which we believe was due to modest pickup in demand and some share gain. This represents an improvement of our trend from previous quarters.","Growth in emerging markets moderated to a low single-digit rate in the quarter as well, largely reflecting the timing issues that I outlined as well as the challenging prior-year comparison for Eastern Europe.","So while we did see some softening of our growth rate and pockets of our business in Q2, we are confident in the return to roughly 4% organic growth for this segment in the third quarter. LGM\u2019s adjusted operating margin of 13.6% was unchanged from a relatively high level we saw last year, as the benefits from productivity and higher volume offset higher employee-related cost in a modest negative net impact from price and raw material costs.","As we anticipated, aggregate commodity costs increased sequentially than ease towards the end of the quarter on a global basis. Of course, we see raw material costs trend to differ across regions and individual commodities, and we continue to monitor these movements within each market and adjust our prices as necessary.","So let me shift to retail Branding and Information Solutions. RBS sales were up 6% organically, driven largely by the performance athletic in Premium Fashion segments within the base business, as well as strong growth of RFID with RFID products up more than 20% in the quarter.","We continue to see volume growth outpace apparel unit imports and at the same time the headwind from strategic price actions we started implementing over a year ago, which was designed to improve competitiveness in our base business are largely behind us. RBS' operating margin improvement reflected the benefits of productivity initiatives and higher volume, which are partly offset by higher employee-related costs.","We anticipate continued margin expansion in the back half of the year as the team continues to execute the business model transformation, and we benefit from the reduction and amortization that we\u2019ve previously discussed.","Sales in our Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment were up 10% excluding currency. While sales were flat on an organic basis, they actually came in better than expected, due largely to the strength in industrial categories, which were up low double digits for the quarter.","Our operating margin declined in this business largely as expected due primarily to the decline in healthcare categories, including the impact of certain contractual payments we received last year that did not repeat. Acquisition integration costs in a modest negative effect in the net impact of price from raw material cost consistent with what we\u2019re seeing in LGM also contributed to the decline.","As I mentioned earlier, acquisition related costs such as inventory step up, amortization and other transition cost related to the Yongle acquisition will temporarily reduce IHM margins in the back half of this year. We\u2019re focused on improving our profitability in this segment, while investing to support growth and expect to see operating margin expand to LGM\u2019s level or better over the long term.","So let me now turn to the balance for the outlook of the year. We have raised the midpoint of our guidance for adjusted earnings per share by $0.25 to an updated range of $475 million to $490 million. Roughly $0.10 of this increase reflects stronger operating results and $0.15 comes from the combination of a lower tax rate and a modest net benefit from currency and share count.","We outlined some of the key contributing factors to our EPS guidance on slide 9 of our supplemental presentation materials. Focusing on the factors that have changed from our previous outlook, we now expect reported sales growth of 7% to 8% for the full year, reflecting the impact of Yongle and Finesse acquisitions and a smaller currency headwind. At recent foreign exchange rates, we estimate the currency translation will reduce net sales by less than 0.5%, and reduce pre-tax earnings by roughly $4 million.","We now also expect incremental restructuring savings from $45 million to $50 million at the high-end of the previously communicated range. And as discussed, we\u2019re now expecting a tax rate of approximately 28% compared to our previous assumption of 30%, again reflecting our new anticipated annual run rate.","And we expect average shares outstanding, assuming dilution of approximately 89.5 million to 90 million shares. Our other key assumptions remain unchanged from what shared last quarter.","So to wrap up, we\u2019re pleased to report another solid quarter of continued progress against our long-term strategic and financial objectives.","And with that, we\u2019ll now open the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.","Ghansham Panjabi","I'm not really sure who to congratulate first. So congratulations to all of you in your new roles, Cindy welcome back. I guess first off, what's driving the confidence between the expected 3Q rebound in LGM and given that you historically have not had a ton of visibility on volumes in that segment. Maybe you can give us a cadence of core sales growth during the second quarter and maybe what you\u2019re seeing in July more specifically?","Mitchell Butier","So, specifically there is a number of factors that Greg talked about, one is around the holidays that are impacting thing, so Easter had a negative impact in Q2, benefited Q1. We saw that in Q1. We talked about the impact of the pull forward from the price increase in China, what benefited Q1 and we anticipate that would hit the Q2.","And then between Q2 and Q3, the move forward of Ramadan has an impact in Middle East, North Africa as well as South Asia, that should benefit Q3 and it didn't hurt Q2. And then combined with just what we\u2019re seeing and our business is trending through, June was better than the other months as we went through the quarter. And our shipments first three weeks, we have very limited forward visibilities, first three weeks were up mid single-digits across LGM as well.","So, a combination of factors trends within the quarter, discrete holidays and timing matters that we can point to around pricing or holidays is really what's driving us to that Ghansham. Now that's - I think your overall point we have limited forward visibility is spot on, that\u2019s why the full range of our guidance we still have a full point of topline growth range, built into our model reflecting that but we wanted to communicate what we\u2019re seeing within the quarter and going into Q3.","Ghansham Panjabi","And just on RBIS, the margins - the volumes came in much higher than we forecasted for the quarter, did margins come in where you thought they would? Wondering why there was not even more operating leverage on there, on the quarter?","Mitchell Butier","Yes, operating margin did come in where we expect them to be relative to the growth and the growth is coming in strong both RFID, as well as strength within the base. Now if you\u2019re looking for more operating leverage on year-over-year comp matter, comparisons that is, we do have more compensation accruals - incentive compensation accruals built in this year than we did last year.","So, again the normal flow through and we\u2019re incentivizing the management to hit the aggressive stretch targets that we built within this business, and so we have more compensation expense in the quarter than we otherwise would.","Ghansham Panjabi","And just one final one in terms of Europe, I'm not sure if you commented on how Europe progressed for LGM during the quarter, and then also RBIS? Thanks so much.","Gregory Lovins","Yes, during the quarter, as Mitch mentioned overall Europe also picked up as we move through the quarter, overall our growth rate in Europe was in the low single-digit range similar to North America. But Europe was impacted a little bit more by the holidays with the Easter timing as well as, as Mitch mentioned some of the Muslim holidays at the end of the period as well. So we do expect to see that return a little bit closer to where we have been previously as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Louis Gaffner from Barclays Capital. Please proceed.","Scott Louis Gaffner","First question was a bit of a follow-up, just Greg I think in your prepared remarks I couldn\u2019t hear, but I think you said either $0.05 to $0.10 better on the guidance relative to operations, and with that, so if you could just clarify that?","And then, if I look at it, obviously the volume is the same as it was before from an organic perspective, is that - so that leads me to think that it\u2019s margins that have gotten - the margin outlook has gotten a little bit better, is that more around price cost or mix or how should we think about the improvement there within the guidance?","Gregory Lovins","Yes, so overall, our guidance increased to $0.25, roughly $0.10 of that is due to operations, and the other $0.15 again is the net impact of tax currency and share count. Overall, I think it is a little bit of mix improvement, and a little bit of productivity improvement. We did range or did raise the outlook on restructuring, as we continue to execute very well on the restructuring initiatives, particularly within RBIS. We continue to drive productivity as we always do in the LGM business as well. So overall, we feel good about the margin outlook and the trends that we\u2019ve been seeing.","Scott Louis Gaffner","And anything on the input cost side that would make you think that you might able to have different price cost spread as we move into the back half of the year and into 2018?","Gregory Lovins","We're not really seeing any real material moves in across different - across the overall in our commodities. As we mentioned a quarter ago, we were seeing some increases in chemicals going into Q2 that we expected to be somewhat short-lived, and it looks like those will be somewhat short-lived.","We do see some increases in paper and pulp as we go into the back half, and there\u2019s a couple of areas or regions where we see that, and in those areas we'll be increasing prices accordingly, but overall relatively immaterial impact across the different commodity categories.","Scott Louis Gaffner","And last one from me, Mitch. When you look at the M&A environment, there've been some decent sized acquisitions within the labels space recently. Any thoughts around maybe getting a little bit more aggressive on M&A and focusing on some larger scale purchases rather than just bolt-on technologies and geographies?","Mitchell Butier","So our M&A pipeline is robust and we continue to work it and calling the exact timing of when things may or may not happen is always difficult. As far as our strategy, our strategy is bolt-on acquisitions of the size that you've seen with Mactac and Yongle, as well as capability building acquisitions similar to what you've seen within Finesse and Hanita. So that is the overall focus.","And part of that is just a result of the reality of the markets which we\u2019re in and our position within them as well. So that\u2019s as far as general size, we don\u2019t say overly limit ourselves, that\u2019s generally how we think about it as far as what you should expect and what we\u2019re focused on.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of George Staphos, Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","George Staphos","Good morning. Thanks for the details. Again, congratulation to everybody. Cindy, we thought you were sick of us, you\u2019re back for more, so...","Cynthia Guenther","I missed you.","George Staphos","Hopefully, congratulations, and first condolences, but now you've had. There you go. I wanted to come back to the extent that we can talk about this and I realize and Ghansham brought it up as well. You don\u2019t have that much visibility on your business given the very, very short lead times that you have. So if you were in our seat, trying to track Avery through 3Q and trying to determine whether that pick-up in volume in LGM has sustained itself, which parameters, which data points in the public domain would you have us watch recognizing there\u2019s not going to be anything that\u2019s particularly good in terms of that effort? And then, I had a couple of follow-ons obviously.","Mitchell Butier","George, we track a lot of the - some of the broad indicators. But the thing is that, a lot of the indicators you will look at are U.S.-denominated in U.S. market isn\u2019t where we\u2019ve seen some of this volatility of growth or impact from holidays and so forth, and quite as much.","So, I think, reading the headlines on the impacts within India, specifically, as far as the what\u2019s going on around inventory levels that was - we expected as - that one to press both Q2 and some of Q3 and seeing what the headline are on that would be one way to track that. The impact of the shift of Ramadan is just moves forward a little bit every year. And so, we\u2019re seeing - going to see that move. So that one - I guess, just - it\u2019s hard for you to tell exactly what the impact would be for us.","And then, generally, just everything else you track, let\u2019s say lot of external indicators people look at are not - are tend to be U.S.-centric and that\u2019s not really where we\u2019ve seen the volatility. And then, on the RBIS side focusing on apparel imports both in the U.S. and Europe would be key indicators to watch as well.","George Staphos","Now, one thing, if we consider where you seem to have some volume deceleration in the quarter, which was in emerging market. Traditionally, I would think that, that would\u2019ve been uneven greater effect given the margin on EBIT. So if that\u2019s the correct assessment that you have traditionally had a little bit richer mix there, how did you offset that in the quarter or was there anything that you did to offset that in the quarter?","And then, I want to come back to the question on RBIS incrementals as well. Should we still maintain the historical rules of thumb that after you cover 2% volume growth - you get to the incremental margins you\u2019ve advertised and discussed in the past in that business or are those figures no longer applicable?","Mitchell Butier","Yes, let me start with the question on the emerging markets, I think the LGM emerging markets, overall we did continue to see growth in most of Asia. We did have a little bit of a - we still continue to see single-digit or high single-digit growth in India despite the GST implementation we\u2019ve talked about, a little bit lower than our previous pace had been but still continue to see good growth, and we continue to see growth in China year-to-date basis in the high single-digit range.","So overall, I think we do continue to see the growth there, a little bit lower than I have been previously - certainly in Q1 where we had the impact of the price increase prebuy as well. But overall we did continue to see growth in the emerging markets, which are typically higher margin from that perspective and that enable us to - to be able to keep that overall margin impact.","Gregory Lovins","As far as on the RBS side, I think that rule of thumb is a good one. It may shift down a little bit as the mix of business shifts more to RFID, those have high gross profit dollars per unit, but the variable margins, especially at the pace that we\u2019re investing in business development that the variable margin might be somewhat lower, the absolute margins are higher than the average, but that would be one subtle shift over time, and I\u2019m talking about over coming years.","As far as what we\u2019re seeing within the business, within the margin profile that incentive comp element is a - would make up the difference for what you\u2019re looking for year-over-year George.","George Staphos","And my last question, I\u2019ll leave it here. Can you comment, put a number on, however you would have us to think about it, to what benefit you might receive from again increasing e-commerce and what that means for your business? And I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you.","Mitchell Butier","That's - increasing e-commerce has been a trend that has helped to support our growth both in variable information labels within materials as well as to some extent within RBIS. In the quarter, it was a little bit slower, VI relative to everything else, but these growth rates can jump around, I mean, it was upper single digits for a quarter and then lower, so these can jump around quarter-to-quarter.","So they\u2019re a little bit slower specifically within the quarter, but general - the general thrust is that that will continue to be a tailwind and be a growth driver for us going forward as it has been in the last couple of years.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Adam Josephson","So, just a couple, one on - Mitch or Greg, just on the tax rate being sustainably lower, I assume that just lower expected growth in the U.S. long-term and continued, appreciably higher growth in emerging markets. But can you just elaborate on that a bit?","Gregory Lovins","Yes, I think the geographic mix is driven largely by the growth in emerging markets as well as the good growth that we\u2019ve seen in Europe over the last number of quarters. And as we continue to do acquisitions, much of that is based outside of the U.S. at this point, with a lot of it being in Europe and some of it being in Asia as well, which typically have lower overall corporate tax rates as well.","So, some of that all contributes to the favorable geographic mix that we\u2019ve seen so far this year and that we expect to continue to see going forward.","Adam Josephson","Thanks, Greg. Just one on margins in the label business, obviously there is substantial margin expansion. In the last couple of years margins have flattened out, this year, obviously the top line growth has slowed a bit, and I think ROS have largely stabilized. How would you characterize the margin performance this year and just differentiate between the margin performance this year compared to the past couple of years? And what do you think is - think is sustainable, obviously, you\u2019ve given a longer-term guidance, but just can you elaborate on the margin performance year-to-date versus what you\u2019ve seen in the last couple years?","Gregory Lovins","I think year-to-date - I mean, our margin performance continues to be driven by a number of things. Some of which Mitch mentioned is well around the growth in higher value categories. So, we have higher single-digit growth in specialty and durables, which typically - as we\u2019ve said, with our higher value product categories have typically higher margin for us as well.","So, that continued mix benefit we saw in the first or in the second quarter, and that\u2019s part of where we expect to continue driving growth and improvement in our margins overall in the LGM side as well. As we said, we had a little bit of a net headwind from pricing raw material cost in Q2, but overall, relatively modest and relatively modest going forward at the back half of this year.","But I think, longer-term, it\u2019s really driven by the strategy around focusing on higher value categories as well continue to get more disciplined in the base and continue to drive productivity in our base business. Both of those things in combination and what - continue driving our margins in LGM.","Adam Josephson","Just a couple other, you might have mentioned this. And forgive me if I didn\u2019t hear it properly. But for resin and paper for the balance of the year, what exactly are you expecting?","Gregory Lovins","Overall, relatively flat in balance of the year sequentially. As we said, we saw a little bit of pickup in chemical costs in the second quarter. We expect that to moderate a bit at the kind of tail end of the Q2 and into Q3. And we are seeing a little bit of a paper increase and really dependent on the region.","In Europe, we\u2019re seeing a little bit more of an increase in paper than maybe some of the other regions. But overall, relatively flat in total. But again, chemicals are coming down a little bit, paper going up a little bit.","Adam Josephson","And just one last one just on capital allocation, I know, you\u2019ve been doing some deals, your buyback activity has slowed quite a bit. Can you just remind us of buybacks versus M&A and the timing of the buybacks?","Gregory Lovins","Overall, I guess, I will start. We continue to have with where we are in our debt ratio as I mentioned ample capacity to continue to fund M&A and to continue returning cash to our shareholders. On the M&A front, as we said on capital allocation, we do look at the pool of funds for M&A and share buybacks somewhat fungible, and we had a little bit more M&A in the quarter than we obviously did in the previous couple of quarters.","But overall, we did continue buying shares back in Q2 and we\u2019ll continue doing so in a disciplined manner. Overall, I think, our approach isn\u2019t changing, our strategy isn\u2019t changing there. We\u2019re going to continue both being disciplined on the M&A front as well as on the share buyback front. But our strategy is not changing towards continuing to return cash to shareholders overall.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citigroup Global Markets. Please proceed.","Bryan Burgmeier ","Hi, this is Bryan Burgmeier sitting in for Anthony. Understanding there were some timing issues in LGM, key competitors still pointed to mid-single digit volume growth. Do you believe Avery lost any share throughout the quarter and if so was part of the price had a cost impact you guys pointed to driven by getting a little more competitive on price?","Mitchell Butier","If you\u2019re just speaking specifically about LGM, what we see around the globe, I would say in the mature regions, we don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve lost share. If anything, we potentially expanded share, and now you recall in North America, we said, we thought maybe we ceded some share late last year and we\u2019re making adjustments to recover and we do believe we\u2019ve recovered there.","Within Asia, we\u2019re not - we don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve seeded any share over the cycle, I will say specifically in Q2. One of the things, we\u2019re looking at, we\u2019ve raised prices in China, and we\u2019ve talked about the importance of our leadership position within the market, and leading out with price when there is inflation.","And we sometimes have near-term share challenges for a couple of quarters, but we usually within a couple of quarters of that, we adjust and cycle that through, and that\u2019s something that we just - traditionally, we\u2019re seeing, when we do price increases, we got to be - have the courage to push it through, and sometimes it has near-term share consequences.","We haven\u2019t completely worked that through yet, because we\u2019re still only a few couple months after that price increase. So, generally no, but you\u2019ve really got to look at market-by-market. Latin America, we continue to take shares, our position. Europe, it looks like we continue to take share. North America, we reversed the share loss. And China, we may have some share deterioration, but we will see that as near term.","Bryan Burgmeier ","And then just a follow-up. RBIS' organic growth was a little bit stronger than we thought, are you guys starting to lap some of the pricing initiatives, and without - like a small headwind during the quarter or is pricing still a headwind? And then what\u2019s your outlook for pricing in the second half?","Mitchell Butier","So, when we\u2019ve taken about pricing and the strategic pricing adjustments, we\u2019ve started talking about a-year-and-a-half ago. We saw an opportunity to dramatically reduce our variable costs, particularly the raw material components that we were using, and moving more to local sourcing.","And so, we started adjusting our pricing before we had localized that raw material sourcing, and then that was having a negative impact on the bottom line. We\u2019ve cycled that through, I believe we cycled through that in Q4 of last year from a margin perspective. Now this business is a custom business, so we\u2019re always pricing the various components where they need to be relative to the specifics - the specs that the retailers and brands need. Our variable margins remain high and we\u2019re growing in the base business.","So price, because it\u2019s a custom business, it\u2019s hard to compare a 2x4 tag that is three color with a 3x1 tag that is four color across cycles if you will. But generally, it\u2019s competitive market, we actually think that this new strategy we have enables us to grow profitably and meet more what the customers need are.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan Securities. Please proceed.","Jeff Zekauskas","In the quarter, were your raw materials and Label and Graphic Materials up by a mid-single digit rate or a low-single digit rate?","Gregory Lovins","Overall relatively flat to low-single digits year-over-year.","Jeff Zekauskas","And you spoke yourself is being squeezed a little bit in the second quarter. Do you expect to be squeezed in the third?","Gregory Lovins","Generally no and our impact in Q2 is relatively modest sequentially Q1 to Q2 largely driven by the chemical inflation we started to see in the back half of the first quarter. But again most of that we expect to have been moderated. We are seeing some pockets as I mentioned before in paper in particular, but we\u2019ll look to manage that through productivity and\/or pricing where necessary.","Mitchell Butier","Jeff it's really a region by region story. So it\u2019s tough to give you global perspectives on it. It is modest overall. But just going around the regions, Q1 we had been seeing inflation. In China, we raised prices and that was going in Q2 having a positive price impact in Q2, but negative volume impact because a lot of the volume was pulled forward as talked about.","In North America, we\u2019ve put out several warning letters that if the inflation we are seeing from Q1 to Q2 continued, we would raise prices that has abated, so we did not raise prices, so that did have some downward pressure on margins in the quarter that should abate. But now we\u2019re seeing paper inflation as Greg mentioned in a couple of regions including Europe, where we are going out with the price increase.","So, you really have to look at it region-by-region and this is just something managing these levels of moves of inflation is just part of the day-to-day focus of the leadership and deciding when to raise prices and when not to, and that\u2019s really the kind of environment we\u2019re in. We\u2019re not in a big inflationary, deflationary environment right now, it\u2019s very modest as Greg said.","Jeff Zekauskas","How much is RFID up in the first half?","Mitchell Butier","It\u2019s up in the mid-teens or so and more than 20% in the quarter. If you recall Q1 was growing sub 10%, as a result of tough comps the previous year.","Jeff Zekauskas","In the Label and Graphic Materials Industry in Europe or the United States, when you look at industry capacity additions over the next year or two, do you think the capacity additions are greater than industry growth or less?","Mitchell Butier","Yeah, the capacity additions have - they come in, in waves and so there was a very little capacity addition in North America for quite some time, and yes, the pace of capacity adds has - if you look at just a very short couple of year horizon has outstripped it.","Now, the key thing to understand within our industry, capacity that\u2019s added can still be scaled up slowly, starting with one shift, two shift and so forth, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve traditionally seen, that\u2019s what we do, that\u2019s what we see happens within the market. Also capacity adds tend to precede potential planned capacity reductions as well.","And so when you look over the long run, you\u2019ll see ads coming in and then assets taken offline. Very similar to our own expansion a few years ago within graphics, we expanded graphics line in one side, and then reduce some capacity another couple of years later. So, this is larger - we\u2019re going through a wave of capacity additions right now Jeff. When we look over the long run, this seems to be what you would expect for an industry that\u2019s growing like ours is.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Chris Kapsch from Aegis Capital. Please proceed.","Chris Kapsch","So, I had a follow-up on this notion of e-commerce being - e-commerce related sales being a little bit weaker in the quarter. You mentioned RFID\u2019s growth actually accelerated, so presumably you\u2019re talking primarily about the variable information in the LGM segment. So, just wondering, if you can provide any color as to why the demand for shipping labels would be weaker during 2Q, particularly against this notion that you feel like you gained share - market share in most regions?","Mitchell Butier","It falls within the normal variability that we would often see within a particular product line. So, nothing specific to call out a broader trend that we\u2019re seeing. It was growing - grew faster than we expected within Q1. We often don\u2019t give the product line outlook by region, I share that because, but if you look at the puts and takes of the various product lines this falls right within the normal variation. If it were to continue for another quarter or two then that would be a different discussion, but this is part of the normal choppiness we see within our product lines.","Chris Kapsch","And then if I could just follow up on sort of the raw material discussion and the idea of potentially, I think you said putting out a price increase at least in Europe, because of inflation in paper. Just curious what you\u2019ve seen over time, maybe you could talk about, I don\u2019t remember since we\u2019ve kind of seen a deflationary environment since late 2014, I don\u2019t recall the industry really going after pricing? And you did characterize most recently even though paper costs are higher, you have deflation suddenly in some petrochemical costs.","So, are you - what\u2019s the dynamic and what\u2019s the discussion with the customer base when you\u2019re talking about price increase on the basis of higher pulp when you have on the other side of the ledger you have raw materials petro to drive raw materials being lower. Can you just describe how you see that playing out? Thank you.","Mitchell Butier","So we share what\u2019s going on within the market, and when we do a price increase we lay out the basis and the reasoning and that\u2019s why some of the price increase tend to be focused on the paper categories because that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing, where we\u2019re not talking about films right now and price increases.","So, we show the impact of the inflation that we\u2019re seeing and a lot of that is to help the converter layer then be informed so they can go further on to the end users to work through price increases that they may need as well.","So that\u2019s the environment we\u2019re in, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re working through right now, and these - you got to keep perspective in that, these are relatively modest at the total company level, where we\u2019re going out as target price increase, where we\u2019re seeing inflation for certain components where we need to pass on price increase to particular customers that are affected by this inflation and this is going on every year.","Over the last few years, Latin America, it was raising prices because they had a lot of inflation in local currency and we\u2019re constantly raising prices that was just part of the MO down there. So this I would say is part of normal doing business and what we\u2019re working through right now.","Gregory Lovins","I think there is also variation by region as we\u2019ve talked about before as well. Some of the chemical costs are part of what led us to the price increase in China in the first quarter and to a lesser extent some increases in North America for chemicals weren\u2019t is a bigger factor, it\u2019s small overall anyway but not a bigger factor in Europe, where Europe we\u2019re seeing paper go up. So it is different by region and by commodity across the regions as well.","Operator","And we now have a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos, Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","George Staphos","Maybe to taking back on Chris's question and it didn\u2019t sound like you had a much more offer on this, other thing it's subject to normal variation you see in the business, but with most of the end market discussion on e-commerce in the trade press seemingly positive, the box state has been quite strong, which we think is being driven by e-commerce. Mitch, what would drive less consumption of VI-related material other than maybe some destocking from previous purchases in the quarter?","Mitchell Butier","So I think destocking, we have talks about often being as far back in the supply chain as we are destocking offerings what can drive moves for a couple of months and I would say that would be the primary thing to focus on. The overall general trend within e-commerce would be - expect it to be a continued driver for variable information and intelligent labels at large.","George Staphos","And then, secondly, working capital in the quarter was pretty normal when you look back historically over second quarter, it was down versus last year. And I think, you called out directionally there were something that were benefiting last year\u2019s performance versus this year. Could you put perhaps a finer point on what some of those variances were? If you had already done, then I apologize for having missed them. And what would your expectations for working capital be both this year and to extent, do you have any kind of directional view into 2018?","Gregory Lovins","So I think, comment I made earlier was more about where we had ended the year before - year-to-date last year, our levels of working capital are relatively similar. And in Q2, we\u2019re relatively similar to where we\u2019ve been over most of the last year or two.","It\u2019s just the starting point for this year. At the end of last year it was a little bit lower than it had been the year before, which led to a different free cash flow impact year-over-year. I think overall when we continue to look at working capital, we do have some pressure some of the acquisitions we\u2019ve made typically have higher working capital ratios than what we have. Such part of the improvements, we\u2019ll be looking to drive from some of the acquisitions as well as we go through the back half of this year and into next year also.","But overall, not much - I wouldn\u2019t expect much significant change one way or another in terms of our overall working capital ratios as we go across the next number of quarters.","George Staphos","So Greg, just to put a bow on that, so you actually think the acquisitions given the opportunities that you have there will actually drive some positive of the working capital for the next few quarters even though, you're starting at a higher-level of working capital intensity in those businesses. Is that correct?","Gregory Lovins","Yes, I think, we\u2019ll start out at a little bit higher level, and then over the course of a few quarters, we\u2019ll be continuing to working to bring those levels back down towards what more like what our average would be. It really depends on the business as well. Certain businesses have different levels of inventory, depending on the type of business, but overall, we\u2019re continuing to drive inventory in other working capital components more towards our average.","George Staphos","Two last ones from me, and I\u2019ll turnover. First in terms of broader trends that you\u2019re seeing here in the LGM business, what could you share about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of adhesive technologies, requirements specifically being placed upon label and here what I\u2019m thinking about is to the extent that again, we\u2019re seeing shifting in channel from traditional retail to online, is that bringing about any kind of change in the label that\u2019s applied on the primary package, and if there is anything that you see as being discernible there would be interested?","And then, switching gears entirely in terms of IHM, are you seeing any, I don\u2019t know, more intense competition from your peers as you\u2019re trying to grow into those markets relatively to what your expectations would have been? And if you could provide any color even if there\u2019s been no change in your view that would be helpful? Thank you and good luck in the quarter.","Gregory Lovins","So two questions there George, so within LGM specifically, I think, what you\u2019re asking is broader trends specifically and as things moved to e-commerce, was that having effect on labels? And we\u2019ve talked about one of the big advantages of our products are the shelf appeal. But if you think about household and personal care and so forth, one of things just pure e-commerce companies are looking for, to still have that moment of truth and people having some type of attachment to the brands that they\u2019re buying.","And so the physical decoration of the product is still an important aspect and we\u2019re actually working with some of the e-commerce companies for how to further improve that moment of truth, so it\u2019s not just a dirty poly bag being thrown on your porch, when you\u2019re buying something that - a brand that you\u2019re trying to connect with.","So, those are works in progress, but overall we\u2019re not seeing a big shift or impact on the branding side of labels, variable information labels, we see this is a tailwind and will continue to be a growth driver for us as we we're talking about earlier.","Then industrial and healthcare materials, like many of our business is competitive, the difference is within that segment, it\u2019s large, we're Tier 2 player and it\u2019s growing well ahead of GDP, and it tends to be specified category. So, when you get specked in, you\u2019re specified on your own or you\u2019re one of two that are qualified for a particular program. And that - I wouldn\u2019t say there is, it\u2019s a competitive environment as every industry that we\u2019re in is, but I wouldn\u2019t specifically call that, I\u2019m seeing some large competitive response.","This is a type of industry where we still see lots of niche players even as an industry is growing like this, these ones are that we\u2019re going after, you tend to still have new entrants and a number of companies, but there is plenty room for everybody to win, so that\u2019s more how it characterize that broader space.","Operator","Mr. Butier, there are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back to you. Please continue your presentation or your concluding remarks.","Mitchell Butier","Well, I just want to thank everybody for joining the call today. A lot of great things going on within the company and we\u2019re looking forward to continuing to execute our strategic priorities and delivering for everybody including our investors over the long run. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

This call is being recorded and will be available for replay from 1:00 p.m. Pacific time today through midnight Pacific time, February 3. To access the replay, please dial 1 (800) 633-8284 or 1 (402) 977-9140 for international callers. The conference ID number is 21543229. I'd now like to turn the call over to Eric Leeds, Avery Dennison's Head of Investor Relations. You may proceed, sir.","Eric Leeds","Thank you. Welcome, everyone. Today, we'll discuss our preliminary, unaudited fourth quarter and full year 2011 results. Please note that unless otherwise indicated, today's discussion will be focused on our continuing operations. The company's Office and Consumer Products business is classified on our income statement as a discontinued operation. The non-GAAP financial measures that we use are defined, qualified and reconciled with GAAP in schedules A-2 to A-5 of the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release. We remind you that we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. These forward-looking statements are made subject to the Safe Harbor statement, included in today's earnings release. On the call today are Dean Scarborough, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mitch Butier, Senior Vice President and CFO. ","I'll now turn the call over to Dean.","Dean A. Scarborough","Thanks, Eric. Despite the challenges of over $200 million of raw material inflation and a sudden downshift in volume in the second quarter that lasted the rest of the year, the businesses delivered more operating income than last year before restructuring costs, as well as nearly $300 million in free cash flow. Our ability to raise prices and to accelerate productivity enabled us to hold our margins in difficult market conditions. We further reduced our leverage, increased our dividend and contributed $70 million to our pension plan. Our intention was to return even more cash to shareholders last year, but we were restricted due to the Office and Consumer Products divestiture plan.","Net sales increased 4% for the full year, mainly due to pricing and currency, which offset sluggish unit volumes caused by lower market demand in many of the vertical end markets we serve. We took a significant step forward with the agreement to sell our Office and Consumer Products business consistent with our strategy to maximize its value for shareholders. ","Now turning to the businesses. In 2011, sales for the Pressure-sensitive Materials segment grew about 4% in local currency due to the pricing actions we took. We held segment operating margin, excluding restructuring, roughly flat year-over-year. I'd like to note that in challenging market conditions, Pressure-sensitive Materials operating income, excluding restructuring, is roughly $80 million higher than it was 2 years ago at the low point of the recession. ","Our Label and Packaging Materials business, which is by far the largest component of the segment, is a market leader with strong competitive advantages. We have differentiated products, especially in the faster growing film categories. We have scale, which enables us to run more efficiently and buy raw materials more effectively than competitors. Label and Packaging Materials is an innovation leader as well. Last year, with relatively modest investments, we introduced nearly 20 product innovations that will help us accelerate profitable growth and extend our leadership position in key markets over the mid to long term.","Retail Branding and Information Solutions was impacted by volume declines more than Pressure-sensitive Materials. Full year sales were down 3% in local currency. Record high cotton prices caused retailers and brand owners to raise prices dramatically, which caused unit volumes to decline. In the fourth quarter, for example, apparel unit imports to the United States dropped more than 12%. Despite this drop, we successfully held RBIS operating margin through a combination of productivity actions and lower employee-related costs. This was a major accomplishment in this high variable margin business.","The major challenge for RBIS has been achieving our margin improvement objectives with almost no sales growth since 2008. We made major progress in 2010 as sales rebounded from the 2009 recession, but last year's challenging unit volume environment stalled our progress. Given the more unpredictable market environment going forward, especially with challenges in Europe, we're accelerating our efforts to reduce fixed costs in RBIS. We enjoy competitive advantages in apparel branded and Information Solutions. No one else has the global reach that matches the scale of the apparel supply chain, but we can be more efficient while preserving these advantages. ","During 2011, we accelerated productivity actions by consolidating production and making our factories more efficient. The benefit of lowering our breakeven point enabled us to maintain margins x structuring in a slower volume environment. Over the next few years, we'll continue to shrink our square footage in manufacturing as the benefits of Lean Six Sigma and new manufacturing and information technology enable us to serve customers more efficiently.","We'll continue to invest in RBIS at less than our rate of depreciation and amortization, ensuring that the business delivers solid free cash flow in this more volatile market environment. Our goal is to continue to drive down our breakeven point, so we can reach our margin targets with lower volume growth.","We're continuing to invest in organic growth for the business. Apparel unit tagging with RFID grew by 60% this year, and we have several new retailers adopting the technology in 2012. There is strong interest from customers in our new Agility HD line of heat transfer solutions for high definition exterior graphics. This is a great example of using our material science capability to provide new solutions for existing customers. ","And finally, we made solid progress this year in building our offerings to retailers and brand owners in new and emerging markets, including Japan, where we have very low market share. ","To sum up, 2011 was about maintaining the leadership positions of our 2 core businesses. With disciplined pricing and improvements in productivity through restructuring and Enterprise Lean Sigma, we delivered operating income growth before restructuring. And we generated strong free cash flow. These accomplishments are a tribute to our employees, who did an outstanding job executing price increases and taking other actions to mitigate raw material inflation, as well as driving productivity and working capital improvement. I want to thank them for their efforts.","For 2012, the economic environment remains uncertain, especially in Europe, and we're assuming a continued lack of momentum. We expect modest growth in sales with higher contributions from emerging markets. We'll continue to focus on increasing our operational efficiency, and we expect to see improvement in earnings and another year of solid free cash flow. We're committed to increased returns of cash to shareholders, and at the same time, we're continuing to invest modestly in organic growth programs to strengthen our competitive advantages. And now Mitch will go over the quarter and the outlook.","Mitchell R. Butier","Thanks, Dean. Starting with Slide 6 and talking through to Slide 8 of our financial review and analysis. Sales in the fourth quarter were up about 0.5% organically as the impact of our price increases was partially offset by lower volume. Volume for the company was down approximately 1.5% and in line with our most recent expectations. Volume was flat in PSM and declined in RBIS and in our Other Specialty Converting businesses.","The negative volume trend that we began to experience in Q2 lessened again, but we continue to experience soft end-market demand and uncertainty, particularly in Europe.  Fourth quarter operating margin was down 80 basis points compared to last year due to the impact of restructuring costs and other items. The biggest increase in restructuring costs was in RBIS as we've accelerated our productivity measures in that business. I'll comment more on that in a moment. ","Adjusted operating margin was roughly flat to last year as pricing and productivity initiatives offset increased raw material costs. While we are seeing inflation in some of the commodities we use, raw material costs in the aggregate have stabilized. But they still remain high. As we discussed last quarter, we've successfully offset the raw material inflation that we began to experience in mid-2010 by implementing price increases and productivity initiatives.","Our fourth quarter effective tax rate on continuing operations was 22%, and our full year tax rate on continuing operations increased from negative 1% last year to 34%. You may recall that in the fourth quarter of 2010 we had a significant tax benefit due to a discrete funding event. The difference in discrete events was a gain last year and charges this year is the primary reason for the major swing in the full year and fourth quarter tax rates.","The major discrete event this -- last quarter was a settlement of a tax matter in a foreign jurisdiction mostly related to Office and Consumer Products. This resulted in a charge to earnings of $0.12 per share, $0.09 in disc ops and $0.03 in continuing ops. Additionally, like last quarter, a contributing factor to the increase in the tax rate for the year and quarter was lower pretax income. As we discussed last time, this impacts us in 2 ways: First, lower tax rates in certain jurisdictions outside the U.S. are achieved only when we pass certain income thresholds. And second, lower pretax income diminishes our ability to utilize tax loss carry-forwards and other tax credits.","Now these comments relate to the GAAP tax rate. As we've said before, the goal of our tax funding is to reduce the amount of tax that's actually paid in any given year and we measure this through the cash tax rates. Our cash tax rate has been in the mid- to upper 20% range for the past few years and have been trending down modestly. ","Looking at earnings for the quarter. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.36. Adjusted EPS from discontinued operations, that is Office and Consumer Products, was $0.03. For a combined total of $0.39. And if you exclude the impact of the tax settlement I referred to earlier, it will be $0.51.","Before getting into the segment, I want to comment on our free cash flow. In the first half of the year, our free cash flow was well below prior year levels due to lower operating results and higher working capital, as well as the timing of pension payments. Looking at the full year, our free cash flow came in at approximately $290 million. This is ahead of the expectations that we provided last quarter, largely due to a continuation of the significant progress we made in Q3 and returning to more typical working capital levels, as well as lower capital expenditures.","Turning to Slide 9. Our Pressure-sensitive Materials segment delivered 3% organic sales growth driven by pricing. PSM's volume in the fourth quarter was flat, an improvement over the third quarter's 2% volume decline. This improvement in the trend reflects Label and Packaging Materials North American volumes swinging positive in the quarter, while the level of the volume decline in Europe moderated. LPM's volumes in emerging markets grew in the mid-single digits, a modest improvement from the Q3 pace, but below its historical and expected average. In PSM's Graphics and Reflective solutions business, sales and volumes were up mid-single digits in the quarter. And PSM's operating margin was essentially flat as the benefit of pricing actions and productivity initiatives offset increased raw material costs.","Retail Branding and Information Solutions sales were down approximately 4% on an organic basis in the fourth quarter. The lower sales were due to a continuation of the trend we saw in the second and third quarters, with lower volume reflecting unit softness in the apparel market. As in the second and third quarters, the fourth quarter declines were most pronounced among mass-market retailers and in Europe. RBIS' operating margin was down due to the additional restructuring actions. Adjusted margin was roughly flat compared to the prior year as the benefit of productivity initiatives offset the impact of lower volumes.","In the past, you may have heard us talk about how we will expand the margins in RBIS through both growth and through productivity. Now we remain confident in our ability to grow this business faster than the market. However, given the soft market environment of the past couple of years, we are not going to rely as much on volumes to get the margins and returns up in RBIS and are expanding and accelerating our productivity initiatives to reduce operating costs as much as its capital base. This strategy will enable us to improve the returns in this business without so much reliance on volume.","Sales of our Other Specialty Converting businesses declined 3% organically due primarily to softer demand for tapes. Adjusted margin was down due to the lower volume. ","Moving on to the outlook for 2012. On Slide 11, we've summarized the key factors that we expect to contribute to our P&L and cash flow in 2012. ","Slide 12 has our EPS and free cash flow guidance. We estimate organic growth -- sales growth in 2012 between 1% and 4%. As you know, our level of sales growth can be difficult to predict, and even more so in a period of uncertainty. Reflecting this, we are using a wider range than usual for both sales growth and earnings.","As for currency, in 2011 currency added 2.5% to reported sales for the full year and $60 million to EBIT. In 2012, currency at January rates would reduce reported growth by about 3% and reduce EBIT by approximately $18 million. The major headwinds against operating profit in 2012 are expected to be currency, employee-related expenses and general inflation. ","In 2011, we implemented restructuring actions that cost $45 million to achieve $55 million in annualized savings, of which 1\/4 was realized in 2011 and the remainder is expected largely to happen in 2012. Part of this was done in anticipation of the divestiture of Office and Consumer Products. In 2012, new restructuring actions are currently estimated to cost about $25 million. And as you know, we are always evaluating further opportunities to reduce costs.","As for taxes. In 2012, we're planning for an effective tax rate for continuing operations in the low to mid 30% range and a cash tax rate in the upper 20% range. Our cash tax rate is lower than our P&L rate due to the benefits of past planning activities.","We are expecting pension contributions of at least $75 million in 2012. We say at least because we like to make a pension contribution with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of OCP. In terms of where we stand on the pension, at year end 2011, our U.S. plan in total was $285 million underfunded. Despite our pension contributions in 2011, the underfunded amount increased year-over-year primarily due to a lower discount rate. As for the sale of OCP, we estimate that the combination of net proceeds and free cash flow from the sale of office products will total approximately $400 million. For now, we're going to talk about net proceeds and free cash flow from OCP as one number because they're so interrelated. As we said when we announced the signing of the definitive agreement, we intend to use the proceeds from the transaction primarily to reduce debt, make additional pension contributions and repurchase shares. We expect the majority of the combined proceeds and cash flow from OCP will be used for share repurchases.","Turning to guidance for EPS and free cash flow. Based on estimated sales and other assumptions, including the listed factors, we expect adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2012 of $1.80 to $2.15 and free cash flow of $275 million to $325 million. Earnings in the first quarter are expected to be between 20% and 25% of our full year earnings guidance.","Overall, while 2011 was a challenging year, we took a number of important steps in executing our strategy. We successfully maintained our margins despite significant inflation by raising prices and driving productivity. We demonstrated once again the strong cash flow potential of our businesses regardless of market conditions. We announced the planned sale of Office and Consumer Products. And we've reaffirmed our commitment to financial strength and returning cash to shareholders. This commitment is clear from our debt position, the increase to our dividend and the promise of more share repurchases. ","Now we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess the first question I had is on Pressure-sensitive Materials. The margins that you posted in the quarter, obviously, as you reported were impacted by input cost, raw materials that you've not offset yet. If you had 100% caught up to those raw materials in the quarter -- at the beginning of the quarter, I should say, what do you think your percentage margin would have looked like as opposed to what you posted?","Dean A. Scarborough","Actually, we caught up on the price inflation GAAP in the quarter.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So you were totally caught up. So is that margin then a normal margin going forward?","Mitchell R. Butier","No. Overall, I think, George, there's a couple of things changing with several -- because of several factors that are putting pressure on the actual margin. One is, because we've broken out and discontinued ops, the sales from Pressure-sensitive to Office and Consumer Products are now reported as sales for Pressure-sensitive, but that doesn't change the earnings because that was already in the baseline. But that does have a permanent adjustment overall to the margins within the business. We also, since the beginning of the whole inflation cycle about 6 quarters ago, raised prices about 5%. That puts about a 50 basis point headwind on the margin itself. So protecting margin dollars, but the margin percent goes down somewhat because of the higher sales prices. So those 2 effects, overall, have an impact on your normal base on how you'll be thinking about it. If you look within the quarter, just on the restated basis, you can see that the operating income in Pressure-sensitive was lowest in Q4. That's just because of the timing of certain costs, as well as the volume was a little bit lower on a sequential basis in Q4 than, say, it was in Q3. The average for the full year came out to 8.3%. And so mid-8% is what it was for 2011.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. One last question, I'll turn it over. I realize that the free cash flow, if you will, will be somewhat interrelated with ultimately what you receive net for OCP. But could you tell us, as of December 31, what the basis is for OCP. And even if you can't tell us that, what tax rate will be applied to that net difference between proceeds and basis when you finally do close on the transaction?","Dean A. Scarborough","George, it's a complicated question because there's a number of moving factors. Let me comment on a couple of the key moving parts. Our basis in this business can move quite a bit throughout the year. Because it's a seasonal business, as you know, we build inventories and then it's transferred to receivables in the second and early parts of the third quarter, raising our basis which would reduce our tax charge, if you will, when we sell this thing. But at the same time, that consumes free cash flow to be able to build those -- that working capital down. So the reason that we're looking at it and just talking about one number because it really depends on if this were to not go to second review and close sometime in March or close in June or July or close in September, October. It has a significant impact on the individual components while not having a significant impact on the overall net proceeds. To your question about the tax rate, a big part of the proceeds, the value will be signed to the U.S. We have a normal tax rate you'd expect within the U.S., 35%, actually 37.5% when you consider the state taxes and so forth. And the element signed outside the U.S., there's quite a few different jurisdictions with different tax rates.","Operator","Our following question will be from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Can you help us reconcile the difference on the earnings guidance and also free cash flow guidance? At the midpoint, you're roughly $2 per share on EPS and $2.90 for free cash flow. I understand the CapEx to D&A is spread. But how should we think about working capital also in there?","Mitchell R. Butier","Working capital, you should assume we're going to keep the productivity at the level that we had in 2011.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And what is the D&A estimate for 2012 post the sale of OCP?","Mitchell R. Butier","Well, there is about $50 million of D&A in OCP. So it's about $230 million is what it was in 2011. They'll trend down modestly -- obviously because we're -- our reinvestment ratio is below 100%.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, because I'm still having trouble with the price between earnings and free cash flow.","Mitchell R. Butier","Yes, there's a number of moving parts between free cash flow from continuing ops versus disc ops. And are you talking about from 2011 to '12?","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","No, just looking at the earnings guidance for '12 which excludes...","Dean A. Scarborough","I think -- Ghansham, this is Dean. I think probably the reason is that we're not paying out very much management bonuses here, if any. So that's why the number would look as large as it would for 2012.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, all right, all right, okay. So maybe $250 million is a more sustainable number for free cash flow, is that fair?","Dean A. Scarborough","No. I mean, I -- we would certainly say that we expect our earnings to increase, especially as our business -- hopefully, the economy and our businesses continue to improve. So our goal is to continue to drive free cash flow at a level close to $300 million.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. But wouldn't that also imply, Dean, based on what you just said that CapEx would go up in that scenario also?","Dean A. Scarborough","Right now, we don't see a need to increase CapEx. Certainly, if business improves dramatically, yes, we would have to make some more investments. But we're really getting more and more productivity out of our existing assets.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, all right. And just finally, just sort of a bigger picture question. The vision for the company post the Office Products business, do you see yourselves purely focused on the 2 existing businesses and returning more cash flow to shareholders over time? Or should we expect some sort of a growth focus by M&A on the existing businesses, both RBIS and PSM?","Dean A. Scarborough","Certainly, for the short term, our focus is returning more cash to shareholders. We think we've got 2 strong businesses, both which throw off good free cash flow. We are making investments on organic growth, so beefing up a little bit of marketing spend and some of the R&D and innovation spend, which I think will certainly help us for the long term. We don't have any plans for, certainly, any large acquisitions on a go-forward basis.","Operator","The next question from the line of John McNulty with Credit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a few quick questions. In RBIS, with the restructuring and the kind of focus on deeper cost cuts and also it seems like maybe a little bit lower CapEx spend, should we be thinking about this business more as a cash cow type business going forward? I don't think when you bought Paxar that was what you were thinking. But I guess I'm wondering how you're thinking about that business going forward.","Dean A. Scarborough","Well, it throws off great free cash flow. And what we've been able -- we've always said there have been 2 paths to getting to the margin. One is through growth, which is, frankly, an easier path because we've got high variable net margin from the business. And -- but given the volatility that we've seen in the marketplace in terms of unit volumes, the other path, frankly, is to drive accelerated productivity. And I think the other thing we've learned over the last -- especially over the last 18 months or so, and this is very similar to the -- to what we've learned in the Pressure-sensitive Materials business, we have released a lot of capacity through our work in Lean Six Sigma. And that will allow us to shrink the amount of manufacturing footprint in terms of square footage. So we can get a lot more out of our existing asset base on a go-forward basis. We've made investments in digital printing and workflow, that will pay off. And we've also figured out to invest in information technology instead of investing in a big ERP system, which would take years and years to get a payback. We're really focused on more of the high-value and quick turnaround payback. So we've got both growth and productivity baked into the business. I don't expect apparel unit volumes to decline forever. I mean, I just don't think that's going to happen. Well, we just got a different path forward so we're going to execute against that. In any case, we will have positive free cash flow out of this business.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. On the -- and then with regard to the Pressure-sensitive business, I guess I'm wondering if you're comfortable right now with how the pricing environment is. Like, are we starting to see kind of the pricing discipline? That -- I know a few weeks ago we've been -- we'd really been kind of focusing on and hoping for -- when I look at the margins, it doesn't seem like it's really coming through. So is the industry acting discipline? And how should we think about that going forward?","Dean A. Scarborough","It's hard for me to speak for our competition. But my sense is that the players in the market are focused on making money. And so the other thing that we're doing, frankly, is we've got a lot better information about how pricing works in the market. So our own strategy, kind of regardless the way competitors behave, seems to be working out pretty well. So I think, especially given this last round of inflation, we are seeing a good market here. And there hasn't been a lot of additional capacity added to the business in a number of years, so that's helpful as well.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And just one quick housekeeping. Your tax rate guidance, I'm a little bit surprised that we're not seeing it down a little bit given the sale of Office Products. So what's driving that? Or what's kind of holding the tax rate up where it is?","Mitchell R. Butier","What's holding the tax rate up is the sale of Office Products given that it's more weighted to the U.S. I think intuitively, I would say selling that business would reduce the tax rate otherwise. But it also requires further additional repatriation of cash and so forth into the U.S. And while we don't -- we've got a number of things in place to keep the cash tax rate into the 20s consistent where it's been for the last 5 years, the GAAP tax rate will actually go up. So a nuance of the -- just the geographic mix of income on a pretax basis with the sale of Office and Consumer Products but it's actually not having the effect that you probably think it would.","Operator","Our following question will be from the line of Jeffrey Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Will you begin your share repurchase program in 2012 when you receive the proceeds from the sale of the Office Products business? Or would you begin it before then?","Dean A. Scarborough","Jeff, we don't comment on the timing or amounts of share repurchase. I'll remind you though that we have about 6 million shares, I think, currently authorized for repurchase and that we are well below our target debt rating right now.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. The second thing is the -- I mean it looks like your Pressure-sensitive adhesives business has about $70 million in revenues, which I assume are sales of adhesives to office products. Is there a long-term agreement or some kind of agreement in place with 3M so that we might view those as ongoing sales? Or once the business goes, then those incremental revenues also go?","Dean A. Scarborough","So we have, as part of the deal, a 3-year supply agreement in which they will buy roughly those amounts over the next 3 years. And in return, we give them exclusivity and that agreement could be extended for another couple of years. And our goal in Pressure-sensitive will be to make ourselves just like we are with any other customer, viable and attractive, and 3M will make a decision whether or not they want to make it or buy it.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","In the quarter, how much overhead was reallocated to the ongoing businesses?","Mitchell R. Butier","There was about 20 -- for the full year, there's about $20 million of overhead once we sell Office and Consumer Products for now that's being reallocated. You'll recall though, Jeff, at the middle of 2011, we announced an acceleration of restructuring to reduce some overhead costs, a portion of that was at the corporate office, if you will, in anticipation of the sale of OCP. So $20 million is the allocation impact, but our goal was actually to reduce the total amount of overhead allocated to reduce the actual margin head, if you will, to the remaining businesses.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. How much are the cash restructuring charges next year, Dean, for 2012?","Dean A. Scarborough","It's about $25 million.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Those are cash, okay. And then I guess lastly, did your raw materials in Pressure-sensitive come down sequentially in the fourth quarter as propylene came down? And do you have additional price increases in Pressure-sensitive planned for next year, for 2012?","Dean A. Scarborough","What we saw was a flattening out of the inflation. We obviously were still in somewhat of our catch-up mode in the back half of the year. There are price increases that are currently being implemented in Pressure-sensitive Materials today in some segments and in some geographies. And yes, so that's where we stand. I expect -- our expectation next year is there won't be a big impact in our earnings from either pricing or raw material inflation. In other words, they'll net out.","Operator","The following question will be from the line of John Roberts from Buckingham Research Group.","John E. Roberts - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","The high tax rate, back to the question earlier, implied flat low or flattish global volumes in 2012, up in some areas but down maybe in Europe and offsetting so that we're flat?","Mitchell R. Butier","The tax rate assumes a range of the growth of 1% to 4% total. So it's different by geography, obviously, growing faster in both ends of the range in emerging markets and slower than that in the material markets. The assumption is Europe will be a little bit slower than North America.","John E. Roberts - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","The share -- average shares outstanding guidance of $103 million, that's actually down, I think, 3.5% from the average that you had in 2011, is that correct?","Mitchell R. Butier","Yes.","John E. Roberts - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","All right. So you are going to buy back stock in the second half of the year, I would guess, that went to proceeds. You got the question earlier on it.","Mitchell R. Butier","Yes, that's the expectation. We built that. While we don't comment on the timing or amount, we wanted to give some clarity as to what we estimate the full year average will be.","John E. Roberts - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","And if the full year was down, say, 3.5%, you'd have to buy back double that, really, in the back half of the year to move the full year average down, right?","Mitchell R. Butier","Yes. That will be the math.","John E. Roberts - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","And how does the forward orders look in RBIS? I mean, are we going to see any restocking effect? Your volume numbers would imply, although I didn't ask your RBIS separate from PSM, but the volume numbers would imply, I think, that you're not going to expect any restocking activity in 2012 by customers.","Dean A. Scarborough","We expect -- if you look at last year, you'll notice that our -- we had volume declines of about 7 -- 6% to 7% in the second and third quarter. In the fourth quarter, it was down about 3.5%. What we saw was actually improvements in the U.S. trajectory, and some deprovement in the European trajectory. Right now, it's Chinese New Year so we have 0 visibility on those forward orders for the fall season. And we'll start to see those in March, April, May. So we'll have some visibility. We're not expecting, certainly at the low end of our guidance range, a massive restocking. And we expect some moderate improvement at the high end of our guidance range. This is the one element I think that is probably the most difficult for us to predict, especially in Europe where we just don't know how retailers are going to respond.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We do have a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess first question I had, back to Pressure-sensitive materials. If I look at the incremental margin for the year which would include the effect of your pricing action and the reduction in percentage margins that you'd get from raising prices, I think the incremental I got was something around 6% or so, a little bit above that. Obviously, lower than the 8%, 8.5% range you showed for many of the quarters in your restated financials. How much of that do you think is lost operating leverage? How much of that is perhaps pricing that you didn't recapture? And I ask that because I think in answering John's question, you said you don't expect much net pricing in 2012. So help me understand that 6%?","Mitchell R. Butier","Sorry, George, I just wanted to understand. Are you trying to understand what the movers are on the Pressure-sensitive operating margin from '10 to '11?","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess maybe more just very basically your incremental margin Pressure-sensitive was like 6% in 2011, if I did it correctly. Yet you said you already caught up to raw material pricing. That seems low to me. Is there any impact from pricing competition despite the market being somewhat balanced and rational? Is there anything that would lead to a higher margin in 2012 since you said that net pricing versus inflation will have limited effect in '12?","Mitchell R. Butier","Right. So the overall impact -- if you look first of all from '10  and '11, volume was actually down for Pressure-sensitive, so that actually -- we had less fixed cost leverage, if you will. So that put some pressure on the margins overall. And then that was also largely offset by productivity and other lower costs. As you go forward to 2012, the biggest single factor in 2012 versus '11 is going to be volume, given the variable margins of this business. So if we're at low end of our range, Pressure-sensitive  is the largest business, then that 1% volume growth is really, all other things being equal, just enough to offset inflation, if you will. I'm talking about nonmaterial towards the higher end of that range, then it starts dropping through to the bottom line much faster.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The 1% to 4% organic sales growth that you're guiding to, I realize it's your best estimate, its bottoms up driven by your teams. How comfortable are you about the low end of that range being achieved given what's obviously a very difficult environment to call relative to Europe in particular?","Dean A. Scarborough","Well, here's the way, it's a really good question. At the bottom end of the range, George, let me step back for a second. So we tend to be an early cycle business. So when we saw conservatism in our end-use market supply chains where we saw price increases driving lower unit volume, we really got hit in the second quarter. I mean, we were driving 7% or 8% volume growth in the first quarter. Everything looked great. And then Q2 happened and we slowed down dramatically. We have seen some stabilization in that trend throughout the year. The U.S. has gotten sequentially better. Europe has gotten sequentially worse. And for me, if we see just a relatively stable economy, that should be a benefit to us because we won't see the inventory destocking that obviously happened to us in the second quarter. That should help certainly on a comp basis. If Europe gets hit hard because of financial crisis or the economy there just doesn't respond very well, that's going to hurt us because now we have even higher percentage of our sales and volumes driven by Europe than we did without Office Products. I hope that helps.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. It does. And look, I realize it's a difficult situation trying to call the rest of the year being that we're end of January here. Next question I have, when I look at the severance in RBIS, for example, $6 million in fourth quarter and at least actually more than that in the third quarter. Can you comment how many -- what's the impact of headcount reduction behind that amount of severance? It's a fairly large number.","Mitchell R. Butier","The impact to headcount reductions, it's...","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","How many people are no longer at Avery considering that severance impact?","Mitchell R. Butier","So the biggest single impact from the most recent round of restructuring was around reducing the overhead or operating expenses across the business. And so those tend to be, on average, higher cost employees. When you look at this business, it's dangerous to talk about the averages of headcount because you have some really low-cost employees in emerging markets. Then you also have some employees with higher costs in the SG&A. So overall, if you look at the percent of headcount, it's lower than you would expect relative to the amount of savings on average, because most of it was SG&A reductions. We talked about reducing the SG&A within this business by a few percent.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that answered my question. A couple of others and I'll turn it over. Again on RBIS, Dean, we've talked about before, either at one point in time, you'd look at a 12% operating margin as being realistic. In other times, when we've added all the profitability of the business acquired, what you started with the restructuring, EBIT would be something like $200 million. How much do you think you've lost to the market from competition? Or do you think all of the margin degradation has been purely decremental margin because of volume?","Dean A. Scarborough","I think it's volume because, I mean, if you look at U.S. import data for the fourth quarter, unit volumes were down 12% and our sales which -- and that would've really been a second, third quarter sales trajectory for us, we were down 6% to 7%. So I don't think we're losing share. I would certainly didn't expect unit volumes in apparel to drop like they have in 2011. Okay. So on the margin comment, remember that there are almost 2 full points of margin on RBIS that come from amortization of intangibles. That goes away in 2015. So from my perspective, certainly from a cash perspective, we've got 2 full margin points there. And if this kind of more volatile environment continues, we'll get our cost and our footprint in shape to achieve the margin objectives. That's the goal. We'll get there using a different formula.","Mitchell R. Butier","George, I think in RBIS, the sales in 2011 were roughly flat with where they were in '08 because of the volatility there. As you know, a good portion of the cost base of this business as an emerging market which was wage inflation and so forth, that's the comp and headwind. If you have flat sales, it makes it more challenging to expand margins which is why we talked about continuing to focus on growth but redoubling our efforts around productivity both to reduce costs, as well as reduce the capital base of the business.","Dean A. Scarborough","We're not getting up on growth, George, so that shouldn't be the headline.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. I'll turn it over. I have a last question after everybody else goes.","Operator","Mr. Staphos, you may continue, sir.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. When I look at the fourth quarter tax rate and I add back the $0.03 for the discrete item that was attributable to the continuing ops, I get a rough operating, if you will, tax rate of around 22%, which matches what you said the effective rate is. Maybe I missed it before, how do you reconcile that with what you think your ongoing tax rate of low to mid-30s is going to be?","Mitchell R. Butier","Well, in the fourth quarter, overall you should be focusing on the full year because the fourth quarter is a squeeze, if you will. When we were giving our full year guidance for 2011, we're considering Office Products not being a discontinued operation. If you want to bridge the -- our 2011 tax rate, if you will, to what we're guiding in 2012 from continuing ops, overall just the impact of a couple events that we had, discrete items which were some modest benefits in 2011 that we don't expect to be there in 2012.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","What's the effect of the divestiture in Other Specialty Converting? And what's your normalized CapEx cash?","Dean A. Scarborough","Was that 2 -- I think that was -- there were 2 questions there. I think one was around CapEx, which was about $150 million, is what we're planning for the year. And we sold the product line in Other Specialty Converting back in the early part of the fourth quarter so that definitely had an impact on the sales and earnings.","Mitchell R. Butier","Sales were only about $20 million in that business and proceeds were about $20 million as well. And the EBIT, George, in that business was just a few million.","Operator","Mr. Scarborough, there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to you, sir.","Dean A. Scarborough","Thanks. And I just like to make 2 final points about the company. First is that we have strong businesses with many competitive advantages. Our emerging market footprint, now approximately 40% of sales without Office and Consumer Products, positions us for higher revenue growth. We're making modest investments in organic innovation in our core businesses to strengthen competitive advantage and modestly improve our growth trajectory. Second, we have a strong culture of productivity embedded in the company, which has enabled us to become more efficient and allows us to invest at less than the rate of depreciation. Working capital productivity is another focus. And together, that enables us to generate strong free cash flow. We intend to significantly improve the amount of cash returned to shareholders now that we've met our debt reduction and leverage targets. Thanks, everyone, for joining, and we look forward to speaking with you again.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today.

Please go ahead.","Cindy Guenther","Thank you, Tina. Today we'll discuss our preliminary unaudited first quarter results. Please note that throughout today's discussion, we'll be making references to non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP measures that we use are defined, qualified and reconciled with GAAP on schedules, A-4 to A-7 of the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release and the Appendix of our supplemental presentation materials.","We remind you that we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. These forward-looking statements are made subject to the safe harbor statement included in today's earnings release.","On the call today are Mitch Butier, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Greg Lovins, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I'll now turn the call over to Mitch.","Mitch Butier ","Thanks, Cindy, and good day everyone. We delivered adjusted EPS in line with our expectations for the first quarter, a roughly 10% increase over prior year on a constant currency basis, despite organic revenue coming in a bit lower than usual, as continued strong performance in RBIS was partially offset by soft volume in our two materials businesses.","Label and Graphic Materials posted roughly 1.5% organic growth for the quarter, driven by pricing. Volumes were down as growth in our high value categories was offset by declines in our base businesses as we ceded some share in lower margin, less differentiated categories due to our disciplined approach to raising prices to offset inflation. We expect to win much of this business back over the course of a few quarters.","As for underlying market trends for Label Materials, conditions appear to have been relatively soft over the past couple of quarters not only in Europe and China, as we've discussed previously, but in North America as well. We expect our organic growth rate to improve as we move through the year, driven by gradual focused share gain as well as a modest improvement in underlying market demand.","Despite the soft top-line, productivity efforts supported a healthy operating margin for LGM in the quarter, particularly in light of transition costs associated with the European restructuring. We expect LGM's operating margin to improve through the course of the year, driven largely by benefits from the completion of this project in Europe.","Retail Branding and Information Solutions, once again, deliver both strong top-line growth and significant margin expansion. The base business grew by roughly 3% on an organic basis, while enterprise wide RFID, once again, grew by more than 20%. As you know, apparel represents the vast majority of RFID sales and was again the key driver of most of our growth here in the quarter.","And our pipeline continued to expand, already up roughly 15% from the beginning of this year, with engagements in categories outside of apparel principally, food, beauty and aviation leading the way. Given the strength of our position, strategies and team, we are confident in our ability to achieve our long-term target for RFID solutions; that is 15% to 20% plus growth.","We continue to increase our level of investment to support this growth as we build out our Intelligent Labels platform to enable a future where every item can have a digital twin and digital life.","In Industrial and Healthcare Materials, sales declined modestly on an organic basis, driven by the decline in global automobile production, which more than offset solid growth in other industrial categories as well as strong growth in medical. And, as for margins, we made good progress in the quarter toward achieving our target for this business.","In short, another solid quarter, and we are reaffirming our earnings guidance for the year. While the year is starting off more challenging, we are prepared for it. Our relentless focus on productivity continues to enable us to increase our pace of investment in high value segments, increase our competitiveness, and grow profitably in our base businesses, while importantly, continuing to expand operating margin, which we were able to do again in the first quarter and expect to deliver for the full year.","We remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-term objectives and we will continue to seek opportunities to leverage our positions of strength commercially, operationally, and financially, and lean forward even as others may pull back.","Now I'll turn the call over to Greg.","Greg Lovins ","Thanks, Mitch, and hello everyone. We delivered a solid start to the year with adjusted earnings per share of $1.48, in line with our expectations. As expected, pension settlement charges, almost entirely non-cash, drove a loss in reported income. Reported earnings per share was a negative $1.74, including a $3.13 per share hit from the pension settlement charges, net of tax.","We grew sales by 2.4% on an organic basis, as currency translation reduced reported sales growth by 4.4 points in the quarter. And adjusted operating margin increased by 30 basis points to 10.9%. And we realized $5 million of net restructuring savings in the quarter. And note that we are still incurring transition costs associated with the European restructuring with savings ramping up in the second half of the year.","Turning now to cash generation and allocation, we generated $7 million of free cash flow in the quarter, which was up roughly $27 million compared to the prior year, and recall that free cash flow in the first quarter is typically negative, driven primarily by the timing of employee incentive and customer rebate payments.","In the first quarter, we effectively settled the liabilities associated with the termination of our US pension plan. The cash cost to complete this transaction was significantly better than expected, reflecting competitive market conditions for the purchase of annuities. As we've discussed, we've increased our pace of fixed capital and IT-related spending for a couple of year period, with gross capital spending expected to be up by about $25 million this year compared to last year, to support our organic growth and margin expansion plans.","We do expect capital spending to then moderate over the next few years, consistent with our long-term capital allocation strategy. And we continue to return cash to shareholders as we repurchased roughly 0.9 million shares at an aggregate cost of $89 million and paid $44 million in dividends in the quarter.","Our balance sheet remained strong. Our current leverage position gives us ample capacity to continue executing our disciplined capital allocation strategy, including investing in organic growth and acquisitions, while continuing to return cash to shareholders. We are well positioned to take advantage of any dislocations in the market should they occur over the next few years.","So turning to the segment results for the quarter, Label and Graphic Material sales increased by 1.4% on an organic basis, driven by prior year pricing actions, as the volume mix declined modestly. LGM's high value segments continued to outpace growth of the base business, led by specialty and durable categories which were collectively up high-single digits on an organic basis.","Breaking down LGM's organic growth in the quarter by region, North America was up low-single digits while Western Europe was roughly flat. Emerging markets also grew modestly as strength in South Asia and Latin America was largely offset by organic sales declines in China and Eastern Europe.","Operating margin for the segment was down 50 basis points on an adjusted basis to 12.5%, due to the margin impact of raising prices to offset raw material inflation combined with transition costs associated with the European restructuring. Ongoing productivity initiatives, including material reengineering offset the impacts of lower volume and higher employee-related costs.","At this point, we've covered the cumulative effects of the roughly 18 months of raw material cost inflation that we've experienced through a combination of both pricing actions and material reengineering. Globally, raw material costs were down modestly on a sequential basis in the first quarter and our outlook assumes relative stability through the balance of the year.","Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions; RBS delivered another quarter of strong topline growth, up 7% on an organic basis, driven by both RFID and the base business. Total RFID sales were up by more than 20% for the quarter. The vast majority of which benefited the RBIS segment, with faster growth among European brands and retailers. Adjusted operating margin for this segment expanded by 220 basis points to 12.4%, as increased volume and lower currency related costs more than offset higher employee-related costs in the quarter.","Turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment, sales declined by 1% on an organic basis, driven by the decline in global auto production as automotive applications globally represent about a third of IHM's total sales. Outside of automotive, Industrial categories were up mid-single-digits on an organic basis.","And Healthcare categories grew at a low-single-digit pace with mid-teens growth in medical applications. And we made good progress on the margin front in IHM. Adjusted operating margin increased by 200 basis points to 9.5%, driven by productivity improvements.","Focusing now on our outlook for 2019, we have maintained our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to be between $6.45 and $6.70. We have trimmed our outlook for organic sales growth to roughly 3.5% in light of the softer start to the year. With the midpoint of our EPS guidance range assuming that organic growth for LGM comes in below the long end of its long-term target range, while we continue to expect that RBS will come in above the high end of its long-term range, reflecting continued strength in RFID.","We've outlined some of the other key contributing factors to this guidance on Slide 9 of our supplemental presentation materials. In particular and just focusing on the changes from our assumptions in January, at recent exchange rates, currency translation represents a roughly 2.5 point headwind to reported sales growth for the year, with a pre-tax operating income hit of $27 million. This is up modestly from the $25 million we anticipated previously.","We estimate incremental pre-tax savings from restructuring, net of transition costs, will contribute about $40 million to $45 million, up from our January estimate of $35 million, as we have now completed planning that was still in process at the start of the year. Due to the timing of these actions and related transition cost, roughly 70% of the full year net savings from restructuring will be realized in the back half of the year.","And as I mentioned, total pre-tax charges associated with the settlement of pension liabilities came down to roughly $450 million, with an after-tax EPS hit of roughly $3.15, almost entirely in the first quarter.","In summary, we delivered another solid quarter and remain confident on our ability to deliver on our long-term goals to achieve GDP plus growth and top quartile return on capital.","And we'll now open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Anthony Pettinari of Citigroup Global Markets. Please go ahead.","Anthony Pettinari ","I'm wondering if it's possible to say how LGM volumes kind of trended through the three months of the quarter and maybe what the exit rate looked like and how April volumes have looked like. And I think there was a comment about; you expected modest improvement in underlying demand I think in 2Q. What's driving that specifically around Europe or China?","Greg Lovins","Yes, thanks Anthony. So I think back half of the quarter, particularly March was marginally better, I think, than where we started at the beginning of the first quarter. So overall, a little bit of improvement, as we're exiting the first quarter, at least on a marginal basis. As we look into April, we only have a few weeks so far and we also of the timing of the Easter year-over-year, which is different. So little hard to tell based on those trends. We do seem to be a little bit marginally better in April from where we were in the first quarter with some -- a bit of improvement in Europe. It looks like it's a continuation of the trends from Q1 in North America.","Anthony Pettinari ","Okay, that's helpful. And then you talked about potentially gaining back some of the business in the next few quarters that you lost in 1Q. is that -- can you just -- what's driving that? Is that basically material reengineering just kind of taking its course and readjusting to the marketplace or how do you plan to get back that business?","Mitch Butier","Yes. So Anthony, we've discussed in the past, some periods of inflation with multiple price increases like we've gone through. What we've experienced is similar to what we've seen in the past and it will have elements of share moving between different players as you go through that period and we are willing to take some share risk to be able to make sure we move our market position to where we needed to be for the long-term health of the business and the industry.","And so that's what we did and we saw some of the share loss and it's pretty consistent with what we saw actually in the last wave of inflation a number of years ago. So we just work through by showing continued differentiated service and quality, and through that we can regain the share over time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Edlain Rodriguez with UBS Securities. Please go ahead.","Edlain Rodriguez ","Kind of like a related question, so you had expected Q1 to be soft volume-wise. So, what really changed from the end of January when you had -- when we reported earnings between now for the reduction in volume outlook that 3.5% versus 4%, like what really changed in between?","Greg Lovins","Yes. So, I think, across the segments, it's really LGM just coming in a little bit softer than our expectations were for the first quarter. And as Mitch said, we'll take a measured approach at regaining some of that share back, and we expect some improvement as we move through the year on the overall market trends. So we expect some improvement as we go, but overall, the first quarter did come in a little bit softer than we had expected it to in LGM.","Edlain Rodriguez ","And one quick one on IHM, I mean clearly you're still having some volume issues there, but when do you expect that to kind of correct itself or is it that mainly dependent on auto-related markets to come back?","Mitch Butier","Yes, so as I mentioned earlier, outside of automotive, our business was pretty good in the quarter. So outside of automotive, our Industrial categories grew kind of mid-single digits. Our Medical business grew in the mid-teens, we feel good about that. Automotive, as you said, is really the driver of the challenge we had in the quarter. And that's about 30% of our overall IHM revenue. So the expectations in the automotive market, I think, globally as we move through this year is still a little bit of a challenge in Q2, maybe a little bit better than it was in the first quarter with some improvements in the back half of the year, so, generally looking to improve in line with the overall expected improvement in automotive as we go over the next couple of quarters.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Gaffner of Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.","Scott Gaffner ","Thanks, good morning, Mitch. Good morning, Greg. Just want to continue on LGM for a second, Mitch, if I heard you right, you said you thought there'd be some modest end market improvement at the end of the year, but I'm just trying to understand that, because it sounded like more of the weakness in Europe and China was a little bit more macro related and so I'm just trying to figure out what's driving that commentary?","Mitch Butier","Part of it is just comping the fact that we started to see some of that decline in growth rates in the second half of last year, as we've talked about Scott. So that's a big impact of it and just reading the same macroeconomic forecast and everything else that you all can see as well. So, we don't have limited forward visibility, as you know. So it's not something specific related to what we're seeing within our market other than comps get a little bit easier as well as just macro trends that we're seeing.","Scott Gaffner ","Okay. And then if I look at the quarter itself, you said earnings came in as expected. Clearly we've talked about some LGM weakness, but if I look at RBIS, I would think maybe that's where you kind of got back to even on -- relative to your expectations because the base business is up 3%. I can't remember the last time that the base business outside of RFID has been up that much. And so can you just, is that -- is that what was driving the -- what got you back to EPS as expected and what was driving that RBIS base business growth? Thanks.","Mitch Butier","Yes. So, overall, RBIS, another strong quarter, as you pointed out and we've highlighted and that was definitely part of the offset. The other element here is we did expect to start the year a bit soft and that we knew that the -- it would be more of a challenging volume environment in LGM this year, and we were going to be able to leverage the strengths of what RBIS is going be able to deliver, but also our focus around productivity. We take -- lay out these numbers and these we see as commitments and that's what we're focusing on delivering, and so we've been driving productivity while continuing to execute our strategies commercially across the portfolio, but particularly leveraging our areas of strength within intelligent labels and RBIS in general.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, please go ahead.","George Staphos ","Thanks for the details. My first two questions, first of all, Mitch, can you talk a bit about how you anticipate improving your market share while also maintaining margin? You mentioned the normal strength and tactics that you pursue and in the long-term those actually do lead to margin improvement, as we've seen over the years. But one way you can gain market share back is by becoming more and you had said it, competitive which could initially lead to some lower margin. So, if you could have us get a little bit more of a glimpse in terms of how you plan to attack both of those goals, and then, I had a follow-on?","Mitch Butier","Sure. Yes so primarily, it's basically by focusing our points of differentiation and servicing quarter key points of differentiation, particularly the service, even in the less differentiated product categories and we will engage our customers and it's not just going back after the customers where maybe we lost some shares, it's going after other customers as well, and working with them to gain share. And there is -- we have thousands of customers within each region, as you know.","So it's really just a broad strategy of engagement with the marketplace. We are starting to see a little bit of material deflation, so if we -- if that does actually materialize, that would be something that we wouldn't be looking to hold on to in this environment necessarily, obviously different customer or customer depending where the margins and product -- product and customer margins are, but that's how we'll look at it. It's basically managing the volume, price and mix dynamics customer by customer product-by-product exactly.","We've been talking about for the last few years, which has been a key driver for enhancing our growth rate as well as improving our margins. We'll be executing that strategy going forward.","Greg Lovins","So the other thing on LGM margins would be the restructuring for Europe which is transition costs here in Q1 and Q2. We'll see that transition to savings in the back half. And as we said before, about 70% to 75% of our restructuring savings will be back-half loaded this year. So that's another reason we feel good about continuing to grow margins as we progress across the quarters.","George Staphos ","Thanks, Greg. And that's kind of a good set up from my second question. So first part, Mitch, when should we begin to see visible improvement, not that this quarter was anything to be concerned with, but when do you think you'll be in a position to say yes our goals, our objectives in terms of gaining share and gaining back some of the business that we wanted to gain back will be visible. Is that a 2Q or a 4Q timeframe?","And then on the restructuring, is the additional savings a function of reacting to the market and it being a bit more challenging. You made it seem like it was just more savings that you found through your planning process? So thank you for your thoughts on those two points.","Mitch Butier","Yes. So as far as when we should start to see on the market share perspective, we should take a couple of quarters to start seeing it, and a couple of quarters beyond that effort to be recovered, if you will. So that's what you should generally expect to see and what we've seen in the past. As far as the restructuring and having additional restructuring dollars we basically -- as we were entering the year, we wanted to make sure that we had multiple levers to pull and we've had a number of restructuring actions and ideas over the coming few years and we look to see how can we accelerate those actions, given the -- what we thought might be a more challenging environment.","This is a key strategy for us around driving productivity relentlessly and we've got a number of ideas and so it's really around the acceleration of those. It's not, I would say, in response to the current environment, it's more of an acceleration to ensure we are competitive and can grow profitably in the base, and continue to invest in the high value segments, to be able to drive the outsized growth both there as well as in the emerging markets.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi of Baird. Please go ahead.","Ghansham Panjabi ","I guess, Mitch, on Slide 5 where you kind of break out the organic sales change on a quarterly basis, just looking at last year, clearly 2Q was sort of the high watermark for organic sales, but very, very tough comp, to a lesser extent in 3Q as well. Should we expect the cadence for this year to kind of mirror the inverse of that, just based on what you're seeing on the macro or -- because presumably pricing would also sort of phase down just the comps and also what you're seeing on raw material costs as well?","Mitch Butier","Yes. So, if you look at the -- I think what you're asking is because we had a high level of our organic growth in Q2. What does that create a tough comp? Is that what you're asking Ghansham?","Ghansham Panjabi ","Yes.","Mitch Butier","Yes. So yes and no, that was comping 2017 where we had an abnormally low level of growth. So there is quite a few moving factors, if you recall, around price increases in various regions that caused pull forward as well as timing of holidays particularly impacted '17 which impacts those '18's growth rates. So I would say that you'd expect as far as going forward, particularly in LGM, to see an increase in the organic growth rate through the year as we go forward.","Ghansham Panjabi ","Okay, was just trying to clarify, thank you. And then just, in your prepared comments, you had touched on RFID and the pipeline already up 15% or so, so far this year. How should we interpret that in terms of that level of pipeline growth so early in the year versus your guidance for 20% plus growth in that for RFID for -- on an annual basis? Should we expect it to be higher this year or just -- is that just sort of the normal pipeline filled and that's really for future growth, beyond just this year.","Greg Lovins","Okay. Yes, so the pipeline. I mean, it's up 15% to roughly already just in the first few months, as you said, and it's up more than 50% from where we were a year ago. This is really around our efforts around the investments we've made in business development in categories outside of apparel, while also continuing to leverage our strength within apparel. So these are early stage. And just like with apparel, the areas outside of apparel will take a few years to really get meaningful revenue.","But that's how you should think about it, is that we see great amount of traction and progress for growth in the coming years around apparel and we're looking to build the next waves beyond that. And as far as specifically the revenue growth, we've said that our target is 15% to 20% plus over the long term. We deliver more than 20% last year and again in Q1 and our target is to deliver the 20% plus this year as well, for the full year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Josephson of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Adam Josephson ","Mitch or Greg, just question on raw materials, I think you both mentioned they were down I think modestly sequentially in 1Q. And I think Greg you said you're assuming relative stability thereafter. We follow the global paper markets, there has been quite a bit of weakness in paper prices globally year-to-date and chemicals, to a lesser extent. Can you just help us with what you saw in 1Q sequentially and why you're perhaps not assuming more sequential deflation later in the year, given what's happening to paper prices?","Greg Lovins","Yes. So sequentially, as I mentioned, we did see some favorability from Q4 to Q1. And Adam, I think you mentioned it was mostly for us in chemicals and films, a little bit in paper as well, differs depending on the region in paper but globally a little bit of favorability in paper. So we did see -- we start to see some of that sequential favorability. We expect a little bit more sequential favorability in Q2. Still figuring out exactly how that will land, I think Mitch has mentioned that a few minutes ago. And then right now we're -- right now our projection for the back half is to stay relatively stable. We don't have visibility much past what's happening over the next couple months. So right now, we're expecting to be relatively stable over the back half with some improvement here in the first half, sequentially.","Adam Josephson ","Thanks, Greg. And just in terms of your organic sales growth guidance of 3.5%. I think last quarter when it was 4%, you said about 2.5% is volume, 1.5% is price, correct me if I'm wrong there. What is -- what do you expect the composition to be now?","Greg Lovins","Yes, Adam, so we still expect, I think from LGM perspective, last quarter we said 1 to 1.5 points of price. We still expect a point or so of price in the year within our guidance range for LGM in particular.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John P. McNulty of BMO. Please go ahead.","John McNulty ","With regard to the share loss or share shifts away, where there any regional specifics on that, that you can give us or was it broad-based?","Mitch Butier","We saw it in a number of regions and part of this is also, we don't have firm market data for Q1 in all of our regions yet. So we are hypothesizing what we think the market did. But we think we saw some share loss in a couple of -- in multiple regions because the inflation was kind of happening globally at the same time and our behavior and strategies in each region was consistent around multiple price increases, and we took the risk concurrently.","In North America and Asia, we're comping a little bit -- some higher share that we had in early last year. Again, share points tend to move around a little bit when you go through this period of change, but we saw relatively broad based and some of this is based on hypothesis because we don't have all the firm market data yet for Q1.","John McNulty ","Got it, got it. And then, just with regard to uses of cash, I think we haven't seen much in the way of M&A recently from you and I think last quarter you kind of highlighted that, look it's always hard to time these things. But I guess, can you give us an update on the pipeline in terms of -- in terms of what you see out there and whether it's a target rich environment or if things, maybe given the macro have, have been rolled back a little bit.","Mitch Butier","We still have a good pipeline from an M&A perspective. The -- I'd say, level of interaction has actually increased pace over the last three to six months. You can't tell the timing of these things, as you said. But yeah, that's basically more interaction, more discussions and dialog and we've got a full pipeline and we're -- we see attractive opportunities to continue to leverage our core capabilities, expand on our core capabilities, and increase our exposure to high value segments through M&A, but we will be disciplined in our execution of that strategy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan Securities, please go ahead.","Jeff Zekauskas ","Thanks very much. Your LTM volumes were down a little bit in the first quarter and you do have a difficult comparison in the second quarter, maybe your volumes last year grew 6%. So my guess is, you're probably going to be flat or down in volumes, again, in the second quarter. And you have a reasonable tough comparison in the third quarter. So it looks like volume growth in label and graphic materials will be maybe down a little bit or flat or up a tiny bit in 2019. What makes this year so different than previous years, when you were growing 4% or 5% in volume terms?","Mitch Butier","Yes, I think overall there is two factors, the market being a bit softer is what we saw late last year and beginning to see, and so that would be -- made in the markets down and then specifically around our share, is the other position that we've talked through, and it will take us a few quarters to recover that. So those are the two factors of why our volumes will be down for the year relative to last year.","And you're right, Q2 is not an easy comp by any stretch. I was -- my comment earlier responding to Ghansham's question is that we're somewhat comping a little bit easier comps from the previous year. But it's definitely, I would say, more normalized last year and our growth rate in LGM specifically you'd expect to ramp beginning from where we were in Q1 of 2019.","Greg Lovins","Driving our growth rate last year and continuing here, as I mentioned in the first quarter is continued strength in our higher value segments within LGM, so we grew roughly mid-single-digits in LGM this quarter on high value segments. And in some of the categories like our specialty label categories over the course of last year and the course of Q1, we're kind of high single to low-double digits even. So we feel good about continuing to drive strong growth in the higher value segments within LGM and that's part of what's helped us deliver the stronger growth last year and it gives us some more confidence this year as well.","Jeff Zekauskas ","So I think in March, US box shipments were down about 4%, do you view that as an indicator of that and some way coincides or provides insight into the growth rates of your LGM business in North America, or do you see it as not a relevant indicator?","Mitch Butier","No, we'd look at that as one factor. There is not one or two key indicators for the industry, but that's a factor of overall -- it's just shipping activity and business activity and so forth. So we do see that as an indicator. We also look at what CPG firms are reporting as far as unit volumes and so forth and you're seeing in household and personal care categories, for example, some low revenue growth, but that's actually all price as well and volumes. If you look at the US, they're down modestly particularly in the categories that we feed. So I'd say the macro indicators, you highlighted one Jeff, and some others are what the other data points we look at to understand what's going on in the macro and how it affects, specifically, our industry and our business.","Cindy Guenther ","One important point, Jeff, on the box shipments is that variable information -- material for variable information labels is less than 20% of LGM sales, so important to keep that in mind.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Chris Kapsch of Loop Capital. Please go ahead.","Chris Kapsch ","Yes. So a question, sort of follow up to some of the commentary, but just in terms of the where you saw the business when you provided guidance at the end of January relative to the way the first quarter has developed. Is there a region that is -- and this is focused on LGM, but a region that where weakness is more pronounced than other areas, relative to prior expectations?","Mitch Butier","Yes, Chris, I don't know that it's any one region in particular, I think we saw a little bit of softness, as we mentioned, across the US, across Europe, and across China. So just -- each of them are little bit softer than we had probably expected at the beginning of the quarter. I don't think it's one region specific.","Chris Kapsch ","Okay. And then the follow-up is focused on this. The market share that you ceded in LGM and I guess more in the commoditized roll-label materials, is there -- as you plan to pick some of that market share back up, is there a region that you're more motivated to gain share back relative to other regions and\/or is there a region where the share loss was just more pronounced than other regions? Thank you.","Mitch Butier","So overall, I'd say our focus is broad based. We are the market leader in each region of the world and we've -- given the scale advantages that affords, we will -- we are focused on building upon our position of strength here. And that's -- so that's broad based. As far as any particular region, there is not a particular region I would say played out one more than the other. And again, we don't yet have all the market share data and that will obviously be input as we work through that and determining the exact precise strategy region by region.","But even, when you break it down further, we have thousands of customers. There is lots of different product segments. So when you breakdown down Europe, it's -- Northern Europe is very different from Southern Europe and so forth, and so we look at it at a micro level to work through the strategy. But at a high level, broad based we're going to be deploying, broadly the same strategy globally.","Operator","Thank you. We now have a follow-up question from George Staphos, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, please go ahead.","George Staphos ","Hi, thanks for taking the follow-ons. Mitch, to the extent that you can comment; Greg, to the extent you can comment, the incremental restructuring savings, were they -- are they sourced from different buckets, the proverbial term or they -- how would you have us think about this additional amount relative to what was planned for this year. That's question number one.","And then, same area in terms of margin, when we look at IHM, the margin expansion was better than our model, it's neither here nor there. But was the margin expansion that you saw in the quarter ahead of your expectations? Was it in line and what in particular has been two or three tactics that has been helping you in that segment in terms of recovering profitability? Thank you.","Greg Lovins","Sure George, this is Greg. So on the incremental restructuring I think it's probably largely in SG&A and pretty much spread across the Materials businesses. So, at the beginning of the year, as Mitch talked about, we had some ideas and plan that we accelerated, some of that in IHM which kind of feeds into your second question about part of why we're continuing to be confident in growing the margin there and hitting the 10% target we have for this year, and then, some of that in LGM really across the region. So it's not one specific action and it's a number of smaller actions spread across both of our materials businesses and regions.","In IHM, as you said, we feel good about the margin trajectory we had in the first quarter, we continue to target 10% margin for the full year this year and it's a combination of things helping us deliver that. I think we talked about before. Maybe that's we're following tactics we used in RBIS a few years ago, around simplifying organization structure, moving decision-making closer to our customers in the regions where we have that contract with the customer, improving our speed, improving our efficiency from that perspective and improving our cost.","So we're focused on that in addition to some of the segmentation initiatives, looking at pricing and complexity reduction where necessary, so really a combination of factors helping us -- giving us confidence in our ability to grow the IHM margins as we move through the year.","George Staphos ","In some ways it's a playbook from RBIS. Anyway, thanks. I'll turn it over.","Greg Lovins","Yes, exactly.","Mitch Butier","Indeed.","Operator","Thank you. Mr. Butier, there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to you for any closing remarks.","Mitch Butier ","Okay. Well, thank you everybody for joining the call. Again, another solid quarter, a quarter of -- despite the some soft top line in the materials business, I think we've demonstrated the resiliency of the business and our ability to deliver on our commitments and we are committed to delivering our long-term objectives and confident in our ability to do so, given our exposure to high value segments and ability to drive outsized growth there as well as the emerging market exposure and to continue to deliver top quartile returns. So thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Please go ahead, madam.","Cindy Guenther","Thank you, Dmitri. Today we\u2019ll discuss our preliminary unaudited fourth quarter and full year results. Please note that throughout today\u2019s discussion we will be making references to non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP measures that we use are defined, qualified and reconciled with GAAP on Schedules A-4 to A-8 of the financial statements accompanying today\u2019s earnings release and in the appendix of our supplemental presentation material.","We remind you that we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results.

I am pleased to report another year of excellent progress towards our long-term strategic and financial goals. Sales grew 8% on a constant currency basis, adjusted operating margin expanded by 50 basis points and adjusted EPS grew 24%.","Our Label and Graphic Materials business continues to reach new heights. Retail Branding and Information Solutions posted both strong topline growth and significant margin expansion, and we made progress in expanding the platform for Industrial and Healthcare Materials.","This past year marked the company\u2019s sixth consecutive year of strong topline growth, margin expansion and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. This consistent performance reflects the resilience of our industry-leading market position, the strategic foundations we have laid and our agile and talented workforce.","Our strategic playbook continues to work for us, as we focus on four overarching priorities; driving outsized growth in high-value product categories; growing profitably in our base businesses; relentlessly pursuing productivity improvement and remaining disciplined in our approach to capital management.","Our strong topline growth in 2017 reflected the balance of contributions from acquisitions and organic growth ,driven by our large presence in emerging markets, as well as in our faster growing high-value categories such as specialty labels, industrial tapes, and of course, RFID.","Emerging markets and high-value categories are the two key catalysts for growth across our entire portfolio. Roughly half of our total sales are now linked to one or both of these catalysts and we continue to target above average growth from them over the longer term.","In addition to the successful execution of our strategy to expand in high-value categories, we also delivered solid growth in our base businesses, by carefully balancing the dynamics of price, volume and mix, by reducing complexity and by tailoring our go-to-market strategies.","Now equally important the topline results, we also maintained our strong focus on continuous productivity improvement. Product reengineering, lean operating principles and the effective execution of our multiyear restructuring plans remain key to our success, not just as a means to expand margins, but to enhance our competitiveness, particularly in our base businesses and provide a funding source for reinvestment.","Now I will just touch briefly on how each of these strategies are playing out in the segments. Label and Graphic Materials, our highest return business delivered another year of strong topline growth and continued margin expansion, reflecting continued above average growth from our exposure to emerging markets, our strategic focus on high-value categories and the ongoing contribution from productivity initiatives.","Our strategy to expand our position in high-value categories, which include specialty labels, as I mentioned earlier, as well as graphics and reflective solutions is working. We delivered strong organic growth for these products in 2017 and further increased our exposure to them, with the acquisition of Hanita Coatings.","Now on the productivity front, LGM consistently delivers. Our focus on material reengineering and continuous improvement through lean enables us to profitably grow our base business, while maintaining and expanding our strong returns.","Retail Branding and Information Solutions delivered both strong topline growth and significant margin expansion, driven by the execution of our transformation strategy and continued strength in RFID.","In terms of the base business, sales increased across most product lines and multiple customer categories, including performance athletic, premium and fast fashion. Our ability to grow this business in the face of challenging retail environment underscores the success of our multiyear transformation strategy, as our improvement in service, flexibility and speed continue to resonate with customers.","RFID grew nearly 20% in 2017. We expect this business will represent close to $300 million in sales this year, as we continue to see increasing engagement with apparel, retailers and brands across all stages of the pipeline, as well as promising early-stage developments in other end markets.","RBIS\u2019 operating margin expanded 150 basis points in 2017 and we expect to be within our 2021 target range for this segment already this year. The team has done a tremendous job transforming RBIS into a simpler, faster and more competitive business over the past two years and we are pleased with the momentum we are seeing there.","Turning to Industrial and Healthcare Materials. We expanded our platform here with sales up 30% on a constant currency basis, driven by both acquisitions and a return to solid organic growth in the back half of the year. Now while I am pleased with our progress on the topline, operating margin is not where we wanted to be, due in part to the impact of acquisitions and growth related investments, but also from a number of operational challenges, as I\u2019ve discussed over the past couple of quarters.","We still have work ahead of us to embed strongly in operating principles and practices into this business to duplicate the operational excellence that epitomizes LGM. We expect to get traction on our productivity initiatives by the middle of this year and I remain confident that this business will achieve our long-term growth and margin targets.","As many of you know, this segment serves attractive high-value markets where we are currently under penetrated and where we can leverage our core capabilities. Given this growth potential we are investing disproportionately to expand our platform here, particularly through M&A.","The acquisitions we completed in 2017 in both of our Materials segments, Yongle Tape and Finesse Medical and IHM, along with Hanita Coatings and LGM are all excellent examples of how we are using both on M&A to accelerate our portfolio shift to higher value categories.","I am pleased with our overall progress in executing the strategy. We are on pace to achieve the returns we have targeted from acquisitions we completed over the past two years, while adding new capabilities that are key to our long-term value creation strategy.","Carefully planned and executed M&A is just one key element of our highly disciplined approach to capital allocation. Over the past couple of years we increased our overall pace of investment, including for organic growth and we are picking up that pace even further in 2018.","On the fixed assets side, 2017 spending was focused on capacity additions in both Europe and Asia. This year capital spending will continue to be concentrated in Asia, while we will also be making a number of investments in the Americas to support our strategy for long-term profitable growth.","In addition to the pickup in CapEx spend we are also increasing our level of SG&A investment, particularly with respect to RFID, as we continue to build our intelligent labels platform. This increased pace of investment is commensurate with our consistent GDP plus organic growth and ability to maintain top quartile returns on capital, while preserving ample capacity to continue delivering cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Overall, I am pleased with our progress over the last few years and again in 2017, and expect to maintain this momentum in 2018, with another year of strong topline and double-digit EPS growth.","Now I will turn the call over to Greg.","Greg Lovins","Thanks, Mitch. Hello everybody. I will provide some additional color on full-year results then I will walk you through our fourth quarter performance and our outlook for 2018. As Mitch said, 2017 represented another year of great progress towards our long-term financial targets.","On slide seven of the supplemental presentation materials, we included our progress against our scorecard for the five-year goals ending in 2018. As you can see here, we are on track to meet or exceed these goals.","We have delivered cumulative growth and adjusted EPS of 17% and significantly expanded return on capital, adjusting for the impact of U.S. Tax Reform in Q4. We believe our returns remain in the top quartile relative to our peers, a position we expect to maintain, while increasing our pace of investment for both organic growth and M&A.","We continue to have ample capacity for these investments, while returning cash to shareholders in a disciplined manner. Our balance sheet remained strong but our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio on the low side of our targeted range at year end.","In last March we introduce a new set of long-term targets, which carries through 2021. Now that we are only one year into this cycle, 2017 performance was on pace to deliver the new targets. Given the diversity of our end markets, our strong competitive advantages and our resilience as an organization to adjust course, we are confident in our ability to deliver to a wide range of business cycles.","So let me now turn to more recent performance, our results for Q4. I will first address the transition to the new U.S. tax code, which had a negative impact on reported earnings in the fourth quarter, while improving our outlook going forward.","We recorded a tax charge in Q4 of approximately $172 million or $1.91 per share, resulting in an effective tax rate for the quarter of 138% and 52% for the full year. This charge include the tax on deemed repatriation of accumulated untaxed foreign earnings, as well as the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and this amount reflects our provisional estimate of the impact of the new legislation. We made to update this assessment over the coming months as new information becomes available, including interpretations of the legislation by various regulatory bodies.","Our adjusted tax rate was 28%, which represents our estimate of where we would have ended the year in the absence of Tax Reform. This is consistent with the guidance we have provided in October and down from an approximately 32% for the same period last year. Looking forward, we anticipate that our 2018 tax rate will be in the mid-20s and we expect that rate to be sustainable.","So focusing now on the underlying operating results for the quarter, our adjusted earnings per share was $1.33, up 34% compared to the prior year, which was above our expectations due to strong sales growth and margin expansion.","We grew sales by 9.1% excluding currency, with 4.7% organic growth and 4.4% from acquisitions. Currency translation then added 2.8% to reported sales growth in the fourth quarter, within approximately $0.04 benefit to EPS compared to the same period last year.","And our adjusted operating margin increased by 90 basis points to 10.3%, as the benefit from higher volume and productivity more than offset higher employee-related costs and the net impact of pricing and raw material costs. And productivity gains this quarter included approximately $16 million of net restructuring savings, most of which benefited the RBIS segment.","And free cash was $166 million in the quarter and $422 million for the full year, up roughly $35 million compared to prior year, driven largely by our higher operating income. And in the quarter we repurchased approximately 200,000 shares as an aggregate cost to $25 million. For the full year, we repurchased 1.5 million shares at the cost of $130 million and we paid $156 million in dividends. And net of dilution our share count at year end declined modestly compared to 2016.","So turning to the segment results for the quarter, Label and Graphic Materials sales were up 6% excluding currency, reflecting 1 point of benefit from the acquisition of Hanita. Organic sales growth of 5%, reflected continued strong growth of our high-value product lines, driven by specialty labels and graphics. Our Q4 growth also benefited by about a 0.5 point from some pre-buying by customers in advance of price increases announced for January.","And breaking down LGM\u2019s organic growth by region, North America and Western Europe were both up mid-single digits, and our growth in emerging markets was also up mid-single digits, with continued strong growth in South Asia and mid single-digit growth in China, which was partially offset by soft results in Eastern Europe. It is important to note that while we saw some timing related quarterly volatility in China during 2017, our full year growth in this important market was in the high-single digits.","Our operating margin for this segment was strong, up 70 basis points on an adjusted basis to 12.2%, as the benefits from increased volume and productivity more than offset higher employee-related costs and a negative net impact from pricing and raw material costs.","The sequential impact of raw material inflation was in line with our expectations for the quarter and while increases to-date has been gradual and relatively modest, we are expecting some further sequential inflation in the first quarter.","We continue to address this through a combination of both product reengineering and pricing, and we have announced price increases in all regions over the past three months and we will take further actions as necessary.","So shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions, the RBIS team delivered another excellent quarter, as the team continues to execute extremely well on its business model transformation, enabling market share gains while driving significant margin expansion.","Regional empowerment has moved decision-making closer to the market and improved local accountability, helping to speed and flexibility in the competitive advantages, and we continue to build a more efficient cost structure.","RBIS sales were up 5% organically, driven by strength in both RFID and the base business, as well as the continued lift related to the 2018 World Cup. For the full year we do estimate that the World Cup related sales contributed roughly 80 basis points to organic growth in RBIS.","Our volume growth has outpaced apparel unit imports into the U.S. and Europe for number of quarters now, giving us confidence that we are gaining share, with the performance athletic, premium and fast fashion segments leading the way sales.","Sales of RFID products grew at the mid-teens rate for the quarter and we are targeting 15% to 20% plus compound annual growth for RFID over the long-term. Although, we do of course expect some volatility in the growth rate in any given quarter or year based on timing of customer implementations.","And adjusted operating margin for this segment expanded by nearly two full points to 11.9%, driven by the benefits of productivity and higher volume, as well as the reduction in intangibles amortization. These benefits were partly offset by higher employee-related related costs and the net impact of pricing in raw material costs.","And finally, turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment, with the benefit of Yongle and Finesse Medical acquisitions, sales rose 57% ex-currency. Our organic growth rose 6%, reflecting strength in both industrial tapes and Vancive medical products.","Adjusted operating margin declined by roughly 2 points, due to the impact of acquisitions and other investment spending, as well as the near-term operational challenges that Mitch discussed. Over the coming years, we expect to see operating margin gradually expand to LGM\u2019s level or better, achieving our long-term targets for this business by 2021.","So turning now to our outlook for 2018, our anticipated adjusted earnings per share -- we anticipate adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.70 to $5.95. We have outlined some of the key contribute factors to this guidance on slide 14 of our supplemental presentation materials.","We estimate that organic sales growth will be approximate 4% for the year in line with the range we have experienced over the last few years. And we expect the impacts of -- impact of acquisitions on sales to be approximately 1.5% from closed deals.","Our recent exchange rates, currency translation represents a roughly 2.5 point addition to reported sales growth and a pretax operating income tailwind of roughly $20 million. And we estimate the incremental pretax savings from restructuring actions will contribute between $30 million and $35 million in 2018, much of which represents a carryover benefit of actions initiated in 2017.","And as I mentioned, we expected tax rate in the mid-20s and we have assumed 25% for purposes of our EPS guidance. And we anticipate spending roughly $250 million on fixed capital and IT projects.","And note that while we have been increasing our pace of investment, our outlook for 2018 is consistent with the cumulative five-year spending target under our long-term capital allocation plan, which we communicated last March. And finally, we estimate average shares outstanding assuming dilution of 89 million shares to 90 million shares.","So in summary, we are pleased with the strategic and financial progress we made against our long-term goals this year. And we are committed to delivering exceptional value to our strategies for long-term profitable growth and disciplined capital allocation.","And with that, we will now open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Matt Krueger","Hi. Good morning. This is actually Matt Krueger sitting in for Ghansham. How are you doing?","Mitch Butier","Good, Matt. Good morning.","Greg Lovins","Good Matt. Thank you.","Matt Krueger","Good, good. So looking back at 2017, how much inflation did you see across the raw material basket in your businesses? And then what are you baking into your expectations for 2018 as far as raw material inflation goes?","Greg Lovins","Overall in 2017, as we mentioned, I think, last quarter, we had relatively modest inflation, particularly in the back half of the year and in Q4 it came in pretty much in line with what we had expected it to be. We are seeing some sequential further lift in inflation in Q1. I think, overall, our expectation for the full year in 2018 versus 2017 is probably low-single digits in terms of the rate of inflation versus last year.","Matt Krueger","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, taking a step back, looking at your business, you\u2019ve averaged 4% organic growth since 2013 in what looks like a relatively tepid macroeconomic environment. Are there any factors that you would \u2013 that would keep you from accelerating organic growth above this level moving forward, especially as pricing contributes more and the global macro seems quite a bit more favorable?","Mitch Butier","I mean our guidance of 4% basically just reflects exactly what you said, the organic growth we have had the last number of years and there have been puts and takes over those years as well. So we thought that was the right number to go with from a guidance perspective.","As you look into \u201818, clearly with price increase coming through, if the macro were to improve than that would be tailwinds to that number, I think, there is question about how many macro tailwinds are really are and how long they will last, but then second you have got to think about headwinds that we have as well.","Greg talked about the World Cup growth that we had in 2017 in RBIS that won\u2019t continue, as well as the pre-buy from the price increases that we announced that we receive the benefit from in Q4 as well, so few things going both ways.","Matt Krueger","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. That\u2019s it from me. Thanks.","Mitch Butier","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.","Scott Gaffner","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Mitch Butier","Hi, Scott.","Greg Lovins","Hi, Scott.","Cindy Guenther","Hi.","Scott Gaffner","Hi, Cindy. Just a follow-up on the raw material inflation, if I remember correctly, I think it was last quarter, maybe was for the full year, you had about a 25 basis point drag on gross margins from inflationary pressures, is that -- did that continue over into the fourth quarter and how should we think about the underlying inflationary pressure for maybe gross margin perspective in 2018?","Greg Lovins","Yes, Scott. So I don\u2019t think we quoted a number last quarter, what we had expected in \u201817. I think as we said was relatively modest net impact last year between price and inflation. As I said, we are seeing some sequential inflation as we enter 2018 and as you know our approach is two-fold to deal with that, one, we look at product reengineering, see if we can take material costs out of our products and we also then look at pricing.","So across 20 year, at the very end of 2017 we announced price increases or have implemented them in Q4 or early Q1 in all regions across the LGM business. So we are continuing to deal with that and we feel relatively comfortable with our ability right now to manage the inflationary pressures between those two levers that we have. So we do see some net modest impact probably in the first part of the year, but we expect that to be able to manage that.","Now if inflation comes in stronger, continuous sequential increase as we move through the year, I think, as you know, as we have said in the past, it takes us a quarter or maybe two quarters to deal with that as it goes, but right now based on what we are seeing right now with the price increases we have announced in the material cost reengineering we feel relatively comfortable being able to manage through that.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. And on the transportation side, obviously, there has been a lot of concern about rising transportation costs both rail and truck-related, I would assume some of your rolls go on trucks and some on rail, but can you sort of give us a breakdown at exposure there and what you\u2019re most concerned about that, if you have the ability to pass through that transportation cost?","Greg Lovins","Yeah. So we do obviously have some materials that move on trucks and rail, and we do see some increases there over the last couple of years, I think, in North America, some of the factors you mentioned and some of our pricing actions do take into account the either increases in those kind of macro issues on the transportation, perspective, as well as fuel, sometimes we deal with that through surcharges as well. But right now we factor that into how we think about pricing actions across each of the regions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup Global Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Anthony Pettinari","Good morning.","Mitch Butier","Good morning.","Greg Lovins","Good morning.","Anthony Pettinari","Mitch, you talked about investment in the Americas to support growth and I wasn\u2019t sure if you were referencing LGM or RBIS or both. Are there any details you can give in terms of product categories or geographies that you\u2019re focusing on in terms of the investments?","Mitch Butier","Yes. The investment focus overall is what I was commenting was LGM and RBIS, RBIS specifically around RFID and the rest is LGM. And there are \u2013 we are looking at some expansions for growth in the Americas particularly in the U.S. and Mexico are some expansion that we are planning right now.","We have not invested in the North America region for quite some time, well over a decade and some of the discussion we had around Luxembourg, we are expanding there, we have gone through a period of little investment there as well. We consider the amount of the market and our own growth. It\u2019s time to ramp that up again.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then you also referenced some early-stage development in non-apparel RFID. I don\u2019t know if you can give any details there and then just kind of related question, there has been a lot of attention paid to Amazon, Amazon Go store that I don\u2019t think is using RFID. Any thoughts on competition potentially down the road to RFID from cameras and just general thoughts there?","Mitch Butier","Sure. So broadly speaking about the areas outside of apparel, we are seeing a number of small opportunities that are bubbling up, but there is a three end markets specifically that we are focusing on accelerating the development of that, aviation, food and beauty.","There has been quite a bit of \u2013 we have got a few pilots going on with a couple of end customers in those spaces and we have actually seen relatively small pickup in some of our growth, a lot of that round pilot stage, but we see a tremendous amount of opportunity in the space.","And if you think about food, a lot of similarity to apparel in some way, so one is just desire to increase and improve the supply chain and reduce the manual labor involved with managing that supply chain.","And then the focus on freshness, in apparel you have season that create a certain level of parishability. Well, fresh foods definitely have an even higher degree of that. And what we see customers trying to do is reduce their cost by reducing waste but also as part of their sustainability drives to reduce the amount of wasted food in the network. So those are three areas where we are seeing progress.","As far as your question about Amazon Go, I am not going to comment on any specific company that we work with. But yet that Amazon Go specifically, my understanding does not use RFID. We have been consistent in saying that we actually see the Internet of Things and the connection between the physical and virtual world is going to be huge driver for a number of technologies and with the proliferation of cameras and AI and sensors, we think that all these technologies are going to complement each other.","And what RFID really provides is in areas we have a tremendous amount of SKU complexity, parishability and lack of line of sight, RFID really place in that category. So we think there is going to be a complementive technology that support this whole drive towards IoT more broadly.","We are also seeing unmanned stores, convenience stores and the like in Asia that are definitely using RFID. So different and companies are attempting different technologies as they look to rollout a more automated customer interface for food and convenience stores.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","George Staphos","Thanks. Hi, everyone. Good morning.","Mitch Butier","Hi, George.","George Staphos","Lots of detail and congratulations on the year. I guess, first question I had to the extent that you can comment, the investments that you\u2019re seeing in LGM and U.S. and Mexico, is there way to put a revenue potential to the level investment or quantify the level investment, we are talking about one new code or two new code or something totally different?","Mitch Butier","Yeah. We haven\u2019t announced the complete extent of the investments that we are making in Mexico. We did announced that we are putting a small coder in that location to serve the Mexican, as well as the export market in Central America to support the growth that we are seeing in those regions and again in the U.S. is the support -- the growth in U.S. and Canada, we have been seeing a good amount growth. We have not articulated the exact amount of dollar investment overall, George.","George Staphos","Okay. But we are talking about two coders here then, correct?","Mitch Butier","Yes.","George Staphos","Okay. Now second question, thanks for that, can you talk -- and maybe you had mentioned that, I had missed and if I did, I apologize in advance, can you talk about the productivity issue that you\u2019re seeing in IHM and what makes you comfortable that you can apply the traditionally lean approach to what is clearly in some way similar to LGM in terms of the product, but in many ways is more complex in terms of SKUs and for that matter high-value SKUs which could in turn create issues in terms of productivity and spoilage and the like. So any thoughts it would be helpful?","Mitch Butier","Sure. So when we just look at the plant and supply chain, lot of similarities with LGM, so that\u2019s what give us the confidence from a starting point and we are seeing progress in certain regions from instilling this discipline around lean sigma for example. We have connected the R&D team from this business with the LGM team part of one organization. We are cross pollinating people, pulling people in from LGM, from RBIS, where we also have a strongly lean culture as well and that is what gives us the confidence, both cross-pollination of leadership, as well as taking the process and process technology from elsewhere in the business and instilling it within IHM. That coupled with, we are getting early traction in some regions, but not the amount of traction that we wanted to be at this stage.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with UBS Securities. Please go ahead.","Edlain Rodriguez","Thank you. Just quick follow-up on IHM, like those operational issues that you are having, like how long do you think it will take you to address that, is it something that\u2019s going to take that more than a year or is that something we should see more progress no sooner?","Mitch Butier","Yeah. We said \u2013 yeah, so we said that we would expect to be seeing traction on the middle of the year. I think from the context perspective, when you look at the margins where they are, big portion of that is M&A, as well as growth investments, it\u2019s about a point, so $1 million worth is the upper in the quarter is the operational challenge I am referring to, so I think we will be on a good trajectory by the middle of this year.","Edlain Rodriguez","Okay. Yeah. That makes sense. And in terms of opportunities you are seeing in that segment for bolt-ons and stuff, I mean, is it still as attractive as you earlier expected?","Mitch Butier","Yes. What we are seeing with both working through our pipeline, we continue to see attractive opportunities that we are evaluating, as well as just looking our own business, I mean, the industrial tapes business, which is one of the key areas of focus was up almost 10%, the Vancive medical business where we made a small acquisitions this past year also up double digits the second half of this year, so both in the performance of our business, as well as what we are seeing out there in the pipeline give us that confidence that this is right place to keep going.","Edlain Rodriguez","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan Securities. Please go ahead.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. You took $172 million tax charge and I guess there\u2019s $29 million in repatriation tax that\u2019s included in that. Are your -- how does this change your cash taxes payable? In other words, I guess, the first quarter or second quarter, how much cash will come out from this charge and how does that compare to say previous years when you have taxes that you need to pay in the first quarter or first half of the coming year?","Greg Lovins","Yeah. So, overall, Jeff, with the tax code, the transition tax to the new tax code, you basically have seven years or eight years to pay that, so we do not expect anything more than a modest cash tax impact certainly in 2018. Overall, I think, as I said, we are looking at roughly mid-20s effective tax rate. We think our cash tax rate will be somewhere in the low 20s on a go forward basis as well.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay. And your accounts payable was a little bit more than a $1 billion up from about $850 million last year. Is there something unusual there or you are happy having a higher level of payables or what you -- what accounts for that lift? And your inventories are up about $100 million year-over-year at 20%. Can you comment on that lift as well?","Greg Lovins","Yeah. So on both of those pieces, fair amount of that is related to acquisitions, so we brought on a number of acquisition this year and added of course the working capital related those, as well as currency. So currency has had an impact particularly in Q4 versus prior year, last year was one of the -- Q4 was one of the lower rates in 2016 and one of the higher rates in 2017.","So I think those two pieces overall had a big impact on that dollar increase. I think, overall, from a working capital efficiency perspective, we ended the year fairly well within our expectations, maybe actually a little bit better and our operational working capital pretty much in line with where we ended the prior year in 2016 from an operation working capital percent perspective.","That\u2019s despite the fact that as we have said before, we have some higher working capital ratios in the emerging regions, where we are growing a little bit more. So overall we feel pretty good about the progress we made from a working capital perspective in the year.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay. Thank you so much.","Mitch Butier","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Adam Josephson","God morning. Thanks everyone and congratulations on another really good quarter.","Mitch Butier","Thanks.","Adam Josephson","Mitch or Greg, just one on North America, I think, you said it was up mid-single digits in the quarter and I \u2013 if memory serves, it\u2019s been accelerating throughout the year, correct me, if I am wrong there. Is this as simple as the economy has gotten steadily better or is there anything more that you would point to and then what are your expectations for that region in \u201818?","Greg Lovins","Yeah. So, I think, Adam, overall, as we said, we also had some pre-buy in the fourth quarter relate to some of the price increases we\u2019d announced for January, but even with that we had grown kind of that low to mid single-digit range in North America in the quarter. That\u2019s relatively consistent I think what we saw in the third quarter as well. So, overall, we have just seen a relatively good market situation there in the U.S. over the last few quarters, but no major changes that I\u2019ve seen in the fourth quarter from a macro perspective.","Adam Josephson","Yeah. Correct me if I am wrong, in years past, Greg, it was growing quite a bit lower than that, right, maybe 1%, 2% max?","Greg Lovins","Yes. It was growing less and part of that the market was growing a little bit slower than Europe, it was something that commented on the past. If you recall, Adam, we also had some share challenges couple years ago and we basically made some adjustments and have regain that share late last year early this year and share has been stable since.","Adam Josephson","Thanks. But just a couple others, the uses of capital, can you just go over what your preferred users are be it M&A, buyback, et cetera, at this moment?","Greg Lovins","Yeah. So our capital allocation approach hasn\u2019t really changed from what was communicated in the past. We typically look to spend about 30% of our available cash reinvesting in the business through CapEx and restructuring, about 20% through dividends and then the other half we have available essentially for both M&A and buyback. So that\u2019s a way we look at it and that\u2019s how we have communicated in the past, we are remaining relatively consistent with that.","Adam Josephson","Thanks, Greg. And just one housekeeping one, tax rate, excuse me, FX rate assumption for \u201818 euros specifically?","Greg Lovins","Yeah. Pretty close to $1.20 in the high one teens.","Adam Josephson","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Kapsch with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.","Chris Kapsch","Yeah. Good morning. I had some questions about the \u2013 just the price increase initiative and the implementation. I think you said that you are acknowledging raw material inflation as we enter \u201818 and you also said, I think, it takes maybe a quarter to successfully implement broad-based price increase efforts? And then presumably we are talking about LGM segment, just wondering if -- are you suggesting that margin in that segment will be down for the first quarter? And then also what I\u2019ve seen or heard from context in the industry is that some competitors came out with sort of high single-digit price increases, yours is probably at least announced more mid-single. Can you just talk about like maybe the delta versus what the industries pushing for and where you guys really expect to net out?","Mitch Butier","Yeah. So, Chris, traditionally it\u2019s taken us a few months, as you say, to pass along price increases once we see the inflationary trends. So that that definitely has been the trend about four months. We think it\u2019s probably less than that, less of an impact usual specifically on Q1.","And then as far as the level of price increases, you sound like you have seen some of our letters. We have \u2013 we are not going to comment on where our competition specifically came out and it\u2019s different by geography, and perhaps, customer set, so I don\u2019t want to comment on what their actions are overall.","But we are putting in through price increases that are necessary for us to offset the inflation after consideration of our material reengineering efforts which reduce the raw material cost of our products. And given our strength of our R&D group and capabilities around innovation here, we would expect our ability to continue to be have a greater offset, if you will then perhaps others may.","Chris Kapsch","Okay. Then if I could follow up on just the opportunities in RFID focused, I guess aviation, food and beauty. When apparel started adopting item level RFID, the case from apparel companies basically inventory accuracy in preventing stock outs that sort of lift sales, not just help with their inventory, but lift sales and the ROI was pretty compelling. I am just wondering how parallel are the cases for adoption in these other segments for item level -- I guess, aviation sort of unique, I am assuming you are talking about baggage tags, but in these other areas, if you could just compare and contrast the ROI for just from adoption?","Mitch Butier","Aviation, yeah, absolutely, so aviation is unique, but follows some of the same principles around high degree of SKU complexity and perishability, you have got to get the bag to the customer pretty quickly once they disembark from the plane.","And as far as, if you look at beauty, a lot of parallels to apparel and if you think about beauty, a lot of it\u2019s sold within the department stores, the same place where apparel is so forth and so the value proposition is very similar.","And with food it\u2019s equal, but probably weighted heavier toward reducing waste overall and ensuring freshness. And we have all seen some large brands that have been impaired from having safety concerns around fresh foods and so forth. So ensuring safety and quality, as well as reducing waste, both for cost reasons, as well as for sustainability drives.","Chris Kapsch","Thank you for the color.","Mitch Butier","Thank you.","Operator","We have a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","George Staphos","Hi. Thank you for taking the follow on. I will ask them in sequence and leave you to get onto the rest of your day. So, first of all, in terms of the 15% growth in RFID, could you give us some additional color perhaps in terms of how much might that have been new customers, new launches, trials, organic growth with existing customers?","Secondly, Greg, I would imagine or Mitch that, with tax policy change or and given where your stock price is that and given your history as an EVA company that would tend to put more focus in the future investment on M&A and organic growth versus buyback, but if you have any additional color there?","And then, lastly on the productivity issues and IHM where you\u2019re not necessarily where you want to be, not to make too big a deal relative to the size of the segment also of Avery, since it\u2019s mostly about cross-pollination and training, why hadn\u2019t that already been done to your satisfaction? Thanks guys and good luck in the quarter?","Mitch Butier","Thank you, George. That\u2019s a three-point question. So RFID, your question about what\u2019s driving the adoption, it\u2019s basically continued trends from what we have seen in the past and there is a few big retailers or brands that have moved one or two a year and then a number of smaller ones as well. So we are seeing major retail moving into full adoption, number of others moving in the pilot and then in addition to that many specialty retailers and brands various state of pipeline.","So each stage of the pipeline, whether it\u2019s from assessment in business case through piloting, partial rollout or full rollout, each day the pipeline has increased from where we were a year ago. And that \u2013 add to that the level of activity we are seeing which is very early in that pipeline for the areas outside of apparel.","From a tax standpoint, just high level, how does it change our thinking being an EVA company, I think the biggest thing about M&A is it makes us more competitive against international companies, who don\u2019t -- because it\u2019s moved to the territorial tax system that\u2019s no longer a drag as we go through our evaluation of M&A targets, also we look at financial buyers there\u2019s some changes in there that basically make U.S. headquartered multinationals, I\u2019d say more competitive on the standpoint. So we are an EVA company, all that goes into our assessment of how we think about this and that will be the key drive for us continuing going forward.","As far as IHM, the amount of cross-pollination that occurred before, we call this is a collection of businesses in the number of different areas and we just did not make the link in the past and we see a significant opportunity for doing so, so we are doing it. I think the key message to take from this is, we have had phenomenal performance over the years and we keep finding opportunities whether it\u2019s around commercial growth, around M&A, around productivity to continue to improve ourselves and this is just the next step in doing so, so that\u2019s should be the takeaway there.","Operator","Mr. Butier, I will now turn the call back to you for any closing remarks.","Mitch Butier","All right. Well, thanks everybody for joining the call and for your interest in the company. The fourth quarter capped another great year here at Avery Dennison and we are well-positioned going into 2018 to continue the momentum you have seen over the last two years. I really just would like to take the opportunity to thank the entire team for their commitment and focus on continuing to deliver for our investors, our customers and our communities.

Guenther - Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations","Thank you, Franz, and welcome, everyone. Today, we'll discuss our preliminary unaudited fourth quarter and full year 2015 results as well as our outlook for 2016. The non-GAAP financial measures that we use are defined, qualified, and reconciled with GAAP on schedules A-2 to A-5 of the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release. We remind you that we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. These forward-looking statements are made subject to the Safe Harbor Statement included in today's earnings release.","Making formal remarks today will be Dean Scarborough, Chairman and CEO; and Anne Bramman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mitch Butier, President and Chief Operating Officer, is also with us today to participate in the Q&A portion of the call.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Dean.","Dean A. Scarborough - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Cindy, and good day, everyone. I'm very pleased to report another year of excellent progress toward our long-term goals. We delivered strong organic sales growth and double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share above the high-end of our original guidance range. We continued our disciplined execution of our long-term capital allocation strategy, yielding free cash flow of over $325 million and more than 3.5-point improvement in return on total capital relative to our 2013 baseline.","We also distributed $365 million of cash to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends. Given challenging economic conditions in many parts of the world and significant headwinds from currency translation, these results speak not only to the resilience of our businesses but to the creativity and commitment of our associates worldwide. And I'd really like to thank the team for delivering such a great year.","What continues to guide our actions is a drive to achieve our long-term financial objectives, delight our customers, and fully engage our talented workforce. I'm confident that the achievement of these goals will result in continued above-average returns for our shareholders.","This past year represented an important milestone for us, as the final year of measurement for the four-year financial targets we first communicated in 2012. I'm very pleased to report that we substantially met or exceeded all of these targets.","If you turn to slide 6 of the supplemental materials we distributed today, you can see our final scorecard. On a compound annual basis, sales grew 4% organically and adjusted EPS grew 20%. We came in just slightly under our target for average annual free cash flow due to the onetime impact in 2014 of our decision to reduce the volatility of working capital at year-end. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. While net debt to adjusted EBITDA is still below our long-term target, we'll continue to exercise discipline in the execution of our long-term capital allocation strategy.","In May of 2014, we communicated a new set of targets extending our planning horizon to 2018 and raising the bar for both organic sales growth and operating margin. You can see the total company scorecard on slide 7, and if you turn to slide 8, the progress against the long-term targets for our two core segments. As the chart on the left shows, 2015 marked the fourth consecutive year of strong organic growth for Pressure-sensitive materials above the high-end of its long-term target.","Performance was solid across all key product segments and regions with above-average growth in targeted higher value segments. While sales growth in emerging markets was slower than usual this year, in the fourth quarter, we gained momentum in Asia. We exceeded our long-term operating margin target by 70 basis points in 2015. The vast majority of PSM's margin expansion last year was driven by productivity and fixed-cost leverage on the strong volume growth. So, we do expect to sustain margin in this segment at 11% or possibly higher.","In contrast to the strength in PSM, RBIS has had a slow start against these five-year goals. Growth has been too volatile, and we've been behind on the pace we set for margin expansion. We began executing a new strategy in 2015 to accelerate growth in the core business through a more competitive, faster, and simpler business model.","The team made good progress against its financial targets in the second half of the year, delivering both top line growth and margin improvement with particular strength in radio frequency identification products, or RFID. We also saw improvement in the underlying trend for the less-differentiated segments of our core business in the back half of the year.","We continue to see significant opportunities for top line growth in this business. RFID, of course, remains a key growth catalyst with a five-year compound annual growth target through 2018 of 15% to 20%-plus. Sales of RFID products increased by more than 20% this year and we expect that momentum to continue through 2016. Likewise, external embellishments grew more than 25% last year.","While this category is still a small share of the total business, about $50 million in sales, we expect continued rapid growth of this highly-differentiated, high-value category through 2018. We also expect to gain share in the less-differentiated segments through faster service and a more competitive product offering enabled by our business transformation. In short, I'm confident that our strategic shift will get us back on track to accelerate growth and achieve our operating margin target by 2018.","We didn't include Vancive Medical Technologies on slide 8 because of its size, but let me touch quickly on this business. Though small today, Vancive continues to offer potential for sales and profit growth. In 2016, we expect to accelerate growth in Vancive's core product line, as well as in our new antimicrobial wound dressings, while delivering continued margin expansion. Vancive continues to represent one of several very promising opportunities for us to gain share in a fragmented market that offers above-average growth with attractive margins.","Returning to the total company view, we remain highly confident in our ability to achieve our long-term financial goal based on our ability to execute against a few key strategies. We will grow through innovation and differentiated quality and service. In particular, global share gain opportunities in Performance Tapes and Graphics, and our leadership position in RFID, will continue to be key catalysts of long-term growth for the company.","Emerging markets, while slower in 2015, will continue to be an important part of our growth story over the long-term. Productivity-driven margin improvement has been a hallmark for the company for many years now and will continue to be a major strategic focus. We will drive capital efficiency, while continuing to invest to support growth in the high-value segments of our core businesses.","To this end, we anticipate a large increase in capital spending in 2016 compared to last year; partly due to carryover from projects we began in 2015, but also to support our strategy to accelerate growth in high-value segments.","On the PSM side, we're investing in capacity to support growth in the Graphics business, while optimizing our manufacturing footprint. We're adding coating capacity in Asia to support still solid growth in that region. And we're investing in information systems to drive supply chain productivity by upgrading systems in our North American Materials business.","In RBIS, major investments include capacity additions to support rapid growth of RFID and heat transfer technology, as well as projects to support a more cost-effective footprint. Finally, we will continue to pursue a disciplined approach to returning excess cash to shareholders.","Looking to 2016, given the lack of forward visibility in our markets, our guidance reflects a number of significant uncertainties, including emerging market growth, the net impact of deflation in pricing, a challenging environment for apparel retailers and, of course, currency rates. Despite these challenges, we expect to deliver another year of solid progress against our long-term strategic and financial goals in 2016.","Adjusting for a roughly $0.18 hit from currency translation, the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance reflects a 15% growth rate with further expansion of our return on capital. Our solid free cash flow, combined with a strong balance sheet, gives us ample capacity to invest in our existing businesses while continuing to grow the dividend, repurchase shares and pursue value-enhancing bolt-on acquisitions.","From a balance sheet perspective, while below our targeted leverage range today, we'll remain a disciplined investor. In short, we're committed to hitting our 2018 targets, and I remain confident that the consistent execution of our strategies will enable us to meet our long-term goal for superior value creation.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Anne.","Anne L. Bramman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Dean, and hello everyone. I'll provide some additional color on the quarter, and then I'll walk you through our outlook for 2016.","In Q4, adjusted earnings per share declined 6% compared to the prior year, reflecting an extra week in the 2014 fiscal year, as well as the effect of currency translation. EPS was above our expectations in October due to higher-than-expected sales and a lower tax rate. The lower tax rate contributed $0.06 to the quarter and year. Organic sales growth, which adjusts for the extra week as well as currency translation and a small product line divestiture, was 7% overall and was strong for both core businesses.","The impact of currency translation and the extra week were significant. Currency translation reduced reported sales by 8%, while the impact of the extra week represented an additional headwind of approximately 7.5%. Together, these factors had a roughly $0.20 negative impact to EPS compared to last year's fourth quarter.","Adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter improved 60 basis points to 8.7%, as the benefit of productivity initiative more than offset higher employee-related costs. Restructuring savings, net of transition expenses, were $22 million in the quarter and $71 million for the year, in line with our expectations. Our adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 29% and 33% for the full year, better than expected due to the resolution of foreign tax examinations during the quarter.","Free cash flow was $138 million in the quarter. For the full year, free cash flow was $329 million, representing 103% conversion of adjusted net income.","Combined spending on capital projects and restructuring were roughly in line with our expectations for the year, albeit with a different mix than originally planned. As Dean mentioned, we anticipate a significant increase in capital spending in 2016, partly due to carryover from projects initiated in 2015. Importantly, we have not revised our outlook for cumulative investments in capital and restructuring through 2018.","As Dean indicated, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders. We repurchased 3.9 million shares in 2015 at a cost of $232 million and paid $133 million in dividends. We ended the year with roughly 91.7 million shares outstanding, including dilution, representing a 700,000 share decline compared to the end of 2014.","We did pick up the pace of share buyback in the fourth quarter in part to cover above-average dilution resulting from the rapid rise in our stock price over the course of the year. We have sufficient debt capacity to continue to our share buyback program in a disciplined manner.","Now, looking at the segments. Pressure-sensitive materials sales in the fourth quarter were up approximately 7% on an organic basis, above expectations due to volume improvement in emerging markets, particularly in China.","Sales in both Label and Packaging Materials and combined Graphics and Performance Tapes increased mid-single-digits organically. On a regional basis, sales in North America increased at a low-single-digit rate, while Western Europe was up mid-single-digits.","As Dean mentioned, organic sales growth in emerging markets picked up in the fourth quarter. China was up mid-single-digits, a meaningful improvement from the low-single-digit pace we've seen in the country over the previous five quarters. We saw a surge in demand for e-commerce labels as well as continued momentum in specialty products.","Both India and the ASEAN regions continued to be strong, posting double-digit organic growth rates for the quarter. PSM's adjusted operator margin increased by 40 basis points to 11%, as the impact of productivity initiatives more than offset higher employee-related costs.","Given the headwind from the extra week last year, higher volume did not contribute materially to margin expansion as it had done in the previous three quarters. Similar to the past couple of quarters, we experienced a modest benefit from deflation, net of price. This benefit tends to net out over the long term, so it is reasonable to assume that we'll see some offset to these gains over a full business cycle.","Switching over to RBIS, sales increased by approximately 8% on an organic basis with significant contributions from both RFID products and external embellishments. Consistent with recent quarters, sales growth among U.S.-based retailers and brand owners outpaced their European counterparts.","Adjusting for the impact of RFID sales, we, once again, saw strong growth in the Performance segment globally. And the underlying trend for the less differentiated segments improved, a positive sign that we're beginning to gain traction with our strategy change.","Adjusted operating margin improved 160 basis points to 8.4% as the impact of productivity initiatives more than offset higher employee-related costs.","Sales in Vancive Medical Technologies declined by 13% on an organic basis, due in part to difficult comparisons against the prior year related to a shift in orders from the third to the fourth quarter in 2014. As we said before, given the applications-specific nature of orders in this business, we do expect sales growth to be somewhat volatile quarter-to-quarter. The business was profitable for the quarter in line with expectations.","Turning now to our outlook for consolidated top line growth and earnings in 2016. We anticipate adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.85. We had outlined some of the key contributing factors to this guidance on slide 13 of our supplemental presentation material. We estimate between 3% and 4.5% organic sales growth. Included in this estimate is an assumed slowdown of the 2015 pace of growth for PSM due largely to the loss of a large customer program in the personal care sector of the Performance Tapes business.","Changes to the customers' technology drove the decision to bring this program to a close. The program loss represents a roughly 1 point headwind to PSM's growth in 2016, largely impacting the second half of the year. Note that while the total Performance Tapes business will show a decline in sales on an organic basis in 2016, we continue to expect high-single-digit growth for the industrial side of the business, reflecting progress against our share gain strategy in this high value segment.","At recent exchange rates, we estimate that currency translation will reduce net sales by approximately 3.5%, representing a pre-tax earnings headwind of approximately $25 million or roughly $0.18 per share.","We estimate the incremental pre-tax savings from restructuring actions will contribute roughly $75 million in 2016, about a third of which represents the carryover benefit from actions taken in 2015. Approximately two-thirds of the total savings relates to actions taken in RBIS to drive a more competitive business model.","Combined with the other cost reductions and the anticipated benefit of volume growth, we expect these actions will more than offset pricing adjustments and inflationary pressures in the business, getting us back on the trajectory needed to meet our 2018 adjusted operating margins at 10% to 11%.","We continue to expect the tax rate in the low- to mid-30% range. We estimate average shares outstanding assuming dilution of roughly 90 million shares, reflecting our continued return of cash to shareholders. We anticipate significantly higher than usual adjustments to GAAP net income this year due to non-cash charges associated with the lump sum settlement of certain pension obligations.","This relates to an offer we made to former employees to receive their benefits immediately, as either a lump sum payment or an annuity, rather than waiting until they become retirement-eligible. The purpose of this program is to reduce the financial volatility associated with our frozen defined benefit plan.","You can pick up more details in today's press release, but the short story is that we reduced our pension liability by about $70 million with no increase in required cash contributions to the plan. We anticipate spending approximately $200 million on fixed capital and IT projects in 2016 and expect to incur about $25 million in cash restructuring charges which together represent a $20 million increase over our level of spending last year.","In light of the higher CapEx spending, we expect free cash flow conversion of roughly 100% of adjusted net income. We do, however, continue to expect cumulative free cash flow conversions over the coming years to exceed 100%.","Importantly, while the continued currency headwinds pull our 2016 EPS growth rate below our long-term target, our guidance for the year is consistent with the progress, we believe, is necessary to achieve our key long-term financial targets.","In summary, we delivered another quarter and year of solid earnings per share growth despite a number of challenges. Our two market-leading core businesses are well positioned for profitable growth, which, combined with our continued focus on productivity and capital discipline, enable us to expand margins and increase returns and achieve our 2018 targets.","Now, we'll open the call up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, guys. Good morning. Maybe just, first off, on the macro. Obviously, you sell into many different end-markets on a global basis. Can you just, first off, give us your view of what the global macro looks like from Avery's perspective, the U.S., Europe, Latin America, and also, Asia?","Dean A. Scarborough - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Ghansham, this is Dean. Hi. Yeah, it's always hard to put ourselves in that position given our lack of forward visibility. I think, last year, we experienced reasonably strong growth in Europe, again, probably a little bit better than our expectations, but I kind of relate that back to reasonable amount of consumer spending there. The U.S. was not as strong as Europe, but stronger than we expected going into the year. So, I would say those two economies are relatively stable. I don't think any big \u2013 we're not expecting any big surprises in mature markets and feel good about the economies there and prospects.","Latin America's been a challenge, but also good for us. I would say, because we're a stable player in the region. We've been able to protect our dollar-based profits in that region through a lot of price increases given the challenges there. And then, Asia has been strong. India, ASEAN, very strong throughout the year. And China was the one area where I think we were continuously disappointed in for the last \u2013 well, four of the last five quarters.","Our hypothesis is that inventories in that market were kind of full. And we had customers telling us anecdotally that they just didn't have the sales. We did see some shift in that trend. But we also are tapping into a pretty high growth area in China, something called the logistics label. It's a little more sophisticated than a barcode label. But, fundamentally, its growth driver is the rapid acceleration of online ordering and having things delivered to your home much as we do here in the U.S.","So, in the long run, we're still bullish on China because the Materials business there is really linked to consumer spending, and as that economy begins to shift to a more services-based and consumer spending model, that should bode well for us in the long term. However, I wouldn't be surprised if we see continued volatility in China. But I don't have any specific note on that.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. No, that's helpful. And then on RBIS, it sounds like RFID sort of came in ahead of your expectations for 4Q specifically. Was there any sort of new contract that drove upside for the quarter? Was that a comps issue? Just trying to understand if there's actually a change in the momentum trajectory as it has been over the last few quarters?","Dean A. Scarborough - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So a couple of our customers did accelerate their programs. And as I had said last spring, I noticed a big change in mentality from retailers that I hadn't seen before. And I would say almost every major retailer is in some stage of piloting right now certainly in the U.S. We also saw some nice growth from European retailers at the same time in the quarter. So I anticipate we're going to go through a period of time where we will continue to see accelerated growth above that 15% to 20%. That's why we added the plus to the 20%. Mitch was just at the National Retail Federation Show. So, Mitch, maybe you have some insights on there as well.","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Well, it just really reinforces what we've said before when you started talking about in the last spring, Dean. So a lot of discussion around RFID. And I'd say every retailer we talk to and brand, the big discussion is, again, not really if, but when and how they're going to adopt RFID. And the team has done a phenomenal job; our team. We are the recognized leaders within the space and not just what we provide, but actually helping retailers and brands adopt the new technology.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed.","Alex Wang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Morning. It's actually Alex Wang sitting in for George. Thanks for taking our question. First question, can you just remind us, in RBIS, how much DNA rolls off, I believe, related to accounting from a few years ago? And when the timing of that \u2013 how that progresses?","Anne L. Bramman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So good morning. So really we're going to see the biggest benefit coming through in 2017. It's modest in 2016. It's around $4 million to $5 million. But you should see that ramp up starting 2017.","Alex Wang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Understood. And just as a follow-on, I know you mentioned in the slide deck relatively immaterial, but you spoke or alluded to some product line divestitures. If you could just provide some color around that that'd be helpful. Thank you.","Anne L. Bramman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So we had a very small product line divestiture back in the spring timeframe in Europe. So it was in the RBIS segment, and it was \u2013 very duly impact EBIT on very small sales dollars.","Alex Wang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. I'll jump back in the queue. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Scott Louis Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Dean A. Scarborough - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Scott.","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Morning.","Anne L. Bramman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hi, Scott.","Scott Louis Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just looking at the CapEx for a minute, the $200 million, Dean. I think you mentioned some growth projects as the main reason why the CapEx is ramping up year-over-year. Can you talk about those projects and why the investment in 2016?","Dean A. Scarborough - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. So I think, typically, the way we'd characterize our CapEx is a third growth, a third productivity, a third IT maintenance capital. And actually it's going to move to about 50% of growth capital spending. We started a number of projects later in the year. We need some new Graphics capacity in the U.S. So we're going to be investing in some new capability there. We're also going to get a productivity benefit from that investment. It's going to take us a while to play it out. It's a fairly decent size investment.","We need new coating capacity in Asia, and so we're going to be in the process of building a new water-based coating line there. And then we've got some IT projects in North America. We've got a fairly old system in the U.S. that we're going to upgrade and replace. So those are some of the key investments in pressure-sensitive materials.","In RBIS, clearly, RFID with its rapid growth, we're continuing to invest there as well with some of the heat transfer technology. We also are spending some capital on automation in that business to continue to drive better labor productivity. It's a more labor-intense business than Materials, as well as to help us facilitate a more efficient footprint.","Scott Louis Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And the return on invested capital on these projects, what are return on total capital, how do you kind of look at it?","Dean A. Scarborough - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well above our hurdle rate.","Scott Louis Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then, Dean, on pressure-sensitive materials, I think, if I heard you correctly, the long-term operating margin target was 11%. And then...","Dean A. Scarborough - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Or greater.","Scott Louis Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Or greater. I think if I have the number right, we were up well above that in 2015. And then I think Anne mentioned some raw material price cost benefits in 2015 and then the comment was around over the business cycle expect that to normalize. So as we move to 2016, how difficult is it to get margins up in pressure-sensitive materials in 2016 given that commentary?","Dean A. Scarborough - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think, as you might guess, most operating plans for businesses always look for improvement every single year. So, we're not really different than anybody else. So, we're not going to give specific guidance for operating margins by segment. I think the team has done a good job driving mix, growing faster in high-value segments, and at the same time, getting more competitive in some of the more competitive segments frankly, and driving improvement there. For us, Pressure-sensitive materials is a high-return business. It is at a multiple of our cost of capital. And driving growth, top line growth is also an important goal for us. So, I feel good about the position of the business.","And, again, it's \u2013 right now with oil prices low, I know a lot of people are saying, well, that should really help you. And, to be honest, we haven't seen that much change in the commodities we buy over the last 90 days to 120 days. As you know, a lot of the things we buy are several steps down from crude oil. And then there's still some economies where we're seeing inflation.","So, I think the team has done a good job. We're going to continue to pursue our strategy of driving productivity, driving top line growth and mix. And we have the expectation to continue to drive for more improvement. Those targets that we have that we had set for 2018 are not a cap. They're simply a long-term sort of guidance range, but we feel confident today that we can operate at 11% or over.","Scott Louis Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Well, congrats on the quarter, but more importantly, congratulations on hitting the targets from 2012 to 2015. Not that many companies put out these long-term targets and actually hit the numbers, and you guys did a great job. So, good luck on the next five-year plan.","Dean A. Scarborough - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning.","Dean A. Scarborough - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Regarding the organic sales growth guidance, you referenced the loss of a large customer in PSM. Understanding that you may be limited in what you can say, can you help us understand, is that customer going to a different technology or a different \u2013 to a competitor, or are there any read-throughs for the rest of your business? Or if you can give us any color there, it would be helpful.","Dean A. Scarborough - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Go ahead, Mitch.","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. So, Anthony, I'll answer the last part of your question first. There's no knock-on effects or implications to the rest of the business in PSM. This is specifically within the Performance Tapes business, which is an application business. And one application is not losing share, if you will, to another competitor. There's a technology change in the handset. So, our focus when we've talked about investing in this business, it's really been the focus on the industrial tapes side where we did continue to see growth in Q4 and it's going to be a key focus for us going forward.","So, we look at this as an application we got a few years ago, team did a great job in driving value in achieving our objectives on this application and we knew eventually we'd have a sunset and it's coming in 2016.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on Scott's question on PSM margins. I guess last year you saw PSM margins up 150 basis points. Is it possible to bucket that roughly between productivity versus variable flow-through on volumes versus price cost? And then thinking about PSM margins in 2016 maybe potentially being down a bit kind of asking the same question backwards, where are you giving up the margin versus productivity, volumes, price cost?","Anne L. Bramman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So, when we look at PSM for 2015, by and large by a multiple of two times to three times the benefit in margin came from net productivity and restructuring. So that really was driving the margin improvement that we saw for the year.","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","And your question going into 2016, when we laid out this business, if you look at 2012 when we laid out long-term targets, we said 9% to 10% operating margin target. We passed and exceeded that. We've now set 10% to 11% as the operating margin for this business. And it's really, what we've said, is those are proxies for what would make a high return on capital business here. And that is our focus. And we've been testing and getting achieving new heights.","And we don't, as Dean said earlier, see this as a cap in any way. We all have operating plans to look to see how do we test this to even further new heights. But the reason that we're saying we're confident we can hold the 11% or more in this business is, one, we feel that's a very high return business, we've got to continue to focus on growing it then as we've done a great job over the last few years. And two, just macro uncertainty as far as what's out there within the economy and all the headlines everybody's reading.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets. You may proceed.","Marc Solecitto - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. It's actually Marc Solecitto on for Adam. Thanks for taking our questions.","Dean A. Scarborough - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Marc Solecitto - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","First question we had, you're projecting a modest slowdown in organic growth. I know you talked about the customer loss in your tapes business, but were there any other factors in that modest slowdown?","Anne L. Bramman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, there really wasn't. That was a component when we looked at the total guidance.","Marc Solecitto - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And second question, as far as FX rates, what FX rates are you assuming in your 2016 guidance?","Anne L. Bramman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, right now, we've got the euro pegged slightly under $1.09.","Marc Solecitto - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Dean A. Scarborough - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. How are you?","Dean A. Scarborough - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","How large is your RFID business now?","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","About $150 million in 2015.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","In the RBIS segment, you took about a $16 million charge. Where is that geographically? That is, what part of the RBIS operation are you restructuring? And can you describe that a little bit more closely?","Anne L. Bramman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, the charge is primarily in the SG&A line. There is a portion that goes through the gross profit line. But I would say it's probably an 80-20, 75% to 80% going through SG&A. There's a number of initiatives going on. First, there's a footprint \u2013 we're looking at footprint consolidation to get efficiency in the business. And then, secondly, we also, as we've talked about in the prior quarter, looking at driving more efficiency in the regional basis, getting out some of the layers of management in the business. And so, that's a big component of the SG&A line as well.","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. So just to add on to that, Jeff, so the footprint consolidations Anne talked about, we've announced in Eastern U.S. as well as Western Europe. And then, one of the overall objectives here is to lower costs so we can be more competitive in all segments. And so, we're cutting SG&A across the board, if you will, on a number of areas. But it's not just about lowering costs, it's actually about streamlining the management structure to move decision points closer to the customer and close to market, so we can be faster and more nimble in the market.","So, that's what we're doing. So, the SG&A is kind of broad-based. But it's, again, not just around cost reduction, it's also around getting quicker in the marketplace.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And could you talk a little bit about Pressure-sensitive Material pricing trends? Are prices up year-over-year or down or up a little bit or down a little bit?","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","We're talking about this generally on a net basis. So, when you look at the net impact of pricing and deflation, as we've commented, we saw modest benefits in Q4 again, as we've seen in the previous couple of quarters. If you look at kind of where we fit now flowing into 2016, it's essentially neutral, the net impact between pricing and raw materials.","And it's hard to give a very broad comment on those trends globally because it depend region by region. And some regions were raising prices quite dramatically, double-digits, to offset inflation. Other regions, clearly, in some regions we have some big deflation and it's a competitive environment. And we're working through that.","One thing I do want to say is we talked last year about a couple of course corrections we're making and one of them was rebalancing the dynamics between price volume and mix within PSM. I think, largely, what you're seeing is, we've done a good job of doing that of rebalancing those dynamics. And we talked about getting more disciplined in the less differentiated segments within PSM, and we've done that as well. And the focus is how do we continue to drive growth profitably across all the segments?","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I mean, not on a net basis. On an absolute basis, how are your local prices?","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","We don't provide commentary on that.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. How much did you contribute to your pension plan this year?","Anne L. Bramman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We didn't make any contributions to the plan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Is there any inflation in paper prices in PSM?","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","We're seeing some pressure in Europe, generally because of the currency shifts that you're seeing there, but that's the only place we're really seeing pressure.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","The last question is, once you get through the big spending in 2016 on capital, what happens in 2017? Where is your more normalized level of CapEx?","Anne L. Bramman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So when you look at our long-term goals, we've really had set the target of around $175 million to $200 million a year for CapEx spending...","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you so much.","Anne L. Bramman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","...on average. Yeah.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Kapsch with BB&T Capital Markets. You may proceed.","Christopher J. Kapsch - BB&T Capital Markets","Yeah. Good morning. I had a follow-up on the margin discussion in pressure-sensitive. I think your formal comments were that despite the organic volume growth that that did not benefit mix because of the absence of the week of sales. And I'm just trying to understand why that would matter. And also if there's some mix effect here maybe becoming more pronounced on a seasonal basis with the e-commerce sort of being concentrated in the December quarter. Is there any adverse effect from stronger demand in e-commerce related labels on mix in this quarter? And if so, would that inflect starting in the first quarter?","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yes. So there are several questions in there. So let me try to take a couple of them. So one is if you look at our margins, you asked about the 53rd week impact and what's the variable flow-through from volume. So we did see what you'd typically expect from a volume flow-through from the growth. But if you think about the lack of the extra week that we had, that was pure variable flow-through from (43:47) last year. And we commented about the benefit that it gave us to 2014 earnings, and we expect it to come back down more than $0.10 in Q4. So that's...","Christopher J. Kapsch - BB&T Capital Markets","There's more shipping days than really just running the coaters. Got it, okay.","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","And you've got your fixed cost structure which stays solid for the quarter, and you've got an extra shipping week. So that was what that item's about. But no shift on the volume variable flow-through. So that's what that is.","As far as the mix, so typically Q4, the mix is lower if you're looking sequentially versus Q2, Q3, because we have more Graphics sales, for example, in Q2, Q3 than we have in Q4. So you would typically see Q4 be somewhat lower than if you're looking on a sequential basis. And as far as the...","Christopher J. Kapsch - BB&T Capital Markets","Is that \u2013 yeah.","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Go ahead.","Christopher J. Kapsch - BB&T Capital Markets","Is that mix shift becoming more pronounced as e-commerce just continues to boom?","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","No, because those are very different markets. Graphics are more for the durables markets. So long-lived labels, if you will. So nothing to do with the e-commerce trends. And then the e-commerce we talked about what the key points of growth, particularly in Asia, and that is, well, it's not just classic variable information labels like Dean said earlier. And actually, within China, with this growth that we've achieved, we've actually gotten margins back to where they were before the slip (45:23) we saw in 2014.","Christopher J. Kapsch - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. And if I could follow up also just on, sort of, capital allocation and notwithstanding your continued healthy return of capital to shareholders, you have a good problem here, you're below your targeted leverage, it's a function of EBITDA growth as well as your continued just strong free cash flow generation. But it sounds like you do have more of an appetite because of this situation for bolt-on acquisitions. And I just want to understand like the nature of potential target. Is it still focused in the Graphics and Tapes portion of PSM or would there also be potential bolt-ons, say, to augment your RFID platform or even in Vancive Medical?","Dean A. Scarborough - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So I would say, yes, we have an active pipeline going for M&A. We talked about it. And I would say it definitely includes the Materials businesses, all the Materials businesses. Vancive is also an area that we are looking in.","RFID is an interesting question. I would say the answer is yes, but I would say there's not just a lot out there. We're one of the biggest entities out there for RFID. And really our focus there, other than driving the great growth that we had, is looking for applications outside of a core apparel business because we have a really unique capability in the marketplace. And I think in the long run that will bode well.","Christopher J. Kapsch - BB&T Capital Markets","And if I could just follow-up on that point, on your unique capability, and you have sort of a turnkey approach to retailers I think that are adopting RFID and you mentioned capital investment in that businesses. Is the investment you're making sort of upstream like an inlay capability, or is it more downstream perhaps to augment the part of the turnkey solution that you're offering those retail customers? Thanks.","Dean A. Scarborough - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, Chris, most of that \u2013 I mean, from a capital point of view it's basically in the equipment to make not \u2013 if what I would characterize as integrated inlays. One of the advantages that we have is being able to offer the retailer form factors that are very similar to what they use today; and it makes the incremental cost of adopting RFID even lower than it was before. So I think the team has been very innovative and creative driving both lower cost for inlay production, but also, at the same time, giving the retailer almost a seamless and lower cost transition. So we're really kind of changing the game there.","We have invested a little more in the front-end, but that's actually been in place for quite a while. And we have a really experienced team that understands \u2013 I would say, we don't have so much a turnkey approach, I think we have probably the most knowledge in the business on how to effectively execute a program when we can help guide retailers in a number of areas as they rollout their programs.","Christopher J. Kapsch - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks for the context.","Operator","Our last question is a follow-up from the line of Scott Gaffner from Barclays. Please go ahead, sir.","Scott Louis Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. On the RFID acceleration, you mentioned, Dean, can you just walk us through that a little bit? I mean, was there anything in the fourth quarter? I mean, obviously, when we look at the retail data, e-commerce grew a lot faster than brick-and-mortar. I mean, did the pace of inquiries increased in 4Q or is this just been a steady increase throughout the year around interest in RFID?","Dean A. Scarborough - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would characterize it this way; the folks that have invested in RFID are accelerating what they're doing. So, we had a couple of large customers ask us, can we go even faster? I think the team did a great job of accommodating that pretty seamlessly. I mean our growth in the quarter was almost 90%. I mean that's a lot for any operations and supply chain team to execute.","And as retailers continue to understand the need for really accurate inventories to play in the omni-channel world, I think it's becoming \u2013 I won't say a no-brainer, but it's becoming an essential part of being competitive. And that's the discussion that's going on. And so, retailers are talking mainly about how and not if. So, I think this will be a great growth platform for us for the next few years.","Scott Louis Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And how do you see your ability to continue to reduce the cost structure in the business as RFID grows? I mean, can you take a significant cost out of the chips or where would the cost savings come from, I guess, maybe is a better question as you ramp this business up?","Dean A. Scarborough - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It comes from a combination, so it's sort of all what I would characterize as all levels, right? We have scale in purchasing chips. We have an ability to integrate the manufacturing of the antenna, the making of the inlay and integrating that into the final tag in a seamless process, which reduces materials and reduces process steps. I would literally just in Asia a couple of weeks ago looking at our operations and talking to the team and they've already figured out a way to double the productivity that we're getting on our newly installed equipment. So, I get pretty excited about that. And so far, I don't see a limit to what we're doing.","We also have some longer-term programs, and I mean, in the next two years to four years where I do think we \u2013 there is an ability to take another step change in the cost reduction of an inlay, but I can't, due to confidentiality, get into the details. But we're all-in on this business and I feel really good about both our short-term and our long-term prospects.","Scott Louis Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks again.","Operator","And Mr. Scarborough, there are no further questions at this time. I'll return the call back to you for your closing remarks.","Dean A. Scarborough - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Franz. Well, our focus in 2016 will be the same as it's been for the last four years to deliver exceptional value for customers, our employees, and our shareholders. We're going to continue to pursue the broad strategic priorities that we've communicated, fine-tuning where appropriate, and we look forward to seeing that strategy and execution translate into superior total shareholder return over the long term.

These forward-looking statements are made subject to the Safe Harbor statement included in today's earnings release.","On the call today are Mitch Butier, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Anne Bramman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I'll now turn the call over to Mitch.","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Thanks, Cindy. And good day, everyone. We had another quarter of strong earnings growth, with EPS above our expectations. We are improving our competitiveness with continued strong profitability across the PSM portfolio and making progress with our business model transformation in RBIS.","As expected, organic sales growth in Pressure-sensitive Materials moderated in the third quarter to 3%, reflecting the program loss in the personal care segment of Performance Tapes that we've discussed previously. Excluding this program loss, sales grew 4.5% organically.","Once again, emerging markets were the key growth driver for PSM, more than offsetting softness in the North American market. From a product perspective, the base label materials business remained healthy, with solid top line growth overall and margins expanding across most categories.","Graphics and specialty label materials were up high-single digits for the quarter on a global basis. I am pleased with our progress in shifting PSM's portfolio mix towards these higher value categories. We expect continued benefit over the long term from our focus and investment in these areas.","Speaking of which, the integration of our acquisition of the Mactac graphics and tapes business, which we completed in August, is going smoothly. We also completed a very small acquisition of Ink Mill during the quarter, which expands our capabilities in the high-value reflectives business.","And earlier this month we made an equity investment in a U.K.-based startup called PragmatIC, leveraging our strengths in RFID to enable long-term growth of intelligent labels in new segments.","All three of these recent deals exemplify the range of opportunities we have identified and continue to pursue within our M&A pipeline with a focus on high-value product lines and supporting technologies.","Our commitment to investing here in terms of both M&A and higher capital spending is reinforced by the excellent progress we've made with the high-value segments through which we have delivered consistent organic growth, improved mix, and strong profitability and returns.","Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. Sales were up a little over 2% organically, driven by Radio Frequency Identification. RFID sales were up over 35% in Q3 and are expected to exceed 30% for the full year.","While the pace of growth will slow in the fourth quarter, reflecting the difficult comparison to prior year that we've discussed, we expect that RFID will continue to be a key growth driver for us.","We are continuing to invest in this high-value product line, expanding capacity and improving our manufacturing processes as well as participating in promising new ventures like PragmatIC.","Outside of RFID, top line growth was short of our target for the quarter amidst a difficult retail apparel market in the U.S., particularly among the department stores. That said, we saw solid volume gains across the base business, representing clear signs of success for our multiyear transformation strategy as we become faster, simpler and more competitive while driving margin expansion.","Our strategy is the right one. Moving decision-making closer to our markets, reducing complexity as well as our cost structure and qualifying lower cost, locally sourced materials to support more competitive pricing. Our improvements in service, flexibility and speed are resonating with customers.","In light of the soft top line though, these actions have not been enough to deliver the margin expansion we had targeted for the year. Now we will accelerate our efforts through 2017 to further improve our competitiveness and achieve our 2018 margin expansion target.","So coming back to the total company view. Overall, we've made good progress against our strategic and financial objectives as evidenced by another solid quarter and the $0.10 increase to expected EPS for the year.","We remain highly confident in our ability to consistently deliver exceptional value over the long run based on the execution of our key strategies.","First and foremost, we will drive outside growth in high value segments. We will continue to invest disproportionately here, both organically and through bolt-on acquisitions. Over time this will improve our portfolio mix and bolster our leadership in these key segments.","Second, we are relentless in our pursuit of productivity improvement to enhance our competitiveness across all product categories, and of course to drive margin expansion.","And, third, we are maintaining our high degree of capital efficiency while increasing investments to support profitable growth. And, of course, we will continue our disciplined approach to returning cash to shareholders.","Now I'll turn the call over to Anne.","Anne L. Bramman - Avery Dennison Corp.","Thanks, Mitch. Providing a little more color on the quarter. In Q3, we delivered a 16% increase in adjusted earnings per share on 3% organic sales growth. Currency translation reduced reported sales by 1.7% in the third quarter, which was offset by the lift from the Mactac acquisition.","Adjusted operating margin in the third quarter improved 40 basis points to 9.8% as the benefit of productivity initiatives and higher volume more than offset higher employee related expenses and the net impact of price and raw material input costs. We realized about $21 million of incremental savings from restructuring charges, net of transition cost.","The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 31%, reflecting a reduction to our estimate for the full year effective tax rate from 34% at the end of Q2 to 33% due to stronger income growth in lower-tax jurisdictions. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $248 million, an increase of $57 million compared to last year.","During the first nine months of the year, we repurchased approximately 2.7 million shares and paid $106 million in dividends. Net of dilution, we reduced our share count by approximately 1 million shares for a net cost of $118 million, bringing the total amount of cash returned to shareholders so far this year to roughly $224 million. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have ample capacity to continue funding acquisitions, as well as returning cash to shareholders in a disciplined manner.","We funded the acquisition of Mactac Europe through euro-denominated commercial paper. We will explore a euro-denominated debt offering in the first half of next year to refinance notes that will be maturing later in 2017 as well as the Mactac acquisition. Our objective will be to take advantage of the low interest rates in Europe and the opportunity to hedge currency exposure on our balance sheet.","Now looking at the segments. Pressure-sensitive Materials sales were up approximately 3% on an organic basis. Emerging markets continue to be strong contributors to growth for this segment, representing virtually all of the top-line growth in the third quarter. Excluding the impact of the program loss in Performance Tapes, emerging market sales were up over 10% organically, comparable to the pace we saw in the second quarter. This strength was fairly widespread across the countries that comprise emerging markets.","Of particular note, the underlying growth trend in China picked up modestly compared to the second quarter. You may recall that sales in China were roughly flat in Q2 on an organic basis. Adjusting for holiday timing and the Tapes loss, we estimate the underlying organic sales growth for China was back to the low-single-digit rate we saw in the first quarter of this year and for 2015 as a whole.","Turning to the mature markets, in North America, sales declined at a low-single digit rate on an organic basis. This reflects a soft market and the pass-through of savings from deflation, while Western Europe was up low-single digits. Demand in Western Europe has been consistently growing at solid low to mid-single digit rates and on occasion even higher. Factoring in Eastern Europe, the overall European market has been a strong source of growth for us, and we expect that strength to continue.","We're investing to keep pace with the growth in this region, recently announcing a $65 million investment over the next year and a half to expand both the capabilities and capacity of our flagship operation in Luxembourg. From a product line perspective, Label and Packaging Materials sales were up mid-single digits organically, while sales for the combined Graphics and Performance Tapes product lines were down low-single digits, reflecting the expected program loss for Tapes.","Excluding the program loss, combined sales for Graphics and Performance Tapes were up mid-single digits on an organic basis. Pressure-sensitive Materials adjusted operating margin of 12.6% was up 50 basis points over last year, as the benefits from productivity and higher volume more than offset the net impact of price and raw material input costs as well as unfavorable mix.","Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions, RBIS sales grew 2% on an organic basis driven by growth of RFID. Sales outside of RFID continued to be soft, down low-single digits, reflecting modest growth in volume which was more than offset by the impact of strategic pricing actions that we began taking late last year.","As you know, we began adjusting our prices in late 2015 to become more competitive. So the sales growth comparisons for the base business become modestly easier in the fourth quarter.","As Mitch said, we do believe that the transformation of our business model becoming more cost and price competitive while providing better, faster service is driving volume growth, albeit in a challenging retail apparel environment that makes it tough to see the impact of these wins in our financial results.","From a regional perspective, we saw strong mid-single digit unit volume growth for core label products among European retailers and brand owners, due in part to continue progress in expanding our share among the fast fashion players.","Unit volumes for core products were flat in the U.S., an improvement over the mid-single digit decline we saw last quarter. This market is especially challenged as demonstrated by macro indicators.","In particular, apparel imports into the U.S. were down on average by about 3% for the most recent three months reported. And since the fourth quarter of last year, the inventory to sales ratio for U.S. apparel has been at pre-recession levels.","Adjusted operating margin for the segment improved by 20 basis points as the net savings from the business model transformations were largely offset by higher employee related costs. We have not changed our long-term margin expansion objectives for this business and expect to achieve the goal we set for 2018.","As expected, sales for Vancive Medical Technologies were down 20% on organic basis in the quarter, reflecting the combined effect of share losses and customer inventory rejection. We were able to partially offset the impact of the sales loss through cost reduction actions.","Going forward, the steps we began taking mid-last year should enable consistent growth and significant margin expansion over the long term.","Now, turning to our outlook for the rest of the year. We have raised the midpoint of the range of our guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share by $0.10 to $3.95 to $4. This reflects the better-than-expected operating results that we delivered in the third quarter including the lower expected tax rate.","We outlined some of the key contributing factors to our EPS guidance on slide 8 of our supplemental presentation material. Highlighting the changes from our previous expectations, we have reduced the high end of our organic growth outlook and now expect full-year sales to grow between 3% and 3.5% on an organic basis. We now expect more than $75 million from restructuring savings net of transition costs for the year. And as discussed previously, we now expect an effective tax rate of approximately 33%.","So just wrapping up, we're very pleased with the strategic and financial progress made against our 2018 goals this past quarter. We're confident we can continue to deliver exceptional value over the long term through superior execution of our strategies, including the disciplined allocation of capital.","Now we'll open the call up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird & Company. Please go ahead.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Anne L. Bramman - Avery Dennison Corp.","Good morning.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning, Mitch and Anne and Cindy. First off, did you see any measurable change in core sales growth for PSM in any particular month during 3Q? There have been some companies and different industries have commented on the slowdown in Europe during the quarter, wondering if you saw any deviation in the quarter?","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Well, so we do normally see some variation month-to-month. We did see a little bit of a slide during Q3 over in Europe. Having said that, we're seeing a little bit of an uptick in early October as well within Europe as well as North America. So I don't read too much into individual month trends too closely, because it's not unusual for us to see four weeks of strong performance followed by a softening or vice versa.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. And then, what exactly, Mitch, is, do you think, driving the weakness in North American PSM? Is it just sort of inventory reductions? What do you think is going on by channel there?","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","It's hard to say. We think there's been a softening in the end consumption of the market in Q3 but we don't have that data right now. But we also did cede some share earlier in the year within that business as we were driving more discipline on the lower value, less differentiated segments.","But, yeah, in the quarter we think it basically softened a bit. We don't have clear reasons why. At LabelExpo the sentiment from North American converters was overall, I'd say, most of them were very confident in their individual businesses, cautious about the market overall, but also talked about how they themselves have less visibility to their own order volumes than they traditionally have had as well. So it's hard to give you a read on exactly what's going on in the North American business, clearly some of the decline was from graphics, if you will, within that region specifically. But it's hard to give you a clear read here. As I said, first few weeks of October we're starting to see an uptick.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And just one final one for me. You also called out higher raw material cost for 3Q. Can you first off expand on that? And then also how are you kind of positioning the company for what could be an increase in inflation as we head into 2017 coming off a period of a few quarters anyway of deflation? Thanks so much.","Anne L. Bramman - Avery Dennison Corp.","Yeah. Ghansham so what we really said was that we saw an impact to our margin price net of raw material input costs. And so relatively speaking, we don't give specific color on pricing inflation, but as we've been pretty consistent in saying that we broadly have given some price reductions since then, that's where we have relatively higher variable margins and where we may have seen some deflation. And we basically have been passing it along to customers in some targeted areas and in my script I specifically called out that we have seen that impact in North America.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Louis Gaffner with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Hi, Scott.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Mitch, just wanted to go back to RBIS for a second. You mentioned the North American apparel retailers and some of the import data. Are there any categories in particular within that channel that you are seeing, any weakness in and than what about European retailers, if you could give some color there as well?","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Yeah. So the categories within the U.S. department stores in particular are seeing softness and we're seeing that as well with our key customers in that space. But generally I think it's relatively broad-based in the data that Anne shared is across the entire retail apparel sector, if you will. So inventory levels returned back this year to their pre-recession high. If you recall, for a few years after the recession they were quite a bit lower, those have bulked up. A good portion of that relates to the fact it was a very warm winter last year and just there was not as much sell-throughs, they have been holding on to the inventory. So I know the goal is for retailers to flush some of that inventory out of the system through this holiday season.","And then for Europe, it depends I'd say overall softness in the U.K. Clearly the U.K. retailers with Brexit going on, I think, are struggling a bit and so that's one place we see softness. But in Germany pretty solid, other markets we are seeing relatively solid performance at the end retail level.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And any \u2013 you said RFID up 30% in the quarter, with some of the weakness in apparel are there any change in the conversation with your customers around adoption rates on RFID?","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Yes, it was up 35% in the quarter and we expect to be 30% for the full year and we're expecting the growth to moderate a bit going into \u2013 quite a bit in going into Q4.","The conversation is very similar. Working through in each retailer or brand, need to go through an assessment of the business case and then piloting and then you get a partial adoption and then full adoption. So, no real change in the conversations. There has been in the last quarter since we talked about where the pipeline is, we have had one tier 1 move from pilot into early adoption and then a couple of very small specialty retailers move either from business case to pilot or pilot to adoption.","So, conversation is pretty much the same. Seeing a little bit of a migration through the pipeline as well.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Last one for me just around the share repurchases. I mean, obviously you don't make a decision based on one day's move, but the stock is down fairly dramatically today and I would think your internal model would be screening well for share buyback here. How do you think about share buyback into the end of the year?","Anne L. Bramman - Avery Dennison Corp.","So as you talk about, we don't really comment on timing and pace of share buyback and we have been really consistent in how we look at this, but we look \u2013 we do have an intrinsic value model and as we see the gap, if we see a gap widening, we will be much more aggressive in buying back stock.","And again as we see the gap \u2013 less of a gap, then we don't buy back as much stock at that point. So we are a bit opportunistic in how we look at our share buyback programs as well.","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Yeah. So Scott, we don't comment, but you can probably infer from our past behavior how we would behave in such an environment.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Understood. I appreciate all the color.","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Absolutely.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Leon Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks operator. Hi everyone, good morning. Thanks for all the details. Cindy, congratulations to you as well and good luck with the retirement. We'll miss working with you.","I guess the first question I had, recognizing the answer is probably both, when we look at the slight reduction in the core growth rate you are expecting, Mitch, is it more centered in RBIS given the weakness in retail or is it in the somewhat difficult to pin down but nonetheless apparent reduction in consumption in Pressure-sensitive Materials in the \u2013 I think the U.S. is what you said. Which one of those is a bigger driver of this modest trim there?","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","So, George, are you asking about Q3 or Q4 because you can kind of triangulate on what that takes?","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I was meaning it really more for the full year outlook but answered however you feel is most illustrative.","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Yeah, so overall, I mean RBIS you can see where the growth rate is, little over 2% and so we expect roughly a continuation of that. Obviously it can be a little lower, a little higher depending on how things pan out. And a couple key contributing factors, we have harder RFID comps, if you will. We have a couple of things that ease up on the comps front in that business. So that's what we're thinking within RBIS, as the continuation.","And within Pressure-sensitive, the Q3, the revenue was lower than we were thinking that business would come in at and it was specifically around North America. And so it's really a question about, is the early trends we see in October continue, positive trends that we're seeing, or does it revert back to a lower level.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Is October more or less in line with what you would have expected otherwise? And obviously it's up, but is it up where you would have liked it to have been?","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","It is consistent with our guidance range that we've provided. One thing, it's very hard to read Asia, North Asia in particular, because of the calendar shift of the Golden Week. So basically their harvest festival, if you will. So that distorted things. So anything for RBIS because so much is sourced out of North Asia as well as North Asia for Materials Group is not a good read. North America rebounded like we said and Europe has rebounded a little bit from a softening late Q3 as well.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you for that. Now one other question I had, if I look at the guidance increase, I know it's roughly $0.10. The tax effect in the third quarter was probably a couple of pennies. The FX negative is about a couple pennies more favorable. Is there a way to split the remaining difference between restructuring, what you said is in excess of $75 million but you didn't necessarily say how much, and any other factors that are benefiting you?","Anne L. Bramman - Avery Dennison Corp.","Yes, really the biggest piece of the gap that you're talking about is from the beat we have with PSM this quarter. So even though the restructuring we gave guidance, it's just slightly more than $75 million. It could be a couple of million more. We just wanted to give a little bit of flavor on that. But it's really the operational beat we had this quarter.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks for that, Anne. My last one and then I'll turn it over and try to come back. Back to RBIS, we've asked similar questions I guess in the past around the business and your need to restructure. Recognizing it's a challenging business, and it's competitive, at the same time you're continuing to restructure and you're trying to stay ahead of kind of the pace of competition and the other challenges in that market. At this juncture, given what you know, what two or three things make you confident that you can continue to retool that business, stay ahead of competition and ultimately hit your margin targets for RBIS by 2018?","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Yes, so I think overall what makes us confident around that is the adjustments that we made \u2013 started making last year that we talked through, and it was the beginning of what we said would be a multiyear transformation. We made quite a few adjustments, and a lot of that was around moving more decision-making into the regions and closer to the customer, having a more segmented approach, different customers, if it's a performance athletic \u2013 high-end performance athletic brand relative to a discounted retailer, they have different needs, so we've adopted a more segmented approach.","And, as part of that, in some segments that meant adjusting our cost structure to, one, expand margin but, two, also to get more price competitive. Remember that the variable margin in this business, even in what we call the less differentiated, are relatively high. And so being able to drive consistent growth is a key requirement within this business as well.","So what are the signs of success? It's basically we're getting volume gains, we've stopped the share slide that we had for a couple of years going into mid last year, and we're seeing volume gains even though the market is down. And we've basically proven the model ourselves internally, so now it's a matter of pushing forward to accelerate.","And as far as just to get to the margin targets that we've laid out for 2018, if you recall when we laid those out, we identified there is a lot of amortization expense going away late in the cycle. So we've got to have basically a full point of expansion just from that. That's not new. We talked about that when we first laid out the targets. So that gives you a full point and then from there, from where we expect to be this year, you need less than a point of margin expansion over the two years to get to the low-end, and less than 2 points to get to the high end.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thanks, Mitch. I'll turn it over.","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Thank you, George.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Mitch and Anne, I hope you are well. Forgive me I joined a bit late, so forgive me if I am repeating anything. But it sounds like you reduced \u2013 you slightly reduced your organic sales growth guidance on account of some weakness in North America in PSM. Am I on the mark so far?","Anne L. Bramman - Avery Dennison Corp.","Yes. When we looked at our guidance, yes, we came in a little bit softer on the North America for PSM. And I think if you look at the full year guidance, the reality is we're going to be around the midpoint. If you look at the two ranges, you'd have to assume a pretty significant change in the run rate in Q4 for the businesses, and on the downside piece to it you would have to assume a reversal in trend for all the businesses as well. So the likelihood is we are going to be around the midpoint.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then \u2013 thanks, Anne. And you raised your guidance partly on tax and I think you said partly on better PSM. Is that right?","Anne L. Bramman - Avery Dennison Corp.","Correct. And I will clarify on the tax, that's really a contributor from PSM as well. We saw a very favorable geo mix of where the income was coming from lower tax jurisdictions. So I really consider that kind of operational beat as well.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So you have lower sales expectations for PSM broadly, but you have higher profit expectations for PSM for the year presumably on margins, right?","Anne L. Bramman - Avery Dennison Corp.","Correct.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And that's why the margin upside given the sales \u2013 given that sales were a bit light?","Anne L. Bramman - Avery Dennison Corp.","So again a similar story than what we've had \u2013 that we've had the last couple of quarters is productivity continues to be a very strong performer for this division and in this quarter, we continue to deliver on the productivity front. So really the beat we had that we're showing for the full year guidance came from this quarter.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And just in terms your implied 4Q guidance that's the midpoint around $0.95 compared to last year's $0.85, last year you had a little tax rate. So can you just help us understand what the primary drivers of that year-over-year growth are?","Anne L. Bramman - Avery Dennison Corp.","So for our guidance for the margin we would assume the normal seasonal margin, sequential margin pieces from Q3 to Q4 for PSM and we are in traditionally the RBIS business does have a higher margin sequentially from Q3 to Q4 that we also have baked in. So you look at our guidance range, really the biggest component of it is where will the margins deliver for RBIS.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Anne. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup Global Markets. Please go ahead.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. With the investment in Luxembourg, is it possible to say when the capacity becomes available or when it ramps and then how much of that $65 million investment shows up in 2016 CapEx versus 2017 and kind of any early view on 2017 CapEx?","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Yeah. So just specifically with that investment, it's coming online essentially for the year 2018 is when it will be up and running. So that's our expectation. And if you look at the investment that we're making, we've consistently talked about pretty robust growth within Europe, both Western Europe but also the combination of Western Europe and Eastern Europe.","So this is a business that actually we haven't added a new coder in for labels for quite a number of years. And so this is to fund the growth that we're seeing within that business right now and we expect we'll continue to be investing in that region because we see quite a bit of opportunity for continued growth there. As far as the CapEx timing, Anne do you want to comment?","Anne L. Bramman - Avery Dennison Corp.","Yeah. So generally the bulk of the CapEx timing will take place in 2017 and the spending that we have this year is within the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year of roughly $200 million for CapEx. And again, when we laid out our 2018 target we said that on average we would spend about $200 million in CapEx over the years. We're a little behind in the first couple of years of that guidance range, so I would expect to see us still average around the $200 million. It's just going to be a little more back weighted overall for the company.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Okay. That's very helpful. And then in RBIS, I think the last quarter you indicated you were impacted by store closures and athletic goods. I'm wondering given what we've been reading in a very challenging retail environment, our store closures, are they still a headwind in 3Q? And does that may be a drag through the end of the year or any kind of color you can give there?","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","There's always some consolidation in store closures and what you see is what we see. Specifically what we commented on before was the fact that there was some bankruptcies of some athletic store, athletic chains. So, that affected performance athletics to recall at declined last quarter, which was exceptional because usually we see very consistent growth. So that category for us returned to growth in this past \u2013 in Q3.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just one last one. It's kind of a follow-up to George's question on RBIS. In your remarks you referenced accelerating the RBIS margin improvement program and I was wondering if can you give a little color on the levers you can pull there from here on out. Do you need to get more aggressive on the price adjustments or are there additional costs that you can take out or would you get more aggressive along M&A or just how should we think about the levers you can pull to accelerate the RBIS margin improvement?","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Yeah. I think it's just a basically a continued execution of what we've been doing but really taking the next step and accelerating what we've been doing. This is about winning in the marketplace and I'll tell you from what we're seeing and what we are hearing from customers. The changes we made are resonating, that gives us confidence. We are seeing the numbers behind that of volume gains in a period of declining market conditions, so that gives us confidence.","And we just see opportunities to run this business more efficiently as well. So there's quite a few levers within a business of that size and don't want to go through each of the individual details but we feel not pleased with where the performance is but confident with the prospects of this business and what we are going to deliver.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks. I will turn it over.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I was wondering if you could give us a feel for the growth rate in the athletic chains following the softness in the previous quarter. What is a normal rate that you were expecting and are you there in the third quarter?","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","So this can have a little bit of volatility too, but it's consistently grown above the average for the overall segment and pretty \u2013 relatively consistently mid-single digits to higher, so and that's where was within Q3.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Okay. Thank you. And could you give us some detail as to the inventory increase versus last year inventory is up 10% versus revenues up 2.7% or is this Mactac or is something else going on?","Anne L. Bramman - Avery Dennison Corp.","So Rosemarie, there a couple of components to it. Yes, this is the first quarter that we have got Mactac in our balance sheet, so that will distort some of your ratios a little bit. But in general, a couple of quarters ago we talked about the fact that we were making some investments in certain select areas and inventory primarily in RFID with RBIS.","And so while we have continued to make progress, and we have seen the inventory reductions come down as we played out the year, we still have an investment in that in order to carry us through the end of this year into next year.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","So this is making sure you have the proper inventory in anticipation of the changes you are making?","Anne L. Bramman - Avery Dennison Corp.","It's the pipeline of RFID customers that we've got to make sure that we are meeting their demands.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Okay. Thank you. And if may I ask one last one, your ratio price, selling price versus cost, was negative as raw material costs seem to be rising, are you expecting that ratio to worsen in the few quarters until you manage to get price up in line with raw material cost?","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","So, raw material cost, the environment we're seeing is relatively stable. You see some commodities like oil have been on an upswing, but as far as what we're experiencing they've been relatively stable.","And as far as the net impact of price and raw material cost, Anne talked about what the headwind was in the quarter, and over the long run we've been pretty consistent in saying that some of the modest gains we've had in each quarter over the past couple of years basically, over the long run those eventually adjust for themselves, if you will, or correct.","So, what we're seeing on the pricing, net pricing front is what we expected, the outperformance in PSM was largely around continued productivity, and our objective here is to consistently grow this business, leveraging our innovation capabilities, which includes finding ways to reduce the material content of our products so that we can be competitive in the marketplace and grow the market while driving returns and margins in this business.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Thank you. And one very quick one, if I may. When are you \u2013 when are we anniversarying the program loss in Performance Tape?","Anne L. Bramman - Avery Dennison Corp.","So, we had a bit of \u2013 a small piece of that in the first half of the year, but I would expect to see headwinds in the second half as the program loss really \u2013 we really start filling that in Q3.","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","It's basically mid next year is the rough rule of thumb you should use, Rosemarie.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey John Zekauskas with JPMorgan Securities. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, thanks very much. I guess I'd like to go back to raw materials. I understand that your raw material costs were pretty benign, but propylene costs are up $0.10 pound since April. And so that's going to move up acrylic prices in the fourth and in the first quarter. So, is your attitude that you're going to wait and see, as the raw material costs move up, if they do move up before you take pricing action, or are you going to try to be more aggressive? What's your stance as some of the petrochemical values move up?","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Yeah, so we saw a little bit of modest inflation that we talked about last quarter, but we've seen relative stability, and individual components, Jeff, move in different directions. But on balance is where we're seeing things fairly muted, if you will. So that's what we're referring to, not any individual components, you're absolutely right, what you're seeing is what we're seeing for that component.","But what we do is when there is inflation, and so if we were to \u2013 if start to seeing inflation, we go through and we will announce price increases on which products or which region it's affecting. And a good example of that is last year we were still in a relatively deflationary environment. We raised prices within film and categories within Europe. So went out and announced it and pushed it through. So you've really got to think through about \u2013 with the commodities we're seeing, it's different in U.S. dollars or if you are in euros, and so we basically make adjustments and we will put price increases where we see inflation.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. You made a couple of small acquisitions. What did you pay for them and what did you get? That is what was the revenues or the EBITDA and what were the cost of your two small acquisitions?","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Yes, we don't \u2013 I mean, they're very small and so we don't want to disclose all the details about them, but I can tell you the incremental acquisition just has a few million dollars of revenue; so very small.","It's a business that's really investing in our high-value reflectives business but it's also a capability we think we can leverage elsewhere within the portfolio as well. They make UV and UV LED curable inks and it's part of our TrafficJet solution within that business.","And then on Pragmatic, so that was an investment you haven't \u2013 was earlier in October, so it's not in the results right now.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sure.","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","That's a minority investment. There was \u00a318 million funding round that Pragmatic went through. We were less than half of that, I will say.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Why is Europe PSM growing faster than the U.S.? Or are there particular markets in Europe that are healthier or more robust and are there particular PSM markets in the U.S. that are a little lackluster?","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","So, Europe broadly speaking gets the benefit of Eastern Europe emerging markets, and Eastern Europe this quarter is what really was a key driver for them. But actually pretty consistently for the past years even Western Europe we've talked about growth being higher than the U.S.","And there's a number of factors behind that. We can't point to any one. One of them is regulatory requirements around larger label sizes and so forth. So there's not one thing I can point to, that's one example. But to be honest, it's the differential between the U.S. and Western Europe has pretty much consistently been a little bit bigger than we would have even expected. I'm talking about market level not just our performance.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And in the weakness in the U.S., was it confined to a particular market or it's too hard to tell?","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Not a particular market, no. It's relatively broad-based.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Okay. I think that's it from me. Thank you so much.","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","You're welcome.","Operator","We have a follow-up question from the line of George Leon Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Hi, guys. I want to come back to RFID and RBIS a little bit. So recognizing you're not giving guidance here for 2017, do you think, Mitch, over the next couple of years \u2013 let's frame it that way, that the outlook for adoption is as good as what we've seen, you know, say over the trailing 12 months? I recognize it's retailer by retailer, et cetera, and it can come in fairly large chunks, but if you had a frame is it as good, better, somewhat worse, how would you have us consider it over the next couple of years?","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","I would say it's as good and getting better.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","So, we basically a year or so ago we were talking about getting into an inflection point starting to see some customers adopt. We've seen that. But it's really hard to call when that will happen to the point you raise. I mean, next year we expect this business to be double-digit growth. It could be just over 10% or could be 30%. So timing specifically is hard to tell but over the long run we definitely, you know, we've talked about this business being at 20% growth business and that's what we continue to expect.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Mitch, are the returns getting better to the retailer from adoption that's why the growth has been so strong or are there other reasons why you'd see adoption? I would imagine have to be the former but, again, just want to get your thoughts on that.","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","I think it's just more \u2013 it's retailer by retailer and brand by brand, them going through the process. It's a pretty big shift and how they do things, how they think about running their supply chains. So the returns have been strong, very strong last few years for adoption. It's just each business, each customer needs to go through that assessment and evaluation. And the reason pilots can take so long and the early adoption phase can take a while is just purely because of the change and adjustments they need to make.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Back to the margin question from earlier and \u2013 again we have talked about this before and I was aware that you have the drop off in DNA, the roll-off from Paxar there. So if I look at the low end of your range, I guess I would drill down and say what makes you comfortable about getting that incremental 100 basis points or so? When I look at 2016, obviously a lot of restructuring benefit to your credit, but yet the margins are, at least in this quarter, kind of flat versus the year ago. So is it just further restructuring that drives the majority of that 100 basis points? Is it more in your view the RFID element which you're quite obviously positive on? What gives you confidence in at least capturing that last 100 basis points above and beyond the DNA component?","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","It's really a balance between driving the growth strategy as well as driving further productivity. And if you look at the business, we've consistently delivered over half-point a year of margin expansion regardless of what's going on in the top line. And if you look over the last few years, we've grown this business 2.5%. So our objective here is, ensure we can get those margin targets even in a lower growth scenario than the 4% to 5% we had targeted. We will get there even in this lower growth environment, and ensuring there is upside as we develop and push through our growth strategies so that when we start achieving that 4% to 5% growth, which is still our goal, you will then have further uplift from there.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Appreciate that. And then I guess my last question and I will turn it over, actually two part, two questions, I apologize. The Pressure-sensitive mix, what was negative in the quarter? I remember reading in the release, but I don't know what your comments were here on the call. And then the extra sales week in the fourth quarter from last year, I seem to remember that not really having much of an effect in earnings, but I just wanted to verify that. Thanks guys and good luck in the quarter.","Anne L. Bramman - Avery Dennison Corp.","Thanks. So the mix was primarily in two different areas. First was customer application that we had discussed in the personal care space for Tapes.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right.","Anne L. Bramman - Avery Dennison Corp.","So that was the Pressure-sensitive mix. And then the second piece was North America. Primarily in the high-value segments we've been talking about in North America volumes as well. So those were the two pieces of the mix. It was geo mix as well as customer Tapes. As far as the 53rd week, that was really...","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just on that, I saw emerging markets tended to be a higher-margin for you, so why would North America being a little bit weak be negative for mix?","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Yes, so as far as on the geo mix comment, George, our margins we've said are higher where we have higher relative market share and North America we have relatively high relative market share.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you for that. Sorry about that Anne, go ahead.","Anne L. Bramman - Avery Dennison Corp.","On the 53rd week, that was really 2014, 2015 impact, so you really wouldn't see anything for 2016.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, I was just reflecting on the comparison, but that's fine. Okay. Thank you, guys.","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Mr. Butier, I will now turn the call back to you. Please continue with your presentation or closing remarks.","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Okay. Thank you. Well, thanks everybody for joining the call.

The conference ID number is 21930677.","I now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Guenther, Avery Dennison, Vice President, Investor Relations and Finance. Please go ahead, madam. ","Cindy Guenther","Thank you, Jennifer. Today we'll discuss our preliminary unaudited fourth quarter and full year results. Please note that throughout today's discussion we'll be making references, non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP measures that we use are defined, qualified and reconciled with GAAP, on schedules A-4 to A-8 of the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release and the appendix of our supplemental presentation materials. ","We remind you that we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. Before looking statements are made subject to the Safe Harbor statement included in today's earnings release. ","On the call today are Mitch Butier, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Lovins, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ","I'll turn it over to Mitch. ","Mitch Butier","I'm pleased to report another year of strong adjusted earnings growth with EPS of 9% or 15% on a constant currency basis, despite lower than usual organic growth of 2% due to challenging market conditions. ","As you know, our focus in the slower top-line growth environment is on protecting your margins in the base business while driving faster than average growth in high value categories like RFID. We are executing well on both fronts while investing to drive future growth and further strengthen our competitive position. ","We are largely on track to achieve our long term financial targets that we communicated three years ago. Greg will walk you through the scorecard in a moment. Our consistent performance reflects the resilience of our industry leading market positions, the strategic foundations we've laid and our agile and talents and workforce. ","Our mission is to create value for all of our stakeholders through innovation, operational excellence, and highly disciplined capital allocation. These fundamentals drive the successful execution of our core strategies in particular achieving outside growth in high value categories, driving profitable growth in our base business and detaining how ambitious 2025 sustainability goals. In 2019 we made good progress on all of our strategic priorities. ","High value categories in the emerging markets remain our two key catalysts for GDP plus growth across our entire portfolio with over half of our total sales linked to one or both of these. In 2019 high value categories and the emerging markets again grew faster than the average. High value categories are up mid-single digits with RFID alone contributing nearly a full point to total company sales growth. ","Our base business declined modestly. We -- LGM market share that we see is at the tail end of the last inflationary cycle that we discussed previously. Importantly LGM volume turned improved in the back half of the year as we recovered that share, we expect this volume improvement trend to continue into 2020. ","Our continued focus on operational excellence, which has long fueled our industry leading service and quality was again a key enabler of significant productivity gains. The combination of product reengineering, restructuring and the deployment of lean operating principles enabled us to again, expand margins further, enhance our competitiveness and continue providing a funding source for reinvestment. ","Equally important, we continue to make solid progress towards our 2025 sustainability goals. You'll be able to read more about this in our new integrated Annual Report that will come out in March. ","Just a few highlights. As of year-end 2019 we'd reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by more than 30% since 2015 over 85% of our paper is now certified to be sustainably source. Close to 95% of our operations are landfill free and we further improved our already top-notch employee engagement scores.","Now looking at how our strategy is played out in each of our segments. Label and graphic materials delivered modest organic growth under challenging market conditions. The base business was flat overall for the year, which as I mentioned, reflect that share loss that we largely recovered by year end. ","High value categories once again, grew faster than the base. I'll be at a slower pace than we're used to do the softer and market demand. Likewise, emerging markets also grew faster than average though slower than usual with strength in India in South America offsetting weak demand in North Asia. ","At the same time, LGMs adjusted operating margin expanded another 30 basis points to 13.3% and this already high return business as we completed the restructuring of this is European footprint mid-year. ","Over the past couple of years, LGM has successfully navigated through a significant inflationary as well as the subsequent transitions in the modestly deflationary cycle that we've been seeing more recently demonstrating the resilience of our business model. ","Given our strong leadership position in the industry, we are willing to take some near term share risks through these cycles knowing that our superior product quality, service and cost position will ultimately win out. ","So while 2019 proved more challenging, reflecting both market driven headwinds and some missteps on our own part, we are well positioned for profitable growth in 2020 and beyond with excellent returns in this business. Retail branding and information solution sales increased by more than 5% on an organic basis, driven by over 20% growth in high value categories, that is RFID and external embellishments. The apparel business decline, modestly reflecting market demand that was impacted by trade related uncertainty. ","While there are signs of potential resolution of this uncertainty, some customers may further rebalance their supply chains. ","Our global footprint along with our differentiated pop product and service capabilities gives us a significant competitive advantage to win over the long term as we partner with our customers to support their evolving sourcing strategies. ","Enterprise wide RFID products and solutions grew by more than 20% generating roughly $365 million of sales reflecting ongoing penetration of apparel, as well as expansion in relatively new verticals including food, beauty and logistics. ","Our total pipeline of customer engagements continues to expand. Compared to this time last year our number of customer engagements from business case to rollout is up 50% driven primarily by categories outside of apparel. ","As a leader in ultra high frequency RFID, we are positioned extremely well to capture these opportunities with industry leading innovation and manufacturing capabilities and the best most experienced team in the space. And we continue to build out this platform, increasing our level of investment to drive growth both organically and through acquisitions and external partnerships.","To that end, our purchase of Smarttrac's in laid business, which we expect to close late this quarter, represents an excellent strategic fit for us. Combined RFID becomes a more than $500 million business, expected to grow 15% to 20% annually over the long term. ","Smarttrac's capabilities complement our existing product offerings and process technologies while expanding our intelligent labels platform to better serve industrial and retail segments. And their global manufacturing footprint likewise, complimentary to our own, strengthens our inlay manufacturing capacity and capabilities. ","Turning to profitability, RBIS has adjusted operating margin, expanded another 120 basis points for the year. The team had done a tremendous job transforming RBIS and just simpler, faster and more competitive business over the past four years and we're pleased with the performance we're seeing here. ","Shifting now to industrial and healthcare materials. Although sales growth was modest for the segment, we believe we outpaced the market across most categories and importantly we made substantial progress towards our 2021 profitability target, driving 140 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. We've strengthened our management team here and fine tuned our strategies. We remain confident that this segment will deliver significant value over the medium to longer term.","On all 2019 was another solid year. As we reflect back on the last few years, we are pleased with how we have leveraged our foundational strengths in operational excellence and innovation to consistently make progress towards our long term goals to deliver GDP plus growth and top quartile returns on capital. ","We have driven outsize growth in high value segments, while also growing profitably in our base businesses. We have substantially reduced the environmental impact of our operations while focusing increasingly on the development of innovative or environmentally sending products. ","We've continually driven productivity that has enabled us to ramp up our pace of investments in high value segments, particularly RFID, while also expanding margins and importantly, this progress has been made possible by our amazing team that's dedicated to delivering for all of our stakeholders in a dynamic environment, while upholding our longstanding commitments to integrity and excellence. ","As we looked at 2020 we are confident we will continue to make progress in our strategic fronts, including the next evolution of our leadership structure and way to productivity initiatives. As you know, we've had a theme over the last few years to move more and more decision making closer to our markets, both to increase speed and lower costs. Along these lines, we are now consolidating our corporate and group functions for LGM and IHM. ","In addition to making the leadership structure number , this and other productivity initiatives we've recently launched will yield significant savings through 2021 enabling us to continue to increase our pace of organic investments while also expanding margins. ","So once again, we're pleased with the progress we've made to our long term goals over the last few years and in 2019 specifically and we expect to make continued progress in 2020. ","That's for guidance. We expect adjusted EPS of $6.90 to $7.15 with our outlook reflecting improved volume growth and continued for activity gains, partially offset by increments on investments and transition costs associated with our next wave of restructuring actions. ","I'll now turn the call over to Greg. ","Greg Lovins","Thanks Mitch, and hello everyone. I'll first provide an update on our performance against our long term goals, and then walk you through fourth quarter performance and our outlook for 2020. ","Slide 7 of our supplemental presentation materials provides an update on our progress against the five-year targets that we communicated in 2017, and recall that this represents our third set of long term goals after meeting or beating our previous two sets of long term targets. ","As you can see, we are largely on track specifically over the past three years, sales growth on a constant currency basis is in line with our target up 5.7% annually. While organic growth was close to 4% just slightly below our target due to the generally slower demand environment in 2019, and reported operating margin hit nearly 11% in 2019 or 11.7% on an adjusted basis, up from roughly 10% in 2016. ","And do you largely do that combination of strong top line growth in margin expansion adjusted earnings per share was up 18% annually. Return on total capital adjusting for the distortion related to the termination of our U.S. pension plan came in close to 20% for 2019, well above our 17% target that reflects top core performance relative to capital market peers. And our balance sheet remains strong with our net debt to EBITDA ratio below the low end of our target range. ","Our consistent progress towards achieving these long term goals reflects the diversity of our end of markets, our strong competitive advantages and our resilience as an organization to adjust course when needed. Together these give us confidence in our ability to deliver GDP plus growth in top quartile returns on capital over the long term. ","Now at the same time that we communicated our financial goals through 2021 we also laid out a five year plan for capital allocation, which you can see on slide eight. We're tracking well against this plan starting with strong cash flow generation and we put a total of $2.4 billion to work over the first three years of this cycle. Allocating that largely in line with our long term plan. ","And clearly our current leverage position gives us ample capacity to continue our pace of investments for organic growth and acquisitions while also continuing to return cash to shareholders in a disciplined way. ","Now let's focus on the fourth quarter. Overall, financial results were solid with adjusted earnings per share of $1.73 up 14% versus prior year, and about a nickel better than our expectations. We grew sales by 2.1% on an organic basis in currency translation, reduced reported sales growth by 1.9 points in the quarter.","Adjusted operating margin increased by 80 basis points to 11.9% and we realized $18 million of restructuring savings net of transition costs in the quarter due in part to LGMs restructuring in Europe. ","And our cash generation has been strong as we delivered $512 million of free cash flow for the year up roughly $83 million compared to 2018, and this increase reflects both profit growth and improved working capital efficiency. ","The fixed and IQ capital spending, total fixed and IQ capital spinning came in at $257 million in 2019, which was in line with prior year and a bit lighter than we had expected due to the delay of some spending related to project timing at year end. ","Utilizing our strong cash flow, we returned $427 million in cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and a higher dividend. In line with the average amount of cash distributed to shareholders over the preceding two year period. ","So turning to segment results for the quarter label and graphic material sales increased by 1.5% on an organic basis, driven by the net effect of volume and mix partially offset by pricing. LGMs based business and high value categories were both up the low-single digits in Q4. The base business sales trends improved from earlier this year who fucking easier comparisons to the timing of share loss at the end of 2018 in early 2019 as discussed previously. ","And high value category growth slowed in the quarter reflecting the decline in graphic sales due to a challenging prior year comparison in North America as well as generally softer and market demand in the quarter. ","Stepping back to look at LGMs sales trends through the course of 2019 organic growth has been relatively stable between 1.0% or 1.5% each quarter and the first half though volume and mix represented a net negative with price adding roughly 2.5 points. ","On the second half volume and mix were net positive with price becoming a headwind by the fourth quarter. Given the sequential deflation that came through in the third and fourth quarters, we do expect pricing to be a roughly 1.5 point headwind to LGMs organic growth in 2020 with the toughest price comp impacting in here in the first quarter. ","Breaking down the LGMs organic growth in the quarter by region, North America declined at a low single digit rate, reflecting what we believe was a relatively flat market along with lower prices. Western Europe grew at a low single digit rate driven by modest market growth and share gain partially offset by pricing. ","Emerging markets were up low to mid single digits with relative strength in South Asia, Eastern Europe and South America partially offset by a modest decline in China. And operating margin for the segment was strong up 40 basis points on an adjusted basis to 13.3%, as the benefits of productivity initiatives and the net impact of raw material deflation in pricing were partially offset by unfavorable product mix. ","So shifting now to retail branding and information solutions. RBS delivered another quarter of strong top line growth up 5.2% on an organic basis, driven by continued strength and RFID and external embellishments, which are up more than 20% on a combined basis. ","Our base business adjusted for the migration of products to higher value RFID solutions was up slightly versus prior year. A modest improvement compared to Q3 and in line with our expectations. ","Adjusted operating margin for the segment expanded by 140 basis points to 13.6% that's a benefit from increased volume and productivity were partially offset by higher employee related costs and growth related investments.","Turning to the industrial and healthcare material segment, sales declined by 1.1% on an organic basis as a low single digit increase for industrial categories was more than offset by a mid single digit decline in health care. We continue to make solid progress in the margin front in IHM beating our 10% margin goal for the full year for Q4 specifically adjusted operating margin increased by 60 basis points to 10.2% as the benefits of productivity gains in strategic pricing initiatives more than offset higher employee related costs. ","So turning now to our outlook for 2020, we anticipate adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $6.90 to $7.15. We've outlined some of the key contributing factors to this guidance. On slide 14 of our supplemental presentation materials. ","We estimate that organic sales growth will be approximately 2% to 3% what's the midpoint of that range reflecting the carry over effects of the share we recaptured in LGM partially offset by expected price reductions associated with the deflation that we've been experiencing.","Our 2020 fiscal year contains 53 weeks ending on January 2nd, 2021. The extra week which you picked up in the fourth quarter is expected to add about 1.2 reported sales growth with no impact on organic growth. And note that the extra week crosses over the New Year's holiday, so it's expected to be a low volume week with lower than average profitability and we expect it to add an estimated $0.10 benefit to EPS. And we expected the Smartrac's acquisition well at about 1.5 points of growth for the year, assuming the deal closes late this quarter. ","Given transition costs and interest expense, we expect the acquisition will be modestly diluted to earnings in 2020 roughly offsetting the benefit of the extra week so the effects of the two will not be equally distributed through the year. At least recent rates currency translation is a 30 basis point headwind to report at sales growth with a headwind in the first half, particularly in the first quarter becoming a slight tailwind in the fourth quarter.","And we estimate incremental pre-tax savings from restructuring net of transition costs will contribute between $30 million and $40 million in 2020, and note that a meaningful portion of the savings associated with the restructuring charges taken recently will not be realized until 2021 likely on the order of $30 million. ","We expected both the GAAP and adjusted tax rates will be in the mid 20s for the full year with the variability in the GAAP tax rate from quarter-to-quarter as usual. And we anticipate spending $220 million to $230 million on fixed capital and IT projects down from the previous two years as anticipated. ","The cash payments associated with our restructuring initiatives are likely to come in around $35 million, roughly $20 million lower than the past year, and we estimate average shares outstanding assuming dilution of roughly 84 million. ","Finally, while the Coronavirus situation in China is very fluid and it's early days to assess its full impact. We've factored in up to a nickel headwind to our EPS guidance, reflecting the mandated delays and starting back up following Lunar New Year, it's impacting many regions in China in which we operate. And of course our first priority is ensuring the health and safety of our employees and that's the focus of our team right now. ","So in summary, we're pleased with the strategic and financial progress we've made against our long term goals in 2019 and we're committed to delivering exceptional value through our strategies for long term profitable growth and disciplined capital allocation. ","Now we'll open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird & Company. Please proceed with your question. Please go ahead. Your line is open. ","Ghansham Panjabi","I guess, you know, first off on the two and a half percent core sales growth that you're guiding towards to the mid-point and can you sort of break out that construct further by segments. I know you called out a 1.5% or so price headwind for LGM, but what about volumes for each of the segments and for the Corona buyers impact and the nickel that you have baked in. Will that impact, do you think both segments LGM and RBIS or is it specific to one? ","Greg Lovins","Yeah, it's the first time I saw him on the growth or 2% to 3% as I talked about, includes volume growth a bit higher than that with about a point and a half of price at winning LGM, which is about a point to the full company. So we expect a little more volume growth, particularly in LGM with some of the carryover, uh, share gains that we had in 2019 and then within RBIS, we expect to continue to see strong growth in RFID contributing similar level of growth for the company that we saw in 2019.","So I think that's the biggest drivers of growth between LGM and RBIS for the, for the year. We look at the Coronavirus impacts most of what we factored in that nickel is related to the materials businesses since those are generally serving demand is created in China. And that's the biggest impact and that nickel basically is based on about a week starting up later post Chinese New Year within RBIS, the factories there are generally demand in the other regions. So we do foresee some potential delays or shipments from Q1 into Q2 depending on how this plays out over the next couple of months. But the demand we think wouldn't be as effective as it would be in the materials businesses. ","Mitch Butier","Yeah. So just to add it up, obviously a fluid situation, our first priority as Greg noted earlier, is ensuring the safety and health and well being of our teams, and second to ensuring we're","supporting our customers as they work to support their overall end market demand as well for this environment. ","So pretty good, our guidance considers just one week basically lost sales and lost consumption for the direct, for the consumption in region. Just to shift from Q1, Q2 for a end demand that's service from China to outside of China. ","Ghansham Panjabi","And the confidence meets on the volume improvement is that big time visibility you have on share gains or you send a better macroeconomic backdrop as you unfold. What do you have embedded in there? ","Mitch Butier","We use the big broad economic forecast that you would be looking at as well for 2020, but the specific improved trends is, reflects the current trends we saw in 2019, particularly at LGM if you recall the first half we're coping lower share positions within LGM, within that business then hopefully on the RBIS side, outside of RFID, which we continue to exceed, expect continued a strong growth both there and external embellishments, but we had a negative impacts from the volatility just around the tariff situation and so forth. ","So that's, we do expect an improvement overall a lot of it's just copying, uh, some weaker trends that we saw particularly in the first half in LGM. ","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay. And then for my second question on RFID, you know, legacy Avery RFID has been growing pretty steadily at, you know, call it 20% or so a year? How does that compare to a Smartrac's in terms of their growth rates? What does it add from a technology standpoint to Avery? which particular end markets are you getting incremental exposure to I think you'd call that industrial and some retail -- So it just more clarity there. Thanks. ","Greg Lovins ","Yeah. So Smartrac's with a leader in developer and manufacturer and RFID inlay. The new technology brings us in areas such as industry, so near field communications as well as a sensor. So around moisture and temperature sensors, sensors and so forth. And a number of new applications I mean they obviously serve the base apparel business like we do, but they also bring a number of new applications such as interactive garments, that provide, you know, enable people for, for example, skin jackets to have real time interaction, um, through social media, using connected and smart appliances, toys. There's a number of various end applications and from an end market perspective increased expansion exposure within retail and then also in the automotive sector as well. ","So those are some of the new capabilities and technologies that it brings. And as far as growth, their growth rate is below ours so we've talked about our long term growth objective being 15% to 20% plus organically we've been delivering around 20 of these suggested gunshots. ","Now, we're now saying that combined and see we expect to be 15% to 20% reason I grew up with a slower was just, you know, they were growing slower and retail with Avery organically, taking a bit of share each year in the space then to just automotive saw a little bit of a slowdown particularly in 2019 for all the other reasons that we've been talking through. ","So very strategic acquisition brings us great capabilities and we're confident and we're going to be able to deliver 15% to 20% growth with the combined entity with margins above the average profile consistent with what we've been delivering so far. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with BoFA Securities. Please proceed with your question.","George Staphos","First question I had was on the restructuring, Mitch and Greg, if you could provide a little bit more detail and to the extent possible, I recognize it you can't share everything obviously, but you know, what's involved with the next restructuring Ash? And you mentioned, I think combining some back office or organizational structures between LGM and IHM. What else is involved, you know, down the road, might we see some, you know, further production capacity, uh, melded together or folded in, given the investments that you've made. And what do you say is your actual net benefit from productivity and restructuring asset this year? I know there's some that'll trail into 21 and beyond, but what do you get this year that have transitioned costs? ","Mitch Butier","George I'll answer the first part of the question. Greg can cover the outlook for the savings. So specifically George, I mean again, the next wave of restructuring actions that we've recently unfolding. The biggest single one there and the charging Q4 relates to the consolidation of the functions between IHM, corporate and LGM. So it's exactly what you called out. We see an opportunity to move faster and reduce costs by better integrating and removing that extra functional level, to be able to deploy more of those resources locally, for driving growth. So that's -- that's the largest, areas of restructuring. There's a number of other initiatives and we'll comment on those in due time.","Greg Lovins","I think from the savings perspective, in 2019, we had about $50 million of a restructuring savings net of transition costs in a year. As we said earlier, expect us to be about $30 million to $40 million in 2020. With about $20 million to $25 million of that being carried over from the actions that we did in 2019. The largest part of that carry over, of course, coming in the first half from that European footprint action. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup Market -- Global Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Anthony Pettinari","In LGM, it sounds like high value products were really strong for the year, but the graphics and reflectives were down low-single digits in 4Q, I think you talked about a tough comp, but I think you also mentioned demand maybe being a little bit softer. And I was wondering, if you could tease out the impact of those two factors, and kind of any thoughts on what you're seeing in graphics and reflectives in 1Q or what you expect? ","Mitch Butier","So not much of you yet in 1Q, just given the early start to the year, and where we are right now. I think in the fourth quarter, we did have probably an even split between the challenging comps, Particularly in North America from prior year. And a little bit of slowness across the other regions from a graphics perspective. Still last year we grew in the low-to-mid single digit range for graphics overall for the year. So we'd expect to get closer to that level for full year 2020 as well.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay, that's helpful. And then just on RFID, the Japanese producer that made an announcement about principal ICS that can maybe reduce tag prices to sensor was. And I guess without talking about any particular competitor, do you think principal ICE technology is something that is could potentially be impactful to the RFID business? Is it really something that's new? Just any, just general thoughts about that in RFID? ","Mitch Butier","Yes, that development specifically relatively early stage. But not going to talk too much about the specific development, but overall we're quite close to the developments in the industry. We're a leader in the space and we look at anything that expands the product offering, including lowering the cost, even if it's gotten more reduced the storage capacity as being good for the industry and good for us.","It's something we're -- we're close to and following. But I can't give too many specifics, but there's a number of developments going on just like we're developing within our pragmatic venture investment that we have, another route to low costs basically circuitry, if you will, integrated circuit. So yes, we're close to it. We think it could be exciting for the overall industry and exciting for us. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","John McNulty","Thanks for taking my question. So with regard to the deflationary environment, do you expect to give all raw material benefits that you're -- that you should be seeing back and forth -- in the form of price? Or do you get to keep or capture some of it at this point? I guess how should we be thinking about that as we look at 2020? ","Greg Lovins","I think from a 2020 perspective, right now, we're expecting pricing, raw material input costs to be relatively neutral year-over-year. So as we went through the back half of 2019, we saw sequential deflation start to pick up in Q3 a little bit -- a little bit more than in Q4. Really largely centered around paper coming down in the back half of the year.","As you know, typically when we have price upper, price down as a quarter or so lags, we probably kept a little bit of that in the back half of last year. And then we'll pass that through more into the -- as we entered 2020.","And I'd expect 2020 to be closer to neutral from a price and raw material and for cost perspective.","Mitch Butier","And just to build on that, we don't think of it as passing through necessarily and so forth. It's basically each of the, we're talking to the average and every single region, every single product category is different. So it depends on where the inflation's happening as far as across the spectrum between our base and higher value segments. As well as whether it's paper or more chemical based. And right now it's more paper based, which all of us in all of our competitors tend to be equally exposed to from a commodity standpoint. So, it varies. We're going to continue to manage it, I think, as I've commented on to do it successfully through the last inflationary cycle. And now we're in a monastery deflationary. Our guidance assumes that -- that, it's, as Greg said, belts see net neutral. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBank Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Michael O'Brian","It's actually Michael O'Brian thrown in for Adam. Thanks for taking my question. Just one on IHM quickly. Obviously a nice margin expansion this year. Can you talk about sort of what your outlook is for 2020? And how far you think you can take that?","Greg Lovins ","So our expectations on IHM as you said, we had a margins up well over point in 2019. And we had said, when we're sitting here a year ago, we were targeting 10% margins in LGM 19 delivered a little bit better than that. Our expectation in 2020 is to continue improving our margins and we're targeting 11% or better in 2020. On the path towards, our long term target of 12.5% are high or so. ","We're continuing to improve or expect to continue improving 2020, and then further improvement again in 2021.","Michael O'Brian","And then just back to input cost for a second, you mentioned paper has been deflationary, probably the biggest. Can you -- can you just give us a sense of how a deflationary it's been just on a percentage basis?","Mitch Butier","Yes. I think, you know for the full year '19 we still had net inflation year-over-year started to see that deflation in the back half, I would say kind of in the low -- low-to-mid single digit range from percentage perspective. What we're expecting in 2020 is kind of low-single digit deflation consistent with what we talked about before about a point and a half or so a price down as well in 2020.","Greg Lovins ","And much of that carryover.","Mitch Butier","Exactly.","Greg Lovins ","On both fronts.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Zekauskas with JP Morgan Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Jeffrey Zekauskas","Thanks very much. Is smart tracks profitable business or can you talk about its profit characteristics in rough terms?","Mitch Butier","So overall, I mean, I'll just talk about the business and jumps. We talked about EPS. We expected to be a hit in 2020. Our group related to integration costs and everything else that goes along with the first year of acquisition. Next year, we already expect the EBITDA margin, their EBITDA margins now are above our company average, there'll be above the company average. ","Again next year, just like our RFID business, and we expect to be commensurate with our RFID businesses EBITDA margins in 2022. So that's where their profitability is now, and we'd expected to be comparable to our existing RFID business in a couple of years time.","Jeffrey Zekauskas","Okay, great. And in terms of raw material costs year-over-year in the fourth quarter, where they got about $10 million roughly.","Greg Lovins","Yes. So in Q4 we were down, as I said a minute ago, kind of low-to-mid single digit percentage from a deflation perspective. Particularly in -- largely in LGM because that's obviously where we use the primary amount of our -- our paper. So I tend for instance, doesn't use as much paper as a percentage of its materials.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paretosh Misra with Berenberg Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Paretosh Misra","Thanks for taking the question. For some of the RFIDs side, is there any interest to grow, any other technological capability in that business? For example, maybe scanners or sensors or maybe more printers or maybe even some software.","Mitch Butier","So we overall, we refer to it as a building out leveraging RFID to build out our intelligent labels platform. And one of the reasons for the shift in the language is to not limit ourselves to thinking just about the -- at the time UHF RFID Inlay technology. So, yes, we are looking broadly beyond the specific technologies that we've, from a legacy standpoint had. We already are in the printers business. So we do manufacture, printer RFID enabled printers. We have -- we are investing more and more in the information solutions capabilities, which information solutions is a key aspect of RBS is core business, as far as managing data between the retailers and brands and they -- they're globally outsourced apparel manufacturers so building on that.","And as I mentioned earlier, smart track actually does bring some sensor technology with it as well. So, we're looking primarily around technologies that linked the physical to the virtual worlds and enable the internet of things. So, have we focused around the Inlay's capability and looking at other -- other capabilities on the periphery to invest in to enable further growth?","Paretosh Misra","And then on the -- in the LGM based business, if you could maybe just talk about the outside the inflation deflation, but just the supply demand benefits you're seeing. And, when do you think you might be an environment where you might be able to raise prices? ","Mitch Butier","Sorry, if you're questioning about what the supply demand environment is. I think we've talked about that overall, but what were our outlook is going into 2020 on growth overall, the volume trends had been improving. And the second half of '19 respects to continue improve in the 2020. And from a pricing standpoint, we're very disciplined. Look at ourselves being the market leader, not just doing what's right for our business but the industry. And when I talked through managing successfully through the inflationary cycle, raising prices, multiple times to move ourselves, to where we wanted the business to be and adjusting courses, we started to get in the deflationary cycle.","So, our pricing actions, we talked about our broad based here, but it's very specific targeted customer, right customer for a product by product. And so that's where the informs are decisions around pricing both up and down. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Neel Kumar with Morgan Stanley Investments. Please proceed with your question.","Neel Kumar","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Can you just talk about your cadence of volumes through the fourth quarter. And we'll level lead been so far in January?","Greg Lovins ","Sure. So again, as we talked about a little bit earlier, our volumes particularly in LGM were a little bit stronger in Q4, and they had been earlier in the year. So in LGM, the first half as we said volume and mix was a net and down year-over-year in Q4 we started, or the back half we started seeing improvement in volumes, including in the fourth quarter. As we picked up some net share gains as we've talked about already. Overall the reading Q4 is difficult month-to-month because of the timing of holiday shifts, thanksgiving, Christmas moving a little bit earlier, every -- every period. So, the overall trend macro that Greg laid out is the right one to focus on.","As we go into January, January is also very difficult to read and to all of these Asia because of Lunar new year is relatively meaningless as far as the trends outside of that. What we're seeing in January is consistent with the revenue guidance that we're giving. With looks like, again, we're on timing of holidays and so forth. There might've been a little bit of deferrals, some shipments in North America from Q4 and Q1, a little bit maybe if more shipments that we expect in Europe in Q4 versus Q1. So they basically balance out in total.","Greg Lovins","And when you look at organic growth in the first quarter that will be our largest price headwind year-over-year. So that has an impact on the quarter certainly compared to the full year impact on price.","Neel Kumar","And then you mentioned that 2019 CapEx was a dead light or due to the delays in spending. But then your 2020 capital spend guidance is still coming down about $30 million to $35 million. Do you talk about what's driving that? And is it 2020 CapEx a decent one way to think about going forward? ","Mitch Butier","Well, we have our long term. We laid out a five year capital allocation plan, which basically had $250 million on the average spend over that period. I know that's a loose average. We've spent a little more than that the last couple of years, and we did say that we would have a bid of higher during those two periods. We've been able to spend a little bit less, partially because of the delay is great, commented on. As well as we've found ways to spend a little bit less on the existing projects that we had at planned.","So we -- our five year average that we've laid out is $250 million. It's less than that in 2020 as we've -- as we've walked through. If you pull back from the numbers, we've also discussed, we've gone through a period of recapitalization of our footprint in North America and Europe, which was a key driver of the greater investment in 2018 and '19, and obviously that's now complete. And that's not something that happens all that frequently. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Kapsch with Loop Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Kapsch","Yes, thanks for taking my questions. So just a follow up on smart track is the way you described the profitability of that business. I'm trying to understand why you're suggesting it would be dilutive. It looks -- I think you said it's more profitable than your RBIS segment or at least consistent with your RFID portion of your segment. And, we know what we paid for it, the annualized sales rates. So just trying to understand are you just not, are you -- you're not excluding your integration costs at one time in nature to describe it as dilutive? It looks like it should be a accretive.","Greg Lovins","Yes, Chris. This is Greg. So the modest negative in 2020, as you said, includes some of our integration project management costs of that integration, as well as some interest costs related to the funding of that acquisition, and then of course related to amortization. So I think earlier Mitch was referring to EBITDA margins, being at or, or above, sorry, our company average and similar to our existing RFID business.","Obviously, we haven't closed the deal yet, so we're still working through the exact amortization impacts, but that will have an impact at the EPS perspective. So right now with the integration cost and the incremental interest costs related to expect a modest negative in '20. And then, as Mitch said earlier, a wrestled break even a slightly positive in year two.","Christopher Kapsch","And then, within your LGM segment, you described some of the -- the high growth categories ","as sluggish, I think graphics in particular. Can you just elaborate on what may have changed there? The cadence of that business. I think had been, generally a pretty positive or sustain a decent growth trajectory. So just wondering, if there was an inflection in the quarter or anything specific that's contributing to the weakness in that business. Thanks.","Mitch Butier","Chris, is your question about graphics?","Christopher Kapsch","Yes. Graphics specifically.","Mitch Butier","As a Greg talk through the growth that we saw all 2019 specifically in Q4 there were headwinds from around tough comps and so forth. Aside from that though, graphics within LGM, LGM vast majority of their revenue is tied to consumer non-discretionary, graphics a little bit more cyclical even that it's tied to car wraps and other things that can, when a period of uncertainty deterred for a bit. So, generally as you think across cycles, this one's a little bit more cyclical than the rest of labels and graphics materials. Overall though we saw growth for 2019 and specifically within Q4 as you'll see quarter-to-quarter, there's some choppiness. ","Operator","Our next question is come from the line of George Staphos with BoFA Securities.","George Staphos","Two follow-up questions guys. Thanks for taking them. First of all, Mitch, can you talk a little bit further about, how you view the strategy for IHM, and how it's been evolving. A company, I think has been saying for several years now that it's a core business and you view it as analogous to LGM in terms of what you can do to improve margins. Certainly, some of the questions that we get from investors, clients don't necessarily always see it that way. So how do you see the strategy NIH and evolving and with this restructuring, how do you see the management structure changing or not within -- within IHM? That's question number one.","Question number two, can you just update us on sustainability trends as a regards? Closing the loop on your products from RFID to LGM label material. Thank you. And good luck in the quarter.","Mitch Butier","It's industrial healthcare material standpoint, just broadly. And this is a year adjacency to labels and graphics materials. It's a pressure sensitive material. You leverage our adhesives capabilities both innovation as well as just the capacities that we have, as well as it's the coding capability. So if you were to look into plants that would look similar to the specialty assets that we have within LGM differences. If they're used for functional materials, they're not printed on. So it's the adjacency is very much from a backend perspective. They are separate markets, so we'll continue to have separate leadership, running these businesses as we do today. So that is overall what the linkage is to LGM and the synergy is what we've been talking about over the last couple of years is pretty more linkage, and on that back end manufacturing, R&D and so forth, as well as the support functions integrating that. So that we can have very focused, dedicated, commercial and general management leveraging that core capability across to attack the markets.","And then broadly, those -- these are spaces that have secular tailwind within the market. There's a migration of -- from mechanical fasteners, like nails and screws to tapes and adhesives. And that's something that we see the broad market that we want to continue to invest in. So that's on IHM on sustainability. We've obviously have made tremendous progress in the industry leader on many fronts on this, and we were out early with the drive towards and committing to a set of 20 - 25 goals back in 2015 making great progress on that both on reducing the environmental impact of our operations, as well as the innovative products and solutions. You asked specifically the RFID and LGM. So within RFID, RFID is a great enabler to support our customer sustainability goals, with increased tracking, you can have much greater reduction of waste, whether that be in apparel as well as within food and so forth. So RFID, we see it as a great enabler to reduce waste through the -- through the entire value chain.","And from LGM perspective, here we've been focusing constantly, with long standing tradition. We call it a Think Thin, so reducing the material content of our materials. But on top of that, we've really been focusing on more of our R&D efforts around coming out with innovative products that are focused on recyclability. So enabling more efficient recyclability the end package, which includes CleanFlake, and we're focusing next-gen innovations there.","As well as, using more recycled content in our actual products. We had some launches at label expo that came out with the first ever recycled PE face material, as well as recycled PET products and so forth. So, we're using our innovation prowess to be able to continue to be the innovation leader for the space in meeting our customer's sustainability goals. ","Operator","Mr. Butier, there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to you for any closing remarks.","Mitch Butier","All right, well, thank you everybody for joining us. The fourth quarter kept a very solid year and we're positioned well going in to 2020. Thank you all again for joining us and we look forward to seeing many of you that our Analysts Meeting in May.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this thus does conclude today's conference call.

Today, we'll discuss our preliminary unaudited second quarter 2013 results. Please note that unless otherwise indicated, today's discussion will be focused on our continuing operations. The company's Office and Consumer Products and Designed and Engineered Solutions businesses are classified on our income statement as discontinued operations.","The non-GAAP financial measures that we use are defined, qualified and reconciled with GAAP in schedules A-2 to A-5 of the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release.","We remind you that we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results.

Scarborough","Thanks, Eric, and good day, everyone. I'm happy to report our fourth consecutive quarter of better than 30% growth in earnings per share, reflecting the successful execution of our productivity initiatives.","We delivered sales growth ahead of our expectations, with solid volume increases in both core businesses.","We're on track to deliver our free cash flow target for the year, distributing most of that cash to shareholders.","In the first half, we returned over $200 million to shareholders including the repurchase of approximately 3.5 million shares.","We also raised the dividend by 7%, which we announced shortly after our last earnings conference call.","Both of our core business segments delivered strong results for the quarter. Pressure-sensitive Materials generated solid top line growth, driven by high single-digit organic growth in emerging markets and the successful execution of our innovation strategies. We anticipate beating our target for sales from new products this year, and this is one of the factors driving the strong top line growth in PSM.","As you know, the industry's annual trade event, Labelexpo, takes place in September. I'm looking forward to another standout performance.","Part of our innovation strategy is to continually identify new ways to drive cost up. This type of innovation has 2 key benefits. The first is evident in our bottom line performance. These initiatives, combined with last year's restructuring actions, drove operating margin for the quarter above the high end of our long-term target range.","This capability also enhances our competitiveness in lower margin product categories, enabling us to take share and maintain our high return on capital.","Retail Branding and Information Solutions also delivered outstanding results, with its fourth consecutive quarter of strong sales growth and continued margin expansion.","We are gaining share in this market through growth in most key segments, driven by increased demand from key retailers and brands in both the U.S. and Western Europe.","We're seeing continued momentum in RFID and brand embellishments. And we are delivering particularly strong growth in our still small, but important new markets of Japan, South America and Russia.","We're also seeing good momentum on the operational side. The business is on track to meet its cost reduction and productivity targets for the year, while delivering better quality and improved customer service.","While the business is not yet within the target range for profitability, we're making solid progress against the footprint reduction strategy. And I'm confident in our ability to achieve our operating margin and return objectives over the next couple of years.","The company passed 2 significant milestones in the last 30 days. First, we achieved the savings target from the restructuring actions we initiated last year, delivering $105 million of annualized savings as of the end of June.","And second, we completed the sale of Office and Consumer Products and Designed and Engineered Solutions.","I'd like to take this opportunity to publicly thank the many project teams who worked tirelessly to bring this transaction to a close. As well, I want to thank our now former colleagues at OCP and DES and wish them the very best.","With strong leadership positions in our core businesses, our ability to maintain already high returns in Pressure-sensitive Materials and significantly expand profitability in Retail Branding and Information Solutions, I am confident that we will deliver our financial targets for the year and over the longer term.","Now, I'll turn it over to Mitch.","Mitchell R. Butier","Thanks, Dean. We delivered another solid quarter with 5% organic sales growth and adjusted earnings per share in line with our expectations of $0.71.","This 34% increase in earnings was driven by productivity, as well as continued solid top line growth, particularly in RBIS and emerging markets for Pressure-sensitive Materials.","Adjusted operating margin in the quarter grew 110 basis points to 8% as the benefit of our productivity initiatives and higher volume more than offset higher employee-related expenses and the impact of product mix in Pressure-sensitive Materials.","The productivity improvements were primarily the result of the success of the restructuring program we initiated last year.","As Dean mentioned, we've achieved our target, realizing $105 million of annualized savings through the end of the second quarter.","The net impact of raw material input cost and pricing was again negligible in the quarter.","Free cash flow from continuing operations was roughly $100 million in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date free cash flow to just over $40 million. This was $20 million more than last year due to the improved operating results and the sale of assets, including our corporate headquarters building in Pasadena.","With our strong balance sheet and consistent solid free cash flow, we repurchased an additional 2 million shares for $87 million in the second quarter.","In the first half, we returned a total of $205 million of cash to shareholders through a combination of dividend and the repurchase of 3.5 million shares.","With the completion of the sale of OCP and DES, we expect net proceeds of approximately $400 million, which includes the negative $40 million of free cash flow in discontinued operations in the first half. We intend to use these proceeds to repurchase shares and reduce indebtedness, including an additional pension contribution.","In the meantime, we've reused the proceeds to reduce our commercial paper balance.","Turning to the segments. Pressure-sensitive Material sales were up 4% on an organic basis in the second quarter, primarily reflecting solid growth in emerging markets and moderate growth in mature markets.","Label and Packaging Material sales were up mid-single-digits on an organic basis, while the combined sales for Graphics, Reflective and Performance Tapes increased low-single digits.","On a regional basis, sales for the segment grew low-single digits in North America, were up slightly in Western Europe and grew high-single digits in emerging markets.","PSM's adjusted operating margin improved 130 basis points to 10.7% due to the benefit of productivity initiatives and higher volume, partially offset by the impact of product mix due to a modest decline in the Graphics business and continued penetration of lower margin categories in Labels and Packaging Materials.","Retail Branding and Information Solutions sales grew 8%, reflecting strong demand among North American and European retailers and brands.","RFID revenue grew approximately 30%, contributing roughly 2 points to RBIS' overall growth rate.","Now as you know, RBIS faces tough comps in the second half of this year due to the significant RFID sales in the second half of last year to 1 retailer that had since reduced its program.","RBIS' adjusted operating margin improved 110 basis points to 7.1% as the benefit of productivity initiatives and higher volume more than offset higher employee-related expenses.","Sales in our other specialty converting businesses grew 6%, reflecting solid growth in our medical business, the only component of other specialty converting beginning this year.","The biggest difference between reported and organic sales growth in other specialty converting is due to the exit of a small former OCP product line last year. As you can see, the negative adjusted operating margin in this business was comparable to last year.","Moving on to the outlook. We now expect adjusted 2013 earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.50 to $2.70, and free cash flow from continuing operations of $275 million to $315 million.","Our guidance is based on a number of assumptions including the key factors listed on Slide 8. To highlight a few: Our estimate organic sales growth in 2013 is now 3% to 4%. We've again raised the low end of our sales expectations by 1 point given our performance in the first half.","Obviously, the macro environment remains uncertain, and as you know, the nature of our businesses gives us limited forward visibility.","Interest expense in 2013 is expected to be slightly under $60 million for the whole year versus $73 million last year. Interest expense in the second quarter was lower-than-expected due to a number of factors, including lower interest expense outside of the U.S.","And average fully diluted shares outstanding for 2013 are still assumed to be approximately 100 million.","We expect that the impact of the additional share repurchases from the proceeds of the divestitures will have a modest impact on average shares outstanding for the full year.","In summary, we've had a solid first half in a year in which we expect to deliver adjusted EPS growth of between 28% and 38%.","Our 2 core businesses are market leaders and are well-positioned for profitable growth and increasing returns. And our continued cost and capital discipline enabled us to maintain our financial strength and return cash to shareholders, evidenced by our repurchase of 3.5 million shares in the first half, all of which demonstrate our commitment to delivering on our long-term targets.","Now, we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question, from the line of Scott Gaffner from Barclays Capital.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Good quarter, a little surprised by the growth in PSM, and you made some initial comments on that. Just wanted to follow up a little bit. You mentioned the growth in the emerging product -- emerging markets. Can you talk a little bit about where, which product offerings you're seeing the most growth in emerging markets? Is it around variable information? Is it around the personal care products? Where are you seeing the growth in emerging markets?","Dean A. Scarborough","Pretty much across the board, Scott. We saw excellent growth in South America, as well as the emerging markets of Asia. We -- again, it's really in every product category. So we feel really good about our position in emerging markets, and the team delivered an excellent quarter.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And the margin on the emerging markets, how do those compare to the overall segment average?","Dean A. Scarborough","So it's accretive. They're above the average for the sector.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And you mentioned the -- you had a target for new product introductions this year for PSM. Could you go back and remind us of what the target was and sort of how far above that you actually are this year?","Dean A. Scarborough","Yes, I don't think we gave a specific number. I think in the past, we talked about the vitality index, which is our metric of products that -- our percent of sales that have been introduced -- percent of new products introduced within the last 3 years, and that number has been pretty consistently in the 20% to 25% range. So we're feeling really good about the innovation. We really started down this path in Pressure-sensitive Materials about 3 or 4 years ago, and it's really a cumulative effect. A lot of the products that we launch take time for customers and end-users to adapt to, and so we're really starting to see some acceleration. And it's a good trend.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Kind of sticking with PSM. Looks like a record quarter for that business from a margin perspective. Dean, I think last quarter, you called out some unfavorable mix weighing on the margins on a year-over-year basis for PSM. Did that reverse during the second quarter? And is it time to start thinking about revisiting those targets that you outlined for PSM? At your analyst meeting last year, I think it was 8.5% to 9.5% for 2015.","Dean A. Scarborough","We -- it's actually 9% to 10%. We restated the targets once we changed the way we reported the operating segments. And also, we had the impact there of disc ops. The mix sequentially was pretty much the same as it was in the previous quarters, so we didn't really see a reversal of the mix. I think the team has done a great job of helping us be more competitive, especially in emerging markets. We've done a great job of being more competitive in lower margin product categories, so we're taking some market share there, and the productivity's enabled us to do so. So it's a combination of volume, of the productivity that we deliver in the business, and certainly, the sales growth at 4% really made a big difference. As far as changing the targets, I think we're going to stick with these for a while. We -- those are 2015 targets. It's one quarter where we broke through the average so we'd like to really understand that on a go-forward basis.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, makes sense. And then on RBIS, was there a big difference in terms of sales distribution between the U.S. and Europe? And if you could just touch on whether European retailers are getting maybe a little bit more confident on the outlook?","Dean A. Scarborough","Yes, we had -- actually, the growth in Europe on European-based retailers and brand owners was higher than the U.S. retailers as a percentage. Much of that was due to RFID growth. If you strip out the impact of RFID growth, it was roughly the same. As you know, we have lower relative market share in Europe, and -- so we have been successful in taking market share there, and the RFID programs, again, have really helped us.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of George Staphos, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to come back to the question of margins for both segments. Now if I look at PSM, if I did my math correctly, you had incremental margins of roughly 50%, which is -- I mean, it's not the only time you've ever done something that large, but generally speaking, it's a relatively rare level of incremental profit performance for this segment. Clearly, you had volume growth and you called out, a number of times, productivity. Is there a way to parse that out between the 2 sources? And as Ghansham was mentioning earlier, your mix is lower so it even further sort of supports what a great quarter it was from an incremental margin standpoint. And how sustainable is that incremental margin on a going forward basis?","Mitchell R. Butier","Sure. George, as far as the increase, a significant contributor, the biggest contributor was the productivity in the restructuring year-over-year. And so the incremental margin that you're seeing, you got to layer in the restructuring savings that we have within this business, and we haven't parsed it out business-by-business, but total company saw $20 million year-over-year in the quarter of restructuring savings. And PSM, if you recall, a number of the restructuring actions we took were accretive to both businesses, but particularly to PSM if you think about the integration of Graphics with LPM, the reduction of the research center and so forth. So the reason we're talking about if you combine all the restructuring savings, we're talking about the lower variable margin from product mix. It's basically just to lay out that it's a little bit lower than we've traditionally seen, still profitable. And we say going forward, what kind of variable margins would you expect. They've been a little bit less than we have traditionally talked about within this business, but as Dean said, sequentially from Q1 to Q2, the pressure from product mix has definitely eased a bit. And so a lot of what we're seeing from a negative product mix, if you will, is year-over-year comps, and it is starting to ease a bit.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Mitch, if I'm reading you right though, obviously, you're starting to then lapse some of the restructuring benefits. So whatever your revenue or volume growth might be on a going forward basis, if I'm hearing you correctly, I don't want to put words into your mouth, it would suggest that maybe the incremental margin will probably be at a more normal rate on a going forward basis in these next couple of quarters?","Mitchell R. Butier","Exactly. We pretty much lapped all of the productivity restructuring savings year-over-year as of now. A little bit more in Q3, but then we fully lap it.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Two related questions and I'll turn it over. RBIS, again, you're pleased with progress, and certainly, it's nice to see the revenue growth and the margin expansion. Having said that, I kind of remember that the incremental margin that you've targeted for this segment is roughly around 40% after the first 2% or so of revenue growth that you have at any quarter. And so if I go through that math, I would have wound up with earnings performance a little bit ahead of what you ultimately reported. So were you pleased with the incremental margin RBIS? Have we correctly remembered what the relationships are generally? And what might have caused some of that decremental margin if we correctly analyze what the traditional relationship is?","Dean A. Scarborough","George, this is Dean. We're very pleased with the progress in RBIS. Contribution margins are actually up a bit year-over-year, so very pleased with that. The biggest single impact was last year, in the second quarter, you recall, we had a tough first half in RBIS, so we eliminated almost all the bonus accruals for the first half of the year in the second quarter. This year, the team's on track, so we had a pretty big headwind. So for the team to deliver 100 basis point improvement in margins was, I think, actually pretty impressive. So I think this baseline is actually a better baseline, and the incremental margins that you're talking about are definitely doable on a go-forward basis.","Mitchell R. Butier","The math doesn't change at all. In the second half, we still have a headwind year-over-year for the same reason Dean just laid out, a little bit less than Q2.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And that makes sense. My last question, I'll turn it over, and I appreciate your patience. If I look at the uptick in your organic revenue growth rate very mechanically, it's 50 basis points versus your prior guidance. Yet the EPS guidance, and certainly, again, it's great that it's moving up, not lower, going -- only goes up about $0.02. So when you do some rough math around that, the incremental margin off of that increase in revenue is only about 10%, even though both your segments seem to be doing better than that. So help us understand if there's any elements of -- caution is not the right term, but anything that you want to keep as -- remind us about in terms of gauging how EPS can move relative to your revenue growth, that would be appreciated.","Mitchell R. Butier","Sure, George. So the -- you're absolutely right, sales moved up more than what you'd expect. It was a pure variable falling flow through to the bottom line, and that's essentially due to the lower variable margin, lower mix within Pressure-sensitive Materials is the overall reason for that.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Actually, George just asked my question, but if I can ask it in another way. You increased your top line growth by 1% and yet, you lowered the high end of the range. So I was wondering, in addition to your answer to George, if there was any other reason why the impact is kind of downward on the EPS while it was upward on the top line growth.","Dean A. Scarborough","Yes, Rosemarie, we raised the midpoint of our guidance. I think we feel good about our progress, and we do think -- growth, certainly in the first half, was better than we expected in the beginning of the year when we first gave our annual guidance. I think we're just being prudent. There's still quite a bit of, I think, of uncertainty out there especially some markets like Western Europe. So we're being -- we're focused on executing against our plan and hitting our numbers like we did in the second quarter. And so we just don't -- we don't want to get out ahead of ourselves.","Mitchell R. Butier","And we're basically translating what we saw in the second quarter, whereas, as Dean mentioned, we hit our expectations for earnings, but we were slightly ahead of our expectations on sales. So it's basically just a continuation of the current mix that we're seeing.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay. And then you talked about the retailers doing quite well. Do you have a feel or is it too early to see what is happening with the back-to-school activity so to speak? I just got a call saying that everything is in the store. Is it too early to see what is happening in terms of the sale of those particular items?","Dean A. Scarborough","I think it is too early. Seems in the U.S., the apparel market's actually doing okay. You can see it in both the import trends and some of the same-store sales figures. I think Europe is less robust. I think the point that we're making is that we're doing very well in this environment. And we believe that we are taking market share, we're capturing a good number of the new RFID programs. Our external embellishment products are also growing, I think, in excess of 30%, so we have some new innovations out there that we're offering to the apparel market. So I think we're definitely growing faster than the market.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","And if I may ask one last quick question, what did you see in terms of your medical, whatever you call it, medical films outlook? Is that something that will remain? Do you have high growth expectations? Could you give us a feel for what license is still on the books?","Dean A. Scarborough","So we have a number of -- well, first of all, we believe this is our -- this is our carve [ph] out from our Tapes business. We did in the medical tapes and wound care business for a number of years. We've invested some money in it. We have quite a few new products that are launching mainly in the second half of the year. So we do expect higher growth rates. In fact, we did achieve our first shipment of our medical sensor, our brand-new medical sensor product in June. It was pretty small, but we do expect revenues to accelerate and the EBIT loss to decline over the next couple of quarters.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citigroup.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In PSM, you have a major competitor that's recently discussed plans to reduce label stock capacity in Europe and a few other lower growth markets. And I'm just wondering, when you look at your footprint, following your restructuring efforts, are you comfortable with it? Are there regions where you might have further opportunities to rationalize capacity? Or generally, how do you think about the right footprint to get you to your long-term growth and margin targets in the segment?","Dean A. Scarborough","We have a very consistent philosophy about driving productivity in all of our businesses using Lean Six Sigma principles. So it's something that we look at on a continuous basis. And what we find is the best way to crystallize a lot of the productivity we get at individual plants is actually consolidating operations, closing down facilities, et cetera, et cetera. So we've just been through a major set of restructuring actions that -- we've completed most of those. So far, at least in Pressure-sensitive Materials, RBIS is going to be a continuing story. But we're -- as we start to build our plans for 2014, it's always a subject that we're reviewing in terms of our planning process. So I never ever say that we're done because our teams are incredibly creative in finding new ways to drive productivity in the business.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up on the specialty converting business. Would you expect -- as a follow-up to Rosemarie's question, would you expect that business to basically be breakeven in 2014 or breakeven as we exit the year? Or how should we think about getting to 5% margins in 2015, which I think was the guidance?","Mitchell R. Butier","Our target is to get to 5% by 2015, and we don't provide segment guidance especially on a kind of quarterly basis.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a quick question. Mitch, with regard to your pension, I know your plans, right now, are to make a pretty significant contribution to pension given some of the proceeds from the office sale. With rates having moved where they are, it's looking like your fund status is probably somewhere in the mid to upper 80% range. So any thoughts in terms of maybe dialing back how much gets contributed and maybe increasing the share repurchases or the dividends maybe sooner than you expected?","Mitchell R. Butier","Sure. So we've -- part of our deleveraging is going to be the pension. And when we've evaluated the whole time what the size of that pension contribution ought to be, the excess comp pension contribution, and we've never commented specifically on the amount, it's been around, thinking over the long horizon, when discount rates and so forth moves back more to what I will call a normal -- what would be the excess contribution that would still be worthwhile in that environment. So we are not, we've always said, planning to fully fund or even come close to fully fund with this pension contribution. But it is a pretty, relatively high level cost of debt that we have that we can top up. So not commenting right now. Once we make the extra pension contribution, we'll communicate that. But that is going to be one of the sources of deleveraging, the primary resource.","Operator","Mr. Scarborough, there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back to you. You may resume with your presentation or closing remarks.","Dean A. Scarborough","Thanks, Brenda. I am pleased with the excellent progress we've made so far this year. Business conditions remain challenging, of course, but I'm confident in both our commercial and operational strategies, as well as the ability of our teams to execute those strategies. With our strong leadership positions and competitive advantages in large growing markets, I'm likewise confident in our ability to deliver on our long-term targets of solid top line growth, double-digit EPS growth and superior capital efficiency. Thanks for joining us today, and we'll speak with you all in October.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today.

The non-GAAP financial measures that we use are defined, qualified and reconciled with GAAP on schedules A4 to A7 of the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release.","We remind you that we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. These forward-looking statements are made subject to the Safe Harbor statement included in today's earnings release.","On the call today are Mitch Butier, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Greg Lovins, Vice President and Interim Chief Financial Officer.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to you, Mitch.","Mitchell Butier","Thanks, Garrett. And good day, everyone. We\u2019re off to a great start to the year, with another quarter of excellent progress against the long-term strategic and financial objectives for all three of our operating segments.","Adjusted EPS was up 18% for the quarter, driven by solid sales growth, margin expansion and a lower tax rate. We raised our earnings guidance for the year and expect to deliver our sixth consecutive year of a double-digit increase in EPS and solid organic sales growth.","Our consistently-strong financial performance speaks to the strategic foundations we\u2019ve played and the depth of talent within each of our three operating segments.","Since we had the opportunity to speak at length about our strategies and key initiatives within each of our segments during the analyst meeting last month, I\u2019ll just quickly touch on first quarter results for each.","The Label and Graphic Materials segment delivered another excellent quarter, sustaining strong margins on 5% organic growth. As you know, this group is both our largest and highest return business.","Over the past four years, the business has consistently generated organic growth within our target range of 4% to 5%. We maintained that healthy pace in the first quarter, driven by continued strong demand and share gain in Western Europe and the emerging markets.","Now, in North America, following a relatively strong fourth quarter last year, volume growth was modest during Q1. Although market data isn\u2019t available yet, we do believe that market demand moderated somewhat in the US relative to the back half of last year.","Globally, the high-value product categories, which include graphics as well as specialty labels, grew at a mid-single digit rate on an organic basis as continued strong growth in specialty was offset by slower growth of graphic materials, particularly in North America.","As I mentioned, the operating margin for the segment remained strong and I am pleased with the team\u2019s focus on consistently delivering solid growth and continued productivity improvement in this high return business.","Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. The team continues to execute extremely well on the business model transformation, enabling market share gains, while driving significant margin expansion.","The base business delivered roughly 2% organic growth for the quarter, a meaningful improvement compared to last year, reflecting low single-digit volume growth and a moderation of the impact from the strategic pricing adjustments initiated late in 2015.","The high-value product categories within RBIS \u2013 radiofrequency identification and external embellishment \u2013 continued to deliver as well. As expected, growth of radiofrequency identification products slowed to a mid-single digit pace, reflecting the difficult comparison to prior year when adoption by a large retailer drove growth of more than 70% for the quarter.","We continue to target better than 20% compounded annual growth for these high-value products over the long-term. But as we\u2019ve said, the growth rate will be choppy based on the timing of new program adoptions and expansions by retailer and brand owners in RFID.","And finally, our new Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment came in a little better than our expectations for the quarter. Organic sales growth for the industrial categories continued at a strong pace, largely upsetting the anticipated sales decline in the healthcare categories. We expect this segment to return to a solid growth trajectory by the middle of the year when the bulk of the headwinds in healthcare are behind us.","Now, since we recently created this segment, let me remind you of our strategic intent here. We\u2019ve aligned a number of smaller businesses that share common end markets and favorable secular growth trends, as well as the ability to leverage our key competencies in material science and process technology. This has been, and will continue to be, an area of focus for investment, as evidenced by our recently announced acquisition of Yongle Tape that we described in detail during our analyst meeting last month.","Now, coming back to the total company view, we have raised the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance for the year by $0.18, reflecting an improved outlook for our operational performance and lower expected full year tax rate.","We are confident in our ability to consistently deliver exceptional value over the long run based on the execution of our four key strategies. First, we\u2019ll drive outsized growth in high-value product categories that will improve our portfolio mix and bolster our position in this market.","Second, we will grow profitably in our base businesses, by remaining highly disciplined with respect to pricing, reducing complexity and tailoring our go-to-market strategy.","Third, we\u2019ll continue to relentlessly pursue productivity improvement to expand operating margin, while improving our competitiveness and less differentiated product categories. And, of course, we will continue our disciplined approach to capital management, both with respect to how we allocate capital for growth, productivity and acquisitions, as well how we distribute cash to shareholders.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg. As we announced last month, Greg is serving as interim CFO. Many of you met him when he was in charge of finance for our largest business, the Label and Graphic Materials group. More recently, he served as corporate treasurer.","Greg has extensive knowledge of all of our businesses developed during his more than 20 years with the company. And we have benefited from his strong business acumen over the years. I know you'll enjoy getting to know him better and benefiting from his insights.","Greg?","Gregory Lovins ","Thanks, Mitch. Appreciate that. And hello, everybody. As Mitch mentioned, we\u2019re off to a good start to the year. We grew sales by 7% excluding currency and 4% on an organic basis. And we delivered an 18% increase in adjusted earnings per share, driven by strong operating performance and a lower tax rate.","Currency translation reduced reported sales by about 1% in the first quarter, with an approximately $0.03 negative impact to EPS.","Our adjusted operating margin in the first quarter improved 40 basis points to 10.1%. This was driven primarily by the margin expansion in RBIS. Productivity continues to be a key driver of the year-on-year margin improvement, including about $11 million of incremental savings from restructuring actions net of transition costs.","Our adjusted tax rate was 30% in the quarter, reflecting our revised outlook for the full year rate, which is lower than prior year, due largely to geographic and income mix and the adoption of new accounting standards that impact the accounting for taxes on share-based compensation.","We now expect the impact of this accounting change to be approximately $0.14 for the year, roughly $0.07 higher than previously anticipated due to the rise in our share price during the quarter.","Free cash flow was negative $22 million, which is $15 million better than Q1 of last year. Higher net income and improved operating working capital performance was partially offset by higher capital spend to support our growth strategy. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion for the year of approximately 100% of GAAP net income.","We also repurchased approximately 500,000 shares in the quarter at an aggregate cost of $35 million and paid $36 million in dividends. Including dilution, the company\u2019s share count increased by roughly 600,000 shares in the quarter, half of which relates to the tax accounting change. Additionally, you may recall that dilution always has the biggest impact in the first quarter of our year.","Overall, our balance sheet remains strong and we have ample capacity to invest in the business, as well as continue returning cash to shareholders in a disciplined manner.","As you know, in March, we issued \u20ac500 million of 1.25% senior notes, which are due in 2025. We used approximately \u20ac200 million of the proceeds to repay short-term borrowings associated with last year's acquisition of Mactac. The remainder will be used primarily to support further investment in the business, including acquisitions. ","We\u2019re pleased with the results of this first euro offering, which is consistent with our large and growing footprint in Europe and provides us a natural hedge for our balance sheet.","On the acquisition front, we closed the previously announced Hanita Coatings deal in March and the integration of that business is underway. The announced acquisition of Yongle Tape is on track to close in the middle of this year as well.","Both of these acquisitions will accelerate our ability to grow faster in higher-value categories. We expect the impact to 2017 EPS to be immaterial for each of these transactions as we move through their integration phases.","Now, let me turn to the segment results for the quarter. Our Label and Graphic Materials sales were up 9% excluding currency and up approximately 5% on an organic basis. The solid organic growth continues to be led by the emerging markets and Western Europe.","The strength in emerging markets continues to be broad-based, with double-digit demand growth in the quarter. We also had a modest benefit from pre-buy activity in China, ahead of our price increase that took effect in late March.","Within the mature markets, we continued mid-single digit growth in Western Europe and that was partially offset by some softness in North America, as Mitch indicated.","Our high-value categories were up mid-single digits on an organic basis, with low single-digit growth in the combined graphics and reflective businesses, offset by some continued strength in specialty labels.","The slower growth in graphics was due mostly to timing of customer purchases as well as a challenging comparison in North America, where the category grew at a mid-teens rate in Q1 of 2016.","LGM's operating margin of 12.7% was unchanged from last year as the benefit from higher volume and productivity was offset by unfavorable product mix and higher employee-related costs.","The year-over-year impact of price and raw material costs was negligible in the quarter, but we did see some modest sequential raw material inflation and we expect that trend to continue into the second quarter.","As I mentioned, we have raised prices in China. And if current inflationary pressures in other markets persist, we will look to raise prices again where appropriate.","Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions, RBIS continues to show good progress from our business transformation, with organic growth of 3% despite a lower contribution from RFID than we have seen in recent quarters. And we had continued meaningful improvement in our operating margin.","In the base apparel categories, we continue to see volume growth outpace apparel unit imports in what remains a challenging environment. In addition, the impact of strategic price reductions to improve our competitiveness moderated in the first quarter.","As Mitch mentioned, the RFID was up mid-single digits for the quarter, in line with our expectations. We continue to expect this business to deliver 20%-plus growth per year, with volatility in the growth rate from period to period.","RBIS\u2019 operating margin improvement reflected the benefits of productivity initiatives and higher volumes, which are partially offset by higher employee-related costs.","As the team continues to execute its business transformation, we anticipate continued margin expansion over the balance of the year.","In our Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment, our sales also came in better than anticipated, with growth of 4% excluding currency and an organic decline of approximately 1%. Mid-single digit organic growth in industrial categories largely offset the expected decline in healthcare.","Operating margin declined in this segment overall due to the sales decline in healthcare categories as well.","Let me now turn to our outlook for the balance of the year. We have raised the midpoint of guidance for adjusted earnings per share by $0.18 to an updated range of $4.50 to $4.65. Roughly $0.07 of this increase reflects the stronger operating outlook and another $0.07 comes from the higher-than-expected impact from the tax accounting change. The remainder reflects the reduced headwind from currency translation, which is partially offset by modestly higher share count.","We now also expect the impact of restructuring charges and other one-time items to be approximately $0.30 for the full year, a $0.10 increase versus our previous assumption. This reflects the shift in timing of certain charges associated with our restructuring actions and the inclusion of transaction costs from the Yongle Tape acquisition, which was not previously in our guidance.","We outline some of the key contributing factors to our EPS guidance on slide nine of the supplemental materials. I\u2019ll focus on the factors that have changed from our previous outlook. We now expect organic sales growth of 3.5% to 4.5% for the full year, reflecting our solid results in the first quarter.","At recent foreign exchange rates, we estimate that currency translation will reduce net sales by approximately 1% and reduce pretax earnings by roughly $10 million. ","As discussed, we\u2019re also expecting interest rate of approximately 30% for the full year. And we expect average shares outstanding, assuming dilution, of 89 million to 89.5 million shares.","Our other key assumptions essentially remain unchanged from what we shared last quarter.","So, overall, to wrap up, we\u2019re very pleased with the start to the year and our continued progress against our long-term strategic and financial objectives.","So, thank you and now we\u2019ll open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Robert W. Baird & Company. Please proceed.","Ghansham Panjabi","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Mitchell Butier","Hello, Ghansham.","Ghansham Panjabi","Hey, everyone. So, first off, on RBIS, the 2.9% core sales growth, was that consistent with what you thought going into the quarter? I know you had very tough comparisons from a year ago.","And also, with all the retail store closures that seem to be accelerating, do you foresee any sort of disruption in demand as inventory levels get adjusted in the supply chain?","Mitchell Butier","Yeah. As far as our expectations, we did expect a moderation within RFID specifically within the quarter, not obviously for the year over the long-term because of the tough comp that you commented on.","And we did talk about last quarter that we\u2019re starting to cycle through the strategic pricing adjustments we started making in late 2015. So, we did expect that \u2013 we\u2019ve been talking through. We\u2019ve been seeing volume gains within the base business, so excluding RFID and external embellishments. And we expect as the strategic pricing adjustments cycle through, we\u2019ll start to see the growth on the sales line as well from the base business. So, little bit better than we expected. Overall, strong performance.","As far as what's going on within the market, yeah, there is a significant amount of store closures and focus on inventory reduction as a part of that. For us, that just really reinforces the strategy shift we've had about getting faster, simpler and more competitive, lowering our variable costs, so we can be more competitive in the marketplace; and lowing our fixed cost, so we can expand margins; and focusing on speed and delivery of service to ensure that, as our customers look for faster lead times, we\u2019re able to meet that need.","So, a little better than expected, Ghansham, and I\u2019d say, overall, the trends that we\u2019re seeing definitely aren't great overall from the market, but we think reinforces our strategic strength within the market.","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then in terms of RFID, you had a press release out in early April regarding a partnership with Target. Can you define for us what that actually means for Avery? Does Target, in that case, actually specify Avery RFID labels across their supplier base? I\u2019m just trying to think of the mechanics of that partnership.","Mitchell Butier","Sure. So, don't like to talk too much about specific customers here, but we have a very strong partnership with Target and this is not a new partnership. So, we just announced publicly this last quarter. It\u2019s not a new partnership. We are their primary partner in rolling out of RFID as they roll it across their stores.","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay. And just one final one sort of on the LGM side. Can you just give us more color on the cost inflation trendline, which raw material prices in particular have an upwards bias to them and why with that backdrop would you not want to be more proactive on price increases because it seems like the trendline is higher? Thanks so much.","Mitchell Butier","Yeah. Thanks, Ghansham. Overall, we did see some modest cost inflation in the first quarter and we are seeing some sequential modest further inflation in the second quarter, but largely coming from acrylics and propylene at this point. There are some indications that this could be temporary. So, we\u2019re evaluating that and staying on top of that with our procurement folks as well.","Overall, we continue to be focused on material reengineering as well to drive productivity on our raw material costs when we see these kind of slight inflation upticks. We did increase prices in China, as we talked about. And if inflationary pressures persist, we will look to continue increasing prices in other regions as well as we go through the quarter.","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay, thanks so much. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays Capital. Please proceed.","Scott Gaffner","Thanks. Good morning.","Mitchell Butier","Hello, Scott.","Scott Gaffner","Mitch, when I look at the adjustment to the full-year organic sales growth target of 3.5% to 4.5% from 3% to 4.5% before, you said it was from the solid 1Q. But can you parse that out a little bit more? Is it more within retail branding or more within label and packaging materials? Where do you expect a little bit of an uptick there for the full year guidance?","Mitchell Butier","Yes. I think it's just the strength we saw in Q1 and going into Q2 from what we\u2019re seeing. So, that's really what causes to raise the low-end of our guidance on the top line.","You recall, when we set guidance and talked about it, particularly back in January, while we gave a range both for growth as well as for earnings per share, we said our target and our objective is to be in the upper end of that range. And so, we hit or exceeded our expectations in each of the groups and the company overall, top and bottom line. And so, you should expect the bottom to drift up through time, assuming we keep hitting our expectations.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. So, that sounds a little bit more broad-based higher-than-expected rather than\u2026","Mitchell Butier","Absolutely. I\u2019d say if you wanted to parse it out even further versus expectations, Europe and emerging markets came in a little better than we expected. North America was softer than we expected three months ago, specifically within the quarter.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. And then, just on that \u2013 on the EM better, obviously, you had the pre-buy in China, can you kind of help us size that a little bit? How should we expect that to flow through in the 2Q?","Mitchell Butier","Yeah. Overall, in China, we had a good quarter with growth in the mid-teens. Even with the pre-buy, I think we're in the low double digit range. We would expect potentially between the pre-buy and a little bit of the timing impact of Easter in the other regions, which was in March prior year and April of this year, maybe roughly $0.02 falling between the quarters as a result of those pre-buys.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. And last one, Greg, for me. I heard you mention something about higher share-based compensation. Is that included in your adjusted EPS number? And can you just re-highlight that again, so we can track that?","Gregory Lovins","Yeah. So, it\u2019s not actually higher share-based compensation. It\u2019s the tax impact on share-based compensation. So, that was the change in the quarter. So that\u2019s related to an accounting standard change. So, we have removed the impact of taxes on share-based compensation from an equity to the income statement. So, that was really what the challenge was. It\u2019s not necessarily an increase in share-based compensation overall. ","Scott Gaffner","Okay. All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","George Staphos","Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. Maybe segueing off of Scott's question, so I missed the number. I think you said \u2013 guidance is up $0.18 to the midpoint. I think you said $0.07 was from operations. $0.07 was from the tax rate. And the residual was from which sources, guys?","Gregory Lovins","Yeah. Really, the impact of a smaller headwind on currency, given where we are right now versus where we were at the beginning of the year, net of a little bit of a headwind on the share count.","George Staphos","Okay. And then, on the tax rate and the fact that you're dropping another $0.07 to the bottom line from the accounting adjustment, does that mean also more cash flow for you from that or is it more or less a non-cash, at least initially, effect from the lower tax rate in terms of what hits the bottom line?","Gregory Lovins","In terms of the cash tax, not a major change from where we\u2019ve been historically at this point. That accounting change also did have a small impact on our cash flow as well, but overall not a big change from a cash tax rate.","George Staphos","Okay. Thanks for that. In terms of North America and the somewhat-softer LGM volumes, can you put a little bit more detail in terms of what was driving that? Recognizing you have very, very short lead times, have trends improved into April, so that we shouldn\u2019t worry as much about that, Greg?","And then, there was some color on specialty and graphics and the interplay of volumes in the quarter, if you could review that again, that\u2019d be great.","And thanks. That\u2019s it for me for the first round.","Gregory Lovins","Yeah. I think on graphics in particular, we did have a little bit of low-single-digit growth in North America in the quarter. And that was coming off of Q1 of last year where we grew, I think, in the mid to high teens in the graphics business. If you look at kind of a couple of year comp there, we\u2019re still up in the mid-teens from where we were a couple of years ago in Q1. So, still feel good about our overall trajectory in graphics. Just a little bit of a blip in this quarter with the high growth we had a year ago.","Overall, as Mitch I think mentioned in his comments, other volumes in North America were up slightly year-over-year, particularly in our base business, then offsetting part of that kind of slower growth rate in graphics.","George Staphos","But any view in terms of why this slowdown or was it just purely comparison? It\u2019s just like it wasn\u2019t graphics.","Mitchell Butier","It was relatively broad-based and there\u2019s no particular one or two insights we\u2019d have. I\u2019d say it\u2019s variable information labels, barcode labels trended better than the rest, which we think is linked to just the increased growth of e-commerce.","George Staphos","Right.","Mitchell Butier","Other than that, relatively broad based.","George Staphos","Okay. Thank you, guys. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citigroup Global markets. Please proceed with your question.","Anthony Pettinari","Hey, good morning. You indicated that IHM margins kind of declined as expected. I'm just wondering if you can give a sense of what those run rate margins might be in the second half of the year as you lap some of the headwinds that you called out in IHM.","Mitchell Butier","Yeah. Our overall long-term guidance for this business is to be 12.5% to 13.5% plus. So, we don\u2019t give individual guidance within quarters and so forth. So, we would expect the business organically to show the expansion as we\u2019ve talked through. One thing that does \u2013 you need to factor in that isn't specifically in our guidance is Yongle, the acquisition closes, which we expect sometime middle of the year. There will be an impact on what we actually report. But the base business that we have, you should expect some modest expansion as we go through the year.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just piggybacking on Scott's question, the $0.07 of the guidance raise came from better ops. When we think about the better ops, is there anything more than just the revision to organic growth? Are you running better or is there specific categories that are doing better than others? Just any kind of color you could give there?","Gregory Lovins","It\u2019s broadly the volume flow-through from what we\u2019ve changed on the top line by and large. Obviously, individual divisions, there's different things going on. But that's one \u2013 I\u2019d say overall what\u2019s happening.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Zekauskas from JPMorgan Securities. Please proceed.","Jeffrey Zekauskas","Thanks very much. In the quarter, was RBIS flat, exclusive of the growth in RFID, or flat to down?","Mitchell Butier","No. Excluding RFID and external embellishments \u2013 external embellishments grew roughly 20% \u2013 excluding both of those, the base business was actually up a couple points, Jeff.","Jeffrey Zekauskas","Okay. And how do RBIS orders look for the second quarter year-over-year?","Mitchell Butier","Overall, the orders are consistent with what we\u2019d expect to see. They\u2019re relatively healthy. However, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, the key thing for this business as we go through the peak season is really what happens in the month of May. You can sometimes see surges. And then, if the peak, if you will, drops off a week early or extends a week late, is really what determines what will happen for the second quarter.","Jeffrey Zekauskas","Okay. So, it sounds like April orders, though, are up year-over-year. Is that right?","Mitchell Butier","Yes. And a big driver of that being RFID because we\u2019re passing the tough comps and we\u2019ve got some pipelines still going on.","Jeffrey Zekauskas","I meant exclusive of RFID.","Mitchell Butier","The second is excluding RFID? Then, yes, it\u2019s coming at a healthy clip, relatively consistent with what we saw in the first quarter.","Jeffrey Zekauskas","Okay, great. And then, the thing about Avery's financials is that your SG&A expense in the first quarter tends to be relatively high versus what you might report in the second and third quarters. Why is that? If you look at last year \u2013 I\u2019m sorry.","Gregory Lovins","Yeah. Jeff, so I ought to take this one. ","Jeffrey Zekauskas","Sure.","Gregory Lovins","We issue equity-based compensation within the first quarter. And people who are retirement-eligible, that tends to have a disproportional hit at the point of grant on the P&L, not only necessarily vesting. So, that\u2019s one of the reasons that it hits in Q1 a little bit more than elsewhere.","Jeffrey Zekauskas","Okay. And then finally, do you expect your gap between price and raw materials to widen in the second quarter or contract or stay the same?","Gregory Lovins","Yeah. I think the gap is negligible in the first quarter. As I said, we do expect some modest inflationary pressure sequentially into Q2. So, you might have a slightly bigger gap, but still relatively modest overall. And we\u2019d expect it to narrow again in the second half.","Jeffrey Zekauskas","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Gregory Lovins","Thank you, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Continuing on, our next question comes from Christopher Kapsch from Aegis Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Kapsch","Yeah. I had a follow-up on the discussion around raw material cost inflation. Generally, when you think about paper being the biggest and then some of these petrochemical, acrylic monomer, propylene, propylene derivatives, generally, these are global fungible commodities. So, I\u2019m just curious about the price increase in China. What is it about that regional business in LGM that necessitates a price increase whereas you're not seeing the impetus in Western regions, like Europe and North America? If you could speak to that, does it have to do with the competitive dynamics that you're seeing in Europe and North America or what's unique about China that you're needing to execute on a price increase currently?","Gregory Lovins","Yeah. I think we started to see some increases in China, in particular, a little bit earlier in acrylics, in particular, I think, earlier this year that let us to do the price increasing action in March. We are starting to see the pressures in the back half of Q1 and into Q2, increased a little bit, as I said, in some of the other regions, and that's where we\u2019re evaluating other actions. But, again, also looking at how we look at productivity in material reengineering to help abate that as well.","But, overall, we\u2019re seeing a little bit, again, modest increases across the regions, a little bit earlier in China, which is why we took the action there. And we\u2019re evaluating actions in other areas.","But we do see some signs that this inflation could be a bit transitory across the year. so, we\u2019re making sure we\u2019re staying on top of that and we\u2019ll increase prices as appropriate and where it\u2019s necessary.","Mitchell Butier","And just to build on that, so why is China different? It was a couple of factors. You have \u2013 while they\u2019re global commodities, you have still local capacity and there was some capacity constraints upstream within our markets within China that drove some of that. ","And also, as we\u2019ve talked about before, while these are global markets, you have currency adjustments as well. Obviously, it can influence the actual local inflation. And the Chinese currency has devalued relative to the US dollar, and so that, obviously, would create a little bit more inflationary pressure as well.","I think the key thing here is, we\u2019re seeing some pressure. We expect it to abate. But if it does not, we will be looking at price increases. But our overall focus here is to continue to use our productivity initiatives and material reengineering that Greg spoke about earlier, to continue to find new ways to reduce the cost, so that we can offset any inflation. And to the extent we can't, we\u2019ll then be looking at pricing beyond that.","Christopher Kapsch","Okay, that's helpful. And then, I had a follow-up just on your revised organic growth forecasts. And I realize, under the new segment reporting, there could be some comparing apples and oranges. But focusing on the Label and Graphic Materials business, I think you had an organic plus 5 in the quarter, and again maybe not apples to oranges, but I think the first quarter was the easiest comp, notwithstanding your earlier comments about graphics in North America having a tough comp. So, I think, overall, that the first quarter was an easier or is the easiest comp perhaps of the year. So, just curious about your confidence in the revised organic growth for the full year with what could be viewed as much tougher comps coming in the second half for that business. Thanks.","Gregory Lovins","Well, this being our largest business, the whole range of our guidance that we have, 3.5% to 4.5%, we came in at 5%. You\u2019re asking specifically about LGM. So, at the low end, you\u2019d have to have a moderation for the rest of the year. And at the high-end, you would basically have a consistency with what we saw on Q1.","Christopher Kapsch","Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli from Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Mitch, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the industrial side of your business. Once you exclude healthcare, what type of growth \u2013 and I apologize if you gave it and I missed it \u2013 and are there any particular segments of market that are doing better or worse than others?","Mitchell Butier","Yeah. So, overall, so we\u2019ve had strong growth within the industrial businesses. And the particular segments, US \u2013 both US and Europe, but in the US, building and construction is the biggest area that\u2019s driving growth right now. And modest growth within the automotive space and very strong growth within building and construction.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Are you seeing a decline or anticipating a decline in the other category?","Mitchell Butier","Well, if you\u2019re talking about broadly what\u2019s going on within the market, as far as our perspective, the market may go through may go through a bit of a slowdown or could continue along the pace that it\u2019s been seeing. We have significant share gain opportunity within our business, though, and that's what we\u2019re focused on. And with the acquisition of Yongle Tape, that gives us access to OEMs that we think we can leverage across the product portfolio and really go after new opportunities.","And remember, within automotive, there is a general secular trend towards light-weighting and so forth and a conversion from mechanical fasteners to tapes and adhesives. And so, even if there's a shift on the general automotive build trend, we think that the market overall has good secular tailwinds and we will have share gain opportunity as well.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Thanks. That is very helpful. And then I was wondering if you could give us a little more on the healthcare side.","Mitchell Butier","Sure. The healthcare, there is two aspects to that, if you recall. One, Vancive basically comped through some declines in the middle of last year, so we\u2019ve cycle through that in the middle of this year and we should return to growth in that business.","And then the other aspect was, there is the program loss because of the technology chain within the healthcare side of our tapes business. That basically has been declining and will cycle through by Q3 of this year as well.","Rosemarie Morbelli","So, what do you think \u2013 I understand you are going to anniversary the declines. But what is going to generate growth for that particular business as well as the margins. Are you coming out with new product lines? Are you counting on acquisitions? Can you help me understand?","Mitchell Butier","Absolutely. Yeah, if you recall, one of the changes we made as we reconnected the business with tape, specifically to leverage some of the synergies that we have within tapes for development of new products and so forth, and so we\u2019ve got a number of new products from antimicrobial wound care packages, IV bandages and so forth, and have a number of partnerships with key end users that we see a lot of opportunity for growth and margin expansion. And the margin expansion is going to be around both driving growth, but getting much more focused and disciplined in having a much more cost-effective service delivery model.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Thank you.","Mitchell Butier","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is a follow-up from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","George Staphos","Hi. Thank you, guys. Two questions on RBIS for me to finish up. In terms of employee costs, I think there was a mention of that, Mitch, in your remarks at the beginning. Should we be expecting some deceleration in the year-on-year growth in employee cost, 2Q, 3Q, et cetera? Or is whatever the run rate was in 1Q likely to continue over the balance of the year? And if you had that handy or if it was available, what was that trajectory on employee cost? So, that's broadly question number one.","And number two, on RBIS, I just want to make sure, now that you're lapping the strategic price adjustments that you had in the business, do you think the price levels are such that you can continue this volume momentum? Or is there any \u2013 I don\u2019t know how to phrase it \u2013 lingering concern that once you lap that, you may start to see some of your share momentum also decelerate? How would you have us consider that?","Thank you, guys. And good luck on the quarter.","Gregory Lovins","Thank you, George. Yeah. So, first, on the employee cost inflation, this business is more employee intensive than our other businesses, and that's why we call it out as far as the wage inflation that we have within the business. You would expect \u2013 I won\u2019t comment specifically about in this year, but over the trend of the transformation that we have that that headwind would moderate a bit.","The key thing we focus on is our general wage inflation \u2013 because we have this in all of our businesses \u2013 getting it to a size where it\u2019s at or less than our general productivity that we have. So, non-restructuring productivity. So, using Lean Sigma and otherwise. And that is our focus and that's something that we've achieved within the quarter and reached. ","And then, as far as our share gain opportunities, you asked about the \u2013 we cycle through the strategic pricing adjustments, but talking about price going forward within this business is tough. It\u2019s a custom business, so you're moving from a 3 x 3 tag to a 3 x 2 tag and going from four color and five color and so forth.","So, what we really focus on are the variable margins within that. And we think that we can continue to maintain the variable margins and continue to drive more competitiveness and gain more share. And the share isn't just about price. A big move here has been our improved service, both preorder and our design capabilities, as well as post-order, so how quick we can deliver the products to our customers. That is a key part of the value proposition that we\u2019ve dramatically improved over the last 18 months.","George Staphos","Mitch, you may have mentioned it before and I forget if you have. Can you put some kind of numbers around how the service levels have improved for you over that interval or whatever you think is a relevant interval?","Mitchell Butier","Sure. So, our flexibility rates, which we measure as what percent of orders that we can deliver on time based on the customer request on our promised date, these were around 60% 18 months ago. They\u2019re north of 90% now and closing in on what the materials businesses have, which are in the high 90s.","George Staphos","Okay. Okay, I remember that now. It\u2019s very impressive. And just on employee costs, is it typical that you have the most pressure early in the year, just broadly. And so, whatever that headwind that you offset with productivity was in 1Q, the nut gets less lodged to step over in the subsequent quarters or is that not sure? Thank you, guys.","Mitchell Butier","Year-over-year, it\u2019s relatively consistent. Sequentially, Q2 is when you have the big headwind because wage increases tend to happen in early April.","George Staphos","Okay. Thank you, guys. ","Mitchell Butier","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, sir, for your question. Mr. Butier, there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to you. Please continue with your presentation or closing remarks.","Mitchell Butier","Great. Thank you. Well, again, we\u2019re pleased with the performance in the first quarter, of consistently strong performance that we've been delivering. It really is a testament to the depth of talent we have in the organization, the resilience of our leadership positions within each of our businesses and the strategic foundations we\u2019ve laid. And I just really want to thank the team for their continued dedication, creativity and focus. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to Cindy Guenther, Avery Dennison\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations and Finance. Please go ahead, madam.","Cynthia Guenther","Thanks Susie. Today, we\u2019ll discuss our preliminary unaudited fourth quarter and full year results. Please note that throughout today\u2019s discussion, we\u2019ll be making references to non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP measures that we use are defined, qualified and reconciled with GAAP on schedules A-4 to A-8 of the financial statements accompanying today\u2019s earnings release and the appendix of our supplemental presentation material.","We remind you that we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. These forward-looking statements are made subject to the Safe Harbor statement included in today\u2019s earnings release.","On the call today are Mitch Butier, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Lovins, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mitch.","Mitch Butier","Thanks, Cindy, and good day, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to report our seventh consecutive year of strong top line growth, margin expansion, and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our Label and Graphics Materials business delivered strong performance in the year of significant raw material inflation, retail branding and information solutions posted both strong top line growth and significant margin expansion and Industrial and Healthcare Materials made solid progress with its margin turnaround in the back half.","2018 marked an important milestone for the company at the final year of measurement for the five year financial targets, we communicated in early 2014. This is the second long-term performance cycle we've completed since first introducing this discipline back in 2012 and I'm pleased to report that we once again achieved our company goals. Importantly, we are also on track to achieve our five-year goals through 2021.","Our consistent performance reflects the resilience of our industry-leading market position. The strategic foundations we've laid and our agile and talented workforce. Our strategic playbook continues to work for us as we focus on four overarching priorities, driving outsized growth and high value product categories, growing profitably in our base businesses, relentlessly pursuing productivity improvement and remaining disciplined in our approach to capital management.","In 2018, we made good progress on all four of the strategic pillars. We delivered organic growth of 5.5% reflecting continued solid growth in our base businesses and continuing above average volume growth from emerging markets and high value categories such as specially labels and RFID.","Emerging markets in high-value categories remain our two key catalysts for GDP plus growth across our entire portfolio. Roughly half of our total sales are linked to one or both of these catalysts.","In 2018, high-value categories continue to grow at a high single-digit pace with RFID now contributing nearly a full point to total company sales growth and emerging market volume once again grew faster than average. Importantly, our end market exposure in emerging regions is quite broad based with relatively even balance among China, South Asia and a combination of Latin America and Eastern Europe.","Equally important to topline results, we also maintain our strong focus on continuous productivity improvement. The combination of product reengineering, restructuring and the deployment of lean operating principles contributed significantly to our results in 2018. This focus remains key to our long-term success, not just as a means to expand margins, but to enhance our competitiveness and to provide a funding source for reinvestment.","Now looking at how these strategies played out in each of our segments. Label and Graphics Materials delivered another year of strong top-line growth, reflecting above-average volume growth in emerging markets in high value categories, as well as pricing.","Specialty labels led the way for LGM high-value categories with organic growth of roughly 10% while Graphics and Reflectives grew at a solid mid-single digit pace. Strength in emerging markets was led by South Asia and Latin America, while China was up mid-single digits. Mature regions delivered solid organic growth in 2018.","Now while organic growth was strong overall for the year, our volume growth did moderate a bit in both Europe and China in the second half. This trend is reflected in our guidance assumptions for LGM for 2019.LGM\u2019s operating margin remained strong in this high return business, a significant result given that raw material inflation came in much higher than we anticipated at the start of the year.","Keeping up with significant and persistent inflation required multiple price increases in every region of the world over the past 18 months as well as of course our continued focus on innovative product reengineering. Overall another strong year for LGM.","Retail Branding and Information Solutions delivered both strong top line growth and significant margin expansion driven by continued execution of our transformation strategy and continued strength in RFID. In the base business, sales increased across all product categories, reflecting broad-based growth and performance athletic, premium and the value channels.","Our ability to grow our base business here in the face of a challenging retail environment underscores the success of our multi-year transformation strategy as our improvements in service, flexibility and speed continue to resonate with our customers. And RFID grew by more than 20% in 2018, topping $300 million for the year. As you know apparel represents the vast majority of our total RFID sales today driving most of the growth last year.","Outside of apparel, we're seeing early stage traction in multiple categories including food, beauty and aviation which collectively contributed 2 points of growth for the year in RFID. Our pipeline continues to expand across all categories, driving our confidence that RFID will continue to deliver 15% to 20% plus growth annually. We continue to increase our level of investment to support this growth as we build our intelligent label's platform, to enable a future where every item can have a digital twin and a digital life.","RBIS is adjusted operating margin expanded another 170 basis points, not only beating the high end of our long-term 2018 target range but also hitting the middle of our 2020 one target range ahead of schedule. The team has done a tremendous job transforming RBIS into a simpler, faster, and more competitive business over the past three years and we're pleased with the momentum that we're seeing here.","Turning to Industrial and Healthcare Materials. As you know it was a challenging year for IHM and results fell short of our goals. That said our top line challenges mostly limited to the business serving the China auto market. Elsewhere, we progressed well. Our industrial businesses in both North America and Europe grew organically at mid-single-digit rate with improved profitability in the second half and our medical business part of the total healthcare category grew high single-digits organically.","We obviously have more work to do to achieve our 2021 targets, we've set for IHM. I remain confident we\u2019ll achieve these goals just as I was with RBIS a few years back. And I've covered the first three of our strategic pillars driving outsized growth in high value products, growing profitably in the base, and relentlessly pursuing productivity gains.","Now, I\u2019ll cover the fourth pillar, highly disciplined capital management. In terms of the investments we\u2019re making for organic growth and productivity, our primary focus has been capacity as an emerging region for LGM, recapitalizing LGM\u2019s European and North American footprint and investing in both capacity and business development globally for RFID.","Carefully planned and executed M&A is another key element of our disciplined capital allocation strategy, though we didn't complete any acquisitions in 2018, our strategy here has not changed.","We look for opportunities to increase our exposure to high value-add segments as well as to expand and leverage our core capabilities. And finally, we continue to be disciplined in our approach to returning cash to shareholders, and as a result significantly accelerate the stock buyback in the fourth quarter.","In addition to the progress made toward our 2021 strategic and financial goals, we are also making solid progress towards our 2025 sustainability goals. Just to hit a few highlights. We've reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by 25% since 2015, roughly 80% of our paper is now Forest Stewardship Council certified, and more than 90% of our operations are now landfill free.","Looking ahead, we are focused on tackling industry wide challenges with a particular focus on packaging recyclability, by leveraging our existing products and capabilities and developing new opportunities through collaboration with our customers and partners.","Summing up, I'm pleased with the progress we've made toward our long-term goals, as we continue to deliver consistent GDP plus organic growth and top core tile returns on capital. For 2019, we will continue to make progress toward these goals with the midpoint point of our adjusted EPS range up 12% before the headwind from currency translation.","Now while we expect the external environment may prove more challenging this year, we are prepared for it commercially, operationally, and financially, and we will seek opportunities to lean forward even if others may pull back.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Greg.","Greg Lovins","Thanks, Mitch and hello everybody. I\u2019ll first provide some additional color on our performance against our long-term goals, and then we walk through fourth quarter performance and our outlook for 2019.","As Mitch said, 2018 was an important milestone for the company as the final year of measurement for the five year financial targets we communicated in early 2014. And as we noted we achieved all of our targets.","If you turn to Slide 7 of the supplemental materials, you'll see our scorecard. Sales grew more than 4% organically and reported operating margin hit 10% or 11% on an adjusted basis. And adjusted EPS grew 18% annually over the past five years and at the same time we expanded return on total capital over this period by 8 full points to 19% in 2018.","And our balance sheet remains strong with our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio on the low end of our targeted range for 2018. In March of 2017, we introduced a new set of long-term targets extending our planning horizon to 2021.","As you can see on slide 8, now two years into this cycle, we are on pace to achieve these goals as well. Given the diversity of our end markets, our strong competitive advantages and our resilience as an organization to adjust course when needed, we're confident in our ability to deliver to a wide range of business cycles.","At the same time that we communicated our financial targets through 2021, we also laid out a five year plan for capital allocation which you can see on slide 9.","We've put a total of $1.7 billion to work over the first two years of this cycle, allocating it very much in line with our long-term plan. This plan reflects our goal to deliver top quartile returns relative to capital market peers, a position we have maintained while increasing our pace of investment for both organic growth and M&A.","And further our current leverage position gives us ample capacity to continue investing in organic growth and acquisitions, while also continuing to return cash to shareholders in a disciplined way and we are clearly in excellent shape to take advantage of any dislocations in the market should they occur over the next few years.","Now let's focus on the fourth quarter. Overall our financial results were solid. Reported earnings per share was $1.11 including a net $0.37 hit from the combined effects of the pension settlement and tax benefits from a discrete tax planning action in TCJA estimate revision.","Adjusted earnings per share was $1.52, a few cents better than our expectations in a 14% compared to prior year driven by both sales growth and margin expansion. We grew sales by 4.8% on an organic basis as currency translation reduced reported sales growth by 2.9 points in the quarter. Currency translation represented a roughly $0.6 headwind to EPS compared to the same period last year which by the way exactly offset the benefit from the lower adjusted tax rate.","Adjusted operating margin increased by 50 basis points to 11.1% as the benefits from higher volume and productivity were partially offset by higher employee related costs. And we realized $5 million of net restructuring savings in the quarter. Gross savings most of which benefited RBIS were partially offset by roughly $4 million of transition costs for LGMs footprint action in Europe. And note that while we will incur an additional $10 million of transition costs in the first half of 2019 for this project with savings ramping up in the second half.","So turning now to cash generation and allocation, excluding the $200 million contribution to the U.S. Pension Plan, free cash flow for the full year was $429 million, up by roughly $8 million compared to the prior year.","As we\u2019ve discussed, we've increased our pace of fixed capital and IT related spending this year with growth capital spending up by about $30 million to support both organic growth and margin expansion. And we continue to return cash to shareholders with a higher dividend in share repurchases. We significantly accelerated the pace of share buyback during the fourth quarter to $218 million.","For the full year, we repurchased roughly 4 million shares at an aggregate cost of $393 million and paid $175 million in dividends. So collectively we returned a total of $568 million to shareholders in 2018, roughly two times the amount we distributed the year before.","So let me now turn to the segment results for the quarter. Label and Graphic Material sales increased by 4.7% on an organic basis driven largely by price. High value categories once again grew faster than the base business. Breaking down LGM\u2019s organic growth in the quarter by region North America was up high single-digits and Western Europe grew at a low single-digit rate.","Growth in emerging markets was mid-single-digits with continued strength in South Asia and Latin America and China grew mid-single-digits including a benefit from the timing of sales due to pre-buy in the prior year. On a normalized basis the trend in China slowed relative to the first half.","Operating margin for the segment was strong, up 40 basis points on an adjusted basis to 12.9% as the benefits of productivity increased volume and the net impact of pricing and raw material costs more than offset to higher employee related expense and transition costs associated with the European restructuring.","Looking sequentially raw material input costs are relatively stable in the fourth quarter, and we realized the benefit from our pricing actions driving much of the anticipated rebound in our margin from the Q3 level. With the benefit of recent pricing actions we expect to substantially covered the effect of the past 18 months of inflation.","Shifting out to Retail Branding and Information Solutions, RBS delivered another quarter of strong top line growth up 6.9% on an organic basis driven by both RFID and the base business. Total RFID sales were up 20% for the quarter. The vast majority of which benefited RBIS, driven largely by European brands and retailers.","Adjusted operating margin for the segment expanded by 10 basis points to 12.2% as the benefits from increased volume in productivity were largely offset by higher employee related costs and growth related investments, which ramped up over the course of the year. And finally turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment, sales grew 0.7% on an organic basis.","As mid-single digit organic growth for industrial categories in North America and Europe as well as for healthcare globally was mostly offset by weakness in industrial products for the China market. Though this category represents only about 10% of IHM\u2019s total sales that is less than 1% of the company's total sales, we experienced a significant decline in these products due to the drop in Chinese auto production.","We made good progress on the margin for an IHM adjusted operating margin increased by 170 basis points to 9.6% driven by productivity improvement. We faced a modest headwind from raw material cost of net of pricing in the quarter, but expect to realize sufficient price increases in 2019 to cover this gap. I spend a lot of time meeting with our teams in IGM over the past six months.","We're sharpening our commercial focusing capabilities, improving our cost position, simplifying our organization structure and further aligning our operations teams with LGM to leverage our strength there. And I remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-term goals of 4% to 5% plus organic growth with the operating margin gradually expanding to LGM\u2019s level or better by 2021.","So turning now to the outlook for 2019. We anticipate adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $6.45 to $6.70. The midpoint of our range reflects organic growth for LGM near the lower end of its long-term target range. While we assume RBS will come in above the high end of its long-term range reflecting continued strength in RFiD. We have outlined some of the key contributing factors to this guidance on slide 15 of our supplemental presentation materials.","We estimate that organic sales growth will be approximately 4%, and currency translation would be at a roughly 2.5% headwind to reported sales growth. With the pretax operating income hit of $25 million and we estimate incremental pre-tax savings from restructuring net of transition costs will contribute about $35 billion due to the timing of these actions and related transition costs roughly 75% of the full year net savings from restructuring will be realized in the back half of the year, and we expect the adjusted tax rate in the mid-20s in line with 2018, and with the large non-cash charge associated with the pension termination we\u2019ll likely see a low single-digit reported effective tax rate.","And we expect interest expense roughly $75 million to $80 million reflecting higher debt at the end of 2018 due to the pension contribution in Q3 and accelerated share buyback in the fourth quarter as well as a higher average interest rate on total debt. And we anticipate spending $275 million to $285 million in fixed capital and IT projects consistent with our five year capital allocation plans, and we estimated average shares outstanding assuming dilution of $84 million $85 million.","As previously discussed, we expect to complete the process of terminating our U.S. pension plan resulting in pre-tax non-cash charge estimated at $490 million during the first quarter with an estimated after tax EPS or roughly $3.55.","And finally given the timing of the impacts from currency translation and restructuring actions our projected earnings growth is significantly weighted to the back half of the year.","In summary, we're pleased with the strategic and financial progress we made against our long term goals in 2018, and we are committed to delivering exceptional value to our strategies for long-term profitable growth and disciplined capital allocation.","Now we\u2019ll open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Ghansham Panjabi","Yes. So, I guess first-off on the core sales growth to 4% for 2019. How does that break out between the segments from a growth standpoint and also how much of that 4% do you expect will come from price, just kind of the flow through from your pricing actions late in 2018?","Greg Lovins","Yes, Ghansham, so this is Greg. For LGM we expect to be as I said close to the low end of our long-term target range in terms of organic growth in 2019. And for RBIS, we\u2019re expecting to be above the high end of our range, really driven by continued strength in RFID.","And our IHM, we're continuing to expect some softness here in the first part of the year, driven by continued softness in China automotive and looking for that to turn around a little bit in the back half as we start to lap some of that and potentially see some impacts on China automotive or some of the actions that they're taking there to improve that market. So, overall LGM coming in around the low end of its range, RBIS a little bit above the high end of its range. And then the pricing contribution.","Mitch Butier","So price, so in LGM we'll see price carryover I think in the 1% to 1.5% range in 2019 and volume growth accordingly after that. So again coming in overall closer to 4% in LGM with price above 1.5% year-over-year mainly driven by the carryover actions that we've implemented.","Greg Lovins","Then I guess just as a follow up question related to the first one, you've been very consistent with the core sales growth over the last seven years as you sort of highlighted in your slide deck. What gives you confidence that you\u2019ll be able to continue that in 2019 given that there are two very large economies in China and certainly the EMEA region that have slowed? Just help us think through that from a high level standpoint. Thanks so much.","Mitch Butier","I guess overall Ghansham, the guidance that we\u2019ve reflected is largely volume and it basically comes from our two covets for consistent GDP plus growth being in high value segments as well as emerging markets and our broad exposure is largely tied to consumables which tend not to move as much even in periods of uncertainty. So that\u2019s what gives us the confidence of what we\u2019re being going to be able to deliver here.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with UBS Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Edlain Rodriguez","A quick one on LGM. I mean for the fourth quarter you\u2019ve noted that the organic growth was mostly from pricing. So was there any volume growth in any of the regions or any of the products or is it purely pricing that you got in 4Q.","Mitch Butier","Yes we did a volume growth in the quarter in LGM in the low single digit range. So I think price was a bit more impact in the quarter than volume, but overall volume growth was in the low single digit range in the quarter overall for LGM.","Edlain Rodriguez","And one or BIS, as you\u2019ve noted like the margins are almost at your target for 2021. So do you see, I mean can you improve from where you are right now or do they stay where they are in terms of those margins?","Mitch Butier","Yes. I think you\u2019ve seen over the past we don\u2019t consider the margin targets that we set as limitations. There are expectations we have and commitments that we make and so we definitely have quickly moved to exceed the 2018 long-term target we establish and are quickly a little bit above the midpoint. So right now our focus is getting to the high-end as the long-term targeted range and then once we get there, we'll look at reassessing our sites from there.","Operator","Our next question coming from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","George Staphos","I wanted to spend the first question on the restructuring benefits and the cadence when we should expect over 2019. So just being simplistic about it guys in the first half of the year we should expect all else equal about $19 million of negative comparisons \u2013 from the transition costs since we're netting to $35 million for the year. Does that mean that we're well over $50 million positive in the second half which then would have a residual until 2020? Am I thinking about that correctly?","Greg Lovins","Yes, I think - so George I think our transition cost in the first half, we're expecting to be around $10 million related to the European restructuring. So that would be the headwind in the first half. And in the second half, we'll see the benefit of that project, as savings start to kick in the second half and that also comes some transition costs we had in the back half of 2018. So the first half we\u2019ll see a headwind and in the second half we'll start to see the benefits from that action. So as about three quarters of the net savings will be in the second half of the year.","George Staphos","The other question I had and then I'll turn over. Can you give us some color - Ric, I know it\u2019s really early in 2019. What kind of volume rates, what kind of exit rates did we see across China both in LGM and IHM in some of the end markets can provide that, that\u2019d be great? Thank you.","Mitch Butier","Yes, so overall as far as the volume trends that we saw within China, within LGM in the second half, we had some lumpiness as Greg\u2019s and we\u2019ve talked about between last quarter and this quarter because of pre-bias around pricing and so forth, but low single digits which is below the long-term trend we have seen and expect to see long term, so low single digits for volume trends in LGM and then within the industrial automotive that was down 20% reflecting the big decline in auto builds that you've seen in China.","Now I remind you that the auto exposure to China is 1% of the total company revenue, but just if you want to focus in on that, that's what we're seeing.","Operator","Our next question coming from the line of John McNulty with BMO. Please proceed with your question.","John McNulty","Thanks for taking my question. It looks like you're making some headway in the IHM segment. I guess now that things have kind of started to write in terms of the ship there. I guess how should we think about the improvement through to your 2021 targets like is this something that we can kind of think of as a linear margin improvement or is it going to be a little bit lumpy or I guess how should we be thinking about that?","Greg Lovins","Yes, I think so from where we finished 2018 to our progress towards 2021. As we said, we're still confident we'll be within our target range in 2021, but we\u2019d expect that progress to be more steady across the next couple of years, so we do see continuing to make progress from 2018 to 2019 targeting somewhere around 10% margin in IHM in 2019 and looking to continue making steady progress from there as we progress towards 2021.","John McNulty","And then just a question on the margins in RBIS, I mean you are at your 2021 target already. I guess if you kind of looking back I guess what got you there faster than you expected was it the mix of RFID or was it higher sales volumes in general or efficiency, I guess? What are kind of the bigger buckets where maybe you\u2019re a little bit surprised in terms of how quickly it happened and I guess, help to put that in perspective as we look forward where there may be future improvement?","Mitch Butier","It's really both, the transformation that we've been driving in the base and RFID. And a few years ago when we embarked on the transformation, we made some pretty significant strategic adjustments to move decisions closer to the market get faster, simpler, more competitive. We've talked about all of that in the past. And we saw a huge opportunity in doing so. And it's just, I'd say, we're meeting -- hitting our aspirations there and exceeding the commitments.","And then RFID, we\u2019ve said we expect to grow 15% to 20% plus and it's been growing 20% or more over the last couple of years and that clearly is having a big overall lift to the overall business. So it's basically both items and for us it's really about how do we continue to raise the bar and continue to execute to find the optimum balance here between top line margins and capital efficiency within the business.","Operator","Our next question coming from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup Global Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Anthony Pettinari","Just looking at your CapEx guidance, you're stepping up again in 2019. I'm just wondering if it's possible to say if there are large projects that are part of that, or regions or categories where you're specifically accelerating investments versus the last couple of years.","Mitch Butier","Sure. The biggest investments coming from the North America expansion that we've talked about previously, that's coming through as well some investments in South Asia in particular that we are making those are some of the bigger items.","Anthony Pettinari","And then maybe just shipping gears to RFID. You talked about the growth opportunities in non-apparel categories. Is it possible to say, you know our margins in the non-apparel categories, would you expect them to be sort of similar, little bit better, maybe a little bit worse than the apparel segment?","Greg Lovins","We'd expect them to be similar and that's what we're experiencing today though it's less than 10% of the total revenue right now. But, yes we would expect them to be similar.","Operator","Our next question coming from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Gaffner","You should be doing great. It\u2019s a strong quarter. Greg, you mentioned in your commentary about, you know through the fourth quarter, you felt like you were back to where you needed to be from a price cost perspective, but can you talk about it, where you have actually positive price cost spread in 2018 and do you think there's any carry over from a price cost spread perspective into 2019?","Mitch Butier","So I think we entered, we ended 2018 a little bit short from a cumulative in terms of covering the inflation we've seen with pricing as well as material reengineering as we've talked in the past. We do expect that with the pricing actions, we took at the tail end of 2019, most of which went into effect in Q4 very early here in 2019, so that will help close the gap that we had cumulatively from the inflation that we've seen over the last 18 months or so.","As we ended Q4, we saw inflation relatively stable for us. And right now, Q4 to Q1 we've continued to see relatively stable raw materials as well so assuming there nothing changes there - we expect to be largely covered by the pricing actions that we've implemented at this point.","Scott Gaffner","And then just focusing on share repurchases for a second. And just when we look at the timing of that, I mean I know you have an intrinsic value model that - but it gives you - buy signal or not? But was there anything else in regards to the return of capital in the fourth quarter? And sort of how should we think about the repurchases going forward? Is there anything built into the $84 million to $85 million share assumption for 2019? Thanks, guys.","Mitch Butier","Yes, I don't think a thing anything out of our normal practice, so you know historically as we've said, we'll look to continue managing share buyback based on our intrinsic value models as well as using a buyback grade and in periods where we may see the stock accelerating, we might decelerate our buybacks a bit, if we see the stock decelerating that may increase a little bit. And I think that's what you saw here happen in 2018. And so nothing unusual in terms of how we approach that in the past and our expectation is we said with the share count range that, I gave in the guidance is what you would expect us to purchase in 2019.","Operator","Our next question coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Zekauskas","In describing the profit - prospects for LGM you said that it would be if the lower end of its longer term range and RBIS would be above its longer term range. Can you discuss the factors behind those two claims? What \u2013what lies LGM below and why is RBIS above for 2019?","Greg Lovins","Yes. I think so for RBIS, I think its extended strength we see in RFID as we continue to target the 15% to 20% or higher growth there in RFID, as well as some of the strength in the base of apparel business that we saw as we coming out of 2018. In LGM as we've talked about we're looking at 1.5 or 1 to 1.5 of price next year for this year in 2019.","And you know it's alluded to a couple of times a little bit of softness we saw in some of the markets in China, Europe, et cetera as we ended 2018, so a little bit more cautious on the volume as we go into 2019, offset by some of the carryover pricing actions as we mentioned here. So overall that's the direction on the 4% growth roughly for LGM in 2019.","Mitch Butier","And the only thing to add Jeff, the expectation outlook for LGM for 2019 is just for 2019 given some of the macro uncertainty we're seeing now. From a long-term perspective we still expect this business to grow between 4% to 5% organically.","Jeff Zekauskas","And from my follow up in your funds flow statement your changes in assets and liabilities and other adjustments was almost negative $400 million and I guess maybe there's $200 million of pension in there, so maybe it nets out negative $190 million or negative $200 million ex-pension. What's the number for next year, you know, that is are you still going to have a large negative value there or is it smaller or positive?","Mitch Butier","Yes, Jeff, so I think that was mainly driven as you said by the pension adjustments as well as some tax items related to the pension adjustments that moved that so much year-over-year. I think if I could step back broadly for 2019, if I think about free cash flow, we'd expect free cash flow to see somewhat of a modest improvement in 2019 versus where we were in 2018.","As we look at continuing to spend a little bit more in capital investments as Mitch mentioned earlier in his comment. We also expect to have some of the cash restructuring charges 00:39:28 European action that we announced a year ago. Much of that cash will hit us in 2019. So, we see some continued improvement on our profit side as we\u2019ve talked about and then we\u2019ll have some higher CapEx and a little bit higher restructuring cost. Overall, expect a modest improvement in free cash flow in 2019.","Operator","Our next question coming from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Adam Josephson","Just Greg or Mitch, just back to, following up on one of Jeff's questions about your volume expectations for China and Europe specifically. Can you just give us some sense of roughly what those expectations are just compared to what kind of volume growth you've seen in China, in Europe in the years past, just again given everyone's concerns about weakness in China, in Europe?","Mitch Butier","So overall versus what we've seen in years past, we\u2019ll talk about them separately. China, we talked about that growing mid to upper single digit growth trends, up until a couple of years ago and it's been a mid-single digit growth, kind of market since then. And then we saw in the second half, it start to, it declined to low single digit levels reflecting all that we're seeing going on within China.","We expect the long term 00:40:56 return to a mid-single digit growth market overall. So, we're seeing that in the second half of 2018. So, I would expect that to kind of continue at least as we comp the tougher comps in Q1 in the first half. But obviously, we have limited forward visibility. So that's kind of what we're seeing and what we're thinking.","China Automotive, very small part of the business, it was down pretty significant, will comp through that hereafter the first quarter or so. And I know that Chinese government is putting a new incentives around automobile manufacturing and so forth. As we, so that\u2019s something else that may have an impact. So overall, if we expect China to continue to be a long term, a very good market for us here in the near term growing, but at a lower pace.","Europe, same thing. We saw the volumes growth moderate a bit in the second half. And we're expecting that may continue here into the first part of the year with Brexit and everything else going on. And then if you think about long-term Europe, up until a year or so ago, had been growing faster than we would otherwise expect. And I\u2019m talking at the market level and now it\u2019s growing in the low single digit level, which is what we\u2019ve consistently expected up until again the last four months or so when it\u2019s gotten very low-single digits if you will.","So that is our - what we're seeing. And we're basically assuming a continuation of that at least for the first part of the year, depending on if you're at the low end of our guidance range, it be continuing a little bit longer with the high end of the guidance range, it would correct itself rather quickly.","Adam Josephson","And just Greg on the price cost question, someone asked before just to make sure I understood. So it sounds like it was a slight negative for the year as a whole, and it cracked me from a you're expecting it to be roughly neutral in 2019 and just relatedly in some paper markets are coming under pretty significant pressure. Same on the chemical side, so are you seeing any relief on it \u2013 on paper and chemicals, and you mentioned I think inflation would be flat sequentially 4Q to 1Q, but just a little more on your price cost expectations for 2019 would be really helpful. Thank you.","Greg Lovins","Sure I am. So yes, as I said, we ended Q4 is still a little bit short of covering for the year. And in the quarter, but again we expected pricing actions, we took in the back half of the year, which went into place and largely in Q4.but again, we expected price deductions we took in the back half of the year, which went into place, largely in Q4 with those pricing actions we expect to build recovery and be a little bit favorable then in 2019.","In terms of what we\u2019re seeing in the material markets, I think sequentially Q3 to Q4, we saw just a little bit of favorability on chemicals, a little bit of unfavorability on paper. And right now as we've gone from Q4 to Q1, it's a little bit of the same trend, but overall relatively minimal impact sequentially Q3 to Q4 and then Q4 to Q1 at this point in time with what we've seen.","Operator","Our next question coming from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with G. Research. Please proceed with your question.","Rosemarie Morbelli","I was wondering looking at RBIS, if you could - you have expressed strong gain in the share base \u2013 share again. And I was wondering if you could give us more details regarding the product line submarkets, geographies, where you are gaining share?","Mitch Butier","Yes. Our share gain in the base is pretty broad based across multiple customer categories as well as all the various product categories and it really just goes back dramatically to the strength of our position being in every region of the world and our focus around speed and lower cost competitiveness is really resonating with customers and the fact that in this period of uncertainty, I think it really resonates with customers to partner with us.","So it's broad base Rosemarie across the board and if you look at apparel import units, there are roughly \u2013 up roughly 3% so far year-to-date. So pick up in the last couple of months and if we look at our volume trends it's still well-above that. And then clearly, RFID is a clear value driver. In RFID, but I\u2019d say it also creates a halo affect across the rest of RBIS as we are clearly the partner to go to for adduction and then just continued roll out of this technology.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Do you think that in the growth rate of 3% in apparel imports, there was some free buying given the trade war going on with China, which may or may not resolve [indiscernible]?","Mitch Butier","Perhaps, I think that's more \u2013 there's more discussion going on about migration of where products are sourced from, but that is largely what's happening. And it's really at the discussion level still. Apparel imports did surge quite a bit in the most recently available month, which may indicate some of what you're referring to. But on the flipside, inventory levels continue to be extremely lean at the retail level and those have actually declined over the last year as retailers continue to get more lean overall.","So, there are some signs that maybe that did happen. I don't think so. It is part of the active discussion we're having with the retailers and brands. And I think this level of uncertainty really just increases focus on the importance of having a global presence for us as well as the importance of having lean inventory levels for retailers, ritually plays to our strengths and the strength of RFID, which is one of the other reasons we're continuing to see increased pace of focus around RFID adoption within apparel.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Chris Kapsch with Loop Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Kapsch","Just one follow-up on the RBIS dynamically that you were describing. If there was a pronounced migration of apparel manufacturing from China elsewhere. Are you any different or would you look at that as an opportunity to take share given the breadth of your footprint and your presence in essentially all countries where there's apparel manufacturing?","Mitch Butier","So I mean we're available and ready to partner with our customers for whatever they choose to do. In a period of change like that, it does play to our strengths and historically has enabled more share capture. So we saw that years ago and there's a large migration from Latin America to China as an example.","Having said that, I think the pace of migration I mean it will depend on what's going on at the trade discussions going on between the various governments. But there is a large footprint within China and there is a huge network benefit of cluster benefit within China around this. So I'm not sure how quickly it will exactly move, but we're prepared to work with our partners to move as quickly as they individually wish to do.","Chris Kapsch","And then I did have a question focused on LGM and specifically the regions where there's been most exposure to the economic softness that you've talked about and just wondering and presumably we're talking about China and Europe. Can you just describe if there's been any indications of a change in competitive behavior in those regions and the price increases that you've implemented during the course of 2018. Have they been holding in here most recently against that more uncertain backdrop and how do you see those dynamics playing out in 2019?","Mitch Butier","Yes, so overall the competitive dynamics I think are remain fairly consistent with what we've seen over the long-term no big shift competitively. Clearly when you go through a period of change like that we've maintained or gained share in the key regions where we have visibility, the market data for the full year 2018 versus 2017 increasing and so forth, you will see share positions, particularly in some of the less differentiated categories, have a little more variability throughout the course of the year and we saw that, but that is just part of the normal practice and we, as we've discussed in the past, willing to take some near-term share risk during a period of price increase, because we know we can recapture it within the near-term.","So little bit more volatility on that, but that is absolutely the norm we've seen over cycles as far as the competitive dynamic.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up question coming from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","George Staphos","The first one is more of a modeling question. So, I think your guidance for interest expense this year is $75 million to $80 million and that seems to be a bit of a step up from the run rate from 2018, you know aside from perhaps short-term rates being a little bit higher. Is there anything else that's driving that and if you'd called it that earlier and I\u2019d missed it, apologies in advance. That's question on.","The question two when we think about RFID, is there a point in the, I don't know three to five year horizon where it is so effective at allowing your customers now and prospectively to reduce their supply chains such that it actually leads to a reduction in demand overall for smart labels if you get what I'm getting at. Thanks.","Greg Lovins","This is Greg. I'll start with your first question on interest. So much of the step up that we're seeing as we go into 2019 is really driven by the fact that we did issue a $500 million senior note offering in the fourth quarter, late in the fourth quarter, really took effect in December. So we\u2019ll have to carry over impacts for that as well as a little bit higher interest costs and that debt issuance was really to fund the pension as well as some of the share - other increased CapEx in the quarter as well or in the year, sorry.","George Staphos","We\u2019ll remember that. Sorry about that. And then on RFID does it get \u2013 is it so good at reducing supply chain, working capital that all of a sudden you start seeing a slowdown in the demand for the label itself?","Greg Lovins","Yes. So, George I think it's \u2013 if you focus just on apparel, it's got a much longer runway than three to five years as far as the trajectory that we're looking at. If you look at penetration rates and so forth, overall you would expect this to enable some inventory reduction. So, over that time you gradually retailer by retailer should expect to see some inventory reductions which is a near-term impact to demand if you will, but it's overall enabling us to gain more share of the overall apparel labeling space.","And so, we see that it's a good thing. It plays or shrinks. It plays to \u2013 it supports the overall sustainability objectives of the retailers. And so, we see that as absolutely a good thing and I think that's probably part of what even in the period of retail apparel shrink, where I mentioned we still see very lean inventory levels. That's already happening to some extent.","So that is - some of that could happen. I think it will not be a \u2013 it\u2019ll be a gradual if you will, but it's part of the overall objectives that we've laid out for this business and are confident we can achieve or exceed the organic growth rates within RBIS as a result.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with UBS Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Edlain Rodriguez","Mitch, this is like a big picture question for you on M&A opportunities. For a while the focus was in IHM, but given some of the issues there is the focus still on that segment or are there opportunities outside of IHM going forward?","Mitch Butier","Yes. So we see opportunities in all three of our segments. And it\u2019s relative to its side just proportionally we\u2019ve said, it\u2019s an IHM. So our overall focus is on acquisitions that are in high value segments as well as acquisitions that add capabilities in IHM. There is more white space and more kind of bolt-on size acquisition targets that are possible.","As far as the cycle that we\u2019re going through know it doesn\u2019t change our point of view, this is actually the time to actually as I said lean forward as others maybe pulling back. So that is something we will continue to pursue. But we continue to see opportunities within LGM as well. Little bit less just given the size and the dynamics of that market.","And then within RBIS, it will be more on the capability building and technology plays and so forth. We've seen that with a couple of the startups that we've invested in such as pragmatic which is around removing silicon from the integrated circuit for RFID as well as the recently announced Williot which is basically a Bluetooth RFID.","So we've been doing that through venture investment and so forth. And when we think about M&A, it\u2019s more around expanding more on the technology front to really drive the intelligent label's platform.","Operator","Thank you. Mr. Butier, I will turn the call back to you for any closing remarks.","Mitch Butier","So thanks to everybody for joining the call and just to wrap-up, you know clearly the fourth quarter kept another strong year for us. We are well positioned going into 2019, and expect to deliver another very successful year even in the phase of the uncertainty that we're all seeing. And I really just like to finish by thanking the entire team for the continued resilience and commitment for the success for our customers and our communities and our shareholders. So thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Cindy Guenther","Thank you, Pamela. Today, we will discuss our preliminary unaudited first quarter results. The non-GAAP financial measures that we use are defined, qualified and reconciled with GAAP on Schedules A-2 to A-4 of the financial statements accompanying today\u2019s earnings release. We remind you that we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. These forward-looking statements are made subject to the Safe Harbor statement included in today\u2019s earnings release.","On the call today are Dean Scarborough, Chairman and CEO; Mitch Butier, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Anne Bramman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I will now turn the call over to Dean.","Dean Scarborough","Thanks, Cindy and good day everyone. We are off to a very good start to the year on several fronts, including better than expected earnings growth. Both of our core businesses delivered solid organic sales growth and significant margin expansion driving mid-teens growth in adjusted earnings per share. We also signed a definitive agreement to acquire Mactac Europe from Platinum Equity. This acquisition aligns perfectly with our strategy to enhance our competitiveness in high-value pressure sensitive materials for graphics applications. Mactac complements our existing business with a strong brand and loyal customer base expanding our product offering, capabilities and distributor network.","Our consistently strong operating performance, along with the disciplined execution of our long-term capital allocation plan is testament to the strategic foundations we have laid as well as to the strength and depth of our leadership team. I am happy to say that the leadership transition we have had underway has been seamless. As we announced in February, I am formally handing over the CEO reins to Mitch this week. I will stay on the board as Executive Chairman, with Mitch joining the Board following his election at tomorrow\u2019s shareholder meeting.","Since joining Avery Dennison in 2000, Mitch has worked in various businesses and regions across the company and in roles of increasing responsibility. He has been a close partner of mine and has been at the center of our most successful business strategies. Most recently, he was the driver behind our focus on the high-value market segments of our portfolio, while making the investments necessary to be competitive across all product segments. Just as important, Mitch is a champion of the values, integrity and high ethical standards that define Avery Dennison. I am handing off my CEO duties to Mitch with complete confidence in his ability to guide Avery Dennison toward an increasingly prosperous future.","I will save my closing remarks for after the Q&A. So, now I will turn the call over now to Mitch and Anne. Mitch?","Mitch Butier","Let me start by thanking you, Dean, for your leadership, counsel and support over the years, not just from me personally, but on behalf of the entire organization. You have taken Avery Dennison to new heights and I am extremely honored to be able to build on your legacy as I become the next CEO and I am grateful to be able to continue to tap your vast experience in your role as Chairman.","This is a great company with great people and I could not be more confident in the company\u2019s position nor more excited by our prospects. As CEO, my focus remains the same ensuring the long-term success of the company by delivering exceptional value for our customers, our employees and our shareholders. Our two industry leading core businesses are well-positioned for profitable growth. That growth combined with our constant focus on productivity and capital discipline will enable us to continue to deliver strong returns for our shareholders.","As Dean said, we are pleased to report a very good start to the year. We beat our expectations for Q1 EPS by a few cents, reflecting continued outperformance in pressure-sensitive materials. Our consistently strong performance speaks to the strategic foundations we have laid. We are focused on driving profitable growth through differentiated quality, service and innovation with the specific goal to accelerate growth in high value market segments that have above average growth and margin potential, such as tapes, graphics, RFID and emerging markets. We will continue to invest disproportionately here both organically and through bolt-on acquisitions. Over time, this will improve our portfolio mix and bolster our leadership positions in these key segments. In addition to driving growth in high value categories, we are also focused on driving more profitable growth in those that are less differentiated, such as base materials for barcode labels in pressure-sensitive and the value and contemporary segments of RBIS. We are increasing our competitiveness here by lowering our cost and tailoring our go-to-market strategies.","And finally, productivity improvement remains a top priority. This has been the core strength of ours over the years and it is something we will continue to focus on through continued deployment of Lean and Six Sigma, ongoing innovations and product reengineering and investments in automation and restructuring. I want to stress that our productivity focus is not just about lowering cost and expanding margins, both of which are crucial, but also about becoming more competitive so we can grow profitably and better serve the less differentiated segments of our markets.","Now, let me describe how these strategic priorities are playing out within each of our businesses. As you know, our goal in PSM is to create value by growing the top line of this high return business at 4% to 5% organically, while expanding operating margins. And I am pleased to say that the team continues to deliver on both fronts. This business has consistently generated solid organic growth for the past 4 years and Q1 was no exception, with 4% organic growth driven by emerging markets and strength in graphics and specialty label materials. We see opportunities to continue expanding in such high-value categories and are investing to support this growth, including through acquisitions. The Mactac deal is an excellent case in point. I will comment more on that in just a moment.","As for the less differentiated product categories, I am pleased to say we have made good progress on this over the past year and saw a continuation of that trend in Q1. We have more to do on this front, but overall, good progress. As I said, our acquisition of Mactac Europe demonstrates the execution of our strategic priority to further penetrate high value segments as this acquisition enhances our position in both graphics and tapes. This is a classic bolt-on acquisition that meets all of our strategic and financial criteria for acquisitions. Mactac is known in Europe for its high-quality pressure-sensitive graphic materials, with products and capabilities that are complementary to our existing business. It has a loyal customer base and gives us access to new distributors. Incidentally, given the high customer loyalty and opportunity to broaden our distributor network, we intend to maintain the Mactac brand in Europe and Mactac\u2019s manufacturing facility in Belgium adds new capacity to support growth for both graphics and tapes.","Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions, the RBIS team continues to win in high value categories. Sales for radiofrequency identification products grew by more than 70% in Q1 and sales growth for the performance athletic brands was solid once again. Furthermore, the team continues to execute well on its business model transformation, which will enable this business to win in the less differentiated value and contemporary segments while driving significant margin expansion. To this end, we are executing an aggressive set of restructuring and other productivity actions designed to put RBIS back on the margin expansion trajectory necessary to achieve our long-term financial goals.","Let me remind you that this multiyear transformation what it entails. We are reducing our fixed cost, localizing our material sourcing and responding more quickly to changes in our customer needs by decentralizing decision-making. In short, we are rapidly moving to a business model that is making us more competitive. We are seeing early signs of success from this change as we have realized core volume gains in the value segment. Now, volumes for core products among the department stores, what we call contemporary segment, are still down due in large part to the challenges that these customers face in their own markets. Overall, the RBIS team is making solid progress against the transformation. And we are pleased with the results on the top line and bottom line in the quarter. That said, the second quarter will be a key test for us as it is the seasonally most important quarter for this business.","Turning now to Vancive Medical Technologies, first quarter results were simply disappointing with a significant drop in sales. While our long-term new product platform continues to gain traction, we have been losing ground with respect to our core product pipeline. We began taking actions mid last year that are beginning to refill that pipeline, but it will take time to recover due to the long sales cycle in this business. We are committed to achieving consistent growth in our long-term margin objectives for Vancive.","Coming back to the total company view, in terms of our outlook for 2016, we have raised the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance by about $0.08, reflecting some relief from currency headwinds as well as the strong results we delivered in the first quarter. Even more important, we remain highly confident in our ability to consistently deliver exceptional value over the long run based on the execution of our key strategies. We plan to continue to drive outside growth in high value segments, relentlessly focus on productivity to improve our competitiveness in less differentiated segments and drive margin expansion, maintain our high degree of capital efficiency while increasing investments to support profitable growth and continue our disciplined approach to returning cash to shareholders.","Now, I will turn the call over to Anne.","Anne Bramman","Thanks, Mitch and hello everyone. I will provide a little more color on the quarter. In Q1, we delivered a 16% increase in adjusted earnings per share on 4% organic sales growth. Currency translation reduced reported sales by 5.6% in the first quarter with an approximately $0.06 impact to EPS. Adjusted operating margin in the first quarter improved 130 basis points to 9.7% as the benefit of productivity initiatives and higher volume more than offset higher employee related costs. We realized about $27 million of incremental savings from restructuring charges net of transition costs. The adjusted tax rate was 34%, consistent with the anticipated full year tax rate in the low to mid-30% range. Free cash flow was a negative $37 million. About $18 million lower than Q1 of last year primarily due to higher bonus payments associated with our strong performance last year. We repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares in the quarter and paid $33 million in dividends. Net of dilution, we reduced our share count by 0.8 million for a net cost of $80 million.","Our balance sheet remains strong and we have ample capacity to fund both the Mactac acquisition as well as to continue returning cash to shareholders in a disciplined manner. As Mitch mentioned earlier, the Mactac deal aligns with both our strategic and financial criteria for acquisitions. Not only do we expect to be EPS accretive within 12 months, but we also expected to generate a rate of return in excess of our cost of capital within 18 months. We expect to close this deal within a few months and we anticipate that this transaction will have an immaterial impact to EPS this year and expect an approximately $0.10 benefit to EPS next year. That $0.10 benefit is net of interest costs, amortization of intangibles and certain transition costs and it corresponds to EBITDA of roughly \u20ac25 million next year.","Now looking at the segments, Pressure-sensitive Materials sales were up approximately 4% on an organic basis. Traditionally, emerging markets have been a big driver of our growth in PSM. We saw a reverse of that trend last year when faster growth in mature markets picked up the slack for slower than usual growth in China and other parts of the world. In Q1, we returned to the normal trend. Specifically, we saw a return to more modest growth in North America and Western Europe, low single-digits for both, while emerging markets grew at a high single-digit rate. As noted previously, we continued to see strong growth within PSM\u2019s higher value segments. Within Label and Packaging Materials, we grew faster than average in specialty films and papers. And Graphics grew by more than 10%. PSM\u2019s adjusted operating margin of 12.9% was up 140 basis points compared to last year as the benefit from productivity and higher volume more than offset employee related costs. Once again, the team delivered the vast majority of this quarter\u2019s margin improvement through ongoing productivity efforts, including engineered reductions in raw material costs as well as restructuring initiatives. While we saw a benefit from deflation net of price in the quarter, it was very modest.","Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions, coincidentally the organic growth and margin expansion for RBIS was identical to PSM. Sales were up approximately 4% on an organic basis and adjusted operating margin expanded by 140 basis points. Sales growth for the segment was driven largely by radio frequency identification products. RFID sales exceeded our expectations for the quarter with organic growth of more than 70%. The comps for RFID got significantly more challenging in the second half, but we continue to expect better than 20% growth for the full year. Adjusting for the impact at RFID, we saw solid growth in the performance segment. This was not withstanding a tough comp up against last year\u2019s first quarter. Sales of external embellishments were soft in the quarter mostly due to timing of orders. We are confident we will see this part of the business pick up over the course of the year.","As Mitch indicated, the growth trend for core, less differentiated products remains mixed. Q2 remains the key parameter for us here. In contrast to recent quarters, sales growth among European retailers and brand owners outpaced their U.S. counterparts, partly due to easier comparisons. RBIS operating margin improvement reflected the net benefit of productivity initiatives and higher volumes, which more than offset higher employee related costs. As the team continues to execute its aggressive transformation program, we anticipate continued margin expansion over the balance of the year. Sales in Vancive Medical Technologies declined by approximately 18% on an organic basis due in part to a difficult prior comparison related to the specific customer. Even with the lost profits associated with the sales decline, the segment\u2019s operating loss came down modestly, reflecting the actions we took last year to set down our investment in wearable sensors. We expect improvement over the balance of the year in terms of both the top and bottom line.","Turning now to our outlook for the balance of the year, we have raised the midpoint of our guidance for adjusted earnings per share by $0.08, with an updated range of $3.75 to $3.90. We outlined some of the key contributing factors to our EPS guidance on Slide 8 of our supplemental presentation materials. The only assumption that has changed here is the impact of currency. Specifically at recent exchange rates, we now estimate that currency translation will reduce net sales by approximately 2% and pretax earnings by roughly $15 million or an estimated $0.11 per share. This compares to our previous estimates of reduction of 3.5% to sales and $0.18 to EPS. The rest of our key assumptions remain unchanged from what we shared last quarter.","So just wrapping up, we are very pleased with our strategic and financial progress we made against our 2018 goals this past quarter. I am confident we will continue to deliver exceptional value over the long-term through superior execution of our strategies including the disciplined allocation of capital.","Now, we will open the call up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Robert W. Baird & Company. Please proceed.","Ghansham Panjabi","Hi guys. Good morning.","Dean Scarborough","Good morning.","Anne Bramman","Good morning.","Ghansham Panjabi","Dean congratulations. Best wishes to you for the future and same to you as well, Mitch.","Dean Scarborough","Thank you, Ghansham.","Mitch Butier","Thank you.","Ghansham Panjabi","I guess first off on Mactac, in the context of this business being sold by BMS in \u201814 for less than what you are purchasing European assets for, can you give us some color on why you passed on the asset 2 years ago, was it being sold one asset including North America and so the antitrust maybe kept you away?","Dean Scarborough","Yes. So we are not going to comment actually on the process that BMS ran a few years ago. I think the key thing we comped to what us buying this business for more than what the Platinum bought the whole business for, including the U.S. a few years ago, actually only 18 months ago or so, they have done a phenomenal job. The leadership within Mactac particularly in Europe in really turning that business around improving the profitability, leaning out the organization, so that\u2019s \u2013 they have created a lot of value in the last 18 months and we see opportunities to leverage it from here and create even more value going forward.","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay. Then Mitch, do you see any additive technology that you are acquiring with these assets or?","Mitch Butier","It\u2019s complementary technology overall. So, they have number of coding lines with various different adhesive capabilities. But if you look at within the graphics space, there is graphics and tapes to smaller degree within this business, but there is very long life in casting films, which is something that we do quite well like shrink wrap and so forth and then there is shorter life promotional films for graphic materials. And they have a very strong brand and complement our strengths with how they go to market in their approach.","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay. And just one final one on the customer loss in PSM, you called out last quarter. Just to clarify, does that start impacting the first quarter? And is it 1% or so top line loss for that segment any different than your previous year? Is that still the right way to think about that loss? Thanks.","Anne Bramman","Yes. So, we are still looking at about 1% impact for the year. I would say it\u2019s more back loaded in the second half of the year where you are actually going to see the exit in that business.","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Louis Gaffner from Barclays Capital Incorporated. Please proceed.","Scott Louis Gaffner","Thanks. Good morning.","Anne Bramman","Good morning.","Scott Louis Gaffner","Just a follow-up on the Mactac for a minute, any regulatory hurdles that have to be overcome in regards to the acquisition?","Dean Scarborough","We are making filings in a couple of jurisdictions call it Germany specifically, normal customary filings that we need to go through. This is a highly competitive space and we see that the acquisition that we are making is going to even increase the level of innovation in the space. And so I think that the regulators will look at that favorably.","Scott Louis Gaffner","Okay. And one of the issues around that business was the prior owner hadn\u2019t invested very much capital in the business. Did the buyer from Platinum, did they invest significantly in that business from a capital perspective do you know?","Mitch Butier","They invested in restructuring that business over the past year and a half streamlining the organization.","Scott Louis Gaffner","Got it. When I look at the pressure-sensitive margins in the first quarter, up 140 basis points year-over-year, is there something or any items that sort of falloff as we move through the year that would keep you from that kind of variance year-over-year as we move through throughout 2016?","Anne Bramman","Yes. So, I think we are in a record cycle from a margin perspective and really kind of at the peak for PSM. So, I would anticipate we are going to have margin compression in the back half of the year. And we talked about this before, in the last couple of quarters, we have seen some modest benefit from deflation net of price. And so, it would be really reasonable to assume that the business cycle would see offsets of this gain. Additionally, we are seeing some signs of modest inflation in the commodities markets. And as I mentioned earlier, we are seeing some 1% change for performance tapes with the customers\u2019 program that\u2019s exiting and that was a margin that was little bit higher margin than above average in the business as well. So, it\u2019s a little bit of the impact in the second half as well.","Scott Louis Gaffner","Okay. And when you say margin compression, you mean lower margins year-over-year in the back half of 2016 or just lower than we had...","Anne Bramman","I think what we are talking about is right now, we are at a record \u2013 Q1 is really a record quarter for PSM from a margin perspective. So, it\u2019s less about year-over-year and more about we are at a peak right now.","Scott Louis Gaffner","Okay, alright. And then in the quarter just around the organic volume for pressure-sensitive, 4%, how much of that was price and how much of that was volume?","Anne Bramman","So most of that came from price or from volumes sorry and then about 3% of that came out of emerging markets.","Scott Louis Gaffner","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of George Leon Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Alex Wang","Hi, good morning. It\u2019s actually Alex Wang sitting in for George. Congratulations on the quarter. First question, it sounds like PSM was really a driver of the positive variance relative to your expectations. Can you talk a little bit more about the higher value ad segments in emerging markets, how sustainable you think those trends are? And then on a related point, having now four or five quarters with the operating margins at the high end or above the long-term guidance range, are you in a position maybe to reevaluate the margin target for PSM?","Mitch Butier","Yes. So, as far as your first question, the performance on the margins within PSM, so yes, it was basically margin beat and PSM was what caused us to beat our own expectations of the total company. And essentially, just the mix came in a little bit better and we continue to drive growth within the high value segments, so that was a key contributor to that factor. And within the emerging markets, we did see within China, we saw some modest growth. As China, the level of growth as we have been talking about for four out of the last five quarters or so have had moderated from what we have seen traditionally. So, it was in the low single-digits. However, that\u2019s being offset by pretty phenomenal growth in ASEAN as well as in India. So, that\u2019s what\u2019s going on with the growth trajectory and the margins. One of the other things that came in a little bit better than we expected, we are expecting essentially neutral benefit on the net impact of price and raw material inflation. It came in a couple of million dollars better than our expectations. So, that was a positive contributor as well. And remind me, Alex, what was the second question?","Alex Wang","Mitch, just on the long-term target and whether you are in a position maybe to reevaluate that?","Mitch Butier","Yes. So, we are not going to reset targets. We established those targets for 2018. As we have always said, this business is an extremely high return business even at those levels. And we have never seen them as a ceiling or a cap and we are continuing to test our limits and continuing to push this business both in the top and bottom line and that\u2019s something we will continue to do. So, we think it will be at this point, after a few \u2013 5, 6 quarters of outperformance, so this could change the long-term trajectory or long-term target is not the right time to do it.","Alex Wang","Understood. And just as a follow-up, maybe switching over to RBIS, if you could talk a little bit about why maybe the core products we are not seeing some more acceleration in that, maybe what your expectations are as we progress through the year and what you are hearing from your customers as we move into a heavier selling season? Thanks very much.","Dean Scarborough","Yes. So, in the core products, we are actually I think what I commented on is we are starting to see early progress from the actions we have been taking. Now, the revenue is actually down modestly. But recall, we said we were going to be more aggressive on the pricing front with certain \u2013 in certain categories and we have done that. And so the volumes are actually up with value and that\u2019s \u2013 and I am excluding RFID right now. They are significantly up if you include RFID, but volumes in our core products are up. And so we think we are seeing good signs and consistent last few quarters from the volume growth perspective. Good trajectory there. In the contemporary or the department stores, we are still seeing volumes down and a lot of that has to do with some of the challenges that the number of the department stores are seeing in their own marketplace today.","As far as what customers are telling us, it\u2019s hard to give you an average. If you look at it, there is a number of customers that are doing quite well, a number of retailers and brands, and there is a number that are having their own challenges that they work through things. So overall, we are coming off of a winter season that was a little lackluster from a retail sales perspective. And so, a number of the retailers have more inventory than they want to be having right now and that is factoring into their thinking. On a broad base, if I had to characterize, I would say cautious optimism is what the retailers and brands are looking at. And those that are even struggling, everybody is looking to get more productivity out of their existing retail footprint and it\u2019s something what we can help them achieve that, particularly with RFID and that\u2019s the focus of the conversations.","Alex Wang","Appreciate the thoughts. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. How do you feel about your working capital? I think your receivables were up year-over-year. Your sales were down. Do you think that you are managing working capital as well as you might \u2013 do you expect it to be used this year or benefit?","Anne Bramman","So in general on our working capital, we \u2013 a big part of the change is that we have some planned investments in inventory, primarily in the RFID space to support the accelerated growth that we have seen in that business. So over time, we expect that that will even out. But we did plan on in making those investments to make sure that we meet our customer commitments.","Jeff Zekauskas","And you are...","Dean Scarborough","Just quick on their receivables that there is a regional impact as far as regional mix, the higher growth in the emerging \u2013 some of the emerging markets where we have long, slightly longer terms has an impact on that. I say overall, we can do a little more here on the working capital perspective. And so we saw some deterioration. Part of that is just due to mix and some strategic decisions that Anne commented on inventory. We think we can do more here.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay. Your corporate costs year-over-year were up a couple of million dollars, but your SG&A was down, I don\u2019t know, $22 million, why was corporate up and SG&A down so much?","Anne Bramman","So in general, we are going to see over each quarter, there is a little bit of variance that goes on with the corporate expenses, so you should expect to be near from $20 million to $25 million a quarter. So it\u2019s within that variance that we see just say from timing on some of the expenses. As far as SG&A, as we have talked about, we have had a significant restructuring program, especially in RBIS, where a majority of their savings are coming through the SG&A line. So when you look at SG&A savings, the productivity coming as restructuring is driving the improvement overall. We had some favorable in currency with the currency change that are also favorable, but it was offset with higher employee costs.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay. Are RFID margins higher or lower than the RBIS average margin or is there\u2026?","Mitch Butier","The EBIT margins are above the RBIS average.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay. And often you get a sense of the order pattern going into the second quarter, retail sales in the United States have been a little bit on the weak side, is that something that you are seeing or when you look at your order patterns so far, how does that appear to you?","Mitch Butier","Order patterns are consistent with the guidance we are giving overall, but just a real test is not entering the quarter. It\u2019s really how long the peak lasts throughout Q2. So if it ends a few weeks early, that obviously has a big negative impact to us. So it\u2019s consistent right now, but it\u2019s really not an early read. As we have said, we have limited for visibility. Last year, the peak season actually ended relatively early and that was one of the reasons we had the decline last year in Q2. So consistent, but I would say, it\u2019s too early to give you any more color on how that will play out.","Jeff Zekauskas","How will you finance Mactac or how...?","Anne Bramman","So we have ample capacity through both cash and our current credit lines.","Jeff Zekauskas","So do you expect to borrow the whole amount or partly borrow, what\u2019s your plan?","Anne Bramman","So we are \u2013 so specifically, we have plenty of capacity available on our credit lines that we can fund this transaction. And we will look at long-term what this means for us from a financing prospective. So we generally \u2013 we have a CP program and we have got some other credit available for us that we can use.","Jeff Zekauskas","When you give your accretion calculation for next year, do you assume cost cuts or that\u2019s without cost cuts?","Anne Bramman","So there is very \u2013 as I mentioned in my comments, there is very little that we have got into the number for next year for synergies. We really \u2013 we will have some from the procurement side. But the team, the Mactac team has done a phenomenal job of investing in the business and really streamlining it. So what we are getting is a business that\u2019s really complementary to our Graphics business in Europe.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Christopher John Kapsch from BB&T Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher John Kapsch","Yes. Good morning and kudos. I had a follow-up on Mactac, just so if I remember, I mean this is going back a while, there is probably over a dozen years ago that UPM-Kymmene tried to acquire all of Mactac globally, that was challenged domestically by the DOJ and obviously didn\u2019t go through, I am just wondering, back then was there any challenges on the European side and I guess, if you could comment on that first? I realized...","Dean Scarborough","Chris, this is Dean. So the answer is no, so only the U.S. Department of Justice was looking at anti-competitive practices. There was a \u2013 in Europe, there was also an investigation of the industry that happened around the same time, but the two weren\u2019t linked in terms of an antitrust linkage, so to speak. So they were independent investigations.","Christopher John Kapsch","Okay. And then could you just maybe provide some color on what sort of physical assets come with the acquisition. And then you did mention in your formal comments some of the things that the private equity sponsor had done to improve that business in Europe, just wondering if that improvement was more a function of productivity and cost outs or do they also grow the business, you could talk about maybe the growth trends for Mactac Europe in the last couple of years and how it looks going forward based on your due diligence?","Mitch Butier","Sure. So as far as the assets that we are acquiring, so with eight coding lines and they have the capabilities across all different three primary adhesive categories emulsion, hot melt and solvent. So that\u2019s what we are acquiring. And as far as what the company has gone through the last year and a half, they basically restructured down to the single manufacturing facility. They used to have more than one and that\u2019s been the area of focus. And as far as the top line, this business is \u2013 Mactac has extremely well respected brand in the graphic space and tape spaces. And this business used to have some other unprofitable categories specifically bulk roll label materials that they have exited over the last year and a half as well that were unprofitable and pretty low end. So the trajectory for the overall business isn\u2019t really indicative by what was going on in the underlying core. And yes, we know them as from what we have seen in the due diligence and also as competitors that are well respected in the market. And it\u2019s a platform that we expect to be able to leverage and continue to grow profitably.","Christopher John Kapsch","Okay. And then one follow-up on just regulatory and I am going to go back even further but when you guys acquired Jackstadt many years ago, was there any antitrust issues or questions in Europe on that transaction. And then I guess that was more a play and roll stock materials versus it sounds like Mactac is exclusively on the higher end graphics, is that correct?","Mitch Butier","So you have got a good memory, Chris. So the Jackstadt acquisition, we did have filings in multiple jurisdictions around the world. You are correct also in that about 80% of Jackstadt sales were in the bulk roll label growth category although they did have a decent sized graphics business as well. And we went through a second round of process with some of the regulatory authorities in Europe, specifically in Germany. So it took on, I think four months or five months and then we have got the approval. So Mactac\u2019s business is primarily a graphics business. And by and large, with a little bit of tapes, it\u2019s a nice add-on to what we are doing. And these are both categories where we have relatively low market shares respectively. So we have got \u2013 I don\u2019t want to project how regulatory agencies will react, but suffice it to say that we wouldn\u2019t have done the deal unless we had some level of confidence that it would go through.","Christopher John Kapsch","Sure. Thanks for the additional context. And then if I could just follow-up on \u2013 one on the just the comment about peak margins and some expectation that there will be compression in the second half, if you look at some of the drivers setting aside the raw material benefit that you got in this quarter, it seems as though you guys have been optimizing your customer mix, you have been driving growth in higher margin more value added product lines and you always have been terrific at optimizing your manufacturing both from, I guess contenting out the material content as well as just enhancing your operational run rates. And none of that seems like it\u2019s in jeopardy in terms of not being sustained, so I am just wondering, why the commentary about maybe this flattening out or compression of operating margins over the balance of 2016? Thanks.","Mitch Butier","Yes. Chris, so overall, I think the way you have characterized is right and then I will answer your question. We will continue to drive growth in looking to have outsized growth in the high value segments that obviously improves mix. And we have also been talking about instilling more discipline in our less differentiated segments with how we grow and ensuring that it\u2019s profitable growth there. And our productivity initiatives that is the core strength of ours, we continue to execute on and have consistently done that and we will continue to do that. As far as \u2013 if you look at where the margins are in Q1, hence comments we are comping from Q1 where we are expecting it to go forward, you normally have a seasonal reduction in those margins in the second half late in the year. So we just want to highlight that there were some seasonal adjustments. We got the impact of lower \u2013 the tapes decline of one customer, which will have an impact. And the \u2013 just purely from the purchase prices we have for raw materials and the selling prices, it was a modest benefit. And there was definitely some deflation in North America. And as we have talked about last time, we have actually been adjusting our own prices to our customers in those segments that are impacted the most. So it\u2019s \u2013 we are at peak levels. You don\u2019t want to lock on this time you can get to a new level and say, this is something you should baseline your models on and how you are thinking about it. I will tell you our focus here is about growing this business and growing it profitably and continuing to see opportunities for how we can further expand margins, which also fits and this is a great business and a great platform. That links right into to why we are trying to penetrate this space even more aggressively with acquisitions like Mactac.","Christopher John Kapsch","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Mr. Scarborough, there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to you. Please continue with your closing remarks.","Dean Scarborough","Thanks Pamela. Well, I would just like to say I am excited about the company\u2019s future, probably more excited than when I joined more than 33 years ago. And I would also like to say that the course that we have set in late 2011 and then committed to the longer term targets in 2012, it\u2019s working. And \u2013 but there is more to come. I am proud to have been part of making Avery Dennison the leading company that it is. I want to thank the leadership team, our employees, our customers and our suppliers for their creativity and commitment to our success. And I have enjoyed engaging with investors and financial analysts over the years and I really appreciate the relationships that we have built. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

To access the replay, please dial 800-633-8284 or 1402-977-9140 for international callers. The conference ID number is 21896769.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Cindy Guenther, Avery Dennison's Vice President of Investor Relations and Finance. Please go ahead.","Cindy Guenther","Thank you, Tina.","Today, we'll discuss our preliminary unaudited second quarter results. Please note that throughout today's discussion, we'll be making references to non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP measures that we use are defined, qualified and reconciled with GAAP on pages A-4 to A-8 attached to the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release and the appendix of our supplemental presentation materials.","We remind you that we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. These forward-looking statements are made subject to the safe harbor statement included in today's earnings release.","On the call today are Mitch Butier, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Lovins, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Now, I'll now turn the call over to Mitch.","Mitch Butier","Thanks, Cindy, and good day, everyone.","Earnings in the second quarter met our expectations, delivering a roughly 12% increase over prior year on a constant currency basis, as we more than offset softer than expected growth with increased productivity.","Now, 2019 is obviously playing out a bit differently than we envisioned at the start of the year-end. As you can see from our results, we are once again proving our ability to anticipate shifting market conditions and are responding swiftly. This agility is enabling us to sustain our earnings growth trajectory and maintain the midpoint of our EPS guidance for the year.","We continue to execute well in driving outsized growth in high-value categories with growth of these products and solutions again outpacing the base business in Q2, and at the same time, our relentless focus on productivity was again a key driver of margin expansion.","In sum, we are making good progress against our key strategic priorities and despite the current environment are on track to deliver our long-term financial targets.","Label and Graphic Materials posted roughly 1 point of organic growth for the quarter, driven by pricing with high-value categories again growing faster than the base. Overall, volumes declined modestly, reflecting softer market demand as well as the previously discussed loss of share in less differentiated categories over the preceding couple of quarters. Recall, this share loss resulted from our disciplined execution of pricing actions near the end of the inflationary cycle. We've begun to recover that share while sustaining the strong margin we achieved in the same period last year.","The slower demand trends we saw in Q1 continued into Q2. We've adjusted our full-year guidance to reflect the softer market conditions through the balance of the year, combined with gradual, focused share gain.","As I mentioned, productivity efforts supported a strong operating margin for LGM in the quarter. We\u2019ve been anticipating the possibility of a general market slowdown. And so, in addition to some belt tightening, we accelerated restructuring actions that we had in the pipeline to both further improve our competitiveness in each region as well to drive long-term, sustainable expansion of both margins and returns.","Retail Branding and Information Solutions delivered solid organic growth, driven by ongoing strength in RFID while continuing to drive significant margin expansion. RFID grew once again by more than 20%, while the pace of the base business slowed. The slowdown in the base reflected general market softness, as well as what appear to be some choppiness in timing of retailer purchases in light of trade related uncertainty. While apparel market uncertainty remains, we are well-positioned to win here with our unsurpassed global footprint and differentiated product and service capabilities.","The strong growth in RFID continues to be fueled by apparel, while we made great progress in developing other promising verticals. Our total pipeline of customer engagements continues to expand, now up by more than 30% from just the beginning of this year with engagements in categories outside of apparel including food, beauty, logistics leading the way.","As the leader in ultra-high frequency RFID, we are positioned extremely well to capture these opportunities with our industry-leading innovation and manufacturing capabilities and the best, most experienced team in the space. We continue to increase our investments in business development and other resources to drive this growth, as we build out our Intelligent Labels platform to enable a future where every item can have a digital twin and a digital life.","In industrial and Healthcare Materials, sales were flat on an organic basis, driven by the decline in global auto production, which more than offset solid growth in other industrial categories as well as strong growth in our medical business. And we once again made good progress in the quarter toward achieving our operating margin target for this business.","In short, another solid quarter and despite a softer top-line, we are reaffirming our earnings guidance midpoint for the year. Our strategies to deliver outsized growth in high-value categories are clearly working and our relentless focus on productivity continues to enable us to increase our pace of investment in these categories, increase our competitiveness overall and grow profitably in our base business as well, importantly, continuing to expand operating margin.","We are confident in our ability to achieve our long-term objective to drive GDP-plus growth and top-quartile returns and we will continue to seek opportunities to leverage our positions of strength, commercially, operationally and financially and lean forward even as others may pull back.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Greg.","Greg Lovins","Thanks, and hello, everyone.","As Mitch said, we delivered another solid quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.72, in line with our expectations, and again up more than 10% on a constant currency basis. We grew sales by 1.6% on an organic basis and currency translation reduced reported sales growth by 4.7 points in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin increased by 60 basis points to 12.1%. And we realized $12 million of restructuring savings, net of transition costs in the quarter. The LGM restructuring in Europe was largely completed as of the end of Q2, which will drive a significant uptick in savings from this initiative in the second half.","Turning to cash generation and allocation. Year-to-date, we generated $165 million of free cash flow, up nearly $38 million compared to the prior year. And as we've discussed, we've increased our pace of fixed capital in IT-related spending for two to three-year period to support our long-term organic growth and margin expansion plans, with capital spending expected to be up by about $25 million this year. We continue to expect capital spending then to moderate from this level over the next couple of years, consistent with our long-term capital allocation strategy.","And we continue to return cash to shareholders. In the first half of the year, we repurchased roughly 1.2 million shares at an aggregate cost of $117 million. We paid $93 million in dividends, including the 12% increase in the dividend rate in April, for a total of $209 million of cash return to shareholders, up 11% compared to the same period last year. And our balance sheet remains strong. Our current leverage position gives us ample capacity to continue executing our disciplined capital allocation strategy, including investing in organic growth and acquisitions while continuing to return cash to shareholders. We are well positioned to take advantage of any dislocations in the market should they occur over the next few years.","I'll now turn to the segment results for the quarter. Label and Graphic Materials sales increased by 0.9% on an organic basis, driven by prior year pricing actions as volume declined modestly. Growth in LGM's high-value categories continued to outpace the growth of the base business, once again led by specialty and durables, which were collectively up high single digits on an organic basis.","Breaking down LGM's organic growth in the quarter by region. Both North America and Western Europe declined at low single digit rates, reflecting the market dynamics already discussed. Emerging markets grew at a low single digit rate with China up low single digits and South Asia up high single digits. Adjusted operating margin for the segment was strong at 13.8%, in line with the same period last year, reflecting the benefit of productivity actions including material reengineering, partially offset by currency-related headwinds and the impact of lower volume.","As I mentioned in last quarter's call, we've covered the cumulative effect of the roughly 18 months of raw material cost inflation that we experienced through a combination of pricing actions and material reengineering. We're now seeing some modest deflation in our raw material input costs on a sequential basis with comparable sequential declines in both the first and second quarters of the year.","Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. RBIS delivered solid top line growth, up 4.4% on an organic basis, driven by faster growth in high-value categories with sales of both RFID and external embellishments up more than 20% for the quarter. Our base business was roughly flat, adjusting for the impact of cannibalization due to RFID. Adjusted operating margin for the segment expanded by 130 basis points to 12.5% as productivity and higher volume more than offset higher employee-related costs and growth related investments.","Turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment. Sales were flat on an organic basis, driven by the decline in global auto production as automotive applications globally represent about a third of IHM's sales. Outside of automotive, industrial categories were up mid-single digits on an organic basis. Healthcare categories likewise grew at a mid-single digit pace with better than 20% growth in medical applications. We continue to make good progress on the margin front in IHM. Adjusted operating margin increased by 120 basis points to 10.5% driven by productivity and a net benefit of pricing and raw material costs, which more than offset higher employee-related costs. Gains on the pricing side largely relate to strategic adjustments we made as a result of our work to more effectively segment our portfolio.","Focusing now on our outlook for 2019. We have maintained our guidance midpoint for adjusted earnings per share while tightening the range to $6.50 to $6.65. We have reduced our outlook for organic sales growth to a range of 2% to 2.5% in light of the slower market conditions in LGM during the first half that we assume will continue. We have outlined some of the other key contributing factors to this guidance on slide nine of our supplemental presentation materials, in particular, and just focusing on the changes from our assumptions in April.","At recent exchange rates, currency translation represents a roughly 2.5-point headwind to reported sales growth for the year with a pre-tax operating income hit of $28 million. This is up slightly from the $27 million we had anticipated previously. We now estimate that incremental pre-tax savings from restructuring, net of transition cost, will contribute about $45 million to $50 million, up $5 million from our April estimate, as we've accelerated a number of actions that were in the pipeline, we've already realized about $17 million in net savings year-to-date and expect the balance of our full-year savings will be split roughly equally between the third and fourth quarters. And we've narrowed our range on average share count, assuming dilution of 84.5 million to 85 million shares reflecting an assumed pick-up from the Q2 pace of share buyback during the second half.","In summary, we delivered another solid quarter in a more challenging environment, and we are confident in our ability to deliver the earnings guidance we communicated at the start of the year and are on track to deliver on our long-term objectives to achieve GDP plus growth and top-quartile returns on capital, driving sustained growth in EVA.","Now, we'll open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird & Co. Please go ahead.","Ghansham Panjabi","I guess, first off on margins in LGM being flat year-over-year during the second quarter, even with the obvious moderation in volume growth. You mentioned accelerated productivity actions, reengineering et cetera. Can you just give us more color in terms of what actually benefited you relative to your initial expectations for that specific segment?","Greg Lovins","Yes. I think overall there is a couple of pieces. One, we talked a little bit about the stronger growth in higher value segments and that\u2019s helped overall with our margins there as well, as well as some of the share loss that we've talked about over the last couple of quarters, so some of the less differentiated segments. So, having a generally kind of lower average variable margin than our average would be on that decline. At the same time, as you mentioned, Ghansham, we've accelerated productivity efforts, combination of restructuring actions as well as kind of short-term productivity actions including belt tightening, as Mitch mentioned a little bit of incentive costs and a little bit of benefit from price deflation year-over-year. So, really a combination of things with the productivity, as well as stronger growth in high-value segments helping maintain the margin year-over-year.","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay. That's helpful, Greg. And then, Mitch, back to your comments on RBIS and the comments of the base business slowed. Kind of looking back, do you think that you benefited from any material extent from a volume pull forward previously that may have impacted 2Q or do you see incremental weakness? I guess, what are customers telling you as you cycle into the back half? And then, also, have you seen any impact specific to RFID as well? Thanks so much.","Mitch Butier","Sure. So overall as far as pull forward, it's tough to call overall, Ghansham. as far as end retailer behavior has been doing in the first half, there has been just more choppiness, as I commented on. The other big factor just between Q1 and Q2 is really around just timing of holidays and Chinese New Year and everything else. That aside, Q2 seemed to have a bit of a slowdown in the base, and it's really around just some of the uncertainty, particularly around announced tariffs and then tariffs being canceled, and so forth. So even within individual quarters, we're seeing a bit more lumpiness than we normally see. Now with that regard, performance athletic continues to be a well-positioned category, they've moved a lot of their sourcing outside of China already, and I'd say the value segment, so think of discounters and so forth are more exposed to what's going on with the China U.S. trade relationships.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Edlain Rodriguez, UBS. Please go ahead.","Edlain Rodriguez","A quick question for you Mitch. I mean in terms of LGM like the volume softness you see in the base label business, like what are some of the key end markets where you're seeing that softness?","Mitch Butier","Key end market is, for base, if you're talking about paper-based products and so forth, would be variable information label. So e-commerce labels. If you think about the variable information labels for shipping, for near the grocery store and you get a barcode at the deli counter and so forth. So that's some of the less differentiated categories that we're referring to.","Edlain Rodriguez","And can you talk about like the progress you're making on regaining like the lost market share in LGM? And again, remind us again like how exactly are you doing that to get that volume back? Is it through pricing or is there something else going on? Just a little more color please.","Mitch Butier","Yes. We're seeing progress, particularly in North America and Europe where we have clear data on what is going on within the market. We can tell from the volume trends that we're seeing, we're making progress, we've stabilized the share position and began to recapture that share here in Q2. We are focused on doing this in a disciplined and gradual way. As we said, it will take us a few quarters to recapture that share and how we do it is basically continuing to focus around our differentiated quality and service, that is a key area of focus for us. And so we're willing to take some risk particularly late in the inflationary cycle knowing that our core fundamental points of advantage continue to play through over time. Having said that, our markets clearly are competitive and less differentiated categories are competitive as well. So we continue to have a balanced strategy focus around innovation and productivity to remain competitive and continue to have attractive returns within the base categories.","I do want to comment real quick also as Ghansham you had another follow-up question around RFID. So again, just as my comments said continuing to see strength within RFID, RFID is an enabler for continuing to not only provide opportunities for end market demand and managing through the omnichannel, all of the advantages we've talked to in the past, but also around shortening lead times and cycle times which given some of the trade uncertainty also is a great capability for any retailer and brand to have. So there is not any impact or changing views overall in RFID in any way other than just general recognition that it is the technology of the future within the apparel categories and we're seeing the new opportunities continue to flourish outside of apparel I talked through as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari of Citigroup Global Markets. Please go ahead.","Anthony Pettinari","In LGM, you identified variable information and shipping labels as maybe a couple of the weaker end markets that you sell into in the quarter. Apologies if I missed this, but for LGM, is it possible to say which geographies or which regions were particularly weak or strong from a volume perspective in the quarter? I know you gave those volume trends regionally for RBIS.","Mitch Butier","If you're talking about specifically for VI and shipping label volumes by region, if we saw actually strength in China pretty strong growth within the VI, variable information label category, reflecting just strong growth of e-commerce as well as a little bit of easier comps in that specific category in China. And then elsewhere, we're actually seeing general slowdown, which reflects a general slowdown we think in economic activity with Europe being the biggest decline. And obviously, there is a piece of share loss in there as well from our business. I'm talking a bit of market.","Anthony Pettinari","Got it. Now that's helpful. And then in your comments, you discussed levers you can pull to grow earnings and returns and I think you talked about leaning forward as others pull back. And I'm just wondering, I don't know if that comment was specifically around M&A, but can you just talk about maybe valuations that you're seeing, is it too soon for kind of the economic slowness that we've seen in some regions to actually impact multiples, conversations you've had with potential targets, any general thoughts on M&A?","Mitch Butier","So it's a general comment, overall. So just around our organic strategy, we've been ramping up our pace of investment for the last few years to drive this outsized growth in high-value segments and we've been leaning forward with continued restructuring activity that you hear us announce periodically, we continue to focus around how to find more productivity to fund those investments, protect the core and expand margins. So, it's leaning forward on all those strategies. And it's also around just capital allocation of what's leftover with free cash flow as you comment on, and it's M&A. And we find most of what we're looking to companies in the pipeline are privately held, prices tend to be a little bit sticky. We are actively engaging a number of targets there. We did slow down a little bit of the slow core ships in IHM, we're now going to be ramping that up as well as far as how we core people, but it's in general pipeline is healthy. But the pricing is a bit sticky is what I'd say. And that's why things haven't converted of late. The other element of the comment is just there is more volatility in general around stock market and so forth and so we aren't well positioned for share repurchases as well. So it's multifaceted, Anthony.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John McNulty, BMO. Please go ahead.","Bhavesh Lodaya","Hi. Good afternoon. This is Bhavesh Lodaya for John. You touched on the RFID opportunities and it's great to see it maintained its strong growth. As we think about how a tough macro impacts the segment, are you seeing any changes in implementation and\/or expansion from your customers where either they may be slowing down things to reduce their spend or alternatively they may be accelerating their adoption to help improve efficiency. So maybe you can touch on how to think about both those sides?","Mitch Butier","I'm not sure I caught the beginning of the question. I think you're asking about RFID and if we're seeing any change in behavior given the current macro and the answer is the only change we've been seeing over the last few years is a continued interest and acceleration. Again, this enables companies to connect more with their end customers, it enables them to have more efficient retail as well as omnichannel strategies, and it enables them for more efficient supply chain. So, even if things do turn down, it actually says this technology is a key enabler for the success of various companies in that environment. So we're not seeing any negative shift just a continued acceleration as we commented on both in our revenue as well as in our pipeline of activity.","Bhavesh Lodaya","Okay, thanks. As a quick follow-up, any updates on the M&A environment, particularly for this segment or outside of it?","Mitch Butier","Just we continue to see opportunities for M&A and we are continuing to work the pipeline and that no additional comments beyond what we've discussed. Part of the reason, as you've noticed, we've been below our targeted leverage level. And so that we have the capacity to both do M&A as well as continue disciplined share buyback and we're well positioned for that and continue to engage in active pipeline.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from George Staphos, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Molly Baum","Hi. Thank you. This is Molly Baum sitting on for George. He is traveling today, but one of the questions that he had wanted to ask was, what impact is recycling and other sustainability efforts having on LGM and RBIS both from a volume perspective, but also how is it impacting your product development efforts?","Mitch Butier","Yes. So overall on sustainability, we've committed as you all know to a number of set of long-term targets and we're making great progress on that both procuring more sustainable raw materials, reduce the environmental impact of our business and developing more sustainable and innovative products and solutions. So a key area of focus is around really the recyclability of packaging and it's getting a disproportion amount of our investment dollars as we've talked about, we have innovative solutions out there such as CleanFlake that enable more efficient and effective recycling of plastic containers, that's been growing double digits, and we are continuing to invest a higher amount of our innovation spend specifically in this area, given the fact that we spend a disproportion amount of the industry's R&D spend, we feel we're well positioned for this and see that it will be a slow change overall, but we are well positioned to help lead that change.","Molly Baum","And then, I don't know if I heard this correctly. I think one of the comments in terms of RBIS base business being flat. That was adjusting for some cannibalization from RFID. Can you quantify kind of what the impact would have been if you included that and just give a sense for how you expect that to trend going forward? Thank you.","Greg Lovins","Yes. So, we said the base business in RBIS was roughly flat with the cannibalization. It would be down low single digits if you exclude that impact. So low-single digit impact in terms of the transition from certain tags that used to be without RFID to now price tag, for instance, it would include RFID.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Josephson, KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Adam Josephson","Mitch, in terms of the cadence of volumes throughout the quarter, can you just talk about them and how that cadence led to your guidance reduction on organic sales?","Mitch Butier","Yes. So overall just the lowering that we had -- when we had the Q1 performance, we've seen blips for individual couple of months at a time even a quarter and so we weren't calling it as a bigger shift, and with what, how we saw how Q2 came in, we concluded giving a range of guidance that at the low end just shows a pure continuation of the first half growth and at the high end I assume that once we get through the easier comps in Q4 that that growth rate increases a bit, so that's very simple how we came up with the guidance.","Adam Josephson","I mean, it's just a follow-up to that April through June, did you see any meaningful change in underlying trends?","Greg Lovins","Yes. And we were probably strongest in the middle of the quarter and a little bit softer in April and June, so as Mitch said it's been a little bit choppier over the last couple of quarters. So nothing meaningful that I would say and again as Mitch mentioned our comps are a little bit tougher in Q2 and Q3. So, we\u2019d expect the third quarter to be a little bit on the lower side of our guidance range and the fourth quarter a little bit stronger.","Adam Josephson","And Greg, in terms of volume versus price, I know in LGM, you were up 1.2 [ph] organically. And I know all of that was price because volume was down. In terms your expectation for the second half in LGM specifically, are you expecting volume growth embedded in your guidance and what is volume versus price for LGM or anything you can talk about with along those lines?","Greg Lovins","Sure. So, I think we talked about a couple of quarters ago, our original expectation for this year was about a 1 point to 1.5 growth when we started the -- growth in price. When we started the year, we were around that 1.5 level. I think now for the full year in LGM, we're probably expecting to be closer to 1 point, maybe slightly below and most of that year-over-year is carryover pricing from last year and most of that impact was in the first half, so we would see a little bit more volume growth in the back half and a little bit less on the price side.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas, JP Morgan Securities. Please go ahead.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. Can you talk about July business trends across your three segments?","Greg Lovins","Yes, Jeff. This is Greg. There is -- I think July had not much of a read so far, just given holidays in July in the US and then Europe holiday period starting. So I wouldn't say that we make or take much for churn from what we've seen so far this quarter. So again, what I would say is Q2, we expect to be more or Q3, we expect to be more like the first half, maybe a little bit lighter in terms of year-over-year growth given the harder comp in the third quarter, with that picking up a little bit in the fourth quarter as Mitch indicated earlier given some of the, the share loss and some of the softening markets we saw at the tail end of last year.","Jeff Zekauskas","And maybe you discussed this before and I missed it. Can you talk about the volume trends in Label and Graphic Materials in the US, generally, Europe, South America and China for the quarter?","Mitch Butier","Yes. So, Jeff, the volume trends, we don't talk about the specific volume trends overall region by region. So, but if you look at within North America. It was growing low single digits organically through the end of '17. And the growth began to moderate a bit in '18 and then moderated fully again here in 2019. And as we talked about before, Q1, we think we saw a bit of softness that was probably a little bit more share than just the market at least in the beginning of the quarter and now we're seeing all same macro trend you're seeing and we don't yet have share of market data for Q2. But if you look at the macro trends, it seems that there might be a bit of a softening in Q2 here. Europe had even stronger growth than North America up until early last year, it then moderated, it moderated still further from a market perspective, and it looks like volumes, it actually went negative as an overall market as well in Q2. And China continued to see growth within the variable information labels tied to e-commerce, it's tough to tell exactly. There is no clear market data here, but there's just a lot more uncertainty in general, there's growth -- decent growth overall outside of variable information labels in the market, but it's a lot more push and taken just uncertainty I'd say with engagement that we have with our customers. And then South Asia, we continue to see strong growth, ASEAN a little bit lighter than India, ASEAN basically has tough comps they're going through. India seeing strong growth still although that's moderating a bit. Exports are down coming out of India, which is having a general macro view. And Latin America, decent growth relative to the environment and you can see what's going on in the environment there. We've got -- had a quite a bit of currency price and so forth over the last couple of years.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Chris Kapsch of Loop Capital. Please go ahead.","Chris Kapsch","So, I look at the income statement, I see the gross margins roughly flat year-over-year but your SG&A was down 70 basis points year-over-year. I don't think it's ever been below 15%. I get that's partly just sales leverage with the growth over time. But the -- and I get you've mentioned obviously the relentless focus on productivity. You called out some belt tightening. I'm just wondering if you could comment on the sustainability of that metric and if there is anything more specifically that you can point to that\u2019s contributing there? Was there like a reversal of some incentive accruals or just the absence of some incentive accruals there that may have distorted that metric? And how should we think about that metric over the balance of 2019?","Greg Lovins","Yes. Chris, I think, as you've seen, we've been kind of pulling down our run rate on SG&A over the last four quarters really with some of the actions that we started taking in RBIS a couple of years ago that continued through last year as well as some of the actions we've been taking in IHM for instance, as in both of those businesses, we look to improve our speed, reduce our complexity while also reducing our cost. And much of that work has been benefiting SG&A. So, you've seen our run rate come down over the last year and then at the same time, we're also reinvesting some of that savings from those initiatives in the higher value segments as Mitch talked about earlier as well. So we do expect or I should say this quarter as well, we had a little bit of a benefit from incentive compensation as you mentioned as well, but we do expect overall to be more or less in line with where we've been in the last four quarters as we move forward.","Chris Kapsch","Okay. And then if I had -- if I could follow up on RBIS, you mentioned external embellishments as a category growing I think over 20% and just curious if that is -- is that something that's happening in the apparel market where retailers are spending more on that or is it something -- is that dynamic -- that metric a function of some commercial efforts that you put in place, perhaps more design efforts with key retail or apparel companies? If you could just talk about what's driving that dynamic? And is that something that you view as sustainable in the market? Thanks.","Mitch Butier","Yes, part of a deliberate effort and strategy, both commercially to increase our market presence and really to leverage our material science capabilities we have within the company to go from the interior of the garment to the external part of the garment and really trying to capture the overall trend within retail and well apparel specifically on customization and personalization. So that is a key intent, key driver. We've been investing in it, it's been growing from a very small base over the last number of years well above the average and the key growth right now is largely coming from Europe, where we are seeing growth in the Sportswear, fan sportswear categories and so forth.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli, G.research. Please go ahead.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Thank you. Good morning and good afternoon rather, everyone. I was wondering, you mentioned Mitch that the performance athletic did well as your customers moved out of China. So, does that -- did that translate into higher growth, and while you may still, the growth, it is at the lower margin?","Mitch Butier","Yes. So, my comment specific around performance athletic is one, they as a category that is a category that's doing well just in end markets, and two, with regard to some of the sourcing region uncertainty that's out there, it's not a recent item, but over time they migrated more of their manufacturing outside of China already, so it's more of a relative comment from what we see. So that's what my comment was. And as far as what's going on, I think your second part of your question, Rosemarie, was around just the impact of migrating sourcing. This is something that can cause some near-term disruption in the industry related to some of the choppiness I noted. We are extremely well positioned for this given our global footprint that we have our long experience of doing business in all the emerging markets that where apparel is made and so this is something that we see as an opportunity should things shift more -- at a more accelerated pace.","Rosemarie Morbelli","And then, I was wondering, you talked about the impact of the trade war on demand for retail apparel -- apparel items. Looking at the fact that now I believe retailers are beginning to order for the holiday seasons, are you seeing a big change versus what was happening last year?","Mitch Butier","There is some of the uncertainty around it for sure. I can't call one way or the other. Now, I will say, I mean there is no -- the tariffs aren't being implemented. So, and there have been broad discussion about for the vast majority of apparel that there won't be really an impact here. So I think this overall had some early on we were thinking potential delays, but just in general, some of the choppiness that I've talked through, and if you look at just more broadly than that, China, the devaluation of the renminbi has actually made China cheaper to some retailers and brands as well in the meantime. So there's a number of factors that go into their decisions and we're just seeing general choppiness and it's too early for us to call.","Operator","Thank you. Mr. Butier, I see no further questions via the phone lines. I will turn the call back over to you for any closing remarks.","Mitch Butier","All right. Well, great. Well, thanks everybody for joining the call. And I really want to just thank our team for their commitment and agility in delivering another solid quarter. We are confident, as you've heard many times, in our ability to achieve our long-term targets, really reflect the resilience of our industry-leading market positions, the relative stability of our end markets and the strategic foundations we've laid. So, thank you very much.","Operator","That does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

You may begin, sir.","Eric Leeds","Thank you. Welcome, everyone. Today, we'll discuss our preliminary unaudited fourth quarter and full year 2012 results.","Please note that unless otherwise indicated, today's discussion will be focused on our continuing operations. The company's Office and Consumer Products business is classified on our income statement as a discontinued operation.","Please also note that, unless otherwise indicated, prior period amounts referenced in today's earnings release, supplemental materials and on this teleconference call have been realigned to reflect the company's new operating structure, including our new corporate expense allocation method. Within our new operating structure, the company's Performance Tapes business is now reported as part of the Pressure-sensitive Materials segment; RFID is now entirely within Retail Branding and Information solutions; Designed and Engineered Solutions, or DES, which is contracted to be sold to CCL Industries, is included in results of continuing operations and the company's 2013 guidance. DES will be reported as a discontinued operation in the company's first quarter 2013 report. Office and Consumer Products, also contracted to be sold to CCL Industries, remains reported in the company's discontinued operations.","The non-GAAP financial measures that we use are defined, qualified and reconciled with GAAP in Schedules A-2 to A-5 of the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release.","We remind you that we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. These forward-looking statements are made subject to the Safe Harbor statement included in today's earnings release.","On the call today are Dean Scarborough, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mitch Butier, Senior Vice President and CFO.","I'll now turn the call over to Dean.","Dean A. Scarborough","Thanks, Eric. I'm pleased to start with the news that we've agreed to sell 2 businesses, Office and Consumer Products and Designed and Engineered Solutions, to CCL industries. As we mentioned last October, we received expressions of interest in Office and Consumer Products as soon as we terminated the agreement with 3M. CCL was one of the interested parties and wanted to buy both businesses. We're pleased we were able to reach an agreement that is positive for both companies.","I won't go through all the details in the press release, but I do want to note that the purchase price is $500 million, and the expected net proceeds are approximately $400 million. We'll use the proceeds primarily for share repurchases and an additional pension contribution.","CCL is an important partner for us in our Materials business. The deal includes a 5-year supply agreement with CCL, which is an important part of the value to us going forward. We believe it's an excellent deal for both companies and for Avery Dennison shareholders. We expect to complete the transaction midyear once we get regulatory approvals and satisfy the usual closing conditions. The sale will be a significant step toward focusing the company on 2 core businesses to drive higher growth rates and returns.","Now, I'll talk about the financial results for the quarter and full year. We delivered a strong earnings improvement on solid sales growth in 2012. We also delivered strong free cash flow and returned $346 million to shareholders through an increased dividend and share repurchases, which totaled 7% of our outstanding shares. A significant accomplishment in 2012 was the refocusing of the company through our restructuring initiative. This program will enhance our competitive position and strengthen our ability to increase returns, even in a soft economic environment. This program has involved every business. As you know, we combined RFID inlay manufacturing with Retail Branding and Information Solutions. We integrated Graphics and Reflective Solutions into Label and Packaging Materials. We also moved our Performance Tapes business into Materials, as it shares some operating processes and systems with Labeling and Packaging Materials. We moved corporate R&D into the businesses to bring innovators closer to the customers they serve, and we ended investment in several small non-core growth platforms.","We continue to execute against our long-term strategy for the reduction of RBIS' footprint and overall cost structure.","Finally, we changed the relationship between the corporate center and the businesses and streamlined the corporate organization. We have moved resources and support functions into the businesses and reduced activities at the center. We've realigned our segments to reflect this new operating structure. We've also adopted a new methodology for allocating corporate expense that reflects this new structure. We are on track, not only to achieve more than $100 million of annualized savings, but also to accelerate decision-making and to operate more effectively.","Now for the businesses. Pressure-sensitive Materials had solid sales growth for the year and expanded margins. Label and Packaging Materials strengthened its leadership position in all regions, delivering solid sales growth in North America throughout 2012, and double-digit growth in emerging markets after a weak first quarter. Despite a challenging economy in Europe, we achieved a modest increase in sales there as well. LPM also exceeded its target for sales of new products and launched another 14 innovations at Labelexpo this past fall.","Combined sales of Graphics and Reflective Products were up slightly over 2011. We saw strong results in Reflective globally. While sales for Graphics declined in Europe, not surprising for this more economically sensitive product line, we did experience solid growth for these products in both North America and Asia. And we're already seeing savings from the integration of these businesses into LPM.","I want to highlight Label and Packaging Materials' excellent operating performance. The team continued to drive down production costs and improved quality and productivity. They increased working capital efficiency for the fourth year in a row and ended 2012 with record-high inventory turns. Their efficiency and productivity were key drivers in maintaining LPM's high returns.","Retail Branding and Information Solutions ended the year with 2 strong quarters that offset a difficult first half. Organic net sales growth in the fourth quarter was 10%, which helped bring full year growth up to 3%. The growth in the second half was driven by improved market conditions, share gains in the core business and terrific growth in RFID and exterior embellishments, the 2 most important growth programs at RBIS.","The team did an outstanding job with RFID in 2012, increasing sales by more than 60%. Integrating RFID inlay manufacturing into RBIS enabled the business to meet a substantial increase in demand and generated a significant profit improvement. The RFID business is solidly profitable now. We ended 2012 with an annual run rate for RFID sales above $100 million, and we expect to see continued growth in demand during 2013.","RBIS expanded its adjusted operating margin for the year by 120 basis points to 5.2%, which is still below our target range of 8.5% to 9.5%. We expect to make additional progress in 2013 as we lower fixed costs by reducing the manufacturing footprint and continuing to drive share gain through innovation, speed of service and quality.","Now for the outlook. Our guidance for 2013 continues to reflect caution above the top line. We were encouraged by our sales growth in the back half of 2012, but given the mixed economic environment and the short lead times we work with, we're not sure how far this second half momentum will carry over. But even with modest sales growth, we expect 15% to 35% earnings growth in 2013, as well as strong free cash flow, and we remain committed to returning most of that cash to shareholders.","Thanks. And now, I'll hand it over to Mitch.","Mitchell R. Butier","Thanks, Dean. As you can see, we had a solid year, with adjusted earnings per share growth of 20%, reflecting strong performance in Pressure-sensitive Materials, solid progress in RBIS, the early results of our restructuring program and accretion from share repurchases. For the year, we delivered organic sales growth of 4%, adjusted EPS of $2.08 and free cash flow from continuing operations of $312 million, all in line with our long-term targets and at the upper end of the guidance that we set at the beginning of the year.","With leverage in our targeted range and with our consistently strong free cash flow, we continue to deliver on our commitment to return cash to shareholders. In fact, we returned nearly all of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2012, through both dividends and the repurchase of 7.9 million shares, or as Dean mentioned, about 7% of our outstanding shares.","In the fourth quarter, we delivered strong results with adjusted EPS of $0.54 and organic sales growth of approximately 7%. Sales came in stronger than expected with the vast majority of the quarter's growth coming in November and December. A shift in the timing of our fiscal year end also added about 1 point of growth in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter grew 170 basis points, as the benefit of higher volume and productivity initiatives more than offset higher employee-related expenses and the impact of changes in product mix, specifically in PSM. The net impact of raw material input cost and pricing continued to be neutral in the quarter.","Now we've been talking about our cost-reduction program that will structurally reduce our overhead costs and save more than $100 million annually. We're on track and continue to expect to achieve our savings target by the middle of this year. These actions will increase our ability to deliver our targeted earnings growth regardless of market conditions.","The actions we've taken, which include consolidation of operations and streamlining of the corporate center, are reflected in the adjustments we've made to segment and corporate expense reporting. Operating executives are now directly accountable for externally-reported segment results, while gaining greater control over certain functional costs that had been previously controlled from the center. The net effect from a reporting perspective is higher corporate expense, offset by a corresponding reduction in costs allocated to the segments.","Note that this adjustment in allocation methodology has been reflected by an increase in our long-term segment margin targets.","Turning to the segments. Pressure-sensitive Materials sales were up 6% on an organic basis in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting solid growth in North America and emerging markets. Label and Packaging Materials sales grew mid-single digits, with mid-single-digit growth in North America, low single-digit growth in Western Europe and low double-digit growth in emerging markets. Combined sales for other product lines, that is Graphics, Reflective and Performance Tapes, were up mid-single digits. PSM's adjusted operating margin improved 100 basis points to 8.7% (sic) [7.8%] as the benefit of higher volume and productivity initiatives more than offset the impact of product mix and higher employee-related expenses.","Retail Branding and Information Solutions sales grew 10% with about 1\/2 of the growth coming from RFID and the remainder being driven primarily by strong growth at North American retailers and brands. Overall, we believe we continue to gain share in both the U.S. and Europe. Sales of RFID products more than doubled in the fourth quarter and grew about 60% for the full year, a pace that is expected to moderate somewhat as a major retailer recently decided to slow the pace of their RFID adoption. RBIS' adjusted operating margin improved 270 basis points to 6.2%, as the benefit of higher volume and productivity initiatives more than offset higher employee-related expenses.","Sales in our other specialty converting businesses grew 15%, with DES being the primary driver. And adjusted operating margin improved by more than 12 points to 6.4%, due primarily to the higher volume.","In May of last year, we established long-term targets for the company and the operating segments, as shown on Slides 12 and 13. These targets represent a balance of aspiration and pragmatism, and we are committed to delivering them. As I said earlier, we achieved the targets for the company in 2012.","Moving onto the outlook for 2013. We expect adjusted 2013 earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.40 to $2.80 and free cash flow from continuing operations of $275 million to $325 million.","This guidance is based on a number of assumptions, including the key listed factors.","To comment on a few. Our estimate for organic sales growth in 2013 is 1% to 4%. This reflects our business in the U.S. being flat to up 2%; Western Europe, flat to down 2%; and emerging markets, up 5% to 7%. Obviously, the macro environment remains uncertain and we continue to have limited forward visibility.","Based on recent exchange rates, currency translation is expected to have a modest benefit to reported sales growth and EBIT. We expect to realize an incremental pretax benefit of approximately $70 million from our restructuring program.","The minimum pension requirement for 2013 is $60 million. In addition to the required minimum, we anticipate using a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of OCP and DES to make an additional pension contribution. Any such additional pension contribution is excluded from our definition of free cash flow, and therefore, not reflected in our guidance.","Average fully diluted shares outstanding for 2013 are assumed to be approximately $100 million.","And it is important to note that our guidance includes the anticipated operating results of DES in continuing operations and excludes the effect on the share count of any share repurchases made with the net proceeds from the divestitures.","So in summary, the fourth quarter represented a strong finish to a solid year in which we delivered full year organic growth of 4% and adjusted EPS growth of 20%. With the sale of OCP and DES, we've increased the focus of the company. Our 2 core businesses are market leaders and are well positioned for profitable growth and increasing returns. Our cost reduction program to save more than $100 million is on track and positions us for strong earnings growth in 2013. And our continued cost and capital discipline enable us to maintain our financial strength and return more cash to shareholders, all of which demonstrate our commitment to delivering on our long-term targets, including our expectation of adjusted EPS growth of 15% to 35% in 2013.","I would be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question, from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess, first question I had, to the extent that you have visibility into this, you're not the only company that we've talked with during earnings season thus far that said they saw a pickup in November and December. What are your customers, to the extent that they have visibility, relating this pickup to? And then I had a couple of follow-ons.","Dean A. Scarborough","Yes, George. I'd start first with Retail Branding and Information Solutions. We had a very strong quarter, especially the back couple of months. I attribute it to basically, retailer confidence about the spring season as well. So we have a good market and as well as we were taking some market share, as well as strong RFID rollout. All those were factors. So it was nice to see, frankly. And I think for Materials, fundamentally, the business, it grew about the same in the fourth quarter as it did in the third quarter, overall. It's very, very close. I don't sense there was any -- anything abnormal about the fact that November and December were a little stronger. I really can't attribute it to anything specific.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. But on RBIS, the implication would be that your customers are feeling a little bit better about consumer confidence and consumer's willingness to spend back in -- well, in the upcoming springtime season, that's the conclusion.","Dean A. Scarborough","Definitely. Unit costs for apparel are down and so retailers buy on dollars, not necessarily units. And obviously, they do on both. So they're bringing in more units than they did last year.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Second question I had, just -- you mentioned it, so it's worth questioning. The retailer who was driving RFID within their organization, and then has now decided to decelerate some. To the extent that you can comment for them, which, in this kind of forum, what was behind that? And then I had a question on Vancive in terms of how you're going to manage that business on a going-forward basis, whether it's core or not.","Dean A. Scarborough","Yes. So on the RFID business, actually, this is fairly typical when we do retailer rollouts. Retailers will sample a few categories. They'll expand into new categories. Sometimes they'll eliminate the program in other categories. It really depends on what their expectations are. I'll just tell you from our own kind of forecast for the year, some of this was anticipated. And we still expect to have year-over-year growth in 2013 because we have a number of new programs that are scaling up. So I wouldn't read much into that. It'll be -- it should be okay. As far as Vancive Medical Technologies, fundamentally, this is a carve-out of a business we've had in our Performance Tapes for a number of years. It's a medical wound care product category where we use a lot of our adhesive technology to -- in which we launched a lot of new products here. So I would characterize this business as a very small growth platform at this point. It's under $100 million in sales. We've been investing in the business, have a lot of new product launches that should start to come to fruition in 2013. So I would just say it's a nice, solid adjacency to our core Materials businesses that we've carved out and are just managing a little bit differently.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Looking at the EPS range for '13, $2.40 to $2.80, is it just volumes that is the main variable between the low end and the high end? And how should we think about raw material inflation, particularly for the first quarter, given the sequence of price increases in the resin complex?","Mitchell R. Butier","So as far as the range, volume is obviously a key factor in the move between $2.40 and $2.80. Also, it is just what the trends are around -- within that volume, if we prefer to break it down, which categories we see the most growth in. So as you've -- we've talked about the last 2 quarters, we've had higher-than-average growth in some lower-margin categories, in Pressure Sensitive, so it would just depend on the product mix within next year as well. As far as the raw material costs, we -- there's been some movement in a couple of categories. But overall, relatively modest. We're working to manage it. We don't have any significant change as far as the net impact between price and raw material costs baked into our guidance for '13 versus '12.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Then, Dean, I think last quarter, you mentioned some share gains in RBIS. Was that -- did that accelerate in 4Q or is it pretty steady in terms of the run rate and most of the improvement was just the improvement at the end market level?","Dean A. Scarborough","We don't -- in the third quarter, I would say, based on the data we had, I'm confident in saying we did have some share gain. We don't have all the import data yet for Q4, so it's hard to really ascertain. I would say, for sure it's a combination of better market growth as well as RFID. It's too early to say if our share gain accelerated in the quarter or not. I do think we took some share. It's hard to nail that down.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, and then just one final one on the DES sale. So post the sale, you're already doing a pretty broad-based cost reduction program. Is there more to do after the DES sale?","Dean A. Scarborough","No. I said DES is a relatively small part of the business, so I never say no to, is there other productivity that we could take. But there's nothing significant planned at this point.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays Capital.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just looking at the long-term operating margin targets, you mentioned you took those up a little bit due to the change in how you allocate corporate expense. I just would have thought, especially with RBIS, there might have been some impact for moving the RFID inlay business into this segment, maybe pushing the margins down a little bit. Is that the case? Is that the way we should think about that? And then, on the PSM business, any impact from the move there?","Dean A. Scarborough","I'd say for RFID, is now solidly profitable, so really no fundamental change in the margin target. It's still relative -- it's still small also relative to the size of RBIS. And I make the same comment in -- by moving Performance Tapes into Pressure-sensitive Materials. That business is -- operates at above the cost of capital. It's a good business, et cetera, et cetera. So no major shifts.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And as you roll out RFID to new customers, is there a significant equipment component of the sale process, or is that something you rely on outside partners for? How does that sort of work into the outlook?","Dean A. Scarborough","Yes. There is some equipment, but we're basically 90% consumables. It's all about the tags and the labels we sell, so it's relatively minor, Scott.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Just lastly on your returning capital to all your stakeholders. Has anything changed in the quarter around the desire to sort of improve your debt rating outlook so that you're comfortably in high yield -- I mean, a high grade credit versus returning share -- cash to shareholders?","Mitchell R. Butier","Nothing's improved in the quarter. As far as our overall intent and objectives, we said we want to have a strong balance sheet, good financial health and that's very consistent. We continue to improve our ratios modestly over time. We -- one thing, when we talk about our financial ratios, we talk about simple net debt-to-EBITDA. Obviously, that's a proxy for our total leverage, which includes the pension. And so when we divest these businesses, the way we're going to de-lever is by topping up the pension.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of John McNulty with Credit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. When you had launched the restructuring program, it sounded like a lot of it was to help combat what you were seeing in terms of inflation in some of the emerging markets, as well as some of even your core markets. I guess, what I'm wondering is on the $70 million of incremental saves that you expect this year, how much of that do you expect to be offset by that inflation? Has it -- and has that directionally improved or worsened relative to kind of where we were last year when you launched the program?","Dean A. Scarborough","Yes, John. I think the notion of inflation really impacts RBIS, because we have a lot of employees in developing markets that have a high inflation rate. So the answer to the question depends a lot on volumes. So we need about 1.5% growth in RBIS to offset the inflation factor, so -- then our incremental margin accretion happens after that, about 1.5% growth factor. So it's really an RBIS issue, it's not a total company issue.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then on the RFID growth, I know you said it was -- it would probably be a little bit more moderate this year because of one of the big customers, I guess, is slowing up their program. But you had 60% growth, like can you maybe bracket what you think is more moderate for this year? How should we be thinking about that business given that it's kind of reached a tipping point in terms of size?","Dean A. Scarborough","Oh, gosh. That's the $64,000 question. I'd say in the 10% to 30% range.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, okay. Fair enough. And then in terms of the platform and how we think about RFID, when you get new adopters of it in terms of stores, chains, what have you, is there a big initial inventory pickup just to kind of build inventory so there is -- just because they're starting the platform, or is it really just kind of on an as-needed kind of type of pull. How should we think about how that ramps up?","Dean A. Scarborough","So the way retailers do this is that they start asking their vendors to tag new items that are going into the stores with RFID rather than doing some -- in the test, a lot of times it's done in the retailers' DCs, but they quickly shift to having vendors do it. So what they do is phase it in as new products come into the store. That's typically the way it's managed. So for us, it doesn't require a lot of inventory build. It does sometimes put a little bit of strain on our capacity. But we manage through that quite well, I think.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan Securities.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","In your other current liabilities, sequentially it went up about $34 million. What was that? And is that something that comes down in the first quarter of 2013?","Mitchell R. Butier","So there's a few things hitting the other accrued liabilities. You have your rebate accruals, which tend to build up throughout the year; variable compensations, so annual bonus, which tends to build throughout the year. You also have the impact of currency. The currency rate for the euro went up within the quarter as well, so a number things. So to answer your question, it's a number of factors building it, the first 2 factors I mentioned would have it come back down again in the first quarter. If you recall, Jeff, our cash flow is rather seasonal. Q1 is the lowest, it's actually negative. One, that's because we're building working capital, traditionally for OCP, but also for RBIS, but it's also when we pay out bonuses and pay out some rebates.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And I don't mean to ask a na\u00efve question, but you put the RFID inlay manufacturing into RBIS and you've described the business, I think, as $100 million business-or-so, a run rate of. But there's not really very much pro forma sales change between the previous RBIS numbers and the current RBIS numbers?","Mitchell R. Butier","Yes. That's because most of the RFID sales, the one vertical that was really taking off, was in apparel, so through the RBIS channel. So RBIS was procuring all the RFID inlays from our RFID division. So that's one of the reasons we've integrated it, just because that's the biggest vertical that's taking off, just to streamline the operations.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So that would mean -- so that's why it's a relatively small revenue change?","Mitchell R. Butier","It's small in the revenue and you'll see a bigger impact on the margins.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, your volume growth was pretty strong for the quarter and sometimes you're inclined to say that your businesses are a leading indicator. But at the same time, you wish to be conservative for various reasons for 2013. But if you put conservatism aside, and you just look at the tenor of business of the fourth quarter and tenor of business as we go into 2013, say, for the first quarter, when you look at your data, are your business trends similar to the fourth quarter or have they slowed down? And I realize it's early in the quarter.","Dean A. Scarborough","I'd say, Jeff, I remember 2011, we were coming off a strong year. In 2010, we were pretty bullish. We had a good first quarter. And then the bottom fell out of all of our businesses in the second quarter because we don't have that visibility. So I think we are a little bit conservative. January, it's been strong so far. But here again, here's one reason why: And simply, that Chinese New Year was in week 4 of last year, so it was in January. And this year it's in week 7, so it's in February. So we expect to have a strong January. February will be weaker than last year because of Chinese New Year and then we won't really understand where the trends are until a couple of weeks after that. So it's really difficult to predict based on the first 4 weeks of the year.","Mitchell R. Butier","And just to add a little bit to that, if you look, pulling China aside, so far what we're seeing is North America up somewhat and Europe actually down. So that's consistent with our full year guidance. That's when I gave the regional outlook as well. And one thing, when you look, it's important to remember core growth. We did say that change in our fiscal year end added about 1 point of growth. So if you adjust for that, our core growth was relatively consistent for the whole quarter, with Q3.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And when you get your $400 million in net proceeds, will all of that be consumed by share repurchase and pension pay down?","Mitchell R. Butier","Primarily, so that's where the 2 primary areas of focus will be. We have -- we know how much we want to de-lever and then we are going to make the final determination about how much exactly the pension versus reported.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of Todd Wenning with Morningstar.","Todd Wenning - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Looking back, you made some opportunistic share repurchases in the first 3 quarters of 2012, but your buyback activity trailed off in the fourth quarter, sort of concurrent with the higher share price. With your stock now having made a really nice run in the recent past months, what effect will that have on your strategy going into 2013?","Dean A. Scarborough","Yes, Todd. We don't comment on the timing of share repurchases.","Todd Wenning - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","But in the sense of, are you looking at it from a valuation perspective, or can you give any color there?","Mitchell R. Butier","Yes, so as we've said before, so we don't comment on the timing or amount of share repurchases, but we look at a number of factors when evaluating the pace and speed with which we repurchase. So one is the timing of free cash flow. One is also just the intrinsic value of the stock relative to where it's trading and including recent trends, as well as just looking at the other uses of capital, looking at what the dividend yield is that we have to pay versus cost of debt and so forth. So that's the overall assumption. As you can see, our average share count for the year implies a degree of share repurchases.","Todd Wenning - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Great. And so what's your take on where the North American PSM industry stands in terms of capacity and how could that -- might that affect pricing going into the new year?","Dean A. Scarborough","There really haven't been any substantial additions to capacity in the market. There was growth in the market last year, so I think it's fundamentally no different in 2013 than it was in 2012.","Todd Wenning - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And do you have an outlook for R&D spending in 2013?","Dean A. Scarborough","Nothing specific, I'd say. As you know, we sort of had 2 vectors here. One vector is we closed our corporate research center. We're moving some activities into the businesses. And the other -- and so I would say in the U.S., we're probably -- that number will be down year-over-year, but we're expanding in China and India. So I'm not sure how it nets up. It won't be a material difference in our R&D spending year-over-year.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question is from the line of Glenn Primack with PEAK.","Glenn Primack","In RBIS, is there room to continue to add the digital printers? And then can you remind us what the return -- the payback is on one of those when you put it in your system? And then, also on RBIS, have you been successful at all at solution selling?","Dean A. Scarborough","Yes. So do we have room for more digital presses? Yes, in fact, we're buying more now and putting them in our operations. They actually take up a lot less room than the offset presses they're replacing. So it's, actually digital printing is one of the things that allows us to help us reduce the overall footprint that we have in Retail Branding and Information Solutions. We get good payback from the investment in digital printing. I don't really want to comment on an amount. It's -- but it's pretty good. I'm sorry, you had a third question there, which I've forgotten.","Glenn Primack","Solution selling within RBIS, have you been able to do that with the customer on the total...","Dean A. Scarborough","I'm really pleased with the progress of our commercial teams in Retail Branding and Information Solutions. I'd say, 5 years ago, we were primarily talking to, what's known as a trim buyer in the apparel companies or the retailers, just really talking about tickets, tags and labels. And now, we are talking to CEOs or CIOs about how we can help them manage their inventories and help improve their gross profit through a wide range of solutions ranging from RFID to price markdown implementation in the stores to more effective heat transfer labeling in factories. So it is quite different. We're still in the early stages, so we have a long way to go. But I'm very, very pleased with our progress.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a follow-up on the question on RBIS. You referenced retailer confidence ticking up. But I think in previous quarters, when you've seen a little bit better growth, you've indicated retailers are still keeping inventory ratios very tight and want to keep the inventories lean. Are you seeing or did you see in the fourth quarter any kind of really inventory restocking effects or is the strength that you saw in the quarter really just better volumes and some share gain?","Dean A. Scarborough","Well, it could be, inventory-to-sales ratio, we track that pretty closely, has remained pretty much in the same range it has for the last 18 months, so it hasn't changed much. The retailers are keeping inventories low. I do think we get a benefit from lower unit costs from apparel right now. So it tends to be a few more units. And the focus on retailers to keep inventory down actually helps us in the sense that RFID is essentially an inventory control solution, for example, and the fact that we can respond very, very quickly to retailers for restocking also helps us gain share. So the trend, in fact, I think really helps our overall business. There is still some uncertainty in the market. I mean, we grew in Europe from European retailers and brands, the last couple of quarters and I'm still a bit nervous of what's going to happen over there. So it's still early in the year yet.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then your 2013 CapEx guidance is ratcheted up a bit from 2012. Can you just walk us through what portion is kind of growth versus maintenance and maybe what businesses are getting the biggest incremental investment?","Mitchell R. Butier","The ratio is still roughly the same, as we've said before. So it's about 1\/3 growth, principally being in emerging markets, capital requirements; 1\/3 maintenance for mature markets; and 1\/3 IT.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","In terms of emerging market margins for Pressure-sensitive Materials, while you can't get into the specifics perhaps, can you tell us what the trend has been over the last year to 2 years? Have you been able to maintain the margin that you've had in that business? And what's the outlook to the extent that you can comment in 2013? And then I have a housekeeping question.","Dean A. Scarborough","So George, emerging market margins for Pressure-sensitive Materials are still above average. We have changed our strategy a bit in emerging markets in that we are going after business in some lower-margin, but still very profitable categories. So we're kind of accelerating growth, taking a little more market share, but still, the overall margins and returns are still above the average.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just why the shift in the strategy, Dean? What's behind that?","Dean A. Scarborough","I think a lot of it has to do with making sure that you don't allow your competitors to gain a foothold in kind of lower-priced, easier-to-make products and then kind of try to work their way up the chain. We've established very strong, competitive positions, especially in higher value-added products like film and durable goods. And I think as we talked about how we want to behave in those markets, there is clearly an opportunity for us to grow faster than the market. And it's profitable and it's simply just a, I'd say, a minor shift in our mindset.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. The housekeeping question, maybe you'd mentioned this before and I had missed it. If so, I apologize. What's the logic for keeping DES in your guidance for the time being? It's obviously not going to be that large in terms of EBIT, just looking at the other specialty converting EBIT. But I was wondering, what was behind that? And then, once that ultimately leaves or maybe even before then, why wouldn't you put Vancive in Pressure-sensitive Materials since you put other specialty tapes in there as well? I realized it's a health care-bent company or business, but nonetheless, it would seem like it would be more PSM than stand-alone, especially when it gets to that size in the segment.","Dean A. Scarborough","Okay, George, the DES, I think we're trying to be consistent here with the accounting. So DES technically can't be moved into disc ops until after the first quarter has gone by. And we're likely to keep that business in -- it's going to be in the company for a couple of quarters. And so, we wanted the comps to 2012 to be easier to do. Also, the share count excludes buyback from the sale as well. So when we upgrade the guidance, when we move DES into disc ops, we'll also likely make some comments about share count, et cetera. So we're trying to be relatively consistent there. The question on segment reporting and Vancive is an interesting one, because it's actually a very technical question and there's a lot of accounting, et cetera, et cetera. Fundamentally, we believe that business is sufficiently different enough from Materials that it needs to report in the Other segment. It also reports directly to me. It does not report into the leader of our Materials business, and that is one major factor in why you have to report it in one segment or another.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. But we should view Vancive as, it's nonetheless small, a core business for you?","Dean A. Scarborough","It is. I feel it's a core business and it has opportunity for growth. We're making investments in the business, and it's a nice business with some great growth potential.","Operator","Our next follow-up question is from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays Capital.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just 2 follow-ups on RBIS and then one additional question. So just on RBIS, I think you mentioned you thought there was improved demand from U.S. and European retailers in the quarter. I just want to maybe flesh that out. How much of that is underlying demand improvement versus the lower cotton prices that we talked about? And then as we roll that into 2013, how much of the guidance is predicated on increased unit volume from lower cotton prices?","Dean A. Scarborough","Yes, that's -- Scott, that's a really tough question to tease out, of how much is related to lower cotton prices versus confidence. I mean, it's an impossible number to derive. Here's the way we look at it. I think we didn't really see the benefit of lower apparel prices till the back half of the year. So my perspective is the comps will be relatively easier in the first half of 2013 and maybe slightly more difficult in the back half of 2013.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And the ordering that your company -- your customers are doing now, are they are still buying for spring?","Dean A. Scarborough","It's for the spring season. So the orders that we've taken, mainly in the fourth quarter, is really all about spring and summer.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","But I mean, the orders in the first quarter, are those for spring as well or is that...","Dean A. Scarborough","So in March, April, we'll start to see some fall merchandise hit our order books.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And Dean, you mentioned the change in the compensation structure, in particular, with the head of the segments now more directly tied to your communications with the Street. Can you be a little bit more specific on that, how their compensation structure has actually changed?","Dean A. Scarborough","So the actual way they're compensated hasn't changed. But fundamentally, we had always held the businesses accountable for a set of EBIT targets. And those EBIT targets were less than what we reported externally. And so the businesses, I guess, didn't feel accountable for certain costs that were allocated to the businesses. So we decided to change that. And now there's -- I can tell you, the business heads pay a heck of a lot more attention to services they buy from the center or other cost allocations. And part of the restructuring plan was the businesses saying, \"I don't really want this service,\" or \"I want it at a lower level.\" And as a way to better prioritize around the specific needs of the business, rather than trying to do it at an average in the corporate center. So I think it's driven better prioritization and better decision-making, especially given the fact that RBIS and Materials are such different businesses at different -- they sell them to different markets, different competitive dynamics, and therefore, have different priorities. So I actually think this is a much better methodology of prioritizing investments in our business.","Okay. Well, I guess there are no other questions. Just to sum up, we're very pleased to announce the deal for Office and Consumer Products and Designed and Engineered Solutions this morning. We'll work with CCL to plan the transition and complete the transaction as quickly as possible. Last May, we set out our long-term goals for you and committed to focusing the company to ensure we can deliver on them. We accomplished a great deal of that work in 2012. Our employees did a remarkable job of serving customers and improving quality and service while executing our restructuring plans, and I want to thank them for their efforts and their dedication. But while we're pleased with the progress we made so far, we know we have more to do and we're focused 100% on completing the restructuring and delivering another year of double-digit earnings growth and strong free cash flow.

The conference ID number is 21734745.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Cyndy Guenther, Avery Dennison's Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. You may begin ma\u2019am.","Cyndy Guenther","Thank you, Frans. Welcome everyone. I\u2019m happy to be back supporting shareholders as the Head of Investor Relations. Today, we\u2019ll discuss our preliminary unaudited first quarter results. The non-GAAP financial measures that we use are defined qualified and reconciled with GAAP on schedules A-2 to A-4 of the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release.","We remind you that we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. These forward-looking statements are made subject to the Safe Harbor statements included in today's earnings release.","On the call today are Dean Scarborough, Chairman and CEO; Mitch Butier, President and COO; and Anne Bramman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Dean.","Dean Scarborough","Thanks Cyndy and good day everyone. We\u2019re happy to have Cyndy back as the IR lead and I\u2019m certain that she will serve all of us very well. I\u2019m also very pleased to introduce you to our new Chief Financial Officer Anne Bramman. Anne started five weeks ago joining us from Carnival Cruise Line where she served as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Anne has extensive experience overseeing the finance functions of market leading companies with complex global operations, including Carnival and specialty retailer L Brands. Anne is an outstanding to the corporate leadership team and I know you will enjoy getting to know her and benefitting from her insights. I\u2019ve also asked Mitch to join us today to participate in Q&A.","Besides the earnings announcement today, I hope you took note of another significant announcement concerning the organization. The board recently approved the appointment of George Gravanis for the role of President, Materials Group effective May 1. George has been a driving force in the growth and global expansion of our materials businesses and he joined the company 12 years ago. He played a key role in unifying our market presence in Europe and has been instrumental in our successful penetration of the Asia-Pacific region. Throughout his carrier with us, George has demonstrated a remarkable ability to inspire his team and drive strong business results.","Now, turning to Q1 results, I\u2019m very pleased to report a good start to the year. We beat our expectations for Q1 adjusted EPS by about a nickel, reflecting solid organic sales growth in pressure sensitive materials and strong sequential improvement for retail branding and information solutions. We also delivered significant margin expansion through productivity gains, higher volume, and improved product mix.","I\u2019m also happy to report that free cash flow improved nicely in the quarter, up nearly $140 million, compared to the first quarter of last year. You will recall that we did expect a meaningful shift of cash from the fourth quarter of 2014 into the first quarter of this year, as we took actions to reduce the volatility associated with year-end changes in working capital. That strategy has played out as anticipated and we continue to look forward to solid free cash flow for the full year with quarterly results more closely reflecting the underlying seasonality of our business. And we continue to expect to return the vast majority of that annual free cash flow to shareholders.","We return $66 million to shareholder via share repurchases and dividends in the quarter. And earlier this month, the board approved that 6% increase in the quarterly dividend consistent with our earnings growth last year. And of course, we still have over $500 million authorized under our share repurchase program. As you know, we are laser focused on achieving our long-term financial goals, both the full year commitments we set through the end of this year and our new targets through 2018.","We said in last quarter\u2019s call that we were making some mid-course corrections to our strategies to insure that we achieve those targets. I\u2019m happy to report that we\u2019re already seeing some benefits on those actions as we strengthened the long-term competitive positions of all of our segments. One key course correction was rebalancing the price, volume, and mix dynamics in pressure sensitive materials.","We had already begun to see some progress on that front in the fourth quarter. And I\u2019m pleased to say that we delivered further improvement in the first quarter with favorable product mix contributing significantly to PSM\u2019s margin expansion in the quarter. The other key course correction was to accelerate profitable growth in the less differentiated segments of both PSM and RBIS markets. Seeing some top line challenges in the back half of 2014, along with the negative translation effects of the stronger dollar, we intensified our efforts to identify accelerate and execute new restructuring actions.","Again, this productivity focus is not just about lowering costs and expanding margins, which are crucial, but also about becoming more competitive so we can grow profitably and win in the more challenging segments of our markets. We made significant progress on this front as well, which is reflected in the increase to our projected restructuring charges and associated savings for the year.","Looking briefly at the segments, pressure sensitive materials had a great quarter, with roughly 4% organic growth and record operating margins in the segment. Organic growth was solid across most regions. As I mentioned, favorable product mix had a significant impact on earnings growth and operating margin in Q1, as our strategy to accelerate growth in higher value segments delivered. We grew faster than average in the films category within label and packaging materials, including durables and specialty applications, as well as with higher value segments within graphics and performance tapes.","Productivity improvement also contributed to the record operating margin for PSM, primarily through ongoing efforts to engineer reductions and material cost, as well as through restructuring initiatives. While we get benefit from raw material deflation in Q1, these savings were more than offset by the carry over effects of prior year pricing adjustments.","As I mentioned at the start, retail branding and information solutions delivered strong sequential improvement in organic sales growth. The priorities for the RBIS segment are clear. First, accelerating top line sales growth for the core business. To that end the performance segment continues to perform well, delivering double digit organic growth in the first quarter. You may recall that we paid some pretty tough comps in the fourth quarter over last year, but this segment has been a consistent source of strength for us.","Our biggest challenge last year was in a less differentiated segments of the market, particularly within value and contemporary. Sales in these segments were still down modestly year-on-year in Q1, but the team has made good progress gaining share in several key accounts. In particular, the team serving factories in North Asia and especially China delivered solid growth reversing last year\u2019s challenging trend there.","Another key priority for RBIS is to capture the above average long-term growth potential in embellishments and RFID. We continue to see strong profitable growth from embellishments, leveraging our proprietary heat transfer technology.","Now, sales for RFID products declined in the first quarter versus prior year as we expected due to reduced demand from a couple of large European accounts. But the existing pipeline of activity remains very strong and I\u2019m confident we will see our return to strong growth for RFID in the back half of this year and beyond. That confidence was reinforced by the feedback I received from multiple customers at the recent RFID Live tradeshow in San Diego where the question of retailer ROI wasn\u2019t even a topic of discussion anymore.","Another key priority for RBIS is of course margin expansion through further streamlining of S&A and rationalizing our manufacturing footprint. With the aggressive restructuring and other productivity actions underway, we expect RBIS to return to the margin expansion trajectory necessary to achieve our 2018 financial goals.","In terms of the company\u2019s overall outlook for 2015, we\u2019ve raised our adjusted EPS guidance by a $0.05, as we believe the execution of our strategies will more than offset the incremental pressure we\u2019ve seen on the stronger dollar.","Now, I will turn the call over to Anne.","Anne Bramman","Thanks, Dean, and hello, everyone. I\u2019m very pleased to join the Avery Dennison team. There were many compelling reasons for me to make this move. I\u2019ve enjoyed working for companies with leading market positions still Avery Dennison was obviously attractive from that perspective. And it\u2019s very exciting to join a team with a proven track record for innovation and execution. I\u2019m obviously transitioning to a new space both in terms of industry and B2B focus; I look forward to bringing a different perspective to the team as I ramp up.","Now adding to Dean\u2019s commentary, I will provide a little more color on the quarter. In Q1, the company delivered a 25% increase in adjusted earnings per share on 3% organic sales growth. Currency translation and the effect of the extra week in the prior year had material impacts on reported sales growth and earnings. Currency translation reduced reported sales by 7.2% in the first quarter with an approximately $0.08 impact to EPS. The effect of the extra week in Q4 added an estimated 3 points to reported growth for Q1, which was worth roughly a $0.05 in terms of EPS.","Adjusted operating margin in the first quarter improved 130 basis points to 8.4% as the benefit of productivity initiatives, higher volume, and improved product mix more than offset higher employee related costs. The company realized about $10 million of incremental savings from restructuring costs net of transition expenses.","The adjusted tax rate was 34% consistent with the anticipated full-year tax rate in low to mid 30% range. Free cash flow was a negative $16 million, an improvement of $139 million compared to Q1 of last year. As Dean mentioned, a good portion of that claim was expected following the actions taken in 2014 to reduce the volatility associated with year-end changes in working capital.","The company repurchased approximately 600,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $34 million and paid $32 million in dividends. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders and have sufficient capacity to continue our share buyback program in a disciplined manner.","Now looking at the segments. Pressure-sensitive Materials sales were up approximately 4% on an organic basis; Label and Packaging Materials sales were up low-single digits; while combined sales for Performance Tapes and Graphics were up mid-single digits.","On a regional basis, the pace of organic growth in both North America and Western Europe improved sequentially with North America up low-single digits and Western Europe growing mid-single digits. Organic growth from emerging regions was relatively low in Q1, up low-single digits due to continued softness in China and a significant decline in Russia offsetting continued strong growth in the Asian regions, India and Korea.","PSM\u2019s adjusted operating margin of 11.5% was up 160 basis points compared to last year as the benefits from favorable product mix and higher volume combined with productivity more than offset higher employee related costs.","Turning to Retail Branding and Information Solutions sales were up approximately 2% on organic basis and adjusted operating margin expanded by 60 basis points. In terms of the top line performance, Dean discussed the solid progress the team has made in improving the challenging trends in the value and contemporary segments of the market, as well as the continued strong performance in the form of segments.","Adjusted operating margin improved 60 basis points in Q1 as the benefit of productivity initiatives and higher volume more than offset higher employee related costs. As Dean mentioned, we expect increased margin expansion over the balance of the year as the team executes an aggressive set of restructuring and other productivity improvement initiatives while gaining leverage from higher volume. Sales in Vancive Medical Technologies achieving a positive contribution to earnings by year end.","Turning now to the outlook of the balance of the year, we have raised our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.45, reflecting the roughly $0.05 nickel beat to our expectations for Q1.","We outlined some of the key contributing factors to the guidance on slide eight of our supplemental presentation materials. Note that three of the assumptions underlying our original guidance have changed and we have reflected those changes in our new outlook. Specifically, for the full-year, at recent exchange rates, we estimate that currency translation will reduce net sales by approximately 8.5% and pretax earnings by roughly $50 million or an estimated $0.35 per share.","Combining carryover benefits from 2014 with new actions taken this year, we now estimate that restructuring initiatives will contribute roughly $70 million plus pretax or about $0.50 plus per share. Consistent with the increase and anticipated restructuring savings, we have raised our estimate for cash restructuring charges to $15 million pretax. Combined with other items, this raises our estimate for pro forma adjustment to GAAP earnings from $0.25 per share to $0.40 per share. As you can see, the rest of our key assumptions remain unchanged from what we shared last quarter.","So, overall, we delivered a good first quarter. Our two market leading core businesses are well positioned for profitable growth, which combined with our continued focus on productivity and capital discipline will enable us to expand margins and increase returns and achieve our 2015 and 2018 targets.","Now I will open the call up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W Baird. Please go ahead.","Ghansham Panjabi","Hey, guys, good morning. And Anne and Cyndy, welcome.","Anne Bramman","Thank you.","Cyndy Guenther","Thank you.","Ghansham Panjabi","First off on Europe and the increase in PSM growth there, but I think you said mid-single digits in Western Europe. Do you think that\u2019s in line with the market or a function of share gains? And also, what are you generally seeing in the macro in Europe across both businesses?","Dean Scarborough","Mitch, why don\u2019t you take that?","Mitch Butier","Yeah, so, broadly speaking, I think we\u2019ve been telling that for a while that Europe has actually been coming in stronger than we had been anticipating based on the macro. But there is a big difference here between Eastern and Western Europe. Western Europe is actually showing really strong growth overall. I think if you look at some of the macro indicators as well, the consumer confidence and so forth, it\u2019s showing positive performance in Western Europe, so we are seeing all that. Eastern Europe is different, particularly Russia. We\u2019ve seen a significant drop-off in Russia, part of that is market and part of that is share, to be quite honest. Because we source Russia from Europe, so our cost base is in euros and it\u2019s getting more challenging to get into Russia from that perspective.","So, overall, Europe is on the West very strong, East is a little bit weaker. We continue to be pleased with the performance and the team continue to do a great job of driving growth in the high profit segments, and we continue to still more discipline in lower profit segments.","Dean Scarborough","I think Ghansham from an overall perspective including RBIS, what we see there \u2013 we have some pretty tough comps from Europe. As you recall there, we\u2019re going in the kind of double digit category for a number of quarters. The couple of our big retail customers have been reducing inventories over the last couple of quarters and that\u2019s put a little bit of pressure. So I would say that, that would be a slightly more negative outlook on Europe from RBIS, but we are hopeful that as the year progresses and the European economies get a little more solid that we will see some of the benefit there.","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay that\u2019s helpful. And that the upside in cost savings for 2015, does that come to some extent from 2016 as a pull forward or is that actual cost savings from something new you found for this year?","Dean Scarborough","These are incremental actions from what we got previously.","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay, but doesn\u2019t change anything in terms of 2016?","Dean Scarborough","No, we haven\u2019t provided guidance on 2016. So..","Mitch Butier","So definitely there is some carryover into 2016.","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay, alright. And then just finally on the margins for PSM in the first quarter I think at 11.5%, I think that\u2019s a record if I am not mistaken. How much of that was boosted by any one-offs such as lower raw material cost or anything else that may not recur as you kind of think about next year for example. Thanks so much.","Mitch Butier","As far as one-offs, there aren\u2019t any one-off benefits that you see coming through within the quarter. It is above the high end of our targeted range that we\u2019ve laid out and we still - when we laid out those long term target of 10% to 11%, we said we are targeting 11% because that level of this business is a very high returns business and we are focusing on achieving 4% to 5% organic growth rate. So no big benefits from that perspective as far as your question of other one-offs related to deflation, we have seen some deflation as Anne and Dean spoke to, but it\u2019s been offset by the pricing that we have seen primarily carryover pricing from last year.","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may begin sir.","George Staphos","Hi everyone, good morning. Welcome back Cindy, welcome and look forward to working with you. I guess couple of questions, first, on RBIS, if we go back and we\u2019ve asked the question I guess in the past as well, 10 plus years RBIS or [indiscernible] has been a source of continual restructuring. What makes you feel at this juncture that this level of action or the actions that you are taking really put the business on a much more profitable, much more sustainably profitable footing for the future. And then I have some follow-ons.","Dean Scarborough","Yeah, George it\u2019s a good question. I think if you look back kind of at the bottom mostly 2009, we made significant improvements and the returns of this business are roughly at an average of 100 basis points per year. I think the team has done a nice job reducing cost and improving service, improving our competitive position and I think the go forward plan would be continued focus on both delivering a balanced strategy which is decent top line growth 4% to 5%, which we think is doable given the market and also continuing to drive a lot of productivity. So we slipped off the track a little bit last year, we did expand margins last year despite the soft top line and \u2013 but what I see is a business definitely recovering here.","And since we want to go back to age-old stories, I have to say RFID if I ever seen a turning point, it\u2019s been these last few months talking to retailers in the U.S. At this trade show a couple of weeks ago, it was all about \u2013 it wasn\u2019t about is the payback \u2013 it was all about when and how they are going to implement this important technology. So I really see this as a definite upside for us over the next few years.","George Staphos","Okay. I want to get to RFID in a minute, but just back to RBIS, you\u2019ve seen the margin improvement and that\u2019s good but it has required continual restructuring. And so do you think that you can get your 100 basis points of margin improvement to get to your goals by 2018, 2019 without further restructuring.","And then on RFID, if you can take us through the backlog in terms of why you think business picks up in the second half of the year, what\u2019s the timeframe and what is the typical process for a retailing customer? Do they say, yes, we agree this is a fantastic thing and we contract with Avery Dennison for couple of stores and it takes a couple of quarters to low those stores and implement RFID. Can you give us a bit more detail around that? Thanks guys and I will turn it over at that point.","Mitch Butier","Sure, George. So on your first question, yes, we are confident where we\u2019re going to be able to meet our 2018 objectives for this business both in terms of growth and margin expansion. To achieve those objectives and you are focusing in on margins, we do need a balanced strategy as Dean said which we do have of growth and productivity. This business has high I variable margins and also has a pretty high level of wage inflation every year. So we need a few points of growth every year to be able to maintain and expand margins there and then drive the productivity that we talk through.","In order to achieve the 2018 targets, what we laid out, we actually knew we\u2019ll be continuing the restructuring within RBIS. And we will continue to restructure this business every year to continue to find opportunities to reduce cost. So the balanced strategy, nothing shifted on that front and we\u2019re going to continue to execute that.","I think one thing we did say we are making adjustments is making sure we are streamline our sales and customer service organizations to focus on some of the lower value segment if you will and we\u2019ve seen good progress on that as you can see in the growth rate here in Q1. And particularly focused on the apparel batteries in China and North China. That\u2019s where we\u2019ve seen good progress as well. So yes is a short answer, but we are confident that we are going to 2018 target, but \u2013 yes, it requires further productivity as well as growth across all segments.","George Staphos","Thanks. So I\u2019d mention on the FRID.","Mitch Butier","Yeah, it\u2019s interesting because I would say first of all most companies were taking longer time scalping up. They do 25 or 30 stores, whey would go the results. Then they would expand it to 100 or 150 [indiscernible] and then they ramp up. And I would say the cycle can last anywhere from 18 months to 36 months. This difference for me here was that retailers understand that to compete in an Omni channel environment. In other words, the ability for customers to operate both online and get products shipped to them or pick up products at the store. Inventory accuracy is fundamental to that strategy and RFID is the easiest way for them to achieve that.","So what we\u2019ve seen is the retailer now basically \u2013 their senior management is saying, we don\u2019t need to go through a second phase of test. We get the benefits, we saw it in the pilot, now it\u2019s rolling out more effectively. So the pipeline of activity is quite substantial. Now that being said, it\u2019s still very difficult to predict precisely quarter-by-quarter when those purchase orders will start rolling in. But I\u2019ve been around the RFID space for more than 10 years and for me it\u2019s more intuitive but I definitely sense a change in mentally by U.S. retailer. So I think that\u2019s positive for us in the long term.","George Staphos","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli and Company. Please go ahead.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Thank you. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to all. If you look at the first quarter, you surprised yourself at least should be better than you anticipated. Can you share with us, Dean, where you saw the main differences versus what your initial expectations were.","Dean Scarborough","Yeah, it\u2019s a good question, Rosemarie. So I think our expectations will obviously higher than the Street consensus, but that being said we\u2019ve beat all internal expectations by about a nickel. And I think certainly the margin expansion in PSM was a contributing factor and a lot of that came from mix improvement. Frankly, now the team has been working hard at growing the higher profit segments and changing the price mix equation. Here we call last year, most of the conversation on the earnings call was why aren\u2019t we getting any flow through from our volume growth, and the team has been working hard. So there was a real positive swing for that. So that was a net positive. And frankly, I was pleasantly surprised by the rebound in RBIS. The first quarter is a tough quarter for us because it\u2019s seasonally low, and I think the team did a great job executing against the number of programs capturing tier from some key retailers and we\u2019ve got a hot product in our heat transfer product customer, we are actually a little bit short in capacity right now. And we are adding capacity as we speak. So all those factors came together. I will say we normally don\u2019t raise guidance at the Q1 because it\u2019s seasonally slow. So, I realize that a nickel may not sound that much, but for us we usually like to get two quarters behind us before we adjust our guidance. So, I think we are feeling obviously pretty good about the balance of the year.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Right, so in addition to the fact that your heat transfer is doing better as you probably benefited from lower cost for materials, is it too early to have a feel as to whether or not retailers are rebounding? I mean what do you hear out there?","Dean Scarborough","Well that\u2019s a good question. One of our data points unfortunately is import of parallel into the U.S. and because of the Long Beach strike stock isn\u2019t coming in. So we don\u2019t have a very good metric right now to see how retailers are feeling and we\u2019ve had some anecdotal evidence where retailers are having issues finding ships to bring the new product over, I think that will all sort itself on in the next couple of quarters. I think U.S. retailers are net positive right now given the way the consumer market is playing out and European retailers were less positive last Christmas. That\u2019s even holiday season, but somewhat more positive now. I would say given again that the relative strength in European economies.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Thank you that is very helpful. I\u2019ll get back on line.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan Securities. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. It is Sofya [ph] in for Jeff, how are you?","Dean Scarborough","Good.","Unidentified Analyst","Couple of questions. Can you discuss what the initiatives are that you are targeting under the $50 million restructuring program and that is like what are the things that was interesting in looking at your results is that all of the margin improvement really came in on the gross margin line and it didn\u2019t really come in on the SG&A line, and so I was wondering whether you can touch on whether all the $10 million in cost savings effected the gross margin line, and also what projects you are targeting within the restructuring program for this year?","Mitch Butier","Sure, Sofya. We are talking a number of initiatives. So part of what\u2019s baked in here from the beginning is the restructuring that we have within graphics and the recapitalization of our graphics operations in Europe. We also took some actions and more you are going to see it really kick in more in Q2 and beyond, around just SG&A reductions. So, we\u2019ve had some actions within both segments, as well as at the corporate level to reduce cost, but also it\u2019s not just about reducing cost we\u2019re also just creating more of a stream line linkage between our marketing in R&D organizations for example and pressure sensitive, as well as some other changes really to get just more dynamic within the marketplace while also further reducing cost. So, SG&A is an area, you\u2019ve heard about the graphics here of actions and we\u2019re taking some additional foot print actions within RBIS. We just recently announced the closure of a couple of facilities in the South Eastern U.S. So there is a number of actions across the board that are happening and that we are working through.","Unidentified Analyst","Just add on to that if you look at for the full year, roughly about two-thirds of the savings will impact SG&A and then the remainder will be in the gross profit line.","Cyndy Guenther","And don\u2019t forget, Sofya, that product mix benefit that Dean and Mitch were talking about clearly benefitted us on GP.","Unidentified Analyst","Yeah. If you took out the \u2013 there sis like some carry over from like negative pricing from last year probably in pressure center, but if you took out the negative carry over what was your raw material benefit in the quarter and what do you think it maybe for the year if you had to guess?","Dean Scarborough","We can\u2019t really predict. As you know we like specialty products by and large both chemicals as well as papers and we just don\u2019t have forward visibility not only to our own volume, but also to just what\u2019s going to be happening in the market. So, we have not tried to predict what\u2019s going to happen in the future as far as commodities market. We did see some sequential deflation, but that was something that we were anticipating and was part of as we said we look at \u2013 we\u2019ve always talked about this in a net basis, looking at price and raw material cost and as you look at the price reduction that we\u2019ve been having through last year included in Q4 that\u2019s have been offset by some of the recent deflation that we\u2019ve had.","Unidentified Analyst","So net benefit was zero you think?","Dean Scarborough","Correct.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. In the pressure sensitive materials segment, the organic volume growth was \u2013 in my opinion phenomenon like 4% on top of like 6% last year, is that rate sustainable for the year seeing, I mean is there \u2013 do you have visibility where you are gaining share and do you think you can carry this rate of growth forward for the year.","Mitch Butier","Well, Sofya, our long term target is 4% to 5% and the difference this quarter was very solid growth in mature markets and a little weaker in emerging markets. I would expect over time for emerging markets growth to kick back in. I think we mentioned China and Russia were pulling us down a little bit on the emerging market side. So, it\u2019s really hard to predict. I\u2019m real happy with the 4% to your point, but we got there a little differently than I would have expected.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes I\u2019m even surprised there was this much domestic strength. I mean it\u2019s a little bit different from what we hear from other commentary and like in other retail trend. So it sounds like that you must have gained a little bit of market share as well?","Dean Scarborough","Well our focus on the high value segment that we have been talking is \u2013 those are places where we do have relatively lower share and so absolutely that is around share gain. So, yes is the short answer to your question. I wouldn\u2019t say in the categories where we are the market leader that are you are seeing the share gains, it is more in the areas like graphics in specialty and so forth.","Unidentified Analyst","My last question would be, as of component of the total pressure sensitive materials business, how bigger are the higher value-add segments now, what do they comprise of the total business?","Dean Scarborough","So, in total I mean it\u2019s not like there is a black and white high value segment and low value segments. If you look at tapes and graphics and reflective solutions in total those are about a quarter of the total PSM and within PSM, films is a high value segment in many regions and you have specialty as well, which is over 10% of the LPM business. So it\u2019s a good portion in this varying degrees of high value versus low value, when we talk about the focus on high value, if you targeted segments that are around 40% or so of the total.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks very much. I\u2019ll get back into queue.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Anthony Pettinari","Good morning. Just wanted to follow-up on RBIS value and contemporary, you all shared there last quarter and I think you indicated in your prepared remarks that your team is making progress in gains share back, my question is and I apologize if I missed this, but were sales in value and contemporary, did they continue to lag in the first quarter and as you exited the quarter you saw some trends that you liked or were you recapturing share in 1Q in those segments?","Dean Scarborough","So the negative, so basically we are still down in the quarter year-over-year. We started to really get share in the back half of the year, really Q2 through Q4, but they were a lot less negative than they were in the fourth quarter. And we know anecdotally that we have gained some program. Some of that should actually start to show up in the second quarter. But more importantly, most of that business resides in North Asia, which is basically China and Asian, and that regions show nice positive growth for us. So we\u2019re pleased to see that and that was a reversal of the trend, so we are feeling good about the trend. So we are not exactly where we want to be yet.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then just kind of a bigger picture question for Dean or Anne. Over the last few years, you\u2019ve obviously taken steps to reduce volatility of your cash flows and improve your margins. And given you\u2019ve realized some good success on those initiatives, I was wondering how you think about the long-term leverage target in terms of being may be at the upper-end or the lower-end of that range or even reconsidering the range given your leverage versus some of your peers either on the packaging or the chemical, you appear to be a little bit under levered?","Anne Bramman","So, I\u2019ll take this one. It was actually a part of a conversation, part of me joining the company as far as the company\u2019s philosophy around this. And then we just did a pretty in-depth analysis on this as well. And quite frankly, we are very comfortable with the approach that we\u2019ve been taking and are sticking to that measure. Our target \u2013 we are targeting a net debt to EBITDA between 1.7 and 2. And we use that as a proxy for the rating agencies that we are looking at, but we do believe that is the right target for maintaining liquidity in all scenarios and then making sure that we achieve the lowest weighted cost of capital across the business as well. So we are continuing to target that BBB [indiscernible] in order to have access to the markets.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I will turn it over.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Chris Kapsch with BB&T. You may go ahead.","Chris Kapsch","Yeah, I guess good morning out there in the West coast. I just wanted to follow-up on the margin strength in pressure-sensitive materials segment. Obviously, that was a key source of the upside in the guidance revision. In the past, you\u2019ve talked about the margins in that business from the emerging market business being higher than the Western regions and then in the quarter, you talked about a little bit better strength in the Western regions and a little deceleration in some of these emerging markets. So I\u2019m just wondering if you can reconcile that mix shift in terms of the contribution to the upsides for the margins in that business.","Dean Scarborough","Yeah, so the sales growth was higher in relative terms than what we have seen traditionally within emerging markets within that business. And the margins are higher in the emerging markets, particularly Asia, than you see in the Western, particularly Europe margins overall. So if you look at our \u2013 I think what you\u2019re asking is do we have a kind of mix hit \u2013 regional mix hit because of the growth levels. And the answer is, that\u2019s more than offset by the product mix benefit that we are getting by driving growth in the high-value product categories.","As well as what we\u2019ve talked about in Q4 was instilling more discipline in some of the less differentiated segments around in pricing and how we go to market in those segments as well. So it\u2019s a combined mix of all that. But I want to call out also that we are kind highlighting mix here, but productivity and cost out were a significant part of the margin expansion that we had within the segment. And we talked about that we are going to be accelerating our efforts there both to reduce cost, ensure we can hit our goals, but also to ensure that we are even more competitive in these less differentiated segments. So, that\u2019s what you are seeing come through here, Chris.","Chris Kapsch","I see. And then just a follow-up on that. Rebalancing of pricing and mix that you just alluded to, did that \u2013 in some of the less differentiated segments, which I assume you\u2019re talking about more in label and packaging versus graphic and performance tapes, did that entail just walking away from any businesses or any business or customers or conversely did you successfully implement any price increases in those areas?","Dean Scarborough","Both. We actually implemented some price increases targeted and in some cases, we actually \u2013 and this is more around Q4 and I talked about this last time where there was previously some business in Q4 that we would go after that we didn\u2019t go after because it was just not that the margin that we need.","Chris Kapsch","Is there any regions that are \u2013 where you feel like the market is more receptive to pricing versus others in some of these less differentiated product lines?","Mitch Butier","I wouldn\u2019t say this is really a regional matter. This is really going to get down into the details, customer by customer, product by product, and that\u2019s the focus that we are giving and we are really using \u2013 adding EVA as an overall focus not just gross margin and making sure that product by product, account by account, that we\u2019ve got the right EVA lens and achieving what we need to be achieving. So, broadly speaking, I wouldn\u2019t talk about regions that are more receptive to pricing because we have in areas where we have experienced some deflation like in films areas we\u2019ve given some price reductions to be able to make sure we are continuing to grow competitively.","Chris Kapsch","I see. And if I could just follow-up quickly on the RBIS segment, a challenge for that businesses over the years has been the retail space sort of operating their businesses with less and less inventory. And I\u2019m just wondering, the first quarter has obviously never been a seasonally strong one, so I\u2019m wondering if the \u2013 what you\u2019ve seen there is supportive of any notion that maybe retailers with consumers having a little bit of relief from energy prices, if there is any notion that they may be looking to bolster their inventories a little bit?","Dean Scarborough","First, it\u2019s a great question. But I think the focus for retailers right now is making sure they have the right inventory. And that\u2019s why we see so much energy and activity around RFID. I think retailers before every season are always positive. The new items that they have are going to be terrific, but if they have been very disciplined in that kind of overbuy, and we did have a couple of large European retailers who purposely cut back last year to just reduce the level of stocks. They just thought they had too much. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see a massive increase in inventories because of retailer overconfidence, but I do think we will see increased adoption of RFID to make sure they have what the customer wants.","Chris Kapsch","I see. And just a follow-up on that because I appreciate your comment about omni-channel and its increased importance. Just as these retailer customers look at their CapEx budgets, I\u2019m just wondering with the shift in CapEx towards omni-channel versus a new square footage growth, which just hasn\u2019t been happening. It seems like RFID is sort of now looked at, at least the way you are looking at it as sort of a subset of omni-channel, so I\u2019m just wondering as \u2013 the folks that control the purse strings on the CapEx side at the retailers, are they looking at cutting more or \u2013 are they looking at increasing the spending in RFID because of the compliments of omni-channel, is that what you are sort of getting at?","Dean Scarborough","Yeah, so that\u2019s what we are hearing. And I think for me the real \u2013 lots of interest, lots of activity, lots of piloting, much more intensity around the activity. And of course when it comes right down to it, I won\u2019t 100% believe until I see those purchase orders cut. But I do expect to see a strong growth component in the second half of the year. And it\u2019s still relatively unpredictable on what the ramp looks like.","Chris Kapsch","All right. Appreciate the color. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays Capital. You may go ahead.","Taylor Saunders","Hi, this is actually Taylor Saunders on for Scott this morning.","Dean Scarborough","Hi, Taylor.","Mitch Butier","Hi, Taylor.","Taylor Saunders","Congratulations on the quarter. Just a couple of quick follow-ups, most of my questions have been answered. But firstly, I guess, organic sales in both segments were pretty good in my opinion. I was just wondering if you could provide any color on what you are seeing so far in 2Q if you think that strength is going to continue.","Mitch Butier","Yeah, so we\u2019ve only had the first few weeks of shipments and the comps are pretty tough because you\u2019ve got Easter timing shifting and a number of holidays that happen in spring in Europe. So overall where, as you know, organic growth 3% to 4%. First few weeks are a little bit softer than that to be quite honest but it\u2019s normal within the normal band that we\u2019d see for a few things and the comps are pretty tough right now that we are looking at. So overall it\u2019s worth coming in, but we are still committed and expect to 3% to 4% for the full year.","Taylor Saunders","Okay understand. And then any update I guess on what you are seeing just with the M&A environment right now and your views on potential to do, maybe some smaller bolt-on acquisitions.","Mitch Butier","Well, good question. We\u2019ve had an active pipeline for a while, nothing eminent again pretty much all small bolt-on type acquisitions and again I think a very high, they are all private companies that we undertake. So it takes time and valuations can sometimes give it to RBIC. We are pretty disciplined about what we are willing to pay. So we will see.","Taylor Saunders","Alright. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may go ahead sir.","GeorgeStaphos","Hi guys. A few quick ones to wrap it from our side and I just want to peg you back on a question that Chris had also earlier. And I wasn\u2019t quite sure I understood the answer in terms of geographic mix. So historically, EM is higher margin, EM grew less quickly, but margins are up, so can you back through very quickly, what the drivers of that work given what is normally been the geographical mix tend in PSM.","Dean Scarborough","So George, you are trying to \u2013 I guess what you are asking is that, geographic mix a positive or negative for the quarter.","George Staphos","Yes. I would guess based on history that it would have been negative, yet it sound like it was a positive and just trying to reconcile that or correct but I might have not heard correctly.","Dean Scarborough","I think it\u2019s kind of a rising tide list although, okay. I mean every region has been executing fundamentally the same strategy I believe that we saw margin improvement in every geography. And the focus on driving higher growth and high return segments was the dominant factor. I don\u2019t believe look at the geographic mix piece.","Mitch Butier","The geographic mix piece is not as much it is relatively neutral overall George and part of it as we talk about emerging markets where came in, Russia was one of the reasons for that. Russia is not one of the higher margins of the emerging market. So overall on the geographic piece, it\u2019s relatively neutral but overtime we would expect it to be a tailwind for us, something that lift margins overtime but we think that benefit until we got the product mix.","George Staphos","Understand. Thanks for that.","Anne Bramman","To that point George, I would also add \u2013 we are talking about China being a little soft specifically around moving away from some lower margin product and we did see a lift in the margin in China year-on-year.","George Staphos","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you for all of that folks. And secondly and just a quick question, I think the answer would be no but I want to check it out anyway. Some of the work that we do survey vice and one of the other sections that we look at had picked up that apparel expectations had improved from some of the company that we track to sell packaging into these markets. Now since most of the apparels coming from offshore, it would suggest that perhaps there has some supplier response maybe because of the poor situation here domestically, have you seen any kind of indication to that effect where you are starting to see some apparel being product here or not from your radar screen?","Dean Scarborough","Yeah, it would be so small, George, it would be a blip for us. There isn\u2019t enough apparel making capacity in this region to make a significant difference. I think what retailers are doing \u2013 and again this is anecdotal, some of them to get product in are using air and one the issues they are facing isn\u2019t so much the bottleneck at ports here in LA. It\u2019s the fact that the ships are taking longer to get back to Asia to pickup products. So I actually think this will all be sorted out in the next few months. So I think it\u2019s going to be a relatively minor blip.","George Staphos","Okay.","Mitch Butier","There\u2019s some shift mix to Latin America, but also you are seeing it out of China. You are shifting towards Vietnam and so forth. Those trends are continuing. But South China is still such a huge apparel hub that we still expect that to be the lion\u2019s share of apparel manufacturing.","George Staphos","Okay. Appreciate that. The last question from us, more the macro question, I think Taylor was getting at it a little bit earlier. Historically, PSM has been a fantastic indicator for the economy is going and you obviously saw a better than expected first quarter from a volume growth standpoint. Do you get any sense specific to pressure-sensitive in the market that you sell into that even with GDP being, I guess, today 20 bps perhaps a little bit stronger underpinning as we head down to the next three quarters of the year? Thanks guys and good luck.","Dean Scarborough","Yeah, I will comment and I will let Mitch to just comment as well. So last year was not a great year for the North American pressure sensitive market, it was down three quarters I think up a little bit, one quarter. So, we did see nice growth. We don\u2019t have the market data yet for this quarter. I\u2019d like to see a couple of quarters of sequential growth to kind of gain my confidence level. I obviously saw the same numbers you did this morning on GDP, but I know there\u2019s been awful lot of numbers on export reductions, not surprisingly. But I\u2019d say, I\u2019m going to reserve my judgment until at least another quarter of market activity for PSM. Mitch what do you think?","Mitch Butier","It\u2019s just overall, I mean it\u2019s tough to link our performance to what\u2019s going on in the macro, but overall if you look at where our growth was in some of the higher value segments and where we know some of that\u2019s been driven by share gain, if you take that away, if you look in North America, the volumes within LPM it is not great growth. So, some of the growth that we are talking about is coming across strong, due to the penetration in the high value segments. Western Europe, it\u2019s surprisingly strong, the level of growth that we\u2019re seeing there, both in the market, as well as what we are experiencing ourselves is continuing to surprise us to the upside. So, I\u2019d say North America seems, I think the numbers we quoted shouldn\u2019t read too much into the macro because it\u2019s also around the focus on the high mix products and then within Europe though that definitely seems to be underlying strength. In China, we are seeing, what we described is exactly what we are experiencing right now, even when you pull comps away there is a little bit of slow down that we are experiencing in China.","Operator","And with that speakers, we will go to our last question from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli. Please go ahead.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Just very quickly, we didn\u2019t touch on when seen and I know it is small and the 11% top line growth is quite strong, and you expect that particular business to be profitable or at least break-even by year end, what kind of a growth rate should we anticipate and what kind of a profitability based on that? I mean going out to 2016, obviously not this year.","Dean Scarborough","I think in our long-term targets we set was 5% top line growth and maybe a little higher than that and then operating margins, can\u2019t recall at the top of my head, 9% something like that.","Mitch Butier","Yes, but we are basically focused on, this business is getting breakeven at the end of this year and then continuing by driving growth as well as productivity getting this business to be comparable to the other businesses by the 2018 horizon on margins, but through its higher growth rate and we are expecting more than 5%, whereas the other ones we are expecting 4% to 5%.","Rosemarie Morbelli","When we talking there, we are talking about dates for lack of band-aids or whatever which are going to deliver medication directly through the skin, correct?","Dean Scarborough","No, so these are not transdermal drug delivery mechanisms, they are wound care basically, so think about a high-tech band-aid with anti-microbial protection to prevent infection basically, as well as we have a lot of other wound care related products.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Alright. Thank you very much.","Mitch Butier","You\u2019re welcome.","Dean Scarborough","I assume that\u2019s the last question. So, thanks for listening this morning. We are obviously pleased with first quarter. We believe we are positioned to win in all key segments of the market and we are particularly happy that the course corrections that we began implementing last year are going through. We will continue to drive growth through innovation and superior quality and service, while reducing the fixed cost structure for both PSM and RBIS to significantly expand operating margin and return on capital and we will maintain our strong balance sheet and continuing to return capital to shareholders. So, thanks for joining us today and I look forward to seeing many of you very soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference call for today.

Please go ahead, ma'am.","Cynthia Guenther","Thank you. Today we will discuss our preliminary unaudited third quarter results. The non-GAAP financial measures that we use for the quarter are defined, qualified and reconciled with GAAP on schedules A-2 to A-4 of the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release.","We remind you that we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. These forward-looking statements are made subject to the Safe Harbor Statement included in today's earnings release.","Making formal remarks today will be Dean Scarborough, Chairman and CEO and Anne Bramman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mitch Butier, President and Chief Operating Officer is also with us today to participate in the Q&A portion of the call.","And now I will turn the call over to Dean.","Dean Scarborough","Thanks, Cindy and good day, everyone. We are again pleased to report another solid quarter of progress against our long-term financial objectives. We grew sales 5% on an organic basis, expanded our adjusted operating margin by 140 basis points and delivered double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share and year-to-date we have generated nearly $200 million of free cash flow.","The pressure-sensitive materials business once again delivered strong results on all fronts. And retail branding and information solutions is making good progress, both financially and strategically, delivering solid top growth and market expansion while charting a new path forward to drive long-term sustainable growth and improve its competitive position in the less differentiated segments of the market. We also made a key strategic decision impacting the course for Vancive, our medical technology business, positioning ourselves for improved profitability in this important growth market. So let's dive a little deeper in to each of the segments.","As I said, pressure-sensitive materials had another strong quarter achieving organic sales growth of 5% at the high-end of our long-term range. Organic growth was positive in all major geographies, with mid single digit growth in both developed economies as well as in emerging markets taken as a whole. Our customers and end users look to us to bring innovation to this industry and our leadership in doing so continues to drive top line performance.","One of my favorite ways to experience that firsthand is by attending Labelexpo, the labeling industry's annual trade show, which took place in Brussels last month. The focus of our innovations on display this year was clustered around themes that matter the most to our customers, productivity, shelf appeal and sustainability. We continue to benefit from growth in higher value market segments, which has been a key strategic focus for us.","For example, global sales of specialty products for label applications, both paper and film, grew more than 10% organically. But we are also growing within the less differentiated product lines driving cross-sell and managing pricing to improve profitability. In short, the strategic course correction that we initiated last year to rebalance the price, volume and mix dynamics in pressure-sensitive materials is working. We have been at or above the high end of our long-term target range for organic sales growth for the past two quarters. And that growth, combined with ongoing productivity and a favorable raw material environment, is driving record operating margins. We will continue to execute this strategy, leveraging our strengths in innovation, quality and service across the entire portfolio.","So let's turn to retail branding and information solutions. While we are the clear leader in the apparel labeling market, the business has faced a number of challenges over the past few years. In particular, sales growth has been volatile. And while we have been improving the operating margin each year in the business, we fell behind on the trajectory needed to achieve our 2018 targets. So we are adjusting course. I am happy to report that we showed financial progress in the third quarter delivering solid organic sales growth and margin expansion. More important though, we began laying the strategic foundation to ensure we achieve our long-term financial goals for this business, including an operating margin in the range of 10% to 11% by 2018. Execution of this strategy will help us get back on track to achieve these goals, while funding the investment needed to drive sustainable growth.","We continue to win in the higher value segments of the business. Performance athletic is a good example where growth has been consistently strong, better than 15% annually over the past couple of years. We are taking share in this important segment of the market, leveraging the full breadth of our solutions including RFID and external embellishments. Our success here is based on strategic partnerships with customers who value our innovation, design capabilities and global reach.","And RFID can be used to deliver. Sales of RFID products grew by more than 20% in the third quarter. As a reminder, RFID sales were down in the first half of this year, reflecting the timing of various rollouts. We continue to expect sales to be up about 15% for the full year. We expect this momentum to continue over the next few years. Fewer than 10% of apparel units are being labeled with RFID tags today and more retailers are adopting the technology. We expect that market demand will roughly double in size by 2018 and that we will maintain a leadership position in this market.","While we are very pleased with the success that we have had with high value segments, we have not been meeting the needs of many customers in the less differentiated segments. In these categories, which represent a majority of the total market, we have lost share to leaner and more nimble competitors. Customers of these products make more of their buying decisions locally and they are willing to make trade-offs to achieve their objectives, for example, substituting locally sourced raw materials for the global standard. These customers prioritize speed of service in times of both times to quote a new order and the order to ship cycle as well as competitive pricing. For us to thrive, we must transform ourselves to be more competitive, faster and simpler, so that we win with all customers and across all segments.","To achieve these objectives, we have developed a new multiyear plan focused on accelerating growth through a more regionally driven business model. We are simplifying our go-to-market strategy on the basis of customer behaviors and needs. At the same time, we are streamlining decision making and eliminating management lairs while further consolidating our manufacturing footprint to reduce costs across the entire business.","Besides reducing overall fixed cost, the new business model will allow us to more easily scale resources up and down based on value to the customer. It will bring product expertise closer to the customer and it will include a delivery model that supports industry leading speed of service. In short, we will build on our strong set of sustainable competitive advantages enabling continued industry leadership. We will continue to leverage on a global network to support all segments with consistent quality and superior service. We will continue to drive innovation with our proven core competencies in printing, weaving and data management. And we will leverage our leadership position in RFID to build partnerships and grow share within the core business.","Now I will just touch on Vancive before turning the call over to Anne. As most of you know, we have been investing in two new growth platforms which, while constraining profitability in this segment over the past couple years, have offered the potential for significant long-term value creation. We have made very good progress achieving our strategic milestones for one of these two platforms, a range of unique antimicrobial dressings that significantly improve patient care.","The second growth platform, wearable sensors, has not met our expectations. Based on a disciplined milestone measurement process and after considering a few strategic alternatives, we made the decision this past quarter to shut down this venture. The business is now above break even and we expect further margin expansion in 2016 with an acceleration of the growth trajectory. Vancive continues to represent one of several very promising opportunities for us to gain share in a pragmatic market that has above average growth with attractive margins.","In sum, I am confident in our ability to achieve our long-term financial targets through 2018, adjusting course as needed to deliver double digit EPS growth and top quartile return on total capital. We continue to deliver strong free cash flow. Combined with a strong balance sheet, this gives us ample capacity to invest in our existing businesses while continuing to grow the dividend, repurchase shares and pursue value enhancing bolt-on acquisitions. We remain committed to returning the majority of our cumulative free cash flow to shareholders over the long term. From a balance sheet perspective, while below our targeted leverage range today, we will remain a disciplined investor.","Now I will turn the call over to Anne.","Anne Bramman","Thanks, Dean and hello, everyone. I will provide some additional color on the financial results for the company and segments. In Q3, we delivered a 13% increase in adjusted earnings per share on 5% organic sales growth. Currency translation reduced reported sales by 9.5% with an approximately $0.09 impact to EPS. Adjusted operating margin in the third quarter improved 140 basis points to 9.4% as the benefit of productivity initiatives and higher volume more than offset higher employee related expenses.","We realized about $21 million of incremental savings from restructuring costs, net of transition expenses. The adjusted tax rate was 34% consistent with the anticipated full year tax rate in the low to mid 30% range. Free cash flow was $85 million, a decline of $68 million compared to last year's third quarter, due largely to the timing of working capital changes at quarter-end. Year-to-date, we have delivered nearly $200 million of free cash flow.","In the first nine months, we repurchased 1.9 million shares at a cost of $109 million and paid $100 million in dividends. As Dean indicated, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders and have sufficient capacity to continue our share buyback program. Consistent with our stated philosophy and strategy, we continue to be disciplined and opportunistic with share repurchases, buying relatively more when the share price dips and relatively less when the share price is higher.","Now looking at the segments. Pressure sensitive material sales were up approximately 5% on an organic basis. Label and packaging material sales were up mid single digits as were the combined sales for performance shapes and graphics. On a regional basis, North America and Western Europe were both up mid single digits, benefiting from above average growth in graphics and continued solid growth in labeling materials. Organic growth from emerging markets continued to be relatively slow, up mid single digits, reflecting ongoing softness in China and Eastern Europe. PSM's adjusted operating margin increased by nearly two full points compared to last year. As we saw last quarter, the improvement was driven by productivity, including continued material re-engineering and restructuring savings, as well as fixed cost leverage from strong volume growth and the benefit of approved product mix.","We also saw net benefit from price and raw material input cost as we continued to reinforce our pricing discipline, particularly in the less differentiated segments of the market. Looking sequentially, the net change from pricing and raw material input cost was negligible as expected. Retail branding and information solution sales increased by approximately 4% on an organic basis with significant contributions from sales of RFID products and external embellishments. Sales growth among U.S. based retailers and brand owners outpaced their European counterparts. Once again, we saw strong growth in the performance segment globally while we continue to see a decline in sales for the less differentiated segments. Adjusted operating margin improved by 120 basis points to 7.9% as the impact of productivity initiatives and higher volume more than offset higher employee related costs.","As Dean mentioned, the strategic changes underway in RBIS will enable the business to be more competitive in the less differentiated segments of the market, facilitating the achievement of our previously communicated long term financial target for both growth and margin expansion. Specifically, organizational restructuring and other actions associated with the new strategy combined with actions taken earlier this year are expected to yield approximately $60 million of pre-tax savings net of transition cost in 2016. Combined with the anticipated benefit of volume growth, we expect these savings will more than offset pricing adjustments and inflationary pressures in the business, getting us back on the trajectory needed to meet our 2018 adjusted operating margin target of 10% to 11%.","Sales in Vancive Medical Technologies increased by about 3% on an organic basis. As we have indicated before, given the application specific nature of orders in this business, we do expect sales growth to be somewhat choppy quarter-to-quarter. The segment delivered a small operating profit for the quarter representing a roughly $3 million improvement over last year's losses. This profit improvement reflects operational gains in the base business combined with the reduction of spending related to wearable sensors venture that we mentioned.","Turning now to our full year outlook for the company. We have raised our estimate for organic sales growth modestly to roughly 4%, reflecting the continued strength of PSM and improvement in RBIS. In terms of adjusted EPS guidance, we have narrowed our previous range while maintaining the midpoint as we expect modestly improved operating performance in the third and fourth quarters will be offset by incrementally unfavourable impacts from currency movements. Keep in mind that we normally have a sequentially weaker fourth quarter due to typical seasonality driven by the number of holidays and generally weaker product mix within the PSM segment. Comparison to the prior year is significantly distorted by the extra week in the fourth quarter of last year and the associated shift in the calendar. We outlined some of the key contributing factors to our guidance on slide eight of our supplemental presentation materials.","Several of the assumptions underlying our previous guidance have changed modestly, specifically for the full year. At recent exchange rates, we estimate that currency translation will reduce net sales by approximately 8.5% with a roughly $52 million impact to pre-tax earnings or $0.37 to EPS. As mentioned, we expect organic growth for the year to be roughly 4%, up slightly from our previous assumption. Incremental pre-tax savings from restructuring actions will total over $70 million in 2015. The actions taken this year are expected to drive carry-over savings into 2016 totaling roughly $75 million.","We now estimate average shares outstanding at the high end of our previous range and we have increased our estimate for pre-tax cash restructuring charges by approximately $10 million as a result of further cost reduction actions planned as part of the business model transformation underway within RBIS. This raises our estimate for restructuring cost and other items by $0.07 to $0.15 per share. Summing up, we delivered another good quarter and remain on track to achieve our 2015 and 2018 target.","Now we will open the call up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan Securities Incorporated. Please go ahead with your question.","Shloka Mehta","Good morning. It's Shloka, for Jeff. How are you?","Dean Scarborough","Hi Shloka.","Shloka Mehta","If we look at your pressure sensitive growth this quarter, it was like 5%. I don't know, last quarter it was like 6%. And looking at the growth rate that your competitor reported a few days ago, those are relatively high numbers. And there's a lot of growth Northern Europe it seems and I was wondering what you attribute that to? And whether you think that's a reasonable rate over the next couple quarters.","Dean Scarborough","Shloka, hi. This is Dean. One of the tough things in the comparison, we obviously watch our competitors when they report numbers, is that we don't know if that number is currency adjusted or not. They don't report organic sales growth. So that's a little bit tricky for us to dissect their numbers. It's always tough to call what the next couple of quarters look like in pressure sensitive materials because as you know we ship out about 80% of our products within two days or less. But our goal is to continue to drive growth in the business at that 4% to 5% range over the long haul and we are obviously feeling pretty good about this year. It did come a little differently in terms of really solid growth in mature markets with some slowdown in emerging markets.","Shloka Mehta","Okay. In terms of cost reductions, will the majority of the cost reductions appear in your gross margin line? Or do you think it will show up as reduction SG&A? How do you think it will be represented in your income statement?","Anne Bramman","So for 2015, two-thirds of that will show up in the SG&A line.","Shloka Mehta","Okay. Like I would have thought the SG&A reductions would have been even larger if that's true, given that there are probably also currency benefits that you would see.","Anne Bramman","So the currency is a benefit for SG&A and it's one of the largest pieces. If you look at the year-over-year, there's some favorability in SG&A and currency is the largest driver of the favorability.","Shloka Mehta","Okay. Can you quantify how much the currency benefit may have been for the year or for the quarter on the SG&A line?","Anne Bramman","On the SG&A line, it was worth about, on a pre-tax basis, it was about $17 million.","Shloka Mehta","For the quarter or for the year-to-date?","Anne Bramman","Yes. For the quarter.","Shloka Mehta","That's helpful. And lastly, I was wondering if I look at the restructuring charges taken this year, I was wondering what the remaining cash outlays may be? Is it like a couple million have been reserved. What's still left to be paid out?","Anne Bramman","So generally that gets paid out over a couple of months or quarter time. So a little bit of a lag but in general for our free cash flow it shouldn't be an issue. We are still going to deliver for the year 100% plus conversion of income.","Shloka Mehta","Okay. I will follow up on that separately. Thanks very much. I will get back in the queue.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.","Scott Gaffner","Thanks. Good morning.","Dean Scarborough","Hi, Scott.","Anne Bramman","Good morning.","Scott Gaffner","Hi, Dean. Hi, everybody. Just following up on pressure sensitive materials there for a minute. I realize you don't have a lot of forward visibility, but Dean you did talk about better growth in the mature markets, weaker in the emerging market. How is that? Because I think there's a lot of investors that I have talked to that have had some concerns around the growth in emerging markets with a lot of the PSM business coming from the growth in the middle class. Is there something you are seeing as far as your customers pulling back on their ability to grow that business and then in the develop markets where are you seeing that? Is it on the variable information side of the market or within the packaged goods? How can we think about that a little bit more?","Dean Scarborough","Mitch, why don't you take that?","Mitchell Butier","Sure. So as far as your first question from an emerging market standpoint, we have been taught by emerging markets collectively how they have been growing and this level of growth has slowed down. But we have been seeing some of the diverging paths what's traditionally been called a emerging markets with some markets slowing down dramatically such as Brazil and Russia, others like China slowing down but still growing.","We have had modest growth within the quarter in China but that's well below what we have traditionally seen, but other markets such as South Asia and ASEAN still showing pretty healthy growth, high single digits to double digits. So diverging path overall is what we are seeing in emerging markets.","And then your question about mature, we are seeing a good portion of our growth coming from our focus on accelerating growth in the high value segment. So areas like our graphics materials where we have a relatively lower market share and have targeted that market to go after growth and the team has successfully been executing that.","As well as specialty labels such as durable products, tire labels and so forth has been a key area of focus for us as well. So we have been seeing outsize growth there but even in variable information as an example, we are continuing to see growth within that segment and it seems to be at a decent clip. Hard to tell how much of that's from underlying consumption, given lack of forward visibility and we don't have market data yet versus maybe inventory movements and so forth at our customers.","So overall pretty broad based with higher growth going on in the higher value segments and we are continuing to see modest growth but good growth in the less differentiated segments.","Dean Scarborough","Scott, this is Dean. In China specifically we have actually seen a slowdown in some markets now for about the last four quarters and I think that's indicative of a classical pressure sensitive view of the world where inventories are being reduced. So we expect that to continue for a period of time.","It's really difficult for our end use customers in China to understand how much inventory is in the channel. So we have seen some of that slowdown but I still think as I always say when things slow down, people still wash their hair even in an economic slowdown. So I don't anticipate the overall demand for the types of products that get labeled in China to really slow down.","We do expect to see a bit of a mix shift I think from an end user perspective. Local brands are getting more aggressive in China and I think some of the multinational brands have struggled. It's kind of irrelevant for us since we call on the whole market there.","Scott Gaffner","Right. Okay. And then focusing on the margins in pressure sensitive, to me it looks like, I know we have asked this before, but it looks like you are going to be well ahead of the long term target by the end of the year within the segment. Is there something around raw material price cost that, what have you believe that sort of comes back a little bit in 2016, such that you wouldn't expand your operating margin target?","Dean Scarborough","Yes. Scott, I think we probably wouldn't do it in the middle of a cycle. If we were going to revise our ranges, we are probably more likely do it at the beginning of the year and take a look at it. We would like to get, again, at least another quarter under our belt. And actually the deflationary scenario differs radically by market. We are seeing currency induced inflation in places like South America and Indonesia and even some of the ASEAN countries.","And in Europe, we really haven't seen a lot of raw material deflation because many of these commodities are actually priced in dollars. So if anything, they have seen net increases. I really think a lot of this has come from a mix of productivity, focusing on higher margin products, driving the mix again. But I just think we will take a look at this as we prepare our guidance for 2016 and my guess is if we do it we will do it then.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. And last question for me, Dean, is really on capital allocation and the share buyback. You guys have had the enviable position of having your stock go up for most of the year and share buybacks come in a little bit below expectations. Other than you buy when the shares are low and trim it a little bit when they are high, how can we think about if they do remain high, what else could you do with the cash? Or are you just going to wait for those opportunities where the stock pulls back? Thanks, Dean and congrats on the quarter.","Dean Scarborough","Thank you. We did our share buyback actually did accelerate the third quarter, actually by almost 60%. I realize we are still below probably what folks thought we would do for the year. I think we are going to be disciplined and patient is how I would characterize our approach to capital allocation. That would include share buyback as well as opportunities in the M&A front.","Do we have another question, operator?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird & Co. Please go ahead.","Mehul Dalia","Good morning. This is actually Mehul Dahlia, sitting in for Ghansham. How are you doing?","Dean Scarborough","Hi Mehul.","Mehul Dalia","You called out a price cost benefiting the PSM business this year. Can you quantify how much price cost has contributed to EBIT so far? And what are your expectations going forward? Should we continue to see some more price cost benefits in 2016?","Dean Scarborough","So the first question is, as far as what we have seen, if you look at the drivers of the margin expense, we have had the biggest single contributor has actually been around from productivity drivers that we have been pushing through and then followed by the volume benefits of variable flow through from growth that we have been driving and then we did talk about the modest benefit from price and raw material cost gaps, if you will. So that has been our reason for our margin expansion. The key driver is pretty consistent with what we have talked about in Q2. Sequentially though, there's essentially been no shift net between price and raw material costs from Q2 to Q3 and things overall while pretty different in individual markets where you see pockets of inflation, pockets of deflation, overall things have stabilized and we don't expect much impact this year going in to next year.","Mehul Dalia","Got it. And your outlooks for $60 million in cost savings in the RBIS business implies basically a 50% increase of EBIT roughly. So what are the primary offsets? And second how are you orchestrating the execution to avoid the disruption for customers given the extent of the restructuring that you are going to be doing?","Anne Bramman","So from an offset perspective, we definitely have higher employee related cost in this business. It is much more employee intensive. So you have natural inflation in those costs that are an offset to that as well. And so I will let Mitch go through the [indiscernible].","Mitchell Butier","The way to look at the overall, these are strategies we are putting in place to be able to compete and win in all market segments. This business has relatively high variable margins. So our focus here has to be both around driving growth as well as driving productivity to be able to hit our margin target that we have laid out. And we have identified the $60 million of savings in this business for next year. That is a means to an end of being able to achieve the 2018 targets that we have laid out. And what you should be thinking is, we are not planning to get and we don't expect to get in that range next year. But you will see a disproportional amount of expansion is what we are targeting in terms of in 2016 in this business relative to the rest of the cycle.","Mehul Dalia","Got it. Thank you so much.","Mitchell Butier","You are welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Adam Josephson","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Anne, would you mind talking about what FX drag you might expect next year assuming current rates? And I don't know if you have gone through the budgeting process but it's a question that's coming up fairly frequently now. And related to that, are there any other above or below the line items next year that we ought to be mindful of that could lead to significant changes in profitability?","Anne Bramman","So in general we are just starting to go through the budgeting process with each of the positions. And so it's kind of hard to have a point of view as far as where we are going to land on this. I know we are going to be giving more guidance in the call after year end. So we will have a little bit more visibility in what we are seeing on that.","Mitchell Butier","Overall I think it will be much more moderated from what we saw this year versus last year.","Adam Josephson","Sure, Mitch. Dean, back to the PSM margins for a moment, I know you just talked about that most of the margin expansion year-to-date has come from your productivity initiatives and the volume growth. So those sound like fairly sustainable sources of margin expansion and they have gotten you to this 12% level. Am I hearing you correctly there that you seem to think these 12% margins are in fact fairly sustainable I think based on what you are saying?","Dean Scarborough","Yes. Adam, when we set the targets, I think we have talked about this before, we had set the targets at a 10% to 11% range. We had a lot of debate internally about should it have been 10.5% to 11.5%, 10% to 12% and when we set the targets, what we are communicating was we are shooting for the high end of the range. We don't necessarily have an upper limit. So the team's done a good job this year of managing, actually in a pretty challenging environment and executing the strategy probably a bit faster in terms of the mix and productivity than we expected. So I don't think we are putting a cap on anything here.","I don't think investors should take the view that because we haven't changed it after a couple of quarters of over performance that we think there's a cap there. I think it's a matter of just us getting comfortable. Q4 is going to be a softer quarter for us. Number one because it just has, compared to last year and even compared to the third quarter, it just has much fewer shipping days because of the calendarization caused by the 53rd week last year. So that's a bit of a challenge. So I think we want to see how that all shakes up.","Adam Josephson","Sure. And just one more on PSM, Dean. Obviously many consumer companies domestically have talked about pockets of weakness that they have seen of late and obviously U.S. retail sales are growing fairly slowly at the moment. So can you just help us understand why your PSM sales domestically might be growing as robustly as they are and I guess the same question applies to Western Europe given the economy there?","Dean Scarborough","Mitch, why don't you take that?","Mitchell Butier","Sure, back to something I commented on earlier, one of the big drivers of us driving growth in the high value segments above what the market is growing in those segments. So areas like graphics and specialty labels, again, is a key area of focus for us and has been a key driver of our growth that we have seen in those regions. As well as I commented in the less differentiated segments, we have seen healthy, modest but healthy growth relative to what we usually see in those segments as well which is variable information.","Adam Josephson","Thank you, Mitch. Appreciate it.","Mitchell Butier","You are welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","George Staphos","Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. I joined the call late so I apologize if you have already answered some of these or covered it in your formal remarks. Relative to the RBIS realignment let's say, how much of the actions you are taking now contribute to the $70 million benefit you expect for next year? And is there further tail on the actions you are taking now in terms of benefit for 2017 and later, recognizing I forget to whose question you were answering, you said that disproportionate amount of benefit is going to happen next year.","Anne Bramman","Right. So we gave guidance that we expect $60 million in that transition cost savings for RBIS in 2016. So clearly of the total company carry-over, the significant portion of that is due to RBIS. When we look at the calendarization we are still going through, quite frankly, the calendarization of the savings in 2016 but we are, at least, preliminary seeing this spread pretty evenly among the year, among the quarters in 2016.","George Staphos","And is that also, I guess one thing I was asking, is there a tail on that in to 2017 and 2018? Again, if you mentioned already I apologize for missing it but if you have happen to have that and it hasn't been commented on I would appreciate some color.","Anne Bramman","Yes. So as I mentioned, we think the savings is spread pretty evenly across the year. So you would anticipate there will be some kind of a tail for 2017.","Mitchell Butier","The other thing we commented on earlier, George you may have missed it, a disproportionate amount of what we are going to hit is going to hit 2016. And so the message here is just to enable us hitting the 2018 margin targets, enable growth within all segments of this business and you should see though, we don't expect to be in the targeted range next year but we will see a disproportionate amount of expansion in 2016 as we get there.","George Staphos","Yes. I had heard that Mitch. I appreciate the color. Let me drop that for now. In terms of the emerging market trends you were commenting to earlier, you mentioned there's been some bifurcation by region. Has there been any appreciable within those regions change from third quarter to second quarter or even as you are exiting the third quarter now to the fourth quarter relative to earlier in the third quarter period?","Mitchell Butier","The only shift I would say from the trends we have been seeing is really in Russia where it's stabilized a bit. Everything else that I commented on earlier were themes we were seeing in Q2 as well.","George Staphos","Okay. Thank you for that additional color. Last thing and then I will come back in queue. Can you comment, if you haven't already, in terms of how the customer rollouts on RFID, this latest wave have been going and what kind of penetration, share gain, not yours but RFID and broadly you are seeing in the market? Thank you.","Dean Scarborough","Yes. George, on RFID, it continues to be robust. We grew 20% year-over-year in the quarter. We have a couple of customers that are in the process of accelerating their rollouts. So I expect that to continue at least for the next few quarters. I was actually pleasantly surprised too on the number of customers that are buying RFID tags. So for me it's getting more broader based. And as brands start to service multiple retailers using RFID, we are starting to get the question out well, 50%, 60% of my products are now RFID marked, might as well just go the whole way, at least through having early discussions on that. So for me, this is specifically in the U.S. So that was a positive trend. Right now we think the apparel unit volumes is about 10% penetrated and we think pretty easily that could go to 20% by 2018. So that's really what we are looking at. But we are in a good phase right now and our team has done an excellent job of supporting customers during this rollout. So I feel good about that.","George Staphos","Dean, forgive me for jumping back in one last one, was the surprise that the tags are being used for products, garments that were lower price point? And so people are seeing the economics at a lower, if you will, point of sale price than you would have imagined? Or is it that they are saying they may increase from, using your figures, 50% to 100%? Thanks.","Dean Scarborough","So, yes. Let me be clear on that. So if you are a brand, okay and you are selling your brand for multiple retailers, let's say Macy's, Walmart, Target, et cetera, et cetera and they start asking for the tags on their garments to have RFID enabled tags and that's a significant portion of your volume, all of a sudden you realize, now I have to have inventories that have both RFID tags on them and non-RFID tags on them. So I might as well go the whole way and by the way, start to extract some of the benefits myself in my own supply chain. So that's really what I was trying to communicate.","George Staphos","Thank you, Dean.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup Global Markets. Please go ahead.","Anthony Pettinari","Good morning. In RBIS you indicated that you were seeing decline in sales in less differentiated segments. I was just wondering when you would expect those volumes to inflect or be positive and then kind of on the flip side you talked about specialty products up 10% and accelerated rollouts in RFID. When you look at the higher margin parts of the business, are there regions or product categories where you are at all capacity-constrained or it's a bit challenging to meet customer needs?","Mitchell Butier","Sure. So as far as the first part of your question around declines in the less differentiated segments, we have started to see a modest shift in the trends with those segments. And I expect it to take another couple quarters before we start to see that turn around. And that's primarily just given the lead times from when you win programs, if you will, to when you actually make the shipments for them. And I would say a couple of quarters but Q2 is really the key peak season for this business. So I think that's going to be the key quarter for us all to watch as we go forward. And as far as the growth that we are seeing in the more differentiated segments of the market, particularly asking about product lines, so RFID and external embellishments, these are spaces we are making investments, then we will continue to make investments so that we can continue to be the market leader and drive penetration of RFID across the entire market and continue to penetrate the external embellishments markets with our innovative solutions.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. That's helpful. And then with regards to the positive trends that you are seeing and understanding that it's early days, are you seeing those positive trends in value and contemporary? And to the extent that you can, can you talk about Avery regaining share in those categories, what you have seen in Q3 going in to 4Q?","Mitchell Butier","So we are not regaining share. The rate of decline has slowed and specifically if break it to value, we are seeing a bigger turn around in contemporary right now. But again, it's very early days given the cycle time from when you make shifts to when you would actually see a meaningful difference in the amount of volumes you are shipping in these various segments, it's just too early to give definitive information on that.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. That's helpful. I will turn it over.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Kapsch with BB&T Capital Market. Please go ahead.","Chris Kapsch","Yes. Good morning. I had a couple of follow-ups on the pressure sensitive business. You parsed out the gross product line growths by region pretty well. But wondering, specifically you mentioned variable information also grew. Could you just like within the label stock materials business, did prime label materials and variable information label materials grow roughly at the same pace? The reason I ask is, I am just wondering if there's any variance there that also might have contributed to positive mix for the business.","Mitchell Butier","So within the prime sector, film grew faster which is not unusual than what you saw on both prime paper as well as variable information labels.","Chris Kapsch","Okay. So that might have contributed to mix but the key mix driver was really more about the growth in graphics and tapes it sounds like?","Mitchell Butier","And specialty labels that we commented on. Specialty paper and then there's also graphics as well, as you have commented. Another key factor here to mention though around that, it's not mix improvement. We have been talking about having more discipline in the less differentiated segments and we have seen again this quarter expanded margins within those less differentiated segments such as variable information labels.","Chris Kapsch","I see. So is that to imply that you actually ceded some share in that? And so one could argue this volume growth, organic growth that you are posting is even that much more impressive?","Mitchell Butier","So if you recall in Q4, we did cede some share in Q4 in a couple of spaces and we commented on that earlier, in previous quarters. But since then you have normal exchanges you have in the marketplaces in these segments.","Chris Kapsch","I see. And then just following up on the sustainability of the margin improvement, obviously you list the drivers in order of importance and productivity has been an important driver. So when I think of productivity and pressure sensitive and correct me if I am thinking of it wrong, but I think your ability to drive your coders at higher line speeds and also your ability to perpetually reduce the material content of your label materials and that's been up sort of a hallmark of your operational excellence over the years if not decades. I am just wondering how sustainable is your ability to continually drive productivity in that regard looking forward?","Dean Scarborough","Yes. Great question. So Chris, one big driver in the productivity, recall last year we had a big restructuring program in Europe that cost us money both in the P&L and restructuring charges to improve our graphics business. We have lapped that this year. That's a big driver of the profitability. So we are now reaping the benefits of that investment in closing an older facility and putting a new coding line in an existing facility. So that continues to be a part of the productivity story in PSM, when we can add a new asset and close a facility to get rid of overhead. I would say that yes, it's pretty much in the company's DNA to drive material cost out through either chemistry or combination of chemistry and process technology and I guess every year we ask ourselves the same question about well, what's the lower limit? And actually the lower limit is zero but we have got a long way to go before we hit that number. In other words we buy by weight, we sell by area and we continuously drive less and less weight in our materials at equivalent or even sometimes better performance. So it is part of the magic of what we do in the business and yes, we are obviously going to keep doing that.","Chris Kapsch","Got it. And then if I could just follow up on the strategic repositioning and RBIS. If I understand one of the comments about rationalizing the manufacturing footprint for that business. I guess historically there's been an awful lot of, I think they used to be called service bureaus, but little shops in the countries near the needle factories and I thought it was generally thought of to be important to be close to the needle to be able to service customers that were making the garments. So it sounds like you are going to be rationalizing a portion of that to drive some margin. And just wondering, can you do that without sacrificing the service levels to some of these needle factories in those various regions? Thanks.","Dean Scarborough","Chris, the overall focus here is to increase our share in the market and service delivery times. The service bureaus you talked about is being a lot of localized service bureaus specifically to that end. Those are actually relatively low cost. Those aren't the areas of focus when we talk about the footprint reduction. It's the larger manufacturing hub and continuing to consolidate to having fewer large hubs but actually having these working on fast response units that have the service bureaus and maybe other smaller assets for quick cycle time deliveries. So that is an area of focus for us and as we talked about this business has relatively intense employee population. When we look at the rationalization and footprint that's overall a focus for us as well.","Chris Kapsch","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Good morning, everyone. Obviously most of my questions have been answered but I was wondering as RFID grows 20%, what is the growth rate that it contributed to RBIS? Do you have a feel for how one impacts the other?","Dean Scarborough","Well, over the long haul it adds two to three points of growth along with external embellishments, the two product categories that we have. So Rosemarie we think about the apparel market growing 1% to 2% probably closer to 1%. And our 4% to 5% target range, we see external embellishments and RFID adding two to three points their share gain. That adds another point that gets us within the target range of how we look at the business.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Okay. That is very helpful. Thank you. And do you have a feel for the upcoming Christmas season? Or is that too early?","Dean Scarborough","Well, I think retailers, this is always a challenge for them. I hate to say this because most of you guys are in the Northeast kind of hoping for a polar vortex so we get a lot of sales of warm clothes for cold winter but it's the same thing every year. And if they can't move the goods, they will discount them. We hope they don't have to. I think retailers are generally pretty disciplined about inventories and now the real focus on them is to make sure they have accurate inventory so they can meet customer needs whether they are ordering online or online picking up at the store and all the other ways consumers can buy products.","Rosemarie Morbelli","So you are not seeing it here lower level -- I am sorry.","Mitchell Butier","From what we are seeing, just in North America, we expect to see some modest growth coming out of that is what we would expect the market to do. Europe we would expect to be a little more challenged. And if you look at the import data you can see imports into the U.S. tracking above what we are seeing in Europe which makes sense given some of the currency headwinds they have as far as apparel unit cost and so forth.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Okay. Thanks. And then lastly you talked about bolt-on acquisitions and in the past you have talked about doing something in the graphics area. Anything new of the valuations lower than they used to be, do you have more opportunities?","Dean Scarborough","Great question. So we have built up a pipeline of possibilities in I would say graphics, in tapes and even in the medical converting area. A lot of the companies are private. So it takes time and we are working on it. And again, we are disciplined about how we do it. So we feel good about the pipeline but these things take time. As I said before, we are going to be disciplined and patient. That's our strategy in M&A.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Okay. Thank you very much.","Mitchell Butier","Thank you.","Operator","Our last question is a follow-up from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Adam Josephson","Thanks. Dean, we appreciate your sentiments on hoping for a polar vortex. You can sit in 80 degrees and sunny weather and we will be snowed in here.","Dean Scarborough","I am a native Clevelander so I remember those days.","Adam Josephson","Anyway, Mitch, back to the higher value added, the growth in higher value added areas in PSM that you talked about, specialty paper, graphics, tapes, can you help me understand what the primary markets for those materials are? And whether it's the end markets that are growing substantially? Or whether you are gaining share or both?","Mitchell Butier","So if you look at graphics, the primary end market, think of signage. So these are very large pressure sensitive labels, if you will, that would go on the side of trucks, that would go on the sides of buildings and so forth or as you have seen in our materials, car wraps, which is the fastest growing area for cast films within the graphic space. So a lot of that is share gain with the exception of some of the cast films and car wraps. The whole market is actually growing from a very small base there. And then within the specialty labels area, we have traditionally had relatively high share in specialty labels and that's more application specific so it's going out and finding new opportunities to drive new application and adoption of pressure sensitive materials.","Adam Josephson","So it's a combination of all of the above, market growth, new markets and gaining share from some competitors?","Mitchell Butier","Absolutely.","Adam Josephson","Terrific. Thanks a lot and best of luck in the quarter, you guys.","Mitchell Butier","Thank you.","Dean Scarborough","Okay. Well, first of all, just thanks again for listening. I want to thank our team at Avery Dennison for another solid quarter. We are pleased with our trajectory, especially given some of the headwinds that we faced this year, especially around currency and armed with the knowledge that we can do even better. Our overall strategy is working. PSM is delivering at or above the 2018 levels. The graphics business is now profitable and our strategy change in RBIS will get us back on track to hit those 2018 targets. The business continues to deliver strong free cash flow year-to-date and as I mentioned we are building a pipeline of small bolt-on acquisitions in the medical, tapes and graphics materials business. And we are going to continue to be disciplined and patient about our capital allocation. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

The conference ID number is 21543232.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Eric Leeds, Avery Dennison's Head of Investor Relations. You may begin, sir.","Eric Leeds","Thank you. Welcome, everyone. Today we'll discuss our preliminary unaudited third quarter 2012 results. Please note that unless otherwise indicated, today's discussion will be focused on our continuing operations. The company's Office and Consumer Products business is classified on our income statement as a discontinued operation.","The non-GAAP financial measures that we use are defined, qualified and reconciled with GAAP in Schedules A-2 to A-5 of the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release. We remind you that we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. These forward-looking statements are made subject to the Safe Harbor statement included in today's earnings release.","On the call today are Dean Scarborough, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mitch Butier, Senior Vice President and CFO.","I'll now turn the call over to Dean.","Dean A. Scarborough","Thanks, Eric. I'm pleased to say we had a solid third quarter. Sales were up nearly 6% on an organic basis, the strongest organic growth we've had since the first quarter of 2011. Our strong top line results were driven by continued momentum in Pressure-sensitive Materials and a rebound in the core business of Retail Branding and Information Solutions, including the accelerating adoption of RFID by retailers. The impact of higher sales and significant productivity improvements drove higher adjusted operating profit. As a result, we raised our guidance for full year EPS.","We are on track to hit our full year guidance for free cash flow. As you know, one priority is to return more cash to shareholders. And through the first 9 months of the year, we met that commitment with a dividend increase and by repurchasing 7.7 million shares. In total, we've returned $312 million of cash to shareholders in the first 3 quarters.","Now turning to the businesses. Pressure-sensitive Materials had another solid quarter on both the top and bottom line. Label and Packaging Materials grew sales in every region with double-digit growth in emerging markets. We had a very successful Labelexpo in Chicago this year, launching more than 14 new products and winning the Labelexpo Green Award for our new Bottle-to-Bottle Film portfolio, which uses a special adhesive that enables more effective recycling of PET bottles. The Graphics and Reflective businesses also increased sales, and we have begun to see the savings from that integration with Labeling and Packaging Materials.","RBIS delivered modest growth in sales in the early part of the third quarter, but then finished the quarter with a very strong September. Sales growth was strongest among U.S. retailers and brand owners, reflecting rising confidence about next year's spring season, coupled with lower cotton prices. Not surprisingly, end market demand in Europe remains weak, but we still delivered mid-single-digit sales growth among European retailers through share gains. In fact, we believe we are taking share in both the U.S. and Europe through improved service and new products, including our exterior embellishment.","In addition, RFID sales to apparel retailers were up nearly 70% over last year. Item-level RFID is clearly accelerating. It took about 6 years to ship our first billion inlays, but we shipped the second billion in less than 18 months. Demand for RFID inlays in the RBIS business translated into a big improvement in profitability in the RFID division, which is reported as part of other specialty converting. I'm very pleased with our progress in RFID.","At Office and Consumer Products, third quarter sales were roughly flat compared with prior year, and we saw improvement in underlying operating profit primarily through productivity gains. Obviously, we're disappointed that the proposed sale of Office and Consumer Products to 3M was terminated. We have restarted the sale process and have several interested buyers, both strategic and financial. That said, even if OCP isn't sold, we expect this business to continue to deliver solid free cash flow.","Our restructuring initiative is on track to deliver more than $100 million of annualized savings by mid-2013. We are creating a leaner cost structure that is enhancing our competitive position and strengthening our ability to increase returns.","Turning to the outlook. Our updated full year guidance reflects some caution about the top line. We had a very strong September, but that followed moderate growth in July and August. Given the short lead times we operate on, we'll need more time to call this a sustainable trend. Now the first 3 weeks of October look right on track with our -- the guidance that we provided in today's press release. Thanks.","And now I'll hand it over to Mitch.","Mitchell R. Butier","Thanks, Dean. As noted, we had a solid quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $0.53, reflecting continued momentum in Pressure-sensitive Materials and solid progress in RBIS. Sales came in better than expected, and we delivered bottom line results at the high end of our expectations for the quarter. Net sales grew approximately 6% on an organic basis as RBIS experienced a rebound in demand, especially in September, and Pressure-sensitive Materials continued to recover from the slowdown in the middle of last year.","Along with solid organic sales growth, adjusted operating margin increased 110 basis points as the benefit of higher volume and productivity initiatives more than offset higher employee-related expenses and the impact of unfavorable product mix. You'll recall that the higher employee-related expenses relate in part to higher bonus expense versus last year. We had unusually low bonus expense last year due to poor business performance.","The net impact of raw material input cost and pricing was neutral in the quarter.","Our year-to-date free cash flow in 2012 is significantly improved from last year due to lower bonus payments in the first quarter of 2012 versus first quarter 2011 and the continued strong management of working capital. We continue to be pleased with the capital discipline we've demonstrated over the past few years. Our net debt is lower than it was at this time last year. Consistent with our strategy of maintaining a strong balance sheet, net debt-to-EBITDA from continuing operations was 2x at quarter end and 1.8x including discontinued operations.","With leverage in our targeted range and with our consistently strong free cash flow, we've continued to deliver on our commitment to return cash to shareholders. In the third quarter, we repurchased an additional 2.9 million shares at a cost of $86 million.","We talked last quarter about our cost-reduction program that will structurally reduce our overhead cost and save more than $100 million annually. We're on track and we continue to expect to achieve these savings by mid-next year.","Turning to the segments. Pressure-sensitive Materials sales were up 7% on an organic basis, an improvement in the year-on-year growth rate versus recent quarters, driven by continued momentum and the fact that we have now lapped the slowdown that began in the second quarter of last year.","Label and Packaging Materials grew organically in all regions with mid-single-digit growth in North America, low single-digit growth in Western Europe and low teens growth in emerging markets. While sales growth benefited from easier comps to the prior year, volume continued to be good in absolute terms as well. Sales in Graphics and Reflective Solutions increased mid-single digits, driven primarily by sales in the Reflectives product line.","PSM's adjusted operating margin improved 40 basis points in the quarter as the benefit of higher volume and productivity initiatives more than offset higher employee-related expenses and the impact of changes in product mix.","Retail Branding and Information Solutions sales grew 7% on an organic basis, reflecting increased demand across most of our product lines, including another strong quarter in RFID. As Dean mentioned, the strong growth in the quarter appeared to be driven by retailer confidence in the U.S. and continued share gains in both the U.S. and Europe. As I said earlier, September was a particularly strong month and actually delivered the vast majority of the quarter's top line growth for this business. The fourth quarter will represent a better indicator of the strength of underlying demand.","RBIS' adjusted operating margin improved 90 basis points as the benefit of productivity initiatives and higher volume more than offset higher employee-related expenses and the impact of changes in product mix due to strong RFID sales.","Sales in our other specialty converting businesses declined 1% on an organic basis, due primarily to weak performance and performance pace. Despite the lower sales, adjusted operating margin improved 500 basis points driven by the increased RFID profitability. Note that the negative mix impact of RFID in the RBS -- RBIS segment is offset by the profitability generated by RFID in other specialty converting.","Moving onto the outlook for 2012. I'll start by commenting on the key factors that we think will contribute to our guidance for the year. Our estimate for organic sales growth is now approximately 3%. This narrowing of the full year estimate is due to the fact that we only have one quarter to go. The macro environment remains uncertain, and we continue to have limited forward visibility. Based on recent exchange rates, the impact from currency on EBIT is now estimated to have an approximately $17 million negative impact versus 2011. Our estimates for the tax rate and capital expenditures remain unchanged for 2012 from what we shared with you last quarter. And as for pension, we expect that pension contributions in 2012 will be approximately $75 million now.","Free cash flow from Office and Consumer Products in 2012 is expected to approximate $55 million before deal-related costs of about $10 million.","Average fully diluted shares outstanding for 2012 is expected to be between 103 million and 104 million. The delay in the anticipated sale of OCP to next year has had a minimal impact on our original estimate of average shares outstanding in 2012. The share count at the end of the quarter was approximately 101 million on a fully diluted basis.  So based on estimated sales, as well as other assumptions including the listed factors, we expect adjusted 2012 earnings per share from continuing operations of $2 to $2.05 and free cash flow from continuing operations of $280 million to $310 million.","In summary, the third quarter was a solid one with better-than-expected top and bottom line performance. Our cost-reduction program to save more than $100 million is on track. And our continued cost and capital discipline enables us to maintain our dual commitment to financial strength and returning more cash to shareholders. In fact, we have already delivered $312 million to shareholders in the first 3 quarters of the year while maintaining leverage in our targeted range.","Now we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First question I had, in RBIS, to the extent that your customers could comment and relay what they were seeing in the market, what was giving them more confidence in the spring selling season for 2013? And in general, what was behind the September pickup in demand?","Dean A. Scarborough","Well, George, first of all, September usually is the start of the ordering season for the spring, so that's normal. This September...","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","No, I understand it, but it sounds like a year-on-year improvement.","Dean A. Scarborough","It was definitely a year-on-year improvement. So a couple of factors. We talked before about how high cotton prices impacted unit demand. Right now, apparel unit costs are about 10% less than they were in the first half of the year, mainly due to lower cotton and other raw material costs. Retailers buy -- when they buy in an open-to-buy, they buy on dollars, they don't buy on units necessarily. So what we're saying there is the impact of lower unit costs for apparel, so they're buying more. So it's the reverse effect of what we saw in 2011. In the U.S., there is more retailer confidence as they look at consumer confidence rising. So I think there's just a little bit more optimism, although I do believe that retailers are still going to keep their inventories under control because we have not seen a significant change in the outlook for -- in terms of the inventory-to-sales ratio. In Europe, I'd say there's more pessimism. But we have been able, with our new products and focusing on our innovation center, executed pretty good market share gains in Europe, so I'm pleased about that.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Dean, Mitch, I'll ask a few questions and turn it over to follow on. Is there a way to quantify how important the RFID capability is in terms of RBIS' improvement and outlook? And then with Office Products, I realize you're obviously in discussions and hopeful of ultimately selling the business. Is there a time out in the future whereby if you don't find an offer that's acceptable, that you may consider bringing the business back as a continuing ops segment and when might that be?","Dean A. Scarborough","So RFID is increasingly becoming a part of the story. I'd say close to 1\/3 of the growth that we had in the quarter was due to RFID adoption. I do want to make the point though that the core business of RBIS came back. And so it's not just an RFID story. RFID is definitely an add-on, and we do see an acceleration of adoption by major retailers. So we're feeling, I'd say, bullish about the impact on RFID and we're clearly well-positioned as the go-to player as companies implement item-level marking using RFID. So I'm happy about that. As far as Office and Consumer Products goes, we are doing 2 things in parallel. We clearly have the sale process underway. We have a number of interested buyers, both strategic and financial. And I'm hopeful we'll get more clarity about that. I'm hopeful that we'll have more clarity during the first quarter. These processes have a life of their own, so it's sometimes difficult to predict. At the same time, we are working very diligently to understand if we don't get a good offer for the business, how would we manage the business to optimize free cash flow over the next 4 to 5 years. We have not invested a lot of restructuring money in this business over the last couple of years because we're -- our #1 priority is to sell it. But in my mind, that restructuring plan and the cash that we can get provides a floor versus what we could potentially get in the sale process.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Ghansham Panjabi, Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just to clarify on the RBIS strength in September. First of all, was that equally true in both Europe and in the U.S.? And then, Dean, when would we know whether this was pure pull forward of demand from 4Q, which I think is one of your stronger quarters versus underlying demand improvement?","Dean A. Scarborough","We'll probably know the answer to the pull forward in December because that's when sales start to taper off. I'd say right now, again, I'll just reiterate the first 3 weeks of October, pretty much across-the-board, are reflective of the guidance that we put into play. It's just -- we just won't know. We just don't have that much forward visibility.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Got it. And then in PSM, a couple of consecutive quarters of nice positive growth and it seems pretty consistent across the major geographies. Can you just sort of give us an update on what you're seeing in the world? I mean, it seems to be very counterintuitive to what we're hearing from a lot of other companies with a lot more industrial exposure, so I'm just wondering why there's a deviation here?","Dean A. Scarborough","Well, recall that we had somewhat easier comps year-over-year because we started to see a slowdown and we did have some share loss beginning with the second quarter of 2011. I think the teams have done a great job, though, of recapturing some of that share with some of our new innovative products as well as a focus on some certain product segments. We regained -- I feel, we don't have the numbers yet, but I feel pretty confident we've regained some of that market share. North American business, though, seems to me to be trending a little bit with the market in terms of we definitely hear from label converters in the U.S. business conditions are more positive than we hear from Europe. Although I have to say, most European customers, based on what I hear, their outlook is a lot more positive than when you read the Financial Times, which is focused probably mainly on the financial sector than it is kind of the basic operations and consumer sector.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Got it. And just one final one on RFID. Where are you seeing the most momentum from a geographic basis? Is it Europe, North America, equal?","Dean A. Scarborough","It's North America right now.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays Capital.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just following up on that RFID question. Are you seeing most of the adoption within, say, the vertical retail channel or are you seeing it throughout the various retail segments that you cover? Can you just sort of give us some color there?","Dean A. Scarborough","Yes, the -- mainly in what we call premier and mid-market, which includes department stores, is probably the major driver right now. And then I would say following that would be vertical retail.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And is it really just loss prevention that you think is driving this, or is it more an idea that your customers want to control their inventory levels? What do you think is the driver?","Dean A. Scarborough","It's 90% all about inventory and making sure that you have exactly what you're supposed to have on the floor to enhance sales. And what we then find is that once retailers get those systems put into place, you can enable loss prevention at a very low incremental cost to that. So that comes as a secondary benefit.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And are you saying -- I think a lot of these retailers are actually using their stores more for their -- as warehouses for their e-commerce businesses. Is that -- have you heard that as a driver as well?","Dean A. Scarborough","I don't think that's the main driver. We do know that retailers, when they sell online and at the store, those stores become places where customers return things as well as pick them up. And so it actually provides, in a way, more opportunities for us because now re-marking items at a store is actually more important than it's been before. So we do have a number of solutions that we offer retailers that allow them to price mark and re-mark garments right in the store and it's very much synchronized with their overall systems.","Operator","Our next question from the line of John McNulty with Credit Suisse.","Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Abhi Rajendran sitting in for John. A couple of quick questions. On the restructuring, of the total savings in the restructuring program, could you maybe provide us with the run rate levels that you had at the end of the third quarter and maybe what level you think you'll exit the year with?","Mitchell R. Butier","Yes, so we are -- what we provided last time is we said we expected about $15 million of the $100-plus million savings to hit this year. We're expecting a little bit more than that now to hit this year, closer to $20 million. And a lot of that's back-half weighted, so the run rate's obviously higher than that with the remainder of it hitting in 2013 and will be in the run rate by mid-next year.","Dean A. Scarborough","We do have some transition costs, though, that will also impact us in the back half of the year.","Mitchell R. Butier","Yes. So that $20 mil -- roughly $20 million is net of some transition costs. So if you look sequentially, Q4 versus Q3, there's actually the incremental savings you'd expect in Q4 versus Q3 is offset by some transition costs we have for one of the specific actions.","Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then just a quick follow-up. Earlier this year, you've kind of laid out a target of $1 billion to $1.5 billion to be returned to shareholders over the next several years. Could you maybe provide an update to this range kind of given the delay in separating OCP as well as maybe how this would be split up between buybacks, dividends?","Mitchell R. Butier","Yes, we haven't provided an update to the range, but the way to think about this is if the sale does not go through, we've provided some data points for 2011, what the EBITDA was, you can see free cash flow for this year. So we will still have free cash flow for that 4-year period. But in addition to that, we would not need to deleverage as much as what was in that model because we still have the EBITDA from Office Products. So if you go through the math, you'd see that we're definitely looking at well over $1 billion of cash flow to distribute to shareholders over that time frame.","Operator","Our next question from the line of John Roberts of Buckingham Research Group.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Your tax rate used to be a lot lower before you sort of went through the dip and the regional shift in business. I don't expect it will change in the fourth quarter here. But as you get into 2013, has your mix shifted back enough for the back half of the year here that you might have a lower tax rate next year?","Dean A. Scarborough","Yes, so our tax rate isn't where it is right now and we're not providing guidance for next year. We did say as earnings go up, it will have a little bit of downward pressure on our income tax rate. The -- one of the biggest factors for us, though, and uncertainty for tax rates in the future is really around the repatriation of cash into the U.S. and what the laws will be prevailing over the coming years. So that'll have the biggest single impact. The cash tax rate, so how much cash we actually pay, had been in the upper 20s and have continued to trend down and we'd expect that still to be in that upper 20% range next year as well.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Silke Kueck with JPMorgan.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's Silke Kueck for Jeff Zekauskas. Have prices in the Pressure-sensitive Materials segment begun to reset given that raw material costs are also moving lower?","Dean A. Scarborough","I'd say the trend is fairly stable and we did lower -- I mean, on a year-over-year basis, we had used some surcharges in 2011 as a way to raise prices and some of those surcharges have rolled back definitely. But when you look on a net-net basis between pricing and material costs, essentially it's neutral.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So neutral means you don't think you had any margin expansion from raw material costs moving lower?","Dean A. Scarborough","No.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Do you expect to see any going forward if your prices hold stable?","Dean A. Scarborough","Depends on what raw material prices do. I'm expecting more of, I think, a stable raw material environment going forward. The big factor, actually, that we had in the quarter was more mix. We're growing faster in some of the paper and variable information product categories, which has a little bit of a downward impact on the margin. Still profitable business, just not as profitable as some of our films business.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And I also have an RFID-related question. My recollection is that your goal was to maybe have RFID item-level sales maybe at a run rate of $100 million, and I was wondering like how far you've gotten so far?","Dean A. Scarborough","We'll be pretty close on a run rate basis by the end of the year.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And like the way it works is if that the label itself is manufactured in other specialty converting and then it's sort of like transferred in some form, I guess, on a cost basis to the RBIS business. And so if I look at other specialty converting, is that business now breakeven or is it profitable? Or how do I think. . .","Dean A. Scarborough","It's profitable. Yes, just a -- so what we do is we buy chips and we make antennas and we attach the chips to the antennas and put it on a plastic, basically, a roll plastic. That plastic inlay, once it is delivered to RBIS and inserted into tag or care label, whatever the form factor is for the retailer, the RFID business has been profitable for 3 quarters in a row and I expect that to maintain on a go-forward basis.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then lastly, I was wondering what -- how much of the pension contributions that are required for this year have already been made?","Mitchell R. Butier","A majority of them have already been made for the year. Not all of them.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So you're like, I don't know, like you've made like a $50 million contribution already, something like that?","Mitchell R. Butier","We made something north of that. So most of them have been paid, but not all of them.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Chris Kapsch with Topeka Capital Markets.","Christopher Kapsch - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I had a follow-up on the RBIS segment. I'm just wondering if you could qualify or even quantify how your margins for that item-level RFID business compares to sort of your -- the core products within the segment? And then, just curious if looking at that business and your goal to sort of double operating margin by 2015, wondering how important the growth in RFID plays into that sort of goal or projection?","Dean A. Scarborough","Well, if you look at the RBIS segment alone, the actual margin percent for RFID is lower than the average, mainly because we're selling -- instead of instead of selling at a $0.01 to $0.02 tag, we're selling at a $0.09 to $0.10 tag. So the margins per unit are higher, but the margins on a percent basis are lower. Now that doesn't include the profit we get from making the inlays at the same time. So overall, I think, from a company perspective, it's good for us.","Christopher Kapsch - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Right. And it sounds maybe like your RBIS segment could beat up its supplier a little bit for a little bit better price, right?","Dean A. Scarborough","Well, we may -- they manage it today, so they'd be beating themselves up.","Christopher Kapsch - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Right, okay. And then I just had a follow-up also on the commentary around market share in that segment. Obviously, there's -- one of your competitors has been sort of struggling and internally focused on rationalizing that business. So I'm just wondering if the nature of the share gains that you've seen is -- is it something that -- is it where you're doing something that customers are coming to you because you have a better proposition or is it really just a case here where one of your competitors is ceding share because they're in a rationalization mode?","Dean A. Scarborough","Well, we've been gaining market share over the last, I would say, 8 to 10 quarters and I believe it's because we fundamentally have been improving our value proposition. We've improved our service. We have more innovative new products out there like the external embellishments. We've invested in innovation and innovation center for customers to visit. So I think we've been doing a good job there. Clearly, there have been some customers that have come to us and said, we need some help. And so that's -- I would say it's a small part of our share gains during the quarter. It's certainly not the majority.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays Capital.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a follow-up on -- 2 follow-ups on OCP. One, you mentioned that you thought the process could play out into 1Q '13. I just wonder if maybe some of these potential bidders, whether strategic or financial, were in the process before such that the process could actually take less time this time around?","Dean A. Scarborough","Well, that's exactly the case. And so we have a number of potential buyers that were in the first process. So I think for them it will be relatively rapid. And again, I'm always cautious. These processes always take a little bit longer than the bankers tell you that they take. So the last time, it took almost a year. So just a little over a quarter for me is certainly a shortened time frame.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just following up on George's question from earlier about bringing this business back into continuing ops. Is there anything from a regulatory standpoint where you have to bring this back into continuing ops at a certain point in time if the sale does not occur?","Mitchell R. Butier","Well, technically, after a 12-month period, but we've -- because we've restarted a new process, the clock starts again.","Operator","Our next question is also a follow-up from George Staphos, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Dean, quick question. Just you mentioned surcharges rolling off that had been put into place in '11 over the course of this year. Would that suggest that there was some margin captured this year that might not reoccur in 2013 as we're thinking about the forecast, or is that really a nominal factor, if you will, as we look out to '13?","Dean A. Scarborough","Yes. There's so many factors that come in to impact the margin. I mean, so there's volume, there's mix, et cetera, et cetera. I don't think there'll be anything material in there, George.","Mitchell R. Butier","One of the things Dean mentioned earlier, George, is when we're talking year-over-year, recall we did lose some share, particularly in Europe last year. So part of that recovery is just recovering what was lost.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","No, I understand. But that would be separate from any incremental price that you'd had this year that you won't have next year. But again, hopefully, you'll offset that with the operating leverage from the share gain. Could you also discuss what the margins are for RFID within specialty converting? Are they above or below average relative to segment total?","Mitchell R. Butier","The segment -- our margins for RFID in other specialty converting, is that your question?","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Correct.","Mitchell R. Butier","Yes, so the margins are actually relatively high because you've got profitability without a whole lot of sales because the sales are actually eliminated within other specialty converting for what's sold to RBIS. So yes, they are higher than the average.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And could you remind us what \u2013 and that suggests that there's been a fair amount of drop-offs in that segment in other businesses given the economic choppiness over the last 2 to 3 years, could you remind us what's left in that business that's not RFID that was around, say, 3, 4 years ago as well?","Dean A. Scarborough","So we have our Performance Tapes business, our Design and Engineered Solutions business, so it's basically an industrial converting business and includes some things like stamps and batteries. And I don't think it's been -- there's not been a material change in those -- in the performance of those businesses. I mean, it's such a small segment. Or it's not even technically a segment, but it's so small that a little bit of change in profitability makes the margin swing by quite a bit. So I'll give you an example. We do postage stamps for the U.S. Postal Service. They ran out of money in the third quarter and so they didn't order anything. Now they're starting to order again. So that had given -- even in a small segment like that, it had an impact.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Understood. I guess the last question and I'll turn it over. Have you seen any impact -- any -- impact's not the right term. Have you seen any increases in capacity in Pressure-sensitive Material in a meaningful way in any of your geographies? One of your competitors has announced here and there some smaller things, but I'm not sure if that's really a meaningful impact to capacity, but wanted to get your thoughts.","Dean A. Scarborough","We haven't seen any material adds in capacity, really, in any region, there's -- I mean, of the investments that I'm aware of. There's been some limited addition to capacity in China. You mentioned one of our competitors added some specialty capacity, but that tends to be for a small segment of the market. It's just not material.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That was wine correct, Dean? The wine label? That was for wine labels\u2026","Dean A. Scarborough","Well, that was one of the -- likely one of the target segments, sure.","Operator","Our next question is also a follow-up from Ghansham Panjabi, Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just a quick follow-up. On the PSM business, on a geographic basis, can you -- was there any major deviation in trend line during the quarter in terms of growth year-over-year? And also, can you just comment on what's on October as well?","Dean A. Scarborough","I think North America grew in the mid- to high single digits. Europe was in the low single digits. Latin America was very strong, double-digit growth, as well as Asia Pacific. And I haven't really seen in 3 weeks, I wouldn't call any other trends. I mean, the first week of October is Golden Week in China. So it's slower right now, but I expect it to pick back up as the quarter progresses.","Mitchell R. Butier","As far as the trend within the quarter, the growth was pretty consistent throughout the quarter. It builds up a little bit later in the quarter, but on a modest level. RBIS was the standout where it had an exceptional, most of its growth all in September.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Todd Wenning from Morningstar.","Todd Wenning - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Could you give us your general take on what you're seeing in China over the past few months?","Dean A. Scarborough","It's been -- China has been choppier than I recall. But still, it's been growing the last couple of quarters at a double-digit rate. So I feel like at least -- the consumer sector of China is what drives our Pressure-sensitive Materials business. I think the export and the investment sectors of China had the biggest part of the downturn whereas consumer side, it seems to be doing okay, even though it's relatively, the developed market's a smaller percentage of the economy.","Todd Wenning - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Excellent. And based on the prices, you bought back stock in the third quarter. It seems that most of the transactions were made early in the quarter before some of the concerns about the deal surfaced. So has the delayed OCP sale affected your approach to buyback still?","Mitchell R. Butier","Well, the timing of when you receive that amount of proceeds, obviously impacts how much share you're going to buy back and the timing of that. But we don't comment on the pace or timing of when we do share repurchases. You can see it had a modest impact on the amount of shares expected to be outstanding for the full year. We were at 103 million before, we're now saying it's going to be between 103 million and 104 million. So it did have some impact, but we're not going to comment on the specific timing.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Silke Kueck with JPMorgan.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I have a short follow-up. So the reported earnings including discontinued operations was $0.57 in the quarter. Was that excluding the -- is that like an adjusted number excluding the nonrecurring items?","Mitchell R. Butier","So the $0.57 is GAAP including discontinued operations.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's GAAP. How much would it be non-GAAP including discontinued operations?","Mitchell R. Butier","So in this quarter, the $0.20 GAAP that you see for discontinued ops is the same for pro forma. So you can just add the $0.20 to the $0.53 that you see to get $0.73.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So you get like $0.73, so versus $0.53. So that means the Office Products division earned $0.20 this quarter and...","Mitchell R. Butier","Yes.","Stephen C. Chick - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So at $0.20 is 1 million shares out, tax effect at, I don't know, like 3%. So that means the business is at a run rate of like $29 million in EBIT, something like that?","Mitchell R. Butier","You have to recall that this business has had a lot of seasonality to it. And Q2 and Q3 are the peak for back-to-school. And we talked last quarter that some of the back-to-school timing had shifted into Q3. So Q3 was relatively strong relative to the rest of the quarters.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Well, those are higher than any of the numbers I remember from, like, 2011 when you still reported the business. So like it seems to be doing well.","Dean A. Scarborough","I think the third quarter, again, because seasonality back-to-school moved more in the third quarter than it did in the fourth quarter -- or sorry, than last year, so I mean they did have a good third quarter.","Mitchell R. Butier","Yes. Back before we reported separately, Q2 and Q3  were always the highest EBIT quarters.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. But like last year, it was -- it ran at $22 million in the second quarter and the third quarter was $21 million. So these numbers -- I mean, these are still much higher than what it was in '11.","Dean A. Scarborough","Well, if you're trying to compare to the old information when it was in continuing operations, you must recall that the corporate allocations that get pushed back in the segments are no longer happening for a discontinued operation. So these results are not apples-to-apples with the numbers you're talking about for Q3 of last year.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I see. So what are the stranded costs?","Mitchell R. Butier","Silke, just we restated and gave multiple quarter information, I think it was back in January, and we'd be happy to go over that with you as well and help identify where these variances are.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. It's like a ballpark number of like stranded costs on an annualized basis that you would allocate to the business?","Mitchell R. Butier","The stranded costs are changing dramatically given all the cost reduction and so forth that we're going through between the cost reduction we've announced this last July and the July before that. So there's a lot of moving parts in talking about the stranded costs. I think would not get to the end you're trying to achieve. So I'd be happy to go over it with you later. We've eliminated all the stranded costs related to Office and Consumer Products. After doing that, we're also structurally reducing the amount of corporate overhead as well. So if you think about it just in those terms, those stranded costs are gone, but that still won't give you the comparison I think you're looking for.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Considering the change in leadership and what I believe is going, or at least what I read, is going to be a boost to help consumers as opposed to growing towards infrastructure, how much help could you get if something actually does happen in that particular category? And what is your overall exposure into China?","Dean A. Scarborough","So China, it's a good question. I don't believe that the new leadership change in China they're going to want to see the economy slow down. So I anticipate that there will be some more stimulative measures taken. The Pressure-sensitive business really is, I'd say, 80% dependent on consumer demand in China and -- which I think is a good factor, and I know the Chinese government wants to continue to shift a higher percentage of their GDP over time to being driven by consumer spending rather than infrastructure or exports. So anything that helps the Chinese consumer will help our Pressure-sensitive business on a go-forward basis. The RBIS business, though, is really driven by apparel and worldwide apparel trends and how much of that is made in China. It's still a very important factor for us. But I think the factors impacting RBIS are more about apparel costs and consumer confidence in mature markets.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","And what is your overall -- the percentage of your overall business in China, if that is a relevant number?","Dean A. Scarborough","We don't disclose that. But more than 1\/3 of our sales, about 35% of our continuing operations are in emerging markets and that includes the emerging markets in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","And if I may ask one last question. If my memory serves me right, which is never sure, but aren't you planning in pushing your RBIS business into other regions in Asia like Vietnam, or I don't remember, Thailand, I believe. Is there some kind of a shift going on?","Dean A. Scarborough","So we have manufacturing operations for RBIS wherever apparel was made. So for example, we have large operations in South Asia, which would include India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. So those are -- especially Bangladesh is a growth area for apparel production, just as Vietnam and Indonesia are growth areas for apparel production. They're taking some share from China. So we're well-positioned to capture apparel demand pretty much no matter where it's manufactured.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay. And there is no difference in the profitability in one of those new regions versus China, for example?","Dean A. Scarborough","Well, some are better and some aren't.","Operator","Mr. Scarborough, I will turn the call back to you now, sir, for your closing remarks.","Dean A. Scarborough","Thank you, France. So just to summarize. We are pleased with our third quarter performance. Our Pressure-sensitive Materials business is executing well with continued growth in emerging markets and innovation, driving decoration transfer and share gains all over the world, including Europe and North America. And I'm also pleased with the ongoing integration of our Graphics and Reflective businesses, as well as the research center. Those remain on track.","The RBIS core business has rebounded sharply now that apparel unit costs have dropped, and there is some rising retailer confidence in the U.S. RFID continues to penetrate and we're also delivering nice returns from that business as well in both the RBIS sector and other specialty converting. And we're going to continue to drive RBIS, drive top line performance while continuing to reduce our fixed costs. That's a big part of the story.","The Office and Consumer Products business, obviously disappointing news with the termination. But again, we have restarted the sale process and we're hopeful to get a resolution on that in the first quarter of next year. We're on track with free cash flow and I'm really happy and just delighted to have been -- to deliver more cash to shareholders in 2012, than certainly we have the past couple of years.","And then, I really need to thank the Avery Dennison team from around the world who are continuing to work safely, working to improve quality and service and focus on customers while also driving big productivity gains from a number of the actions that we're taking all around the world. It's not easy, and I want them to know I really appreciate their results. So thank you, operator, and we look forward to talking to you in the New Year.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today.

Welcome, everyone. Today, we\u2019ll discuss our preliminary unaudited first quarter 2014 results.","Please note that unless otherwise indicated, today\u2019s discussion will be focused on our continuing operations. The non-GAAP financial measures that we use are defined, qualified and reconciled with GAAP on schedules A-2 to A-4 of the financial statements accompanying today\u2019s earnings release.","We remind you that we\u2019ll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. These forward-looking statements are made subject to the Safe Harbor statement included in today\u2019s earnings release.","On the call today are Dean Scarborough, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mitch Butier, Senior Vice President and CFO.","Now I will turn the call over to Dean.","Dean Scarborough","Thanks, Eric and good day, everyone. We had a solid start to 2014. Our playbook is working. We are delivering mid single-digit organic sales growth driven by emerging markets, innovation and share gain. We are executing productivity actions and driving capital efficiency. We are improving returns and we\u2019re returning cash to shareholders.","Organic sales growth came in at the high-end of our expectations for the quarter, driven by Pressure-sensitive Materials growth outside the U.S. specifically the Labeling and Packaging Materials business continued to benefit from strong growth in Asia and South America as well as solid growth in Europe. Performance Tapes also delivered another strong quarter. However, consistent with recent quarters, we did not see as much of the benefit to operating profit from PSM\u2019s incremental sales growth as we generally expect.","We had some headwinds in the quarter that drove higher than expected manufacturing and SG&A expense. So, our operating margin for PSM came in a bit short of expectations for the quarter, given our relatively strong top-line results.","We're very pleased to see the acceleration of top-line growth for our highest return business. And we'll continue to take actions to drive productivity as modest improvement in our flow through will drive even greater value creation.","Retail Branding and Information Solutions delivered another quarter of strong earnings growth inline with our expectations for both top-line and margin expansion. Growth continues to be the strongest with our Europe-based retailers and brand owners and in the performance athletic and fast fashion segments of the market.","RBIS remains on track with its profit improvement plan. The business has made excellent progress in executing its footprint reduction strategy and other key productivity initiatives. As you know, we target a [ballpoint] of margin expansion for this business each year through 2015. The consistent execution of our marketing and operational strategies has kept us on track to achieve that objective.","So again, a solid quarter for us overall, but while I'm generally pleased with the progress we made in the first quarter, we won't be satisfied until we achieve all of our long-term goals. We'll be providing more detail on our opportunities and strategies within each of our key businesses and providing new financial targets through 2018 during our Investor Meeting in New York on May 21st. I hope you'll be able to join us.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Mitch.","Mitch Butier","Thanks Dean and hello everyone. We had another solid quarter with 5% organic sales growth and a 10% increase in adjusted earnings per share, driven by higher than expected volume growth in Pressure-sensitive Materials and continued margin expansion in the Retail Branding and Information Solutions.","Adjusted operating margin in the quarter grew 40 basis points to 7.1%, as the benefit of our productivity initiatives and continued solid top-line growth more than offset the negative impact of higher employee-related expenses.","As part of our productivity initiatives, we realized approximately $10 million of restructuring savings in the first quarter and incurred about $7 million of restructuring costs. Our tax rate in the first quarter was 18% reflecting benefits of discrete items. Our adjusted tax rate for Q1 was 33% inline with our expectations as we continue to anticipate the full year tax rate to be comparable to last year.","Free cash flow from continuing operations came in as we expected with the net outflow of the $155 million reflecting seasonality and the timing of capital needs. We continue to expect to deliver free cash flow in excess of $300 million for the year.","With net debt to EBITDA at 1.4 times, we remain below our long-term targeted leverage position, with ample capacity to continue to return cash to shareholders over the coming years. And we will continue to do so in a disciplined manner. Along these lines, we repurchased an additional 1.2 million shares for $59 million in the first quarter more than offsetting dilution and paid $28 million in dividends.","Looking at the segments; Pressure-sensitive Materials sales in the first quarter were up approximately 6% on an organic basis exceeding our expectations. Both Label and Packaging Materials sales and the combined sales for Graphics, Reflective and Performance Tapes were up mid single-digits on an organic basis.","On a regional basis, North America sales grew slightly; Western Europe grew mid single-digits; and emerging markets grew about 10%, reflecting solid volume growth in both Asia and Latin America.","PSM\u2019s adjusted operating margin in the first quarter was flat at 9.9%, as the benefit of productivity initiatives and higher volume was offset primarily by higher employee related expenses as well as modest headwinds from the net impact of pricing and raw material inflation, currency transaction costs, and higher manufacturing expenses in North America due in large part to extreme weather in the quarter.","While some of these headwinds will dissipate in the second quarter, as Dean mentioned, we continue to have challenges with the flow through in PSM and we are working to address them. Retail Branding and Information Solutions sales grew about 2% in the quarter, consistent with our expectations as continued strong demand from Europe based retailers and brands offset the impact of the tough RFID comps from one U.S. based retailer.","RFID revenue in the quarter declined almost 10%, reflecting the tough comps. Q1 represented the last quarter of these tough comps and we expect RFID sales to begin to return to a more normal growth pattern over the balance of the year.","RBIS again demonstrated continued strong margin expansion in the first quarter with adjusted operating margin improving 120 basis points to 5.8% as the benefit of productivity initiatives and higher volume more than offset higher employee related expenses.","Sales in Vancive Medical Technologies which was previously identified as other specialty converting businesses grew 2.4% in the quarter with an operating loss that was roughly the same as last year.","As for our 2014 outlook, we continue to expect adjusted 2014 earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.90 to $3.20. This guidance is based on a number of assumptions including the key factors listed on slide 8. ","We now estimate 3.5% to 5% organic sales growth which excludes the benefit of the extra week of sales this year. The increase in the low end of this range simply reflects PSM\u2019s higher than expected sales growth in the first quarter. And as you can see, the rest of our key assumptions remain unchanged from what we shared last quarter.","So, overall, we delivered a solid first quarter and continuing to expect adjusted earnings per share growth of 8% to 19% for the year. We\u2019re continuing our strategies of driving above market organic sales growth through innovation and differentiated quality and service, while continuing our cost and capital discipline. We will maintain our strong balance sheet and continue returning cash to shareholders.","Now, we\u2019ll open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner from Barclays Capital. Please proceed.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital","Good morning","Dean Scarborough","Hi. Good morning Scott.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital","Hi. Just wanted to dig a little bit deeper on PSM on the contribution margin, came in around 10%. You mentioned mix before, I think last quarter; can you talk about the mix of sales, is there something else as far as headwinds that maybe go away, I think you\u2019ve seen you might have talked about anticipating at some point, can you just add a little bit more color there?","Dean Scarborough","","Sure. Actually the mix trends are less negative, so we did see a positive impact of that sequentially. But we did run and I hate to blame the weather, but we could run into some weather related problems during the quarter. We had 13 plant days of no shipments and therefore to hit customer service requirements had cost us a bit more money, we have some currency impact. We had some extra expenses that went the wrong way for the quarter. So normally we have puts and takes in the quarter and this year we had a few more takes than puts.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital","So, when we look at the targets you\u2019ve outlined so far, I mean you did say at the last Analyst Day, I think you updated since then 9% to 10% operating margin for this segment. These headwinds that you are facing you think you are more cyclical and more one-time in nature, are they secular trends that are difficult to overcome?","Dean Scarborough","","I don\u2019t think they are secular. The business operated over the target range for three quarters last year, we're still at the top of the target range. We are certainly trying to grow the business faster, this is a business that operates at a multiple of the cost of capital, so growing at faster makes some sense. Some of that growth has come with slightly lower margins, but it\u2019s still value creating and we did have a few more bad guys this quarter I think then we normally would have expected and I do expect the weather to be much better in the spring than it certainly was in the winter.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital","Great. Agreed. And then just from the sales perspective, looking at you said combined sales for Graphics, Reflective and Performance Tapes is up mid-single digit. And if I go back I guess to all the way to 2Q of last year, has that particular portion of PSM has grown quite nicely?","Would you consider that a leading indicator for the company or is there a different sub-segment within the company that you would look at as your leading indicator, because the growth there does look relatively strong over the last three to four quarters.","Dean Scarborough","I really think Label and Packaging Materials is the best leading indicator. And there we had good growth everywhere except for North America where we were disappointed, but honestly that was more weather related than anything else.","We don't have market data yet for the first quarter, but the trends we saw from the market data and showed strengthening trends over the last two quarters of last year. So, for me it's been a net positive.","Our Tapes business has been executing extremely well with very nice growth and a lot of that is just crisp execution of their growth strategies for both the personal care business and our industrial tapes business. So we feel good about that but I wouldn't consider that to be a leading indicator.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital","Okay. And then just lastly, I mean you said in your opening comments, off to a solid start for the year, is the playbooks working, organic growth came in at the high end of the range. And yet we see the stocks down considerably today. Is there something that you have been talking to investors about that's been a big disappointment here in the quarter for the year? And then just to add that the PSM, I mean it sounds like some of this is, it's fleeting overtime. Anything you can point to that is causing some concerns?","Dean Scarborough","No, actually I am disappointed with the stock price drop this morning of course, I think everyone is. We are pretty much right on track for the year, I think where -- we felt like we could have done a little bit better, but again we had several kind of one time events and that hurt us a bit but fundamentally the business is seem to be clicking on, I would say 7.5 (inaudible) cylinders if there is such a thing.","And market demand looks pretty good. I feel very good about the organic growth. And we are holding our guidance for the year. As you know we generally don\u2019t change our guidance after the first quarter, it does tend to be, it is our weakest quarter of the year, so it\u2019s hard to draw the trend line. And we saw strengthening coming through the quarter. So you are probably in a better position to understand stock price movings than we are. I can only guess that past few quarters we have been beating and consensus number by a penny of two and this time we came in under, even though we don\u2019t give quarterly guidance, I know some investors track those numbers pretty closely.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital","Thanks, Dean.","Dean Scarborough","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Robert W. Baird & Company. Please proceed.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Company","Hey, guys. How are you?","Dean Scarborough","Hey, Ghansham.","Mitch Butier","How do you do?","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Company","Good, thank you, thank you. Can you first off quantify that (inaudible) weather impact on the first quarter obviously, it impacted a lot of companies in the sector and out of the sector as well, just hoping to get some sort of [quantitatively] on that from you?","Dean Scarborough","Sure, Ghansham. I guess let me comment about the three components I mentioned, I mention about the price inflation gapping a modest headwind and headwind from the currency and then also from the higher cost in North America which a good portion of that was weather, each of those had a $0.01 to $0.02 impact within the quarter. And if you look at which ones of those will actually reverse out immediately going into Q2, there is $0.02 that basically will come out right away and that we are working to manage through the rest of them as well.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Company","Okay. So it was pretty considerable. And then in terms of margins for PSM, 2013 was pretty strong, 2Q and 3Q in particular from an operating margin standpoint, just given some of the mix issues and some of the productivities you have lined up for this business, do you expect margins to be up year-over-year for this business assuming the mid point of your range in terms of sales growth, sorry?","Dean Scarborough","","Yes, Ghansham, we don\u2019t give segment guidance but let me just talk a little bit about what we are doing this year. We are trying to accelerate our growth rate which makes a lot of sense, it\u2019s value creating for business with its high returns. The second thing is we are executing a major restructuring action in Europe closing the factory that will cost us some money this year on the expense line, but we are doing it to make ourselves more competitive and therefore it should definitely see some improvement than in our operating margins for 2015 and beyond. So we are going to obviously give a lot more color to that as we talk about our targets in May.","One other factor here is that our graphics and tapes and reflective businesses have higher than average margins and we have an opportunity to grow those businesses a bit faster so that\u2019s another real positive.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Company","Okay. And just one final one on RBIS in terms of the geographic sales breakdown between the two major regions there?","Dean Scarborough","Still stronger in Europe. We are actually -- I should say European-based retailers and brands because obviously some of those companies in the fast fashion, in performance athletic have global footprint. The U.S. was negative, when you take out the impact of the RFID, our customer, it was low single-digit positive. And what we see in the U.S. frankly is again good performance in the performance athletic area but some of the mass merchandise business hasn\u2019t been that good and I think it reflects somewhat consumer sentiment.","Fortunately, we did start to see a apparel sales for customers start to rebound, in the March timeframe I think most of apparel companies have reported pretty good results. So, we\u2019re hopeful, but the one thing I am very pleased with though is the amount of margin improvement we were able to drive even with a relatively low organic sales growth rate in the quarter.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Company","Okay. Thanks so much.","Dean Scarborough","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citigroup Global Markets. Please proceed.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets","Good morning.","Dean Scarborough","Good morning.","Mitch Butier","Hey, Anthony.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets","Just following-up on the European restructuring. I was wondering if you could give us any color on how costs will flow through the year and how operating margin improvement is that something that we should think of is really being back-end loaded? And if you can, in terms of the plan closure in the Netherlands that you [Technical Difficulty] timing on that?","Dean Scarborough","","Sure. Anthony you broke up a little bit towards the end, but I think your question was around timing of the European restructuring when we see the saving. So one thing I will say is savings are going to be next year, so there is no real restructuring savings in 2014, it\u2019s in 2015. And then we have some transitioning cost when you implement a big restructuring like this. And that will hit Q2 or Q3, the timing of this is still being worked through as we\u2019re going through the process of announcing the plant closure.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets","","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then you tightened up your organic sales growth guidance, but your full year earnings guidance is unchanged; and I guess that\u2019s a fairly wide range 8% to 19% earnings growth. As you look to the rest of the year, I\u2019m just wondering what would be the major factors that would swing you potentially to the upper-end or the lower-end of that range outside of just volume and demand growth?","Dean Scarborough","Yes. I think a lot of it again has to do with the organic sales growth, and I think that pretty good proxies for that still a pretty wide range 3.5 to 5. The number one question we always had in the second quarter is the lengths and strength of the second quarter ordering season for apparel. And it\u2019s something we just don\u2019t have a lot forward visibility to. And to a certain extent that has a fairly that will have a big impact certainly on the second quarter, which is a fairly strong quarter for us.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets","Okay. And then maybe just a last question, dovetailing on that. As you look through the first three weeks of the month, what have business trends been like and order trends been like in RBIS and PSM?","Dean Scarborough","It is pretty much as we expected and certainly inline with our guidance. Again, it's always a tricky period it\u2019s three weeks, we have had Easter in there. And I\u2019d say fundamentally, they are okay. The one thing we just don't know especially for RBIS is the length of time that the strong ordering period will start.","I mean if you look at the whole company, we started off slow in January, little better in February, March was quite strong. And our order rate has been just fine for the first three weeks of April, but again, trying to predict that out. It's how, the end of May early June look is, it's just hard to do.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets","Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Dean Scarborough","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Zekauskas from JP Morgan Securities. Please proceed. ","Silke Kueck - JP Morgan Securities","Hi, good morning. It's Silke Kueck for Jeff. How are you?","Dean Scarborough","Hi Silke.","Silke Kueck - JP Morgan Securities","Were all of the $10 million in cost savings in the RBIS segment?","Mitch Butier","The vast majority were in RBIS, yes.","Silke Kueck - JP Morgan Securities","Okay. And secondly, I was wondering how your raw material cost are trending like your paper cost, your propylene cost, like it seem to us like a little bit of like a headwind in the first quarter, which would make sense because propane prices moved up, again now a downward moving. So, I was wondering maybe you had some comments on that?","Dean Scarborough","Yes, sure. So this is one of the areas where we've seen a little bit of a shift that I commented on around the modest headwind from the price inflation gap. And we've been talking about experiencing inflationary pressures for the last few quarters. And it started materializing a little bit more in Q1 than we had seen previously.","And while we are seeing the pressures are coming in [adhesive] components, as well as in paper, paper is a profit, all time right now at least for long time. So that\u2019s where we are seeing the pressures and we are working to offset that through procurement actions, further productivity reducing the material content of the products we produce. And so, and then what we can\u2019t offset that will be evaluating price adjustments and so forth. Again pretty modest in the quarter, we are feeling the pressures it did go again just a couple of cents in the quarter.","Silke Kueck - JP Morgan Securities","How much pricing that you get generally in quarter if any?","Dean Scarborough","We got through the pricing, so you really have to look at it region-by-region. We\u2019ve talked in the last quarter about some additional surcharge that we are putting through North America those went through as far as the -- we have a lot of pricing in emerging regions, links to currency movements, so that\u2019s just offsetting the movement in imported, higher import cost of raw materials in those regions. But those pricing are all going through, but overall pricing it\u2019s a competitive situation and that\u2019s where things are.","But hope -- generally again pricing and raw material inflation is relatively neutral what we\u2019ve seen over the last number of quarters, this time I want to guess just a couple of sense, so not significant, but a little bit of a shift.","Silke Kueck - JP Morgan Securities","Last question, of the $0.01 to $0.02 and whether headwinds maybe $0.01 to $0.02 you know raw material price headwinds. Do you think you will make, you can make all of that debt in the second quarter or maybe you would make up half of this and then the other half in the third?","Dean Scarborough","No. So, I think some of that\u2019s what goes out immediately for the things like weather and so forth, a couple of sense we should be cover immediately going in the second quarter others we\u2019ve got a work through and address between Q2 and Q3 and work to offset.","Mitch Butier","","One comment I would make is that quarter came in pretty much right at our expectation and our planning. So, I would say that if you sense any disappointment other than the drop in the stock price, it\u2019s really about we felt that we probably could have performed better in the quarter. Now from our internal planning and modeling perspective, we came in right where we thought we would.","Silke Kueck - JP Morgan Securities","What I would say when I look at my model I saw that in terms of mix sales I saw that Pressure-sensitive would have done better and RBIS a little bit worsen I saw and that sort of like would happen and then for profit performance was different what was expected before, there was very little margin in Pressure-sensitive can you explain why and RBIS did so much and I guess that we also captured the cost savings? And then I guess going forward, I am assuming that the majority of the cost savings for the year also will be captured and RBIS, have I understand that correctly?","Dean Scarborough","","Yes. And next year you will see a shift towards PSM again because of the European restructuring. That\u2019s absolutely right, Silke.","Silke Kueck - JP Morgan Securities","Can I ask one more question on the cash flow statement if I could? That have a very large work, a negative working capital number in the quarter, I mean I understand there are inventory builds early in the year. Does some of it also relate to like some again bonus payments that get done or why is that number so large in the first quarter?","Mitch Butier","","Sure. So, a couple of comments, if you are asking seasonally why is free cash flow always negative in Q1, there is a couple of reasons for that, part of it just the way seasonality of the business so December sales are depressed relative to other months and so when we collect cash from those sales in Q1 that\u2019s lower than. So that\u2019s one reason. The other is incentive compensation payments as you say happen in the first quarter as well.","So that\u2019s why seasonally Q1 is always a negative. As you saw we had a pretty bigger outflow this year than we had last year, few reasons for that. One is if you recall last quarter I mentioned just because of the year-end timing basically 2013, about $30 million I said moved from the first weeks of what we normally see in the first few weeks of the year into year-end \u201813. That was $30 million, you can see the CapEx timings another $20 million.","And the rest of it is around just working capital timing and a key piece of this is around the receivables as far as moving around that, part of that is geographic mix, our terms are longer in the emerging markets where we\u2019re seeing the most growth. Part of that was timing of sales within the quarter, as Dean said, higher sales growth in March than we saw in the first couple of months, so that moves the working capital as well.","So we are seeing a little bit of a shift there. Again free cash flow came in as expected and I think the key thing here is we are not seeing any increased risk from a bad debt exposure or anything else. You can actually see that in the financial statements as well.","Silke Kueck - JP Morgan Securities","And do you still expect to buyback like I don\u2019t know 5 million shares this year?","Mitch Butier","Well, our estimate for the average amount of shares outstanding for the year is 97 million given that we usually have 2 million, but the math would get you to roughly 5 million so.","Silke Kueck - JP Morgan Securities","Okay. Then thank you very much for the clarifications. And I\u2019ll get back into queue.","Dean Scarborough","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","George Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Hi guys good morning.","Dean Scarborough","Hi George.","George Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","How are you doing? Couple of things, one are you in a position at this juncture to talk about what the savings might be in Europe from the capacity realignment?","Mitch Butier","","Yes. The savings next year is expected to be around $15 million.","George Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay. Thank you for that. And then in Europe incremental margin in RBIS this past quarter was exceptional because you were getting all of the restructuring savings, obviously a lot has been driven by volume, but if we can hold normal levels of volume whatever that might be say certainly no worse than what we saw in the first quarter, should we continue to see stronger than normal incremental margin in RBIS the rest of 2014 from what you can see right now?","Mitch Butier","I think George, it depends on the sales growth of course we always had headwinds. So we get, if we get growth above 1.5% or so, we have really good pull through.","Dean Scarborough","Yes. I think the thing to focus on is overall we\u2019ve had expected and we have a full point plus of EBIT margin expansion both in \u201814 and \u201815 to be able to hit our targets. And we are expecting that full point for this year. You saw we had a little bit more of that in Q1, any one quarter can have a little bit more or less than that just timing of when marketing expenditures can come in one year versus the other and so forth. So I think that point that we\u2019ve been talking about the right proxy overall for the year.","George Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay, understood. I\u2019m not trying to get month-by-month, quarter-by-quarter margins and target, but you had 100% incremental margin in a quarter where you didn\u2019t really have your normal revenue growth rate in RBIS, so it was exceptional. So just trying to see if that we should continue to expect better than average margin expansion there and I appreciate the color there? Can you talk at all about what, there were some capacity closures in Pressure-sensitive Materials in North America, what if any effects that\u2019s having on your business in customer base this year if at all, do you have any view on that right now? And similarly, I noticed that one of your peers is expanding capacity in Asia, any initial views on whether it might have a negative effect on you this year, probably not, but in the next couple of years?","Dean Scarborough","George, yes. In North America, anytime a company announces a closure of the factory, it\u2019s generally an opportunity to go after some business, because customers are forced to re-qualify material. So, certainly we probably had more than the average number of phone calls about security of supply et cetera, et cetera. So, I think that could be a small upside for us in the balance of the year. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be anything hugely material to us, just given the relative size of that plant versus our business.","In Asia, it\u2019s been 10 years since our competitor put in a big new asset. So, I\u2019m not surprised that after 10 years, they have got to add some capacity. they\u2019ve taken out capacity in Australia and South Africa. And so, this is really a regional add, it\u2019s not just a country add in China. And in the meantime, I\u2019d just comment, we\u2019ve added several new coding assets during that period of time.","So, given the growth in that market over there, it\u2019s not really surprise. And I don\u2019t anticipate any major disruption in our business in Asia in the last couple of areas.","Our customer surveys indicate that and especially in that region which you know is very high growth says that we have still quite an edge in terms of product quality and service over all of our competitors. And we expect to maintain that as we go forward.","George Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. One question more and I will turn it over and come back in queue. Obviously you can\u2019t talk about your day-to-day changes in capital allocation policy depending on which way the stock is going. But given that the stock has done fairly well here in the last few months getting to date for a minute. How do you view the attractiveness of buyback incrementally from here relative to dividend, can you update us on your thoughts on dividend policy? Thanks.","Dean Scarborough","So on dividend George, we have a Board meeting tomorrow and that\u2019s the meeting where the Board decides on the dividend increase. So we will let everyone know tomorrow in a press release. As far as timing of share buyback et cetera, we don\u2019t comment on that specifically. But I think given our track record, how do I look at it, I look at as pull back in the stock as a buying opportunity frankly.","Mitch Butier","Yes. So George, when we go through that assessment, we have a number of things to evaluate as we think about pace of share buyback, the biggest one is just our assessment of intrinsic value, and then we basically look around volatility of the stock over time. And when there is more distance between the stock prices, meaning the stocks trading at more of a discount to intrinsic value, we buy more and we buy less as it gets closer, so that\u2019s how we think about it.","George Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay guys, thanks for the call. I will come back.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed.","Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Thank you. Good morning all.","Dean Scarborough","Good morning.","Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Could you touch a little on your increasing employee expenses, are your hiring these people in order to push the growth you\u2019ve talked about during the call or is it just your inflation; could you give us a better feel as to what is happening there or what happened in the first quarter and what do you expect for the balance of the year?","Mitch Butier","","It\u2019s all wage inflation, 90 plus percent of it, Rosemarie. So we have and as we have talked RBIS has relative to their size more wage inflation than the Pressure-sensitive Materials but that\u2019s what it is. It\u2019s not any large investments or anything else that we are doing, we are not asking to add back any shifts or anything around for capacity, so we are -- it\u2019s all wage inflation.","Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","","Okay, thanks. And you have [listing] advantage medical, and I know it is small, but you have a target of above 5% operating margin and we are obviously nowhere near that. Could you give us a feel as to where that margin is going to come from? And you only have one and half years to get to it, are you changing your outlook?","Mitch Butier","","Well actually, we changed the segment because we had our DES business was a substantially larger business and certainly had some nice profitable business which we sold last year and we never updated the guidance for that segment. We will update investors in the main meeting but I will say we expect the asset to be profitable next year in 2015.","Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","","Okay. And you\u2019ve talked, if I may ask one other question, you talked about the extra week in the fourth quarter adding 1%, I am assuming it is to revenues; is that 1% to the fourth quarter revenues or could it be because of the timing, a number that could be as large as 1% on full year revenues?","Mitch Butier","So, it\u2019s 1% for the full year, and it all comes in the fourth quarter, so it will be about 3.5%, 4% impact on Q4 itself. But we do not include that in our organic sales growth guidance and when we talk through it, so we basically exclude the impact of the extra week.","Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","","Okay. So that should translate into a positive supplies as we get into that quarter or do you expect some offsetting numbers which is why you\u2019re excluding it?","Mitch Butier","No, so we excluded just on the top-line just to show what the true underlying trends are. And from a bottom-line perspective, I think that\u2019s what your question is, we do not expect us to have much of an impact at all on the bottom-line. So normally adding a week, you\u2019d normally expect a 2% lift for the full year, we\u2019re only saying one because the week that is being added for the year, it\u2019s week essentially between Christmas and New Year; it\u2019s a very soft volume week. And so the variable margin we have on those sales are really just enough to cover the fixed cost.","Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","","Okay. That is very helpful. Thank you very much. And just summarizing, you are expecting the full $20 million of savings in 2014 to hit RBIS results and you already have 10 of that in the first quarter and then next year you expect the full 15 million to hit PSM results?","Mitch Butier","Yes, the plan is $15 million next year and it\u2019s $40 million is the full year number for restructuring in 2014, which we received roughly $10 million in the first quarter.","Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Thank you. Thanks a lot.","","Mitch Butier","You are welcome.","Operator","","We have a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","George Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi guys. You had mentioned that there were three buckets if you will of more takes if you will this quarter, past quarter than puts that were in, price cost, FX, and weather related cost, correct me if I may -- I\u2019m often any of that jargon. You said that you\u2019d be able to begin to see $0.02 reversal in the second quarter which mostly around weather and that you\u2019d work around capturing the rest of that over the rest of the year. Now I can understand price cost managed by reduced cost to trying to improve pricing but on the FX side what else might you be doing on the internal rates pricing more quickly than the FX affect on EBIT.","Mitch Butier","","So the couple of cents that go away immediately relate to the we said higher cost in North America manufacturing cost, of which a good chunk of that was weather that will go away immediately. And of course, the FX will be another piece that is expected to go where there is quite a bit of volatility near the end of the quarter, more than you normally see. And we have hedging practices in place, we manage that but on the front, you always have a little bit of movement. And we are sure it\u2019s not something we normally comment on and that\u2019s what Dean\u2019s point was as we always have things, puts and takes and there were just more of them going in one direction. So a portion of that is going away as well. So $0.02 we expect to be gone right away, the other item we\u2019ve got to work through.","George Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Understood. Just a related question, I didn\u2019t take from your comments, did not take from your comments that the competitive landscape has changed or the negative rollup to the amount of price cost compression that you had in the first; from my experience of covering here that\u2019s bought a variety of type of compression, you see one if the costs are growing up, there is normally some lag time on pricing. But correct me, if I\u2019m wrong, aren\u2019t you would back seeing more competition than normal, your markets aren\u2019t a walk in the park, I recognize it. But are you seeing more competition than normal and in fact you are signaling that?","Mitch Butier","No, I wouldn\u2019t say, there has been an increase in intensity in the competitive landscape. In fact, market overall market growth, I would say in Pressure-sensitive certainly has been better. That\u2019s been helpful.","We\u2019ve been taking market share fairly consistently across the board. So, I don\u2019t really sense and it\u2019s always competitive. But I don\u2019t see a shift.","George Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Understood. Dean, last question I had for you, you mentioned trying to improve the flow through, the incremental margin if you will in the Pressure-sensitive business. What specifically are you doing to try to affect that? Are you changing incentives to the sales force to try to incentivize sales of higher margin products? What are you deliberately now going to pursue the less margin rich volume, to a lesser degree than in the past? What, how are you trying to implement that? Thank you guys and good luck in the quarter.","Dean Scarborough","Thanks George, and good question. The sales force is incented for part of their incentives in Pressure-sensitive for selling a richer mix. So, certainly a component of that in their pay. We are focused on higher margin categories of product, a lot of our innovation frankly is designed around products that have higher value and therefore a higher flow through. So all of those things are underway. And in fact we did see a shift from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, unfortunately it was offset by things like weather and currency and a little bit of inflation. So the areas where we targeted and focus were showing progress and now given us I would say somewhat shift in the environment, we will just take some additional actions.","George Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Mr. Scarborough, there are no further questions at this time, I will now turn the call back to you. Please continue with your presentation or closing remarks.","Dean Scarborough","Thank you, our playbook is straight forward and it\u2019s working and we are going to continue down this path. Innovation will continue to be a hallmark for our businesses, further strengthening our industry leading position in all of our key markets. With modest top-line growth, ongoing productivity improvements and highly disciplined capital management, we will continue to drive double-digit earnings growth and solid free cash flow, most of which will get back to shareholders. I look forward to speaking with many of you at our meeting in May. Thanks for joining us today. Good bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

These forward-looking statements are made subject to the Safe Harbor statement included in today's earnings release.","On the call today are Mitch Butier, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Anne Bramman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I'll now turn the call over to Mitch.","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thanks, Cindy, and good day, everyone. I'm happy to report another quarter with strong growth in earnings and free cash flow. We beat our expectations for Q2 adjusted EPS by about a $0.05 driven by another exceptional quarter in PSM. We continue to drive above average growth in high-value product segment and improve our competitiveness and profitability across the entire portfolio. And we're making good progress with our business model transformation in RBIS.","So starting with Pressure-sensitive Materials. As you know, our goal in PSM has been to create value by organically growing the top-line of this high-return business at 4% to 5%, while expanding operating margin. And I'm pleased to say that the team continues to deliver on both fronts.","In the second quarter, we grew PSM sales by nearly 5% on an organic basis and expanded adjusted operating margins to a new high of 13.5%. Once again, the emerging markets were a key growth driver, up 10% in the quarter.","From a product perspective, high-value Graphics and specialty Labels materials continue to grow at rates well above the segment average, while sales declined for Performance Tapes due largely to the loss of a specific customer application as we've discussed before.","Overall, I'm very pleased with the progress in shifting PSM's portfolio mix towards these higher-value categories. We expect continued benefit over the long-term from our focus and investment in these areas, including acquisitions, exemplified by the Mactac deal that we announced in April.","As for the base business within PSM, what we've often referred to as less differentiated products, we continue to deliver in the second quarter with solid top-line growth overall and margins expanding across the board.","Speaking of which, overall profitability for PSM exceeded our expectations, reflecting leverage on strong volume growth, continued discipline with respect to pricing in the base business, and, of course, exceptional execution on the productivity front.","Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. Sales were up a little over 2% organically, driven by Radio Frequency Identification. I'm happy to report that RFID sales were up nearly 50% in Q2. The case for RFID is clear and we remain the go-to-supplier in the market. So, we expect this to continue to be a key growth driver for us going forward. Outside of RFID, top line growth was short of our target for the quarter amidst the challenging apparel market, in particular, continued challenges experienced by the department stores and inventory reductions associated with athletic goods store closures.","That said, we are seeing signs of success from our multi-year transformation strategy, becoming faster, simpler, and more competitive, while driving margin expansion. Specifically, we saw solid volume gains in both the value and fast fashion segments of the market during Q2, and unit volume for the department stores were relatively stable, an improvement over recent trends.","We are also on track to deliver planned restructuring savings from the transformation. With these actions we're taking to improve our competitiveness in the base business along with the lift from RFID, even in a relatively modest apparel retail market, I am confident we will achieve our 2018 margin target for RBIS.","Now looking at Vancive Medical Technologies. While this business reported solid margin expansion in the quarter, we're not yet performing at the level we expect. We began taking actions mid-last year that are beginning to refill our product pipeline and have recently reestablished the organizational link between our Vancive and Performance Tapes business. Long-term, these actions, combined with strong growth from our new product platform, should enable us to deliver consistent organic growth and double-digit margins in this business.","So, coming back to the total company view. In terms of our outlook for 2016, we have raised our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05, reflecting the strong results we delivered in the second quarter.","Even more important, we remain highly confident in our ability to consistently deliver exceptional value over the long run, based on the execution of our key strategies. First and foremost, being our focus on driving outsized growth in high-value segments, we will continue to invest disproportionately here, both organically and through bolt-on acquisitions. Over time, this will improve our portfolio mix and bolster our leadership in these key segments. Second, we are relentless in our pursuit of productivity improvement to enhance our competitiveness across all product categories and, of course, drive margin expansion. And third, we are maintaining our high degree of capital efficiency, while increasing investments to support profitable growth. And, of course, we will continue our disciplined approach to returning cash to shareholders.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Anne.","Anne L. Bramman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Mitch. I'll be providing a little more color on the quarter.","In Q2, we delivered a 20% increase in adjusted earnings per share on 4% organic sales growth. Currency translation reduced reported sales by 1.7% in the second quarter with an approximately $0.03 impact to EPS. Adjusted operating margin in the second quarter improved 120 basis points to 10.7%, as the benefit of productivity initiatives and higher volume more than offset the net impact of price and raw material input costs and higher employee-related expenses. We realized about $21 million of incremental savings from restructuring charges, net of transition costs. The adjusted tax rate was 34%, consistent with the anticipated full-year tax rate in the low- to mid-30% range. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $152 million, an increase of $38 million compared to last year, reflecting the increase in earnings and timing of tax payments.","During the first half of the year, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares, and paid $70 million in dividends. Net of dilution, we reduced our share count by 1.2 million, for a net cost of $119 million, bringing the total amount of cash returned to shareholders so far this year to roughly $190 million. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have ample capacity to fund acquisitions as well as to continue returning cash to shareholders in a disciplined manner.","Now, looking at the segment. Pressure-sensitive Materials sales were up approximately 5% on an organic basis. Emerging markets continued to be strong contributor to growth for this segment. With organic growth of 10%, emerging markets represented a majority of this segment's top-line growth in Q2, in line with the preceding quarter, and our long-term expectations.","A key exception to the strong growth trend has been China, where sales were roughly flat in the quarter on an organic basis. In North America, sales declined modestly on an organic basis, while Western Europe remains solid, up mid-single-digits. As noted previously, we continue to see strong growth in many of PSM's high-value segments. Within Label and Packaging Materials, specialty film and papers products were up 10% on an organic basis. And Graphics grew high-single-digits. In contrast, sales of Performance Tapes were down mid-single-digits on an organic basis for the reasons we've discussed.","PSM's adjusted operating margin of 13.5% was up 120 basis points over last year, as the benefits from productivity and higher volume more than offset higher employee-related costs and a net impact of price and raw material input costs. By the way, that net gap between deflation and pricing was a modest negative for the quarter. We wanted to highlight it given the change in direction from preceding quarters.","Once again, the team delivered the majority of this quarter's margin improvement through ongoing productivity efforts, including product reengineering and restructuring.","Now, shifting to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. RBIS sales grew 2% on an organic basis, driven by growth of Radio Frequency Identification products, which were up nearly 50% in the quarter. We now anticipate full-year sales for these products to be up more than 30% in 2016, recognizing that the comps get significantly more challenging in the second half. Adjusting for the impact of RFID, organic growth for core labels and tags was down low-single-digits, reflecting modest growth in volume, which was more than offset by the impact of strategic pricing actions that we began to take late last year.","As you know, we began lowering our prices in some categories late in 2015 to become more competitive, so the sales growth comparisons become easier in the fourth quarter. From a regional perspective, we saw strong unit volume growth for core European retailers and brand owners. This reflects excellent progress in expanding our share among the fast fashion players.","In contrast, unit volumes declined in the U.S., where we have a relatively high share position among department stores. Notwithstanding the modest volume growth in pricing adjustments we've made, adjusted operating margin for this segment improved by 30 basis points, reflecting the benefit of the restructuring and other cost reduction actions we've taken to transform our business model. We remain on track to achieve our margin target for this business by 2018.","Turning now to our outlook for the balance of the year. We have raised the range of our guidance for adjusted earnings per share by $0.05 to $3.80 to $3.95. We outlined some of the key contributing factors to our EPS guidance on slide eight of our supplemental presentation materials.","Highlighting the changes from our previous guidance, we now expect the currency translation will reduce net sales by approximately 2.5% and pre-tax earnings by roughly $18 million, or an estimated $0.13 per share, $0.02 worse than our April guidance.","We have reduced the high end of our organic growth outlook and now expect full year sales to grow between 3% and 4% on an organic basis. We anticipate that the Mactac deal will close in August, resulting in roughly a point of incremental sales, with an immaterial impact to EPS this year, reflecting various transition costs. We have reduced our estimate for severance and other restructuring-related costs included in reported EPS by approximately $0.05.","So just wrapping up, we're very pleased with the strategic and financial progress we made against our 2018 goals this past quarter. I'm confident we will continue to deliver exceptional value over the long term through superior execution of our strategies, including the disciplined allocation of capital.","And now, we'll open the call up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird & Co. Please go ahead.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Good morning, Ghansham.","Anne L. Bramman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","First off, on the PSM emerging market growth of 10%-plus. I know you called out China as being flat across the emerging markets, but what about some of the other regions on the emerging markets side, Brazil, Southeast Asia, et cetera, and then what was North America up during the quarter?","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, so just talking about the emerging markets, so China was relatively flat, as Anne commented on. Everything else up, pretty exceptional growth. If you look at Southeast Asia, that was very healthy double-digits as was India and Eastern Europe returned to good growth trajectory as well. Some of that we think is a little bit of pipeline fill within the quarter, but even if you back that out, returned to a healthy growth level. And, Latin America, we continue to see solid growth. A lot of that comes from pricing, as you know, but even on the volume front, we saw it return to growth, particularly in Brazil.","Now, some of that has to do with the elections that come up that always have a benefit for us and not sure what the impact is specifically from the Olympics, but we assume that it had some positive lift as well. So, pretty broad-based on the emerging market exposure and you're seeing a little bit of shift. If you look at the last number of years, China was a lead driver of the emerging market growth and we're starting to see that our strategy of being a leader in all markets is paying off with China starts to slow down, the rest of the emerging markets is carrying the load, and then North America, which is down modestly.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Okay. Thanks for clarifying that. And then just generally on the RBIS outlook. I mean, obviously, apparel has been mixed in North America for a while now. I know you have some company-specific initiatives to gain share in the market, but are there any adjacent markets that you see opportunities and to sort of diversify away from retail apparel to some extent over time?","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","I think there is two specific items, one is if you think about RFID, RFID is really an intelligent label and we are looking at how do we \u2013 the first place to adopt was within the apparel market and we were vertically integrated there, so we're looking at how we leverage our manufacturing prowess as a company at large and specifically the knowledge within RBIS and RFID to leverage that more broadly, which is something we think will be a key growth driver for us in the long-term.","The other one, which doesn't reduce the exposure to apparel, but does create a growth driver for us, is the external embellishment. So, the heat transfer labels. This business, if you look 10 years ago, it was only about the heat transfer labels on the interior of the garment. We are going to the exterior garment where it's actually part of the branding that is displayed whether it'd be for brands or sports teams and so forth and that will continue to be a key growth driver for us as well.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And just one final question maybe for Anne on Mactac. Any other modeling parameters that you can share with us for 2016, assuming the model \u2013 the August close, I think you call out 1% sales contribution, but what about EBITDA? Thanks so much.","Anne L. Bramman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So just consistent with what we said, the 1% for the full year impact and then EPS is, there is really no impact, given all the transition costs associated with, for the back half of the year.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And one question on \u2013 and one on margins, obviously PSM margins in the first half of 13.2% were well above your long-term target, the corporate margin of 10.2% in the first half was also above the high-end of your 2018 target. To the extent your margins are expanding on account of productivity efforts and volume growth, why would that not be sustainable, and what do you think sustainable margins are at this point and why?","Anne L. Bramman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Thanks. So as we talked about, we are really pleased with where we are, and we're achieving new highs in this business. We talked about margin in Q1, we were seeing new highs then as well, and we were \u2013 we never want to cap this business. And so, we're cautious, but we never want to cap this business. We talked about was \u2013 in Q1, with my comments related relative to the average for the year. And so when you think about the second half of the year, we've talked about a couple of headwinds that we've got. First of all, the loss of a customer in the Performance Tapes business, which has impacted about a point for the full year, but really back half weighted. And the second thing is just normal seasonality of this business as well. And so, if you think about second half, it generally doesn't have the same profitability ratio that you would have with the first half of the business that you would see.","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, so overall...","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Do you still think, Anne \u2013 I'm sorry, go ahead.","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","...from my perspective, we've been consistent saying we're continuing to test new heights, and we're going to continue to do that. In this business, we've expanded operating margin by 300 basis points over the last three years. And so that's something we're going to continue to drive to, to see what the right balance is, from an EVA perspective of driving good organic profitable growth, having the right margin level, and capital efficiency, and we continue to test new highs, and clearly we don't feel limited by the targets we set long-term or anything else. So that's what we're going to continue doing and as Anne commented on.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Mitch. Just two other ones; one on the organic sales growth guidance for the year, can you just talk about why you modestly took down the high-end of the range there?","Anne L. Bramman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So, the high-end of the range, we said that earlier, part of that was assuming that you would have the sustained growth for the whole year. And as we talked about, we do have a point of headwind primarily in the back half for Performance Tapes, so the other piece to it is really on RBIS. So, in order to sustain the growth, we've already saw the growth rates coming down a little bit in Q2, and so we modified that. You would have to assume that you're back to full on growth rate and covering for that in the Q1 run rate.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it.","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","And just looking at the second half, the organic growth rate of 4%, the first half was around 3.9%, so it's basically same. We'd overcome the challenges that Anne is saying, it's the high-end of our guidance, so we don't look it as lowering \u2013 we lowered the top end, but if we left it at 4.5%, it would imply that growth dramatically improves in the second half, which is not what we're predicting right now.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Sure. Sure. I hear you Mitch. And just last one on pension, if current interest rates were to hold through year-end, can you talk about what the impact might be on your discount rate, PBO, and pension expense for next year? And thanks very much.","Cynthia S. Guenther - Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations","Why don't I follow-up with you on that after the call, I'm frankly not as buttoned up \u2013 this is Cindy \u2013 on all of those answers, so follow up after the call.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup Global Markets, please go ahead.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. On the RBIS pricing actions, I was wondering if it's possible to say how long you expect those to be a headwind, do you lap that headwind at the end of the year or is it possible that pricing actions maybe move into 2017? And then, kind of relatedly, is it possible to quantify how much market share you've gained back since starting these actions or just qualitatively can you give us any color in terms of how you feel from a market share perspective?","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. So, there is always pricing actions at various levels, but the specific actions we took late last year, we do cycle through beginning in the second half, so it blends in beginning in Q3 through the end of Q4, so we do cycle through that then. And as far as from a share gain perspective, relative to the growth that we're seeing within fast fashion, our growth levels are exceeding the end market. So, we are very confident we're taking share there. From a value perspective, we believe we're taking share within value and contemporary.","So, department stores tough to read, as I commented on, the volumes there the trends that we're seeing are positive and audio gap] (22:45) we're seeing their performance in the marketplace. We believe we are now regaining share there. That was a space, if you recall, along with value, we were losing share on up until beginning late last year, if you will. So, we believe we're starting to shift the share mix overall for those businesses, but we'll have to see how their performance plays out here over the next couple of quarters.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then, on the restructuring costs, the impact to EPS was lowered $0.20 to $0.15, but the savings remain the same. Can you just provide a little bit more color on that, why is the restructuring program going to cost less than originally anticipated or what's the progress there?","Anne L. Bramman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","There's a couple of things that we looked at. First of all, we went and really trued-up our estimates of these costs and so we saw some \u2013 we were a little conservative, so we trued that up, and we're seeing a little bit of favorability on that. And then, quite frankly, some of this just some of the timing of when the costs are actually going to be recorded or hit in the year, so some of that will have a little bit of the timing shift.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. So, it gets pushed into 2017 or...?","Anne L. Bramman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, early 2017.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Louis Gaffner with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, Mitch and Cindy. How are you doing?","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Scott.","Anne L. Bramman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thanks.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Mitch, I just wanted to focus again on Pressure-sensitive for a second, just given the margin performance in the quarter. Is it the margin profile of the products that you're selling in the emerging markets is pushing the margin here or is it the incremental margins on the 10% growth rate or how should we think about what was really pushing that incremental margin in 2Q?","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. So, broad-based, it is not one specific item or theme here. I think the key thing, as I said, exceeded our expectations, even the high-end of our expectations for the quarter, the biggest single driver was the variable flow-through of the additional volume that we saw. The growth rate within PSM was above, if you will, the margin \u2013 I mean the guidance range we had for the whole business for the year, and it definitely was a little bit higher than we expected, particularly coming out of Europe. So that was a key driver overall, Scott, for the PSM performance in Q2.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And, Anne, I think you mentioned, though, that price cost was negative view, do you expect that to continue for a couple of quarters within the segment?","Anne L. Bramman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So, we've been talking about this for \u2013 as you know, for a while. And over the cycle, you would normally see that you would see a negative impact of price, cost, and so we wanted to call that out that we are seeing a modest impact this quarter and you would expect to see, over a cycle, that that would continue.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And just on the growth in the business in the emerging markets, Mitch, you mentioned Southeast Asia, India, what are the product categories that are really growing? I mean, even in Latin America you had solid growth, is it more on variable information side of the business, is it on the Consumer Products side? Where are you seeing the growth, where is that coming from?","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","It's broad-based, but just the whole \u2013 I mean, the economy in South Asia, both Southeast Asia as well as India, are doing quite well, and you continue to see expanded consumer spending. So it's Consumer Products linked as well as variable information labels as well, and it's very broad-based and, as I said, it's very healthy double-digit growth there.","I just got back from a three-week trip over in Asia, and I'll tell you just when you're engaging with customers and so forth, they're quite optimistic about the prospects for their countries and their individual industries, and excited by what's going to come, and we are key partners for them, not only helping ourselves but helping them to grow and lead the market to a GDP-plus type of growth.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's good to hear. Just one last one from me on RBIS, and I guess RFID in particular, I think you said that you expect it to be up 30% at the current run rate. How big would that make the RFID business for you if you actually achieve the 30% rate? And then, in addition to that, how have the recent rollouts have been going? Have you seen any customers interested in moving from test to broad-based rollout? Can you just give an update there? Thanks.","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Sure. So, the business after this year will be roughly $200 million for the full year, so pretty sizable relative to the total size of RBIS. And I think that's an important thing to point out, if you look at RFID in our external embellishment, it's roughly 15% of total RBIS right now, whereas it was 6% just five years ago. And so the whole theme we're talking about continuing to improve our portfolio mix and higher value product lines. It's a great example of what's going on within RBIS as well.","So there's a number \u2013 we don't talk about specific customers within RFID, who's going to full rollout and so forth, but I will tell you the pipeline is rich. We've got about 90 customers in the total pipeline, a blend between those that are in full adoption, those that are in rollout, those that are in pilot, and those are at the very early stages of just evaluating the business case. So, continued to see great progress. And, as I said before, we do have the go-to team for the RFID adoption, and that's a leadership position we expect to maintain.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, Mitch.","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Scott.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christopher John Kapsch with BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Christopher J. Kapsch - BB&T Capital Markets","Yeah. Good morning. I had a couple of follow-ups. Just wondering, if you could explain, and why you suppose China was flat vis-\u00e0-vis the growth that you're seeing in other emerging markets. Is there a different competitive dynamic there versus other regions? I know Raflatac did add some capacity over there not too long ago.","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","It's hard to pinpoint to any one thing. I'll tell you, when I was over there, speaking with customers, generally, they're talking about the challenge of just adjusting to a lower growth environment right now. We do expect this business to continue to grow and trying to be a mid-single-digit growth market, which we still consider a very healthy clip. And so, you're seeing a little bit of adjustment down from, I'd say that, industry used to growth closer to 10% and being mid-single-digits.","Specifically, within the quarter, there's a number of puts and takes for being depressed down to the low-single-digits to roughly flat, but no key takeaways right now. And I will say, for our business, a single quarter being flat or growing a few percent, that can happen; our expectation here is mid-single-digits for China.","Christopher J. Kapsch - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. And then just moving sort of western around the world to Europe. Just wondering, if \u2013 I mean the trends there have continued to \u2013 pretty buoyant considering what's gone on over there, and I'm just curious if there has been any change in those trends since the Brexit vote I guess around a month ago?","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","It's actually too early to tell, overall, is what I'd say. Clearly, I think the broader question is just, what does it mean for the EU and so forth? But if you look at where we are, our market leadership position, regardless of market environment, we are well positioned for this and the UK business is just a little over $100 million worth of business, so relatively small in the grand scheme of things.","Personally, think it's a little bit blown out of proportion, a little bit some of the market reaction initially with what we saw. But we're well positioned and, if there's some challenges in the marketplace, we're going to be looking to take advantage of those as the market leader.","Christopher J. Kapsch - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. And if I could just follow up on this Pressure-sensitive segment margin topic, and I know you kind of had referred to first quarter performance, which was strong, as possibly approaching peak, and now we exceeded that performance by 60 basis points sequentially. And it sounds as though like mix is \u2013 obviously, operational excellence is contributing, but also mix with the growth that you've seen in international markets, which, I believe, are higher margin and obviously your emphasis on shifting towards the more value-added products. And it sounds like that's all going to continue, particularly with investment in accelerating the growth of those sorts of product lines. So just wondering given how well you are executing, and given the trajectory of those higher margin businesses, just what's maybe a more realistic longer-term margin expectation for this Pressure-sensitive segment as we continue to move forward here?","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","So, we're not resetting margin targets right now. We've said that this business and the margins that we've had even 11%-plus, it's very healthy returns and our focus is again finding the right balance of top-line gross margins and capital efficiency to optimize EVA. So, we will be setting new targets when we come out. We're going to do an Investor Day. We're now planning for that to be in March, and we will send out a press release with the exact date here in due time, but that will be the time that we reset it.","And again, I want to emphasize here, the previous targets we had, we clearly don't feel limited by those in anyway. We are going continue driving forward and finding that optimum balance. And we've, again, expanded margin by 300 basis points over the last few years. And remember, we've got questions about resetting target, beginning a year and a half ago, how we set them then, we'd probably be talking about should we be resetting them again right now given where our performance is. So, we are testing new heights and we'll continue to do so and we'll update everybody with our long-term expectations in March.","Christopher J. Kapsch - BB&T Capital Markets","Right. Well, and just one quick follow-up, and you'll continue to get the question until you do reset the margins I'm thinking, but the...","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Understood.","Christopher J. Kapsch - BB&T Capital Markets","...just wondering \u2013 yeah \u2013 if you're \u2013 are you constrained \u2013 given the margin performance and how this business has done, are you constrained anywhere where you feel like you need to ramp-up capital in order to capitalize on growth in the Pressure-sensitive division?","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. I wouldn't say constrained, but we have said that we are going to be increasing the pace of capital investment within this business. If you look at the growth rate, to your point, we do need to increase the pace of capital investment, that is something we would expect. If you look the long-term targets that we had laid out couple of years ago, it was roughly an average of a couple of hundred million dollars over the horizon. We haven't been on that pace until now, but we do expect to be ramping up here, specifically to capture profitable growth, to your point.","Christopher J. Kapsch - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks. And kudos on the execution.","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Leon Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on the quarter.","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Hi, George.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess the \u2013 how are you? Very good performance here. I guess the first question I had and we're beating the Pressure-sensitive margin question into the ground, but would you expect from the current level in the second quarter that you achieved that we should be seeing some flattening out from here seasonally, or is that getting too close for comfort and the commentary about 1Q being perhaps close to peak maybe \u2013 created more distraction needed to be and we should just let you run your business and wherever the margins come out, they come out?","Anne L. Bramman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, personally, I like that second option, but I guess I'll have to address the first question. So, look, as I talked about, even in last quarter's call and this quarter's call, we are hitting new heights as we talked about. We do have seasonality in this business. And I think you've seen that historically, traditionally Q4 in particular has quite a dip in margin when you look at the historical trend on this. I would say that, and as I mentioned, we also have the headwind of the Performance Tapes customer in the second half. So we \u2013 when you look at the high-end of the range, you would have to assume that we can largely sustain this and overcome some of these issues as well. But at the high-end, it's really sustaining this, but continuing through and overcoming some of the Performance Tapes customer loss.","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. So, George, just to reinforce what Anne said, we typically see a drop in Q4 by a full point and then we've talked about Tapes, the decline there on the volume side, well that is a high margin business and so that will have a pretty decent impact on the margins as well. And as Anne said, full range of our guidance, we think capture the full range of possible outcomes \u2013 not possible outcomes, but probable outcomes, and the high end has roughly a continuation excluding a little bit of the excess in Q2, a little bit of continuation of margin trends we saw in first half continuing into the second half with the normal seasonal drop and the impact of Performance Tapes.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. I appreciate that additional color, and that helps us here. If we talk about RFID, so I remember from the last quarter, you were expecting 20% growth thereabouts and now you're in excess of 30%. So, I think a lot of the answer here is in relation to what you're saying to, I think, Scott's question about RFID. But have you seen more customers coming to you for trials as the reason for the increase in the growth rate or has it been a greater amount of sale in existing trials that's been driving the increase in the guidance there for the full year, obviously you have tougher comps in the second half.","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Generally, the latter. So, it's an increase in sales to customers that are already in the process of rolling out. So, just being more aggressive, if you will, the customers and their rollout. So, that's been the primary driver. As far as customers switching into full adoption, if you will, or in the rollout, that's something that usually there is a pretty short lead-time from when that's announced and when we'll start sourcing that.","So, the key question here \u2013 we talked a little bit about tough comps in Q4, the question here, will anybody else convert to that next level, which we've seen in the past as you know.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Understood. The last question I had and I'll turn it over because most of my questions have already been asked. When we look at RBIS, and I think you said you are ultimately constructive or pleased with where the business is and I'm putting words in your mouth, so feel free to adapt as you need to.","But when I look at the margin, where the margin dollars year-on-year being flat versus 2Q, in spite of the $60 million net benefit that that segment getting from restructuring and other performance improvements, are you really happy with that business? Should we assume that all of that benefit has been basically used to grow market share through pricing and other actions?","And should we expect a continuation of the playbook and maybe even an intensification of the strategies in that playbook to ultimately try to grow volume and margin for the segment in the next 12 months to 18 months? Thanks, guys.","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, George. Yeah. So, just the comment around RBIS is we're pleased with progress we're making on the transformation, which we are very pleased with our growth that we're seeing in RFID, but that the growth \u2013 organic growth of 2%-plus in the quarter was short of our obviously long-term target that we have for this business. And while it is largely due to the softness in the apparel market, we're looking to grow this business 4% to 5% long-term. So, I would say that, we met our guidance expectations given what was going on in the apparel market. We're pleased with the progress the team is making on the transformation and we knew this was going to be a multi-year transformation as well. So, yes, there is more \u2013 we're continuing to focus on how can we get less complex, simpler, if you will, and more competitive across the entire customer base.","So, this is something that we will continue to be focused on. And I think it's important as you step back, I mean, yes, the top line has been less consistent, if you will, but we have continued to grow this business over the last number of years.","And regardless of market environment, we have consistently expanded margins over each of the years over the last five years. And that's something that we're going to continue to do regardless of the market environment, leveraging our strength in RFID and external embellishments, in our customer relationships across all market segments and are focused on productivity to get more competitive.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey John Zekauskas with JPMorgan Securities. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, thanks very much. I think you said early in the call that volume growth and pressure-sensitive was negative in North America in the quarter. My memory is maybe last year, it grew 4% or 5%, and in the first quarter grew 1% or 2%. Is there a change in trend there or is this quarter an anomaly, what's happening there?","Anne L. Bramman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, the trends \u2013 so we did have negative growth, slightly negative, in this quarter. I don't think we've said that this business has been 4% to 5%. I think even last year, we saw a bit of a modest improvement, low single-digit growth in this business. So, I think, within a band, if you look over the last several quarters, it's within a pretty tight band of where we're seeing this business. I don't think we're seeing dramatic changes in the marketplace.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. You said that there's now a little bit of raw material pressure. So, if raw materials are \u2013 I take it that they're going up or is it that prices are coming down? Where does the squeeze come from, on the price side or on the raw materials side?","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. So, Jeff, we don't comment on the specific components. We talked about the modest net headwind, if you will, which is not exceptional by any stretch if you look at the long-term trajectory within the business.","So, yes. So, overall, I think this message here is stable in general, stable on raw material inflation; that's the type of environment we're seeing. And we continue to see what you'd normally expect in a competitive industry like we're in on the top line.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. In terms of your upcoming acquisition, do you have all of the regulatory approvals for it?","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. So, Jeff, just received word this morning actually that we received final regulatory approval, we expected that to come through, which is why we said we expect it to close in August, but that did actually come through this morning. So, we are still on track and expect to be closing here in the coming weeks.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Will RFID revenues be higher or lower in the second half than in the first half, given that you grew 50% in the second quarter and you expect to grow 30% for the year?","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","They will be higher in the second half. Most of the growth will be in Q3 though, Q4 is particularly where the tough comps are. We still expect some modest growth in Q4, but it will be modest, unless another rollout starts, of course.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And you said that in pressure-sensitive you had inflationary pricing in South America. Did that lead overall to positive pricing for pressure-sensitive in the quarter or negative pricing?","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. So, Jeff, in a number of markets, particularly Latin America, we do have, what we call, currency pricing. So, when the currencies move, because of the lot of the raw material input costs are coming from outside the region. So, it's not having a net positive impact overall in a sizable way to the bottom line; it's just more way to cover the input costs in local currency.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you so much.","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I was...","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Good morning.","Anne L. Bramman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Most of my questions have been answered, but there is one little hole regarding Vancive. Could you give us a little more details on that particular business? Is that $1.6 million of EBIT sustainable over the balance of the year and then we start seeing the substantial margin improvement the next year?","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. So that business we've been talking about being in a turnaround and some of the changes we started making mid-to-late last year around getting the top-line pipeline moving again.","And so, to answer your question specifically, we don't expect the positive margins to stay at that level going into the second half; there will be some headwinds on that front. And also on the top line within that business, we expect to take us into 2017 to kind of see the reverse in this trajectory and the turnaround of that business.","Anne L. Bramman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And just to add to that, we are expecting in the second half that we'll see declines in organic growth in this business.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","And that is due to what?","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Sorry.","Anne L. Bramman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sorry.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","What would be the reason for the decline in organic growth, which is not particularly large to begin with?","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. Specifically, there is an inventory reduction that is expected with one particular customer for one of the core product lines in the second half.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Okay. And looking at RBIS, could you talk about the growth rate? If you eliminate the impact from RFID, what is RBIS all by itself doing or is that something you cannot separate?","Anne L. Bramman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, what we said in earlier comments was that RFID drove the vast majority of the growth in RBIS to organic growth.","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","And it was actually down modestly, excluding RFID, Rosemarie.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Thank you. And when you look at the customers or the garments that are using your products on RBIS. Can you separate \u2013 I mean, you talked about the, no growth or decline in department stores. But could you separate the high-end product garments versus the type of garments that will be sold at a Walmart, at a Target? Could you give us a feel as to what the industry is doing?","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Sure. Overall, and I think it's somewhat reflective of the types of garments, but with the exception of the impact of some inventory reductions that are impacting us in Q2 or impacted us in Q2, performance athletic, for example, high-value athletic garments have done and are expected to continue to do well.","Fashion has done quite well in the market. So, that's a low-cost, high-churn, a lot of fashion elements, that has done well and is expected to continue to do well, which is one of the reasons why we are focusing on driving growth with that segment and taking share.","Value continues to do well and value actually has a range of \u2013 value and contemporary, a full range of high-end garments and more discount garments. So, it's hard to call out specifically what's winning within that space overall.","But I think, what you're seeing here is broad-based, the reason we talked about the department stores. Department stores are \u2013 a number of them having some challenges right now, and fast fashion is a particular growth driver within the industry.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Okay. Thank you very much.","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","We have a follow-up question from the line of George Leon Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, operator. Just last one, quick one, guys. As we think about the guidance for the year and it went up $0.05, which was basically what the variance was, round numbers. In the second quarter, which in turn was driven by pressure-sensitive materials.","Now again I think some of the other analysts have asked the same question. There are lots of things that are going right for pressure-sensitive at the moment; the growth in emerging markets, the mix inherent in those markets and so on. And I recognize seasonally there should be some drop-off, but we wouldn't expect a significant one in the third quarter anyway, relative to second quarter, based on history.","So, should we just very simply assume that the reason you only took your guidance up by the amount that you beat 2Q is that whatever you're seeing improvement in pressure-sensitive is being largely offset at this juncture by RBIS and Vancive the back half of the year? Or would there be any nuances around that? Thanks and good luck in the quarter, guys.","Anne L. Bramman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Great. So, in general, if you look at the range of the guidance, as we talked about earlier, you'd have to assume that you would have higher growth rates in the second half and that you would have to cover for some of the headwinds we've got for seasonality. And don't forget we've got the tapes customer business coming out, which is higher margin than the average for this segment and really is distorted to the second half as well, when we think about the impact of the business. So, you'd have to take into account the Vancive, the RBIS, and then the fact that we've got those headwinds. We also have a $0.02 headwind for FX that you'll see in the guidance as well.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's right. We've tried to account for that customer loss in PSM, but we'll go back to our spreadsheets on that. Again, thanks for all the color, guys. We'll talk to you soon.","Anne L. Bramman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you.","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, George.","Operator","Mr. Butier, I will now turn the call back to you. Please continue with your presentation or closing remarks.","Mitchell R. Butier - President & Chief Operating Officer","Okay. Thank you. So, overall we're pleased with the quarter and pleased with the progress we're making across both of our strategic and financial priorities. We remain committed to achieving our long-term targets by driving accelerated growth in our high value segments and continuing to leverage our strength traditionally in productivity to ensure we continue to have healthy returns and expanding margins across all product categories.","And I want to thank the leadership team, employees everywhere for their hard work, creativity and commitment to our success.

I am happy to report another quarter in line with our expectations for consolidated result as both the top and bottom line. We anticipate solid results for the full year with organic sales growth of roughly 4%, adjusted EPS 12% to 16%, and continued return of cash to shareholders.","The Pressure-sensitive Materials segment delivered organic sales growth of 6% above our expectations for the quarter driven by volume growth in Europe and emerging markets. In addition to delivering another quarter of solid growth in Label and Packaging Materials, we continue to make good progress with Graphics and Performance Tape. Those of who joined us for our Investor Meeting in May know that these products line represent an important strategic focus for us with opportunities for significant share gain in these relatively high variable margin product line.","Year-to-date, we delivered mid-single digit organic sales growth for Graphics while Performing Tape had another strong quarter with double digit sales growth across all region and in both the industrial and personal care product lines. Operating margin for the PSM segment was down compared to the same period last year do impact to sub comparison as well as a few other headwinds including transition cost related to the European consolidation.","We have experienced a few challenges associated with the restructuring action but I am pleased with the progress the team has made on this large complex project and we continue to expect $15 million of savings when the project is completed next year. We are focused on maintaining operating margin for the segment within our recently increased target range of 10% to 11% and we\u2019re targeting the high end of that range over the coming year.","Now turning to Retail Branding and Information Solutions, the team delivered a solid bottom-line result in the phase of some tough market condition from the quarter while top-line growth remains strong with our Europe-based retailers and brand owners driven largely by RFID sales to U.S. based current retailer and brand owners were saw. A key factor appears to be retailers in the U.S. exercising caution with their orders presumably reflecting the anticipation of weak end market demand. This top-line weakness has continued into the first two weeks of the third quarter, but I want to remind everyone that year-on-year comparisons do get easier for the segment as we move throughout the second half of the year.","I am pleased to say the sales of RFID products were robust particularly among European retailers and we continue to expect RFID to be a key long-term growth driver for this business. Notwithstanding the challenging end market condition, RBIS continued to make good progress in executing key productivity initiatives reporting another quarter of strong earnings growth and taking another step forward on the path to our long-term urban target. As you know, we targeted full point of margin expansion for this business each year through 2015 and recently projected continued margin expansion through 2018.","Finally, Vancive Medical Technologies continues to make progress against long-term strategic objectives. Although sales for its new product platforms haven\u2019t begun to ramp up yet, sales for the core products were up 6% in line with expectations. As we continue to target breakeven profitability for the business by next year. So again another solid quarter for us overall. But as I said before while I am generally pleased with our progress we won\u2019t be satisfied until we achieve all of our long-term goals.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mitch.","Mitch Butier","","Thanks Dean and hello everyone. In the second quarter we delivered 4% organic sales growth and a 13% increase in adjusted earnings per share reflecting sales growth in pressure sensitive materials and continued margin expansion in retail branding and information solutions. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter grew 10 basis points to 8.1% at the benefit of our productivity initiatives and top line growth offset the negative impact of higher employee related expenses and products mix.","As part of our productivity initiatives we realized approximately $10 million of restructuring savings in the second quarter. This is net of $3 million of transition costs in pressure sensitive materials due to the consolidation of our European operations. We also incurred restructuring changes of about $40 million in this quarter driven primarily by this one action. Our effective tax rate was 42% in the second quarter and is 30% year-to-date. Our adjusted tax rate for both Q2 and year-to-date was 33% in line with our expectations as we continued to anticipate the full year tax rate to be comparable to last year.","Free cash flow in the second quarter was $85 million versus $105 million last year. As a reminder last year\u2019s free cash flow was relatively high as it included $26 million of proceeds from the sale of some buildings including our former corporate headquarters in Pasadena. We also had a headwind in the second quarter of this year in connection with the final phase of implementing a new financial system.","During the transition to the new system, we paid certain vendors approximately $40 million in advance of our standard terms. This will not impact full year free cash flow as it is a timing item that will be recovered in the second half. We expect to deliver free cash flow of approximately $300 million in 2014 versus our previous guidance which had a floor of $300 million for the year.","We have reassessed the possible timing of vendor payments and customer receipts at year-end and no receipts $300 million as a clear floor given the inherent volatility of working capital balances at year-end. Any reduction in free cash flow in 2014 related to these factors would simply represent a deferral into early next year.","With net debt to EBITDA 1.4 times we remained below our long-term targeted leverage position with ample capacity that continues to return cash to shareholders over the coming years. Along these lines we repurchased 3.1 million shares in the first half at a cost of $153 million more than offsetting delusion and reflecting an increased level of share repurchases in the second quarter.","We will continue to be disciplined and opportunistic when buying back shares. In addition, we paid $61 million in dividends in the first half.","Looking at the segments, Pressure-sensitive Materials sales in the second quarter were up approximately 6% on an organic basis again exceeding our expectations. Labels and Packaging Materials sales grew mid single-digits and the combined sales for Graphics, Reflective and Performance Tapes grew low double-digits. On a regional basis, North America sales for the PSM segment were roughly flat. Western Europe grew mid single-digits and emerging markets grew almost 10%.","PSMs adjusted operating margin of 10.1% in the second quarter was 60 basis points lower than the peak margin reported in the second quarter of last year. During Q2, higher employee related expenses the impact of changes in product mix and a modest headwind from the net impact of pricing and raw material input costs more than offsets the benefit of higher volume and productivity initiatives.","As mentioned earlier we also incurred transition costs related to the restructuring in Europe which reduced margins by about 25 basis points in the quarter for this segment.","While retail branding and information solution sales declined about 1% in the quarter, we delivered significant margin expansion in this segment. RBIS sales reflected weakness from U.S. based retailers and brands particularly in the value segment, largely offset by continued strong demand from Europe based retailers and brands principally from RFID.","As expected RFID revenue is growing again as we have now left the tough comps we\u2019ve discussed in the past. RFID revenue was up 40% in Q2 and 14% through the first half. Despite the sales decline in the second quarter RBIS again demonstrated continued margin expansion with adjusted operating margin improving 110 basis points to 8.2%, as the benefit of productivity initiatives and other items more than offset the impact of higher employee related expense and lower volume.","The impact of higher employee related expenses was moderated in the quarter due to lower incentive compensation costs in this segment relative to last year.","Sales in Vancive Medical Technologies grew approximately 6% in the quarter while the operating loss was reduced by roughly $1 million to $1.7 million. As for the 2014 outlook, we are narrowing our range of guidance for adjusted 2014 earnings per share from continuing operations to $3 to $3.10. This guidance is based on a number of assumptions including the key factors listed on slide eight of our supplemental presentation materials. We now estimate approximately 4% organic sales growth which excludes the benefit of an extra week of sales this year. We expect average shares outstanding assuming dilution of between 96 million and 97 million shares reflecting our increased share repurchases in Q2.","As I mentioned, we now anticipate 2014 free cash flow of approximately $300 million and we increased our estimate for restructuring charges by a nickel per share due in part to modestly higher cost for the European consolidation. The rest of our key assumptions remain unchanged from what we shared last quarter.","So, about our second quarter results for the individual segments came in so much different than expected the overall results for the company were in line. We are on track to deliver adjusted earnings per share growth of 12% to 16% for the year. As we articulated at Investor Meeting in May we are continuing to drive solid organic sales growth, maintaining our cost and capital discipline, and returning capital to shareholders. All of which continues to enable us to deliver double digit EPS growth.","Now we\u2019ll open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of George Staphos, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead sir.","George Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. Good to hear from you. The first question I had, the incremental margins in pressure-sensitive remained fairly negligible. I was wondering if you could provide a bit more color around that. With the context being, in part, in the past you had taken on additional revenue SKUs that was low in margin, but good from an EVA standpoint. As you answer that question, help me reconcile that other comment as well, in terms of why it's positive on an EVA basis?","Dean Scarborough","George this is Dean. One of the factors that in fact to the quarter were transition cost from our European restructuring. Some of those costs are difficult to predict because basically we were negotiating with the works council and various unions which have ended up being successful for us so some of those we probably had a higher than anticipated cost for transition in the second quarter we would expect in some of that maybe a little bit earlier in the year. So that\u2019s definitely one factor.","George Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And can you\u2026","Dean Scarborough","And mix is the other factor here and I think it\u2019s partially geographic mix it\u2019s partially again the mix with some of the products I think I said at last quarter that this is the way I look at the quarter is kind of within the normal but if I exclude the transition cost it\u2019s kind of within the normal band of variation that we had in the business. So it was lower than we thought it might be in the second quarter.","Mitch Butier","George and I think the other factor is what mentioned was we did talked last quarter that we saw modest and it is again modest gap between price and raw material input cost and that continued carried over in the Q2 as well which was another factor. I think overall like you\u2019re saying that the continuation of the trends that we\u2019ve been talking about for the last few quarters and our target is 10% to 11% operating margin for this business. It\u2019s in that range for this year as you see and our objective is to get it to the high end for sure. But mix and more recently the price inflation I think has a very modest headwind and we\u2019re working off that and kind of reinforces our objective of reducing fixed cost as we go forward.","George Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","My follow on, and I'll turn it over and come back, We've been talking about mix as a headwind for a while, certainly, I think since fourth quarter last year probably dates back to third quarter. If mix is a headwind, by this juncture I would have expected, perhaps, some corrective actions to have been taken with it? Or if it's positive from an EVA standpoint, as you said, can you explain how it can be negative in mix and positive in EVA terms for us? Lastly, again, we've been talking about price cost compression for a while. At this juncture, should we have not seen from Avery Dennison some effective enough moves to have put that in the rear-view mirror? Thanks, guys, and I'll turn it over. ","Dean Scarborough","If you take out the transition cost in the quarter there would be incremental process in the business and that is EVA positive. So we\u2019re again pleased with the overall trajectory there.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird","Hi, guys. Good morning. First off, on North American PSM, again, I think you mentioned that the sales were flat in the quarter, maybe Mitch did. Any sub-categories meaningfully weaker than others? Just curious as to what you think is actually going on in the market there?","Dean Scarborough","It\u2019s been very choppy Ghansham. If you look at the growth last year from the market perspective and I can\u2019t share this specific numbers with you, but start we had a very strong first half of 2013 and then we had a soft third quarter, talking about market now, a better fourth quarter and then the first quarter drop and we\u2019ve talked about some of the factors there. And I would say sort of across the Board, I don\u2019t see one sector or another being impacted. And so, it\u2019s a little bit perplexing to be honest, we continue to be really pleased with hope in every other region. As I look at the U.S. economy, I realized that that a lot of the economists are feeling pretty robust about the second half that there is something about the fact the GDP will be flat for the first half of this year that\u2019s connecting into their business. So, it\u2019s a little bit perplexing. We have talked to customers on the anecdotal basis and they\u2019re basically saying things are okay, but they just don\u2019t see a lot of growth or robust forecast from the customer. I like that a little bit -- its interesting that our RBIS business in U.S. based brands and retailers also were soft and there I think retailers are just being confirmative about what the fall season is going to look this year.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird","Okay. That's helpful. Then on the flip side of that, you mentioned initially that PSM came in above expectations in total. Of the other regions that you're exposed to, which one really came in above, was it Europe, the emerging markets, or a little of both?","Dean Scarborough","Both, I think, Europe has like Mitch mentioned that single digit growth and so -- and the market growth in Europe has continued to accelerate. I just want to tell everybody, we don\u2019t have second quarter numbers yet for the region and from a market perspective, but there continue to be surprise presently above the growth in Europe. Latin America continued to be strong as well as Asia Pacific, so all those regions actually are far and quite well.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird","Okay, I will turn it over. Thanks so much.","Mitch Butier","The one thing I would add is within the emerging market Eastern Europe has a little bit soft still compare to the rest of the emerging market.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird","Mitch, on that, was there any improvement versus the run rate from the previous quarter, or no? In Eastern Europe?","Mitch Butier","No.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup. Please go ahead","Anthony Pettinari \u2013 Citigroup","Good morning. You discussed higher employee related expenses in both segments. I was wondering, is that just wage inflation, or is there some new hiring going on? Is it possible to quantify the expense in either segment? Should we expect that to continue to be a headwind in the second half?","Dean Scarborough","It\u2019s normally inflation. There is no big investment or anything going on. We obviously have so modest investments and stakes for example where we\u2019re seeing high growth and high margin expansion very modest. It\u2019s 95% normal wage inflation. We are always comment on it\u2019s just as being one of the key factors as we talk through it. But one thing I would comment on is what I said earlier is just that, wage inflation is a headwind for RBS in particular but it was more moderated than we normally see just because the adjustments within incentive comp within that business.","Anthony Pettinari \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. That's helpful. In your prepared remarks, I think you reaffirmed full-year cash guidance, but if I heard correctly, you said some cash may be deferred or pushed out from 2014 to 2015 at the end of the year. Did I get that right? If that's correct, is there an order of magnitude of how much that could be on free cash?","Dean Scarborough","Before we\u2019re expecting modestly above 300 million and we set 300,000 at the four, and now we\u2019re saying approximately 300,000. So there is subtle shift change just because we don\u2019t see that we can guarantee, if you will, 300,000 as a floor in our guidance right now. And if you recall at the beginning of this year, $30 million moved from \u201914 in \u201913 more than we expected, it will be commented on that in January during the earnings call and when we just look at it there is just too much volatility when you combine the 53rd week until and so forth, there is a lot of volatility. It really doesn\u2019t matter at time of cash moving a week or two and so anything short within later Q4 to be coming partly in Q1 at the next year.","Anthony Pettinari \u2013 Citigroup","Okay that\u2019s helpful. I will turn it over.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed ","Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company ","Thank you. Good afternoon, all. Following up on George's question, when do you think your price increases will catch up on the raw materials and you will close that gap?","Mitch Butier","It\u2019s a very modest gap and most of the places that we\u2019ve been raising prices have been due more to currency shifts in markets like South America or India, again where we have currency related inflation. I think that this gap is modest enough that we\u2019ll get it through a focus on mix improvements priced and targeted pricing actions et cetera. It\u2019s certainly not like it was few years ago where we\u2019re getting ramping inflation.","Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company ","And what do you see happening in terms of raw material inflation over the next few months?","Dean Scarborough","The stability, relative to Q1 we had talked about pressures if you heard, we didn\u2019t talk much about pressures year-over-year. We still have some pressures there but as far as sequentially we have seen them ease a little bit. And we\u2019re still seeing it obviously within paper and then specialty chemicals as well. But relative speaking, little bit of moderation.","Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company ","Okay, thanks. Looking at the graphic reflective tapes top line growth of 10% to 11%, what is behind that strength? Is it that you are getting new accounts? Is it new products, just because it is smaller? Do they have a smaller margin than the rest of PSM, and therefore this is why you had margin pressure?","Dean Scarborough","No actually the graphics and tapes and reflective product category all have higher variable margins than the core label and packaging business. As we said during the industrial presentations these are markets where we had relatively low market share. And our teams have done a great job of proving some new product innovations and improve quality and service in graphics. Our performance tapes business has seen excellent growth on both the personal care side of the business as well as in industrial business.","We had a couple of new adhesive products platforms that we launched a couple of years ago. And our commercial teams are doing a great job executing, driving lot of new applications both with existing customers and new customers in that business.","Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company ","Okay. If this is the case, if you have a stronger growth for your higher margin products, why was label's margin then, they have to have been down? What is behind those margins?","Dean Scarborough","So while the graphic variable margin was up a lot of that frankly was chewed up by extra transition cost that we had in the European restructuring program which frankly is all about improving our class in that business. So that\u2019s definitely one reason.","Mitch Butier","And the other thing, if you look at we mentioned last year\u2019s Q2 was a peak quarter. It was 10.7 and the average for the year was up 10.2. And so if you compare against that average Q2 and Q3 are usually little bit higher than the average the mid is like 3 or 4. But the point is if you adjust this for the transition cost you basically get for those two factors alone you get in roughly flat margins. Product mix we still had one and that\u2019s why we commented on it for 6% top line growth. We traditionally did a little bit more additional flow through, so we\u2019re just seeing a continuation of the trend within the labels and packaging materials business that we\u2019ve seen in the last few quarters. And it really reinforces the strategy focusing on graphics and tapes.","Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company ","Thanks. I appreciate it. If I may ask one quick last question? In terms of Eastern Europe, how big are Ukraine and Russia? Do you see an impact on your business going forward, if it doesn't quiet down?","Dean Scarborough","It\u2019s a timely question because we literally just opened the new distribution center for pressure sensitive materials in Ukraine. And actually it\u2019s been growing quite nicely now, it\u2019s very, very small. So it really doesn\u2019t have a material impact on materials.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead sir.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital","","Hi. Mitch, I just wanted to go back to the free cash flow guidance for a second. Could you just clarify for me, did you say that $30 million of cash at the beginning of 2014 got moved into 2013? Or was it the reverse?","Mitch Butier","","No that happened and we talk on that back in January and that\u2019s not the reason we\u2019re adjusting our guidance now. I had shared that happened last year and as indicative of the amount of volatility there can be around year-end and it really just moves. So if you recall we beat our guidance for free cash flow in \u201813 and we attributed $30 million of that just due to timing. And if you saw on Q1 of this year free cash flow was worse than it normally is in Q1 and $30 million of that with that was attributable that reason. Does that make sense?","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital","Yes, that makes sense. So, $30 million got pulled from 2014 into 2013, made the free cash flow guidance lower than maybe some of us originally would have anticipated. Now we have free cash flow going from 2014 into 2015.","Dean Scarborough","Maybe\u2026","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital","Maybe, okay. So it\u2019s a maybe.","Dean Scarborough","Scott our first goal year end if you read I think on the 3rd of January and it\u2019s really is hard to project. And as you can see last year we thought we come in around 300 million and we came in 330 million.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital","So, this is mostly related to receivables within the working capital line in? Is that how to think about it?","Dean Scarborough","We receive little down pay at lot of terms are end of month. And so those payments can come in couple of days earlier or couple of days late including our own payments.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital","Alright. Fair enough. When we look at the RBIS business, Dean, I thought you mentioned something about growth in European RFID. Can you talk about the growth within Europe? Is that maybe more meaningful than we've maybe thought about before? How does sort of RFID break down Europe versus US, as a percentage of that $100 million or maybe its $120 million in sales now, who knows, of that business?","Dean Scarborough","We probably I think commenting a little bit is that the investor meetings and the take up off RFID in Europe has been faster than in for U.S. brands and retailers. And frankly as anything we see an acceleration of that impact. And so it\u2019s pretty much when a leader in the category decides to go on RFID so there is a lot of followership so we have definitely seen a stuck up in activity across the board in Europe. The U.S. so we still a lot of ramp up activities going but there are more vertical retailers in Europe and I think they just have some of that have a very natural well defined business case and they are moving forward so it\u2019s all good I think the same thing will happen in U.S. but it will took that behind a little bit.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital","Okay. Lastly, I think you mentioned the, you took the restructuring costs higher, modestly higher due to the European restructuring effort. Are you finding more opportunity, or is the restructuring just costing more to get that done?","Dean Scarborough","The increase it was roughly half from the European restructuring and a little bit more another action within RBIS it\u2019s going to deliver more savings next year as well.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead sir.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","Hi, there. Was your average price mix in the quarter for the Company as a whole up or down? And by how much?","Dean Scarborough","The price mix for the total company was slight headwind overall and if you look at it the product mix that we\u2019ve talked about within the materials business but then also as you recall we\u2019ve discussed that RBIS business has higher variable margins so when that down and PSM is up that also has a segment mix effect if you will overall.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","Okay. Were you surprised at the RBIS volumes or not?","Dean Scarborough","Yes, we thought we would have more robust sales especially from North American retailers, so from that perspective. The color to that too very positive lease of price buy continued strength in Europe.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","All things being equal, are your expectations for the fourth quarter in RBIS lower or higher or the same in light of the sales and order patterns you have seen so far?","Dean Scarborough","Jeff we don\u2019t give segment guidance but I will say this and that is that the terms for RBIS get easier through the back half the year. And a lot of this frankly will be determine how that tool sales they\u2019ll prepare. And if the current consumer confident index is an indicator that people are going to buy more apparel than and the sales are robust at back to school I would anticipate that retail as we feel little bit better about putting more items in stock. If you look at just apparel sales generally as a category in the first half of the year they haven\u2019t been very good the year-over-year sales comps just haven\u2019t been very good. So I think there is just a little bit of conservatism that\u2019s in there.","Mitch Butier","And Jeff if you look at the range of our guidance we don\u2019t give guidance by segment if you look at the range of our guidance the low end is roughly a continuation of some of the trends that we saw in Q2 and the high end is somewhat an improvement from that. So that\u2019s carefully in line with the range of the guidance.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","I wasn't trying to crowbar a forecast out of you. All I meant was that -- no, that normally if the second quarter is weaker, the fourth quarter tends to be a little bit weaker, or that is what I call --.","Dean Scarborough","It\u2019s really different season and I remember back in 2012 we had a really tough first half and then we had a really robust second half for RBIS in terms of volume growth. And because of the seasonality in the business every major seasons is considered to be -- the whole new outlet for retailers.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","Okay. I think there are $3 million in transition costs included in the pro forma operating income in pressure sensitive in the second quarter. Does that go to, I don't know, $1 million in the third quarter and then it disappears?","Dean Scarborough","The timing is in precise when the transition cost flow through but we\u2019re expecting a few million more between Q3 and Q1 next year. So if that moderates.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","It moderates, okay. In terms of cash restructuring outlays, if you hadn't said it before, how much have you paid so far in the first half of the $50 million you intend to pay this year?","Dean Scarborough","Of the 50 million we have not paid that much, so lot of it\u2019s ahead of us still in the coming couple of quarters.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","40?","Dean Scarborough","I don\u2019t have that right in front of me Jeff, sorry. But I can provide that for you off line.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","Okay. What's pricing in RBIS like, or as you look forward? Is that pretty flat or is there a negative mix there as well?","Dean Scarborough","No it\u2019s fine, recalling that business, it\u2019s a custom business. So there is a constant weak pricing as new programs come up. So I think anything the team has done a good job of continuing to improve the variable margins in the business. So I feel actually pretty good about that. What we\u2019re really focused on getting more volume growth because if we had 3% sales growth on top some of the productivity that we delivered in the quarter it would have been pretty incredible result. And so as we look again at the back half of the business I think the good news is that easier, it\u2019s our commercial teams are targeting to take some additional market share, really help us and we fell again pretty good about some of the programs in RFID and external establishments ramping up.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","Avery is often a good bellwether of which way the global economy is going. Does it feel to you like the global economy is accelerating or staying the same or slowing down? Or do you not have a sense?","Dean Scarborough","Well that\u2019s a big responsibility Jeff. I would say\u2026","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","I won\u2019t hold you to it.","Dean Scarborough","Well that\u2019s probably good. The one market that has uncertainties still for me and I am a bit confused is North America. Every other market seems to be doing just fine, frankly and I am pleased with it. Our teams are executing well. And things have just started. In North America the slowness in pressure sensitive typically would say that we have a softness coming and again I looked at the market growth rates it\u2019s been choppy. We\u2019ll have a quarter that\u2019s flat again and then on this case we know we\u2019ll have some weather related effects in pressure sensitive in the first quarter. And the second quarter really didn\u2019t rebound as much as certainly the economy we\u2019re talking about.","And so we just hadn\u2019t seen that kind of rebound yet.","Operator","Our final question is a follow up from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead Mr. Staphos.","George Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Thanks. Hi, guys. I think I know the answer to this, but I just want to confirm. If we looked at your average pricing in pressure-sensitive year-on-year on a per-unit basis, would it be safe to say that pricing was down year-on-year, recognizing that mix is probably a big chunk of that? How would you answer that question?","Mitch Butier","George we actually just comment on the net trend between raw material costs and price trends. And you actually see quite a bit of difference region by region, significant input cost inflation in some regions, largely due to currency that require price increases and in other regions you may see the opposite. So we\u2019ve been commenting on net from an impact and we talked about it being neutral for about four or five quarters consistently until Q1.","And we\u2019re now seeing a modest headwind from that.","Dean Scarborough ","George let me just add a comment here. And Mitch said it before, so I know we\u2019ve been talking about this and this quarter looks more severe than I really feel in. For two reasons we had the highest operating margin ever in Pressure-sensitive Materials last year second quarter as you know moderated a bit in the back half of the last year, but still above the 2015 target range we just have for the business and this year we have the combined impact of for the same mixed range, but the transition cost on top of it -- so I believe that we\u2019re going to continue to operate Pressure-sensitive business focused on innovation, continuous innovation, focused on growing our graphics and performances tape business at higher margins. And we\u2019re going to be in that 10% to 11% margin range again targeting the upper end. I think if also looking catalyst or breakthrough that will certainly come when we complete the European restructuring program because we\u2019ll get a big lift next because we get the benefit of the restructuring of course we would have the transition cost in the P&L at the same time.","George Staphos - Bank of America","Sure. That makes sense. Again, I'm not trying to flag one way or another a concern we have or not, I'm just trying to get at the data best we can to model it. So, I appreciate your patience with our line of questioning. The targeting of --.","Dean Scarborough","I am trying to sound confident. Hopefully, I didn't come across as impatient.","George Staphos - Bank of America","No, understood. In terms of the targeting of the 11%, I'm assuming that's not for the full year next year. You're hoping to get towards 11% as the year progresses, so maybe second half of next year would be where you're beginning to -- where you're approaching that on a quarterly basis. Would that be a fair pictorial?","Dean Scarborough","Actually what we said was for 2018, we wanted to be in the 10% to 11% range and we\u2019re targeting the high end of the range. So I don\u2019t \u2013 ","","George Staphos - Bank of America"," ","I thought you said...","Dean Scarborough "," ","(Multiple speakers) we're happy to give next year guidance, but we\u2019re going to maintain at in the 10 to 11 shooting for 11. That\u2019s what we said.","George Staphos - Bank of America","No problem, Dean. I thought you said during your prepared remarks that you hope to be approaching 11% in the next year off of these programs. I must have misheard you there.","Dean Scarborough","No, definitely, we were -- that\u2019s a longer term goal and if you recall last time we said a target range, we exceeded with it in middle of the quarter. I know again, I am real confident about the 10 to 11 and we\u2019re going to stretch for the high end, so it will be great if we had high end of the range next year but we\u2019re not predicting that right now.","George Staphos - Bank of America","Understand. No problem on that. Can you remind us, what is it about the comps getting easier for RBIS that we should remember? Obviously remember RFID, but is there anything we should reflect on as we're modeling out our volume comparisons? ","Dean Scarborough","Yes, I think the value segment for us in North America was particularly strong in the first half of 2013 and then got a bit softer in the second half. So just to remember having strong comp there so the comps just getting easier, I think that\u2019s the main factor.","George Staphos - Bank of America","Okay, and last, and I think you touched on this before, July trends, it sounds like in PSM have been more or less the same from what we saw in the Q2. Could you affirm that or correct, if it need be? Within RBIS, how have early 3Q trends looked like? Thanks, guys, and good luck on the quarter.","Dean Scarborough","Thanks. I think the trends consistent with our guidance range and pretty consistent with how we came out of the sector quarter. And as just remind everybody that July is a really tough month for us and then August tends to be definitely impressive by Europe holiday. So September always is the key month and that would start, really some of the retailers star to order and purchase for that Q4 season in September as well. So that\u2019s really good season and how going it\u2019s going to go.","George Staphos - Bank of America","Actually, one last one and I'll finish up with here. Historically, if we go back to the 1990s and even early 2000s, if I recall, free cash flow for the Company would accelerate in the second half versus the first half. In turn, that was often a reason why the Company could accelerate repurchases of its stock. Are there any lessons from that as we look out to 2014? Or would you not draw any conclusions, you're just going to be disciplined and opportunistic about repurchase? Thanks, guys, and again, good luck in the quarter.","Dean Scarborough","Thank you, George. We will continue to be disciplined and opportunistic and we don\u2019t look at the seasonality of our free cash flow as a key driver of when we would repurchase shares. We are under levered as I had mentioned and to have ample capacity between our cash flow and our current leverage position and we will continue to be disciplined and opportunistic, George.","Operator","Mr. Scarborough, there are no further questions at this time. You may continue with your presentation or closing remarks.","Dean Scarborough","Thanks everyone. Well, I would like to conclude by saying our playbook is working. We are delivering mid single digit organic sales growth driven by emerging markets, innovation, and share gain. We are executing productivity actions and driving capital efficiency we\u2019re on track to improve our returns and we\u2019re returning cash to shareholders and we will continue on this path. Thanks for joining us and we look forward to speaking with your again soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today.

[Operator Instructions] Welcome to Avery Dennison's Earnings Conference Call for the First Quarter ended March 30, 2013. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay from 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time today through midnight Pacific Time, April 26. To access the replay, please dial (800) 633-8284 or (402) 977-9140 for international callers. The conference ID number is 21610812.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Eric Leeds, Avery Dennison's Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Eric Leeds","Thank you. Welcome, everyone. Today we'll discuss our preliminary unaudited first quarter 2013 results. Please note that unless otherwise indicated, today's discussion will be focused on our continuing operations. The company's Office and Consumer Products and Designed and Engineered Solutions businesses are classified on our income statement as discontinued operations. The non-GAAP financial measures that we use are defined, qualified and reconciled with GAAP in Schedules A-2 to A-4 of the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release. We remind you that we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. These forward-looking statements are made subject to the Safe Harbor statement included in today's earnings release.","On the call today are Dean Scarborough, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mitch Butier, Senior Vice President and CFO. I'll now turn the call over to Dean.","Dean A. Scarborough","Thanks, Eric, and good day, everyone. First quarter results were in line with our expectations, highlighted by strong sales growth in emerging markets for Pressure-sensitive Materials and another good top line performance by Retail Branding and Information Solutions. Higher volumes and the benefits of our restructuring program drove a substantial increase in earnings per share over first quarter 2012.","We are also on track to deliver strong annual free cash flow. Typically, we're a user of cash in the first half of the year and we ended the quarter where we expected to. During the quarter, we returned nearly $90 million to shareholders through dividends and the repurchase of approximately 1.5 million shares.","Regarding the dividend, the Board will conduct its annual review at its meeting tomorrow. As we announced last December, the Board has moved its annual consideration of the dividend increase from December to April.","Turning to the businesses. Pressure-sensitive Materials delivered solid overall results again, driven by strong sales of Label and Packaging Materials in emerging markets, with modest growth in mature markets. Operating margin expanded and was within our long-term target range reflecting higher volumes and the productivity gains from integrating Graphics and Reflectives into our Label and Packaging business.","Trends for Retail Branding and Information Solutions continued from the back half of 2012, with continued growth in the core business and strong growth in RFID. Sales to U.S. and emerging market retailers and brands grew by double-digit percentages. And I was encouraged by mid-single-digit growth from European-based retailers and brands. Based on the latest import data, we are continuing to gain market share.  RBIS operating margin expanded significantly and we expect further progress later this year as we reduce the manufacturing footprint and execute our productivity plans. Second quarter is, of course, the most important season for RBIS. And as you know, we don't have that much forward visibility. However, our order intake does remain strong.","I'm pleased to say that during the quarter we received all regulatory clearances for the sale of Office and Consumer Products and Designed and Engineered Solutions. We expect to complete the deal midyear.  We've also made steady progress on our restructuring initiative, which is enabling us to deliver strong bottom line improvement.","We had a solid start to the year. As Mitch will explain, with the movement of Designed and Engineered Solutions to discontinued operations, we've effectively raised our earnings guidance. I'll note that Q2 is very important for us, and we'll feel even more confident about the year once we deliver the quarter.","Now I'll turn it over to Mitch.","Mitchell R. Butier","Thanks, Dean. We delivered another solid quarter with 4% organic sales growth and a 37% increase in adjusted earnings per share, in line with our expectations. These results reflect strong emerging markets growth in Pressure-sensitive Materials, continued solid progress in RBIS, the results of our restructuring program, as well as lower interest expense and the accretion from share repurchases.","Our free cash flow in the quarter was negative as is consistent with our normal seasonality. With leverage in our targeted range and our consistently strong annual free cash flow, we returned $89 million of cash to shareholders with dividends of $27 million and the repurchase of 1.5 million shares. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter grew 60 basis points to 6.7% as the benefit of productivity initiatives and higher volume more than offset higher employee-related expenses and the impact of product mix as a result of our continued penetration of lower margin categories in PSM.","The net impact of costs associated with raw materials and pricing was again modest in the quarter. As for our restructuring program, to save more than $100 million annually, we're on track and continue to expect to achieve our savings target by the middle of this year.","In addition to expanding operating margins, we also benefited from a reduction in interest expense of approximately $6 million. This reduction is due primarily to a 3-month time lag between when a $250 million long-term note matured in mid-January and when we refinanced it in early April. The new $250 million note is due in 10 years and bears a coupon of 3.35%, and will result in a reduction to annual interest expense of $8 million going forward.","Turning to the segments. Pressure-sensitive Materials sales were up 3% on an organic basis in the first quarter, primarily reflecting solid growth in emerging markets and a moderation of growth in mature markets. Labels and Packaging materials, the largest division in the segment, sales were up low single digits on an organic basis, while the combined sales for Graphics, Reflective and Performance Tapes were up slightly. On a regional basis, sales for this segment grew low single digits in North America, were relatively flat in Western Europe, and grew double digits in emerging markets.","PSM's adjusted operating margin improved 30 basis points to 9.9%, near the high-end of our targeted range as the benefit of productivity initiatives and higher volume more than offset the impact of product mix and higher employee-related expenses.","Retail Branding and Information Solutions sales grew 6%, with about half of the growth coming from RFID and the other half reflecting solid growth at North American and modest growth at European retailers and brands. Sales of RFID products more than doubled in the first quarter, but as we said last quarter, the growth rate is expected to moderate for the remainder of the year as a major retailer recently decided to slow its pace of RFID adoption.","RBIS's adjusted operating margin improved 150 basis points to 4.6% as the benefit of productivity initiatives and higher volume more than offset higher employee-related expenses. As you know, the first quarter is RBIS's seasonally lowest sales and margin quarter, while the second quarter is the strongest.","Sales in our other specialty converting businesses grew 13%, reflecting solid growth in our medical business. The biggest difference between reported and organic sales growth in other specialty converting is due to the exit of a small former OCP product line last year. And with DES now in discontinued operations, the medical business is the only component of other specialty converting beginning this year. The negative adjusted operating margin in other specialty converting was reduced somewhat compared to last year due to higher volume. This business has a negative operating margin and we are making investments in growth to leverage our material science capabilities and technologies in the medical space.","Moving onto the outlook. We now expect adjusted 2013 earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.40 to $2.75 and free cash flow from continuing operations of $275 million to $315 million. When you consider that we are now excluding the estimated results from DES, we are effectively increasing our earnings guidance. The exclusion of DES had a negative impact of approximately $0.15, which was largely offset by lower anticipated cost and, at the lower end of our range, higher volume. As for free cash flow, we reduced the high-end of our guidance range for continuing operations primarily due to the exclusion of DES.","Our guidance is based on a number of assumptions, including the factors listed on Slide 8. To highlight a few, our estimate for organic sales growth in 2013 is now 2% to 4%. We've raised the low-end of our sales expectation by 1 point given our performance in the first quarter. Our full year estimate reflects modest growth in the U.S., Western Europe being flat to down modestly, and emerging markets up mid to high single-digits. Obviously, the macro environment remains uncertain and, as you know, the nature of our businesses gives us limited forward visibility.","Interest expense in 2013 is expected to be approximately $60 million versus $73 million last year. First quarter interest expense was $12 million, and we expect a run rate beginning in Q2 of $16 million to $17 million per quarter. And average fully diluted shares outstanding for 2013 are still assumed to be approximately 100 million.","Given the timing of when we expect the divestitures of OCP and DES to close, the impact of the additional share repurchases from the proceeds of these divestitures will have a modest impact on the calculation of average shares outstanding for the full year.","So in summary, the first quarter represented a solid start to a year in which we expect to deliver adjusted EPS growth of between 22% and 40%. Our 2 core businesses are market leaders and are well-positioned for profitable growth and increasing returns. Our cost-reduction program to save more than $100 million is on track and positions us for continued strong earnings growth. And our continued cost and capital discipline enabled us to maintain our financial strength and return more cash to shareholders, all of which demonstrate our continued commitment to delivering on our long-term targets.","Now we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess my first question is on the guidance, related to what the sales trend has been. And certainly, we understand that you effectively raised your earnings per share guidance given the effect of DES. When I look at what I think is your new continuing operations schedule at the back of the slide deck, it shows that organic sales has been decelerating a little bit over the last few quarters, still at very healthy rates. And so I was wondering if, in fact, that's the trend you've been observing, what gives you more confidence in terms of raising the outlook as you've done? And I had a couple follow-ons.","Dean A. Scarborough","Sure. So overall the reason for the raise in the outlook is really at the low-end, George, and that was pretty much just due to our performance in Q1. When you talk about the growth rate in Q1, it's -- we're right in the middle of our long-term targets coming in at 4% overall, our 3% to 5% target that we've had. And it did decelerate from the pace you saw of the last few quarters but recall, the last few quarters were benefiting from some easier comps and mid-2011 is when our sales fell off so when you look in absolute terms, this is a solid pace and the pace which we expect overall.","Dean A. Scarborough","George, I'd also note that Easter fell in the first quarter this year, rather than in the second quarter in the prior year. So that's part of the reason for I would characterize that as deceleration.","Mitchell R. Butier","Yes the shift in calendar had overall -- a little over -- over 1 point of impact on the quarter as well, but does not change our full year expectations.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Wouldn't Easter being early have shifted volume into the first quarter and helped the growth rate, if I'm hearing you correctly?","Dean A. Scarborough","Easter was on the -- was 1 week earlier and so Good Friday fell into Q1 of this year, whereas Good Friday last year fell into Q2.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Understand. Now related to...","Mitchell R. Butier","This doesn't affect all regions equally, of course, or all businesses equally so...","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sure. Now in terms of the RBIS business and apparel, you obviously gave the appropriate caveat. You don't have great lead times but your bookings thus far have been pretty healthy. And so, the question is, what are your customers saying right now about what their expectations are for the Christmas selling season in the fourth quarter?","Dean A. Scarborough","Yes. I think there is a reasonable degree of optimism as they're looking forward. And so, we're pleased with our growth rate in -- from both European and U.S. and emerging market retailers and brands. I don't think anybody is ecstatic about the environment, but they're not pessimistic either. So I feel -- it feels -- looks okay, is how I'd characterize it.","Mitchell R. Butier","And I think a key thing to focus on some of the comments I made about RFID with half the growth in Q1 and we do expect that growth rate to moderate somewhat.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sure. But it sounds like your customers are feeling a little bit more confident about the consumer in turn being willing to open up their wallets to make expenditures towards the end of the year. Would that be a fair assessment? Whether or not it plays out or not, we'll see, but would that be the fair characterization of what your customers are thinking right now?","Dean A. Scarborough","Yes. I mean certainly, based both anecdotally and on the order trends, I'd say yes, right exactly within our guidance range and pretty much what we expected.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Last question and I'll turn it over. In other specialty converting, what pace of margin improvement could we expect over a couple of years? We realize you're investing in that business right now. Is this a business that, given the current -- if we hold the macro environment constant going forward, that can get to a breakeven or better margin with the next couple of quarters, let's say, sometime as a run rate sometime in 2013? Or would you need to do more restructuring, investment or see more growth for it to be more profitable than it is right now?","Dean A. Scarborough","Yes. Let me just maybe give a little bit of color on the Vancive medical solutions business, that's pretty much all of other specialty converting. It's a carve-out out of our Performance Tapes business, and the core business has actually been growing quite nicely. And we have invested in a couple of new growth platforms, one is on a wearable sensor, where you can wear it on your body and it tracks heart rate and respiration and whether you're sitting or standing. And as well as a new antimicrobial wound care device where we've actually embedded the antimicrobial agent into the adhesive which is actually very hard to do, and we figured out a way to do it. We actually haven't seen any sales on those products yet so we do expect -- we're in the commercialization stage so we're pretty pleased with our progress so far. I don't want to give guidance on exactly when we're going to trip over to positive EBIT because I'll be wrong whatever I forecast. And -- but we are pleased with the trajectory. We've got very specific milestones against the business. And we're going to hit the long-term targets for that business that we've communicated to Wall Street.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Hey, on PSM, Mitch, I think you mentioned negative mix on -- as part of the EBIT variance. Is that mostly because the growth rates in the emerging markets are stronger and that's maybe some of the lower margin business that you're referring to? Or how should we think about that?","Mitchell R. Butier","No. Actually, emerging market growth is accretive to margins. But what we've been doing, even in emerging markets, is looking for places to take share that are still investment-grade opportunities, but maybe we just haven't been quite as focused on that and it's working pretty well. And so, I think the flow through margins are -- well, certainly versus the first quarter last year, are just a little bit less, but it's good profitable business, and so we feel good about it.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then the double-digit growth commentary across the emerging markets, was there a meaningful deviation between say China and Brazil or some of the other emerging markets?","Dean A. Scarborough","The only deviation I'd say is Eastern Europe, as you'd expect, was a little bit softer than what we saw in Latin America as well as Asia.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then back to RBIS, I guess as follow-up to George's question. Dean, you seem pretty optimistic on the outlook there. Most retailers in the U.S. when they reported March were calling out weather and more uncertainty as it relates to the consumer. So can you just help us sort of bridge the gap between the 2 in terms of the outlook?","Dean A. Scarborough","Yes, I mean -- it's always -- all retailers are optimistic about the upcoming season. I mean, so they're talking about what happened in the first quarter and, of course, those are goods that we shipped back in late Q3, early Q4. And at least, from our perspective, there's a lot of good things going on. I mean, we've been able -- we believe we're taking market share, so that's helpful. We still have adoption of RFID, granted the pace will slow in 2013 versus 2012. And, I would say, in general, and it's hard to generalize of course, we see a decent degree of optimism about how the year will play out. Inventories, the inventory sales ratio in apparel is still about where it should be. And apparel costs are also maintaining a good relative position. So all those factors so far look okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays Capital Incorporated.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just my question is really on the guidance. You said -- okay, we understand the minus $0.15 for DES and then you said the offset was I think you said lower cost and higher volume. Can you kind of break down the pieces there? What's lower-cost, and then, maybe on a pennies basis? And what's the higher volume?","Mitchell R. Butier","Sure. Just very simply, at the high-end pull $0.15 off for DES and basically, add back $0.10 for the lower-cost which is a little bit -- a couple  million lower than we modeled -- had a few months ago for interest expense. And the rest of it just being lower operating costs as well as, something I didn't mention, a couple of cents from different shares outstanding assumption late in the year. And then so that's -- so plus $0.15, minus $0.10 at the high-end. And that at the low-end, you've got those same factors but then as you can see, we raised the low-end of our volume guidance for the year and so that's where you get the extra nickel.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And so is the -- you said lower share count later in the year, is that -- that's not related to DES, the sale of OCP and DES? And you would feel like [indiscernible] cash.","Mitchell R. Butier","Yes, if you heard -- we're still saying approximately 100 million shares outstanding for the year. The averaging effect is really modest, and we were just a very modest amount, over 100 before. We're a modest amount below 100 now.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. But just to be clear, that does assume that you buy back shares with the proceeds?","Mitchell R. Butier","Yes. Yes. Yes.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, all right. Just want to make sure we have the guidance right. The other thing is...","Mitchell R. Butier","Go ahead.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I'm sorry?","Mitchell R. Butier","No. Thank you for clarifying if I wasn't clear. So I appreciate that.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","No problem. The other thing is -- with the RFID growth moderating in the second quarter, do you think it can actually turn negative in the second quarter?","Dean A. Scarborough","I suppose it's possible because we had very strong growth last year. I haven't really looked at it quarter by quarter. We still think RFID growth will be 10% to 20% this year, something like that, maybe 10% to 30%. So again, quarter by quarter, that's very difficult to be that precise.","Mitchell R. Butier","The key question is, we know what's going away as far as the buildup of 1 retailer that got a lot of demand last year, it's the ramp up of additional programs and so forth, and that -- the time -- predicting the exact timing of that can be challenging.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And just lastly on RBIS, I think -- Dean, I think you mentioned -- I think you said mid-single-digit growth in Europe in RBIS in the first quarter?","Dean A. Scarborough","So for retailers and brands that are based in Europe, correct.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. Okay, and I mean, are you just with the right retailers or what would you attribute that to? Maybe we're mixing weak European headlines and the environment's better or is it just you're with the right customers?","Dean A. Scarborough","We have lower relative market share in Europe. So I think part of it is -- there's several factors. One is yes, we are with the right retailers. Some of these brands also that we serve tend to be global, even though they're based in Europe. So think of someone like Adidas for example. And so it's really difficult for us to figure out exactly where all their products are shipped. So we just characterize them as European source retailer. And I sense, we don't have the import data yet, is that we're continuing to take market share in Europe and there is RFID activity going on in Europe ramping up as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Zekauskas with JP Morgan Securities.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is Silke Kueck for Jeff. I was wondering if you can discuss where the strength in the domestic pressure sensitive business is coming from? And that is any -- does any of the players selling into the North American packaging markets have reported pretty poor results so far, whether it's PPGs packaging business, or, of course, can business. And so, I think low single-digit volume growth is pretty good so I was wondering how you did that?","Dean A. Scarborough","I'm not actually sure I'd answer the question. I think...","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Did you gain share? No?","Dean A. Scarborough","We don't have any share data yet, Silke for the U.S. business. I do think that -- so I can't really estimate that. We did have low single-digit sales growth in the quarter. We had been taking some market share in North America in the last couple of quarters. So some of that is probably just a lapping factor is that most of our market share gains came in the back half of the year. I think anything else would be highly speculative at this point.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. In terms of cost savings, what was the run rate in the quarter? Are you at $22 million or $23 million a quarter already, something like that?","Mitchell R. Butier","As far as the restructuring program?","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes.","Mitchell R. Butier","We're at net of the some transition cost that we had in the quarter were at $15 million in the quarter, which would equate roughly to a $60 million, $65 million annualized run rate.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And your goal is just to get to $100 million by the end of the second quarter?","Mitchell R. Butier","Yes, by the middle of this year.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. What is your target for RFID revenue in the RBIS business for this year? If I remember it right, maybe it was close to $100 million last year and I was wondering what your target is for this year?","Dean A. Scarborough","So I think we announced we'd hit about $100 million run rate by the end of last year, and we're expecting anywhere from 10% to 30% growth in RFID sales in total for 2013.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And the last question I have is on raw materials. It seems that propylene prices are really coming off sharply again. And have you noticed big decreases in the derivatives materials that you've purchased as well?","Dean A. Scarborough","Well, we definitely saw some inflation especially in North America during the first quarter and which wasn't surprising giving input costs were going up during that period of time.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And all of that should have disappeared by now, right?","Dean A. Scarborough","Well, I hope it does. But I -- it's still -- there is a lag time between the time those input costs change and when we get a benefit or an increase. And there's also supply and demand factors that impact those rates as well.","Mitchell R. Butier","I think overall, the story is very similar to what we said last quarter, Silke. It's relatively stable and we're seeing some inflation in some of the specialty materials that we buy and some deflation in some other specialty items. But overall, pretty much stable.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call back over to you.","Dean A. Scarborough","Okay, thanks. Well, I'd just like to say I'm pleased with the start of the year. We delivered at the high-end of our revenue range for the year, met our expectations for earnings and received regulatory clearances for the sale of DES and OCP. We are committed to meeting our long-term targets of 3% to 5% revenue growth and 15% to 20% EPS growth, while generating substantial free cash flow so that we can return more to shareholders.","I'd like to thank the entire team at Avery Dennison for a good start to 2013.

Welcome, everyone. Today, we'll discuss our preliminary unaudited third quarter 2013 results.","Please note that unless otherwise indicated, today's discussion will be focused on continuing operations. The company's Office and Consumer Products and Designed and Engineered Solutions businesses are classified on our income statement as discontinued operations. The company completed the sale of these businesses on July 1 at the beginning of the third quarter.","The non-GAAP financial measures that we use are defined, qualified and reconciled with GAAP in schedules A-2 to A-5 of the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release.","We remind you that we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results.

Scarborough","Thanks, Eric, and good day, everyone. I'm very pleased to report our fifth consecutive quarter of better than 30% growth in adjusted earnings per share, reflecting the successful execution of restructuring actions and other productivity initiatives, as well as solid sales growth in both of our core businesses.","Emerging markets continued to be a key growth driver for Pressure-sensitive Materials in the third quarter. We also saw solid growth in our European business. Given the tough conditions in this market, I have been happy to see continued growth here.","Overall, sales growth slowed in September, particularly in North America, with a number of our domestic customers citing some softening of end market demand. We have seen better results in the first few weeks of October, but with heightened uncertainty among consumers, we remain somewhat cautious about the trend.","RBIS also delivered solid growth in the quarter even with some tough headwinds from last year's strong showing.","With another solid quarter behind us, we raised our adjusted earnings guidance for the year with an eye on the uncertainty and demand trends in North America. We remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation strategy.","In the first 9 months, we returned over $300 million to shareholders, including the repurchase of approximately 5.2 million shares.","Given our strong balance sheet, I'm happy to say that the vast majority of the proceeds from our divestitures remains available for distribution to shareholders with just a couple of carve-outs.","In September, we used $10 million of the proceeds for a special contribution to the Avery Dennison Foundation, which invests in education and sustainability projects in the communities in which we operate. And earlier this month, we used $50 million to reduce our pension liability.","Now I'll provide a few highlights for each of our core businesses. Pressure-sensitive Materials generated solid top line growth, with better-than-average growth in emerging markets. We're seeing excitement in the market with our slate of new products introduced at Labelexpo, the labeling industry's annual trade show, which took place in Brussels last month.","As the industry leader, one of our key distinguishing features is the consistent stream of enhancements we bring to the market in terms of the appearance, functionality and cost of our products. Our innovation efforts addressed all 3 of these key differentiators, and all were on display at this year's show.","I'll share just a few examples from the 17 innovations we presented at the show. We introduced improved films for durable labeling applications, including a self-over-laminating roll system that creates protected graphics at roughly 30% lower cost, both in terms of raw material savings, as well as operational savings for converters. With this new system, what used to take 2 rolls of material can now be produced with one.","We also introduced thinner, clearer and cleaner films for traditional label applications. For example, one product we featured at the show demonstrated reduced adhesive ooze, which enables faster and more consistent processing times at our direct customer and at the end user, reducing operating cost for both.","The engineering of thinner materials continues to drive profitable growth at lower price points while also benefiting the environment. It's a triple win: good for us, good for our customers and good for the planet.","Speaking of which, sustainability is another key theme for many of our innovations. Our new clean slate material was designed to increase the percentage of recycling output for reuse in new PET bottles. As a result of this innovation, the Pressure-sensitive label can be separated cleanly from the PET flake during the standard recycling process, significantly improving the recycling yield. This technology makes Pressure-sensitive labeling more competitive for recycled containers and could open significant new markets for us. With 2 billion PET bottles going into landfill every year, this is an important step forward for the packaging industry.","While emerging markets and innovation drive our top line growth engine, operating margin expansion remains another key to value creation for Pressure-sensitive Materials. We once again topped the high end of our margin target range for this segment this quarter, driven by continued intense focus on productivity.","Retail Branding and Information Solutions continues to make tremendous progress with its fifth consecutive quarter of solid sales growth and margin expansion. Over the past 2 years, RBIS has delivered over 200 basis points of margin improvement, and we are on track to deliver on our margin targets for 2015.","We are in the middle stages of a multi-year transformation of this business, and I am pleased with the milestones we have achieved. We've had a good record of share gain over the past few years, with solid progress in our key segments, continued momentum in RFID and brand embellishments, as well as strong growth in our still small but important new markets of Japan, South America and Russia.","I'm very pleased with the gains we're seeing in RFID. We've commented before on the slower growth of these products and services in 2013 related to a large pipeline sale by 1 customer last year that did not repeat. But even with the headwinds from this event, the team still delivered 6% growth in the third quarter, and is projected to deliver 20% growth for the full year as we've captured new business in Europe. We're targeting continued strong growth for this $100 million part of the business over the next few years.","The value proposition here is all about inventory management. Retailers are seeing good ROIs from their RFID implementations, and we remain the leading provider in the apparel space by combining the best-performing products with an in-depth understanding of the use case, that is, understanding exactly how our customers can maximize the return on investment in equipment and consumable products.","We're currently working on new rollouts for significant expansions of existing programs with 7 major retailers across multiple market segments. We're right on target for the changes to our new lower-cost operating model. Since 2011, we've reduced our factory footprint by almost 15% without sacrificing capacity or service. In fact, service continues to improve, contributing to our market share gain.","We're implementing a hub-and-spoke operating model. In other words, we'll continue to operate a few large sites with a broad range of production capabilities, while fast response units deliver a more targeted range of products, utilizing a much smaller manufacturing footprint at substantially lower operating cost.","At the same time, we're increasing our digital printing capacity. We've increased this capacity by 60% over the past 2 years, and by the end of this year, over 1\/3 of our graphic tags and labels will be produced with digital printers. We're targeting to increase that share to over half of our total production. This fundamental shift in operating strategy allows us to produce smaller quantities with greater frequency and reduced lead time, which is more in sync with customer needs. At the same time, we improve quality, consistency and repeatability of production runs while more effectively incorporating variable data and other unique features into our products.","With strong leadership positions in our core businesses, our ability to maintain already higher returns in Pressure-sensitive Materials and significantly expand profitability in RBIS, I am confident we will deliver on our financial targets for the year and over the longer term.","Now I'll turn it over to Mitch.","Mitchell R. Butier","Thanks, Dean. We delivered another solid quarter with 3.6% organic sales growth and adjusted earnings per share of $0.69, which was at the higher end of our expectations. The 35% increase in earnings was driven by productivity, principally restructuring, as well as continued solid top line growth in RBIS and the emerging markets for Pressure-sensitive Materials. The quarter also benefited by about $0.02 from a lower tax rate.","Adjusted operating margin in the quarter grew 120 basis points to 7.7% as the benefit of our productivity initiatives and higher volume more than offset the impact of product mix in Pressure-sensitive Materials and higher employee-related expenses in Retail Branding and Information Solutions.","As mentioned, the productivity improvements were primarily the result of the successful implementation of the restructuring program we initiated last year. We continue to execute our plan to reduce fixed cost and realize a further $5 million in the quarter, bringing the total annualized savings for this restructuring program to $110 million.","Year-to-date, free cash flow from continuing operations was $105 million, comparable to prior year.","As of the end of the quarter, net proceeds from the sale of OCP and DES were $402 million, including the year-to-date negative cash flow from the underlying businesses we divested, as well as the transaction costs and tax payments related to the deal paid thus far.","We anticipate an additional $10 million to $15 million of deal-related cash outflow in the fourth quarter, related primarily to tax payments and transaction costs. So the final net proceeds are expected to come in around $390 million.","As Dean mentioned, we're using most of these proceeds to repurchase shares and reduce indebtedness, which includes underfunded pension plans.","To that end, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we used $50 million of the net proceeds to make supplemental pension plan contributions.","In light of these contributions and the effect of rising discount rates, we are currently comfortable with our pension funding status.","Given that the proceeds were received in the third quarter, we currently have no outstanding commercial paper and have higher-than-normal cash levels. While our stated long-term leverage target is net debt-to-EBITDA of less than 2x, we ended the third quarter at 1.2x. This is mostly due to the timing difference between when we received the divestiture proceeds and when we can optimally deploy them.","We believe the right long-term net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio for us is between 1.7 to 2x, which, combined with our consistently strong free cash flow, gives us ample capacity to return cash to shareholders over the coming years.","Speaking of which, we repurchased an additional 1.7 million shares for $75 million in the third quarter.","Turning to the segments. Pressure-sensitive Materials sales were up 3.5% on an organic basis in the third quarter. Label and Packaging Materials sales were up low single digits on an organic basis, while the combined sales for Graphics, Reflective and Performance Tapes increased mid single-digits.","On a regional basis, sales for the segment were relatively flat in North America, were up mid-single digits in Western Europe and grew upper single-digits in emerging markets.","Looking at the trends within the quarter, sales in July and August were strong, but the business slowed in September, most prominently in North America.","PSM's adjusted operating margin improved 120 basis points to 10.5%, due primarily to the benefit of productivity initiatives.","Retail Branding and Information Solutions sales grew 3.7%, reflecting strong demand among European retailers and brands. Sales to North American retailers were down modestly in the third quarter due to tougher comps in RFID.","Excluding RFID, sales growth slowed in North America, driven by moderating demand among a number of retailers.","Now despite the tougher comps in North America, RFID revenue grew 6% globally, as Dean mentioned, contributing roughly 0.5 point to RBIS' overall sales growth.","RBIS' adjusted operating margin improved 100 basis points to 5.9%, as the benefit of productivity initiatives and higher volume more than offset higher employee-related expenses.","Sales in our other specialty converting businesses grew 4.8%, reflecting modest growth in our medical business, the only component of other specialty converting beginning this year. The operating loss in this business was much smaller than last year and last quarter, as one of our partners contributed to the cost of developing a new product in the pipeline.","Moving on to the outlook. We now expect adjusted 2013 earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.60 to $2.70 and free cash flow from continuing operations of $275 million to $315 million.","Our guidance is based on a number of assumptions, including the key factors listed on Slide 8, to highlight a few. Our estimate for organic sales growth in 2013 is now 3.5% to 4%. Obviously, the macro environment remains uncertain, and as you know, the nature of our business gives us limited forward visibility.","Our sales outlook for the remainder of the year reflects, at the low end, a continuation of the weak trends that we experienced in September.","Full year savings from restructuring actions is now estimated at approximately $75 million, and restructuring costs and other items that are adjustments to GAAP results are now expected to be approximately $30 million pretax.","Compared to our July outlook, the increase in adjustment items relates primarily to the $10 million contribution to the Avery Dennison Foundation from the divestiture proceeds, as well as higher costs associated with new restructuring actions.","As mentioned, we utilized a portion of our net proceeds from the divestitures to also contribute an additional $50 million to our pension plans, bringing total pension contributions to approximately $110 million for the year.","In summary, we are on track to deliver our 2015 targets. We've had a solid 9 months in a year in which we expect to deliver adjusted EPS growth of between 33% and 38%. Our 2 core businesses are market leaders and are well-positioned for profitable growth, which, combined with our continued cost and capital discipline, enables us to expand margin, maintain our financial strength and return cash to shareholders.","Now we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question, from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays Capital.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was just looking at the organic guidance that you provided for sales growth, and if I look at it, it looks as if the organic guidance that you're guiding to for the fourth quarter is only moderately below where it was in the third quarter. First of all, is that a good way to read that? And secondly, do you expect better growth out of PSM or from RBIS right now in the fourth quarter?","Dean A. Scarborough","Yes, Scott. The RBIS is a stronger quarter for them, and we do -- we -- anyway. But I think they do have some headwinds last year on the pipeline still, which that -- we don't have that much forward visibility. But I'd say, fundamentally, we don't -- we're pretty much predicting the trend that we've seen in the first few weeks of October is very consistent with our guidance. So I think you're reading that correctly.","Mitchell R. Butier","Yes. And just the range because the guidance range we're giving on sales is the 0.5 point difference for the full year. And so if you take the low end of that, it actually would be -- if you can do the math from where we are in the first 3 quarters, it's 1.5% roughly assumption for the fourth quarter, whereas at the high end, it's closer to 4%. So pretty big range for the fourth quarter, given our lack of forward visibility.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. Okay. But when I look at RBIS, right, correct me if I'm wrong, but 4Q is generally the second strongest quarter for you. Can you talk about -- is the first half of the quarter more important for RBIS or is it the stronger part of that quarter? How do the trends normally play out in 4Q for -- specifically for RBIS?","Dean A. Scarborough","The season tends to start in September and kind of run through the end of the year. And December often is more impacted by the timing of Chinese New Year than anything else because what happens is, a lot of the apparel factories, of course, close for a week in either January or February, depending on when Chinese New Year is. So it has a lot more to do with that. So it's -- we're expecting -- I'm expecting a decent quarter for RBIS. Again, really tough headwinds with the overall growth rate. But the core business, I think, should be fine.","Mitchell R. Butier","We're talking relative to various quarters. So one thing to remember within RBIS, we do have tough comps in Q4 from the large RFID pipeline fill that we had that impacted Q3, as well as Q4 last year.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. And then just lastly, if I look at Pressure-sensitive margins running at about a little over -- almost 10.5% year-to-date, obviously, the fourth quarter normally comes down a little bit. But if I look at that 10.5%, it's well above the 8.5% to 9.5% long-term guidance. Is there something in there that would suggest that margins come down over the next 2 years? And if so, what would those items be that would pull the margins back down to that long-term range?","Dean A. Scarborough","Yes, Scott. Actually, the target range that we put out was 9% to 10%, so we are above that. And that's something we're going to be looking at as part of our guidance range for -- when we come out with 2014 guidance in January.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","First on pension for 2014. Mitch, can you just provide some parameters on how to think about the cash sort of contribution, if any, just given what you said about being comfortable with where the pension plan is, both the $60 million you put in this and $50 million, I guess, from the Office Products sale?","Mitchell R. Butier","Sure. So just broader context. At the end of last year, the pension was underfunded status across all pensions globally with $400 million, and we did do a revaluation. And part of that was temporary, everybody expected, because discount rates were at an all-time low at the end of 2012. So we had about a $90 million adjustment from that, and with our additional pension contribution, the total underfunded status is now south of $300 million. So your question about implications to cash flow specifically for next year, we'll make -- we still have required contributions for the coming few years. The extra contribution we made is -- can be applied to next year's requirement. So we have some flexibility there, but that's a decision that we will make next year. And we'll provide more insight on that, Ghansham, when we give guidance in January.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of your share buyback program, just based on that residual amount post the proceeds from OCP and the pension contribution and, I guess, the parity [ph] as well. If you combine that with your net free cash flow and using our numbers, which are roughly basically where '13 is projected, you have the capacity to buy back almost 12% of your market cap. So can you just provide us some parameters in terms of your discipline associated with how you would decide to purchase stock and the timing associated with that?","Mitchell R. Butier","Sure. So as far as how we go through this is we basically try to triangulate around intrinsic value. Intrinsic value is a key part for us as far as determining when to buy stock. And then as far as how much, there's 2 things. Depending on where the stock is trading, given recent trends, we'll buy more or less in any given week. Overall, another key thing, though, is amount of volumes that you have. So Q3, for example, a very low-volume quarter for us, much lower than it had been for a while. And so we don't want the -- to -- just from supply\/demand dynamics within any given week to really move things around one way or the other.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just finally, Dean, in terms of Europe, is this a debt cap bounce after a year? Is there sort of subpar growth or is there something more just broader going on in there in terms of the recovery?","Dean A. Scarborough","Ouch. I think the team is executing really well, actually. We've been -- most of this growth was in Western Europe. So I think the team has been focused on innovation and focused on taking some market share. We have not seen the market data yet from Europe, but generally, when I was over there talking to customers, they seemed more optimistic than they had in previous years. So I have continued good hopes. Clearly, 4% more than exceeded our expectations. The 4% growth that we saw there exceeded our expectations. But we're really pleased with it, and I like the team's execution. And I think there is more to come.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And just to clarify, I meant the economy, not Avery, specifically.","Dean A. Scarborough","Okay. Well, good. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to chat a little bit about the trends you saw in September and the recovery in October. Was that both in RBIS and Pressure-sensitive or was it more weighted to one of the other -- one or the other segment? And can you talk a little bit about which end markets might have suffered the biggest slowdown in September? And have those been the ones that have recovered or has recovery occurred elsewhere to compensate?","Dean A. Scarborough","Okay. Complicated question. So let me start with RBIS. I would -- RBIS, there's enormous growth rate in September last year as part of that pipeline fill for a customer for RFID. Even with that, they showed a little bit of growth in September, which, for me, was a good sign. We did see some slowdown in the rate of orders for certain segments in the U.S.-based retailers, especially, I would characterize the department store segment and the mass merchandising segment as being softer than we expected. But we still had good performance in the fast fashion, as well as the performance athletic segments of the market. So for me, that was still a relatively good news. We performed very well in Europe, actually, across most segments, and a number of RFID programs kicked in a little stronger than we had thought. So that was a good sign. But really, RBIS was -- in the quarter, was very strong in Europe, moderately strong, I would say, in North America. Pressure-sensitive had a really strong quarter last year, so their comps were tough. But we definitely saw some softness in some of the end use markets, particularly the ones -- those markets that would use film products, whether it be in beverages or in health and beauty categories. And it's consistent with what I, at least, read so far in some of the earnings for some of the consumer packaged goods companies talking about consumer takeaway during the quarter. And so -- and we're starting to see some of that -- saw that business come back a little bit. And we've seen this trend before. Sometimes it just gets a little bit choppy, occasionally. And I would say, I'm not -- we're certainly not -- I don't have a deep level of concern, I would put it, but we're being probably a little bit cautious just watching the U.S. consumer and where they're spending their money. I think the fire drill in Washington over the last couple of months probably didn't help consumer confidence a whole lot. So we'll see how things progress.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's interesting, Dean, because it sounds like on the RBIS side, it was more of the mass or maybe more basic earner who seemed to be weakening in terms of their purchase of products that would demand RBIS. On the other hand, with some of the film products being impacted in PSM, those tend to go more towards higher end. So it seems like it's a little bit of a dichotomy. Would you agree or disagree with that?","Dean A. Scarborough","Not really. I mean, there are people who buy shampoo at Walmart, as well as -- or convenience drugstores, et cetera, et cetera. So I actually think it's consistent. Those products are sold in grocery stores, mass market. And what we've heard -- anyway, what we've seen is lower foot traffic, especially, I guess, at what you would call sort of the lower end of the income pyramid. So that was consistent to me. It does not look inconsistent.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. I appreciate that. One more question and I'll turn it over. Can you give a bit more color in terms of how the rollout of digital printing is helping the cost structure for the business in RBIS? And to the extent that you can comment, how much further ahead do you believe you are versus your peers in having that capability in your overall manufacturing network?","Dean A. Scarborough","Yes. We're not all the way there yet. We'll want to get to about 50% of our volume done digitally. So we're still installing presses and all that. But it's not just about the kit, to be honest, it's about how you manage the entire workflow from taking the order at the customer and basically not touching it until it gets to the press. And so there's a lot of software and data handling that happens. It's a lot more automated than what I would characterize as either flexo or offset printing. And so I think we're probably halfway to where we want to be now. And it's a good trend because customers, again, want shorter lead times, smaller orders. And it's just enabled us to do this more efficiently, not just on the press floor, throughout the entire order taking and handling process.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup Global Markets.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You referenced changes in product mix in PSM in the quarter, and I'm wondering if you can give some color on that mix change that might have been -- might have pressured margins a little bit. And then as a follow-up to George's question on the consumer, you had pretty strong emerging market results there, and some other companies have referenced maybe a weaker consumer, certainly, in Latin America and maybe a little bit in Asia. Are you seeing any indications of that?","Dean A. Scarborough","As part of the second part of your question, I'd say, no, I don't think we've seen a material change in emerging market growth. We had strong results in South America. We had strong results in Asia as well. And so we haven't really seen an impact to that. I think fundamentally, in those markets, pressure-sensitive adhesive technology is taking share versus other forms of package decorations. So that trend is still happening, and as well as I believe we're likely taking some market share, relates back to your first question. We have focused on getting more competitive so that we can participate in some lower margin product categories, still very good business for us, and we're operating above our target margin operating range. So I feel like this has been a good strategy for us, and we're going to continue to do that. Part of our innovation program, by the way, is also to continue to take weight out of our products so we can offer materials that are thinner, that means we can be more competitive in some of those segments. So I think, again, it's a smart strategy for us, and it's driving good results.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe switching to RFID. I think you referenced 6% growth in the quarter and maybe 20% growth for the full year. If you were to strip out the impact of that -- the single customer that you didn't get that business this year, do you have a sense of what that full year growth would have been?","Dean A. Scarborough","80%.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","When you look at your results versus plans, you did touch upon the fact that Europe was better than you anticipated. Are there any other surprises that you had during the quarter, whether on a positive or a negative way?","Dean A. Scarborough","Well, I think we mentioned we were -- we have some concern about the North American results in Pressure-sensitive that was softer than we anticipated, and Europe was stronger. And RBIS, frankly, because of the tough comps, we weren't expecting as strong a result, but the team delivered extremely well in that environment. We didn't anticipate getting any growth in RFID, and we got 6%, so very pleased about that.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay. And then looking at Europe, several companies have mentioned Europe earlier today and the last few days of conference calls. And the impression is not necessarily homogeneous. Some comments are that they are seeing some improvements, others will say that, yes, they are seeing improvements for the balance of 2013. But when you talk to customers about 2014, then it is a whole different story, and it is not clear as to what the anticipation is vis-\u00e0-vis those customers. Could you give us a feel for what you are hearing?","Dean A. Scarborough","Well, the one benchmark that I do have is the label show where we participate, and there are a lot of label press manufacturers at the show. And they seem to be doing very well in terms of sales. So it appears to me that a lot of the European customers were buying new equipment for the future. So from that perspective, I took away that they were at least confident enough to put more capital in their businesses to work for the future. So I thought that was a good sign.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question, from the line of Christopher Kapsch with Topeka Capital Markets.","Christopher Kapsch - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I had a follow-up on the comments about some of the weakness in domestic Pressure-sensitive business in September. If you -- just curious, if you look at the supply chain into that end market and just simplistically thinking about you guys selling roll stock into converters, who sell to the CPG companies, who ultimately sell to the retailers, I was wondering, like, what's the lead time in terms of if a retailer is seeing weak foot traffic or if they see the consumer sort of in a de-stock mode? How long does it take for that to back its way up the supply chain to you and your orders into the -- you're shipping into the converters?","Dean A. Scarborough","Yes, Chris, that's a great question. I wish I had a precise answer. I'm going to guess a few months. It's really hard to estimate because, remember, we're selling, just in North America, probably to 2,500 label converters who are selling to probably 100,000 end users. And it really depends on the particular supply chain. Some companies react faster than others to those types of trends.","Christopher Kapsch - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just shifting more to RBIS and RFID, in particular. Just curious, when you lapped the comparison for the big adopter, when did they really curtail their sort of adoption or deployment? So in other words, when would you see the true underlying growth rate for your business come through a little bit more? I guess, is it second quarter or -- of next year?","Mitchell R. Butier","It begins in Q1 is when we start to see that. The toughest comps were September to early Q1 of last year.","Dean A. Scarborough","But I think the underlying growth rate, I'm going to say, it's really tough because the market is still small. When you get a big retailer decide to move quickly, it can influence the year-over-year cycle. But we've had several years in a row now of double-digit growth, and I'm going to say 20%, 30% is a good average to take over the next few years. And I could -- that could be on the low end, frankly. We just don't know. But I do feel like this -- it's not an if RFID is going to happen, it's how fast and what's the rate of adoption going to be. So I have a high level of confidence that this is going to be a great business for the future.","Christopher Kapsch - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got you. Well, I have just a couple of follow-ups on that sort of adoption curve. If you're looking at -- you mentioned, I think, 7 major retailers that are looking at adoptions, and presumably, this is all focused on item level RFID, not sort of the bar code labels that also have an embedded inlay in them. And if you look at those and understanding that they're making that decision based on an ROI analysis, I'm wondering about the breadth of their deployment. Is it tending to be, if you have visibility into this, towards larger ticket items, like something -- like an apparel item that costs $20, $30, $50, $100? Or is it -- when Walmart had been adopting, they went down to very low-priced SKUs, but supposedly, they've throttled back on that. So I'm just wondering if the ROI case is based on these retailers that are adopting and supporting a breadth of adoption across items that even SKUs that are low-priced?","Dean A. Scarborough","So it's -- I would say there are about 3 factors that are important: one is the price. That's actually not the most important; the other one has to do with complexity of the SKU sets, so think about things like shoes or intimate apparel or jeans where you have an enormous variety of SKUs that are kind of hard to track; and then replenishment rate. Those 3 -- we actually have a formula, which I won't share, to help retailers understand, these are the key factors. What we find that happens, though, is retailers tend to start in certain departments, they get the ROI, and then they get some other incremental benefits in other areas as they move forward. And we've had one major retailer just going to go wall-to-wall because once you've started to tag 60%, 70% of your items overall, the retailer is just saying, \"Well, I have such good inventory control now incrementally that extra cost isn't going to be bad.\" So -- and -- so, yes, those are the key factors.","Christopher Kapsch - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then just finally on that. I mean, there have been some -- in the trade press, there's been some noise about a non-practicing entity, NPE, a.k.a. patent troll, which acquired basically a bunch -- a suite of -- a portfolio of micron technologies, RFID patents, several years ago, and some of the early adopters have reportedly been throttling back a little bit over the specter of litigation associated with that. It sounds like based on what you're seeing, this is not really having an influence on any sort of adoption trajectory for the industry as a whole.","Dean A. Scarborough","Well, certainly, it hasn't in Europe because it's not particularly relevant there. But I think these things tend to get resolved over time, and I anticipate that this won't be an issue for the long run.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to confirm, the guidance for the fourth quarter is -- the low end is predicated on your October trend or your September trend? And if I didn't get either of those right, if you could just recast it, that would be great.","Mitchell R. Butier","It's the September trend which we saw in the early parts of October, and October did see a little bit of an improvement from that trend, as Dean mentioned. But it's September.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. The next question I had, are you seeing any signs of capacity increases in coating, in pressure-sensitive? And for that matter, how are you set for coating capacity over the next 1 to 2 years?","Dean A. Scarborough","In Europe, of course, we had a European competitor announce some closures of capacities, specifically, I think, in Spain and in Switzerland. So we've definitely seen some activity there. There is a smaller competitor that's adding capacity in the U.S. And our capacity situation is just fine in mature markets. We're going to be adding -- we've just added some capacity in Malaysia. We're going to -- and India. We're going to add some new capacity in India next year and likely be looking at adding some capacity fairly soon in China as that business continues to grow.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then back to digital presses. So I'd ask, could you quantify, if not precisely, maybe directionally, or with some qualifiers, how this ultimately improves your cost structure within RBIS? And is it additive to the longer-term margin goal of 9% or is it supportive of that goal?","Dean A. Scarborough","It's supportive of the footprint reduction goal that we've announced. So digital printing takes up less space than, let's say, certainly, than offset printing. You don't have really any pre-press that you have to as well.","Mitchell R. Butier","They're more flexible assets.","Dean A. Scarborough","Yes.","Mitchell R. Butier","So less footprint relative to that output.","Dean A. Scarborough","So it's all been part -- it's all part of the strategy we have to move RBIS margins to the target range. So what I'm trying to do is help investors understand, we have a very clear set of milestones. Okay. We're at about -- we've reduced our footprint by 15%, on our way to get to 25%. Digital printing is supposed to be 50%. It's around 25% or 30% now. So -- but indicative that we believe we're on track to hit our margin targets as we promised back in 2012.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's great, Dean. The last question, just related to that. When did you say you get to 50%, having rolled out digital press throughout RBIS?","Dean A. Scarborough","When?","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes.","Dean A. Scarborough","Well, it should be close to 2015, actually.","Operator","Our next question is also a follow-up from Scott Gaffner with Barclays Capital.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just one clarification. On free cash flow year-to-date, what is the -- you said the divested businesses were actually negative free cash flow year-to-date. Can you provide that number? And then also, is the $10 million to $15 million, I think that's what you referenced, $10 million to $15 million of additional cash on divestitures would be spent some time in the fourth quarter. Is that included in the free cash flow guidance?","Mitchell R. Butier","So the free cash flow guidance we have is for continuing operations, so that excludes any of that. The $10 million to $15 million extra I referenced was basically getting you from -- if you look at the exhibits behind the -- in the financial statements, you see we have $402 million of net proceeds now. I'm just saying we have another $10 million to $15 million to pull off of that. So that will drop down to roughly $390 million. As far as the negative free cash flow, there was negative free cash flow of about $40 million in the first half for those 2 businesses related to investments you make in working capital. If you will recall, OCP was a seasonal business, as well as we had some of the transaction -- pre-closing transaction costs within there as well. So that's why we lumped it all together because that wasn't really the operating level of free cash flow for those businesses.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just one longer-term question. As more and more sales move to e-commerce, what sort of impact should we think about that having on your business? I would assume you get less ticket if you don't have the in-store ticket anymore, but maybe you get more RFID sales. How do you kind of think about that change-over over time?","Dean A. Scarborough","Well, actually, Scott, it's a good question. Retailers don't change their branding or ticketing, whether it's sold in-store or online. And in fact, it actually provides some new opportunity for us because what's happening is that retailers want you to be able to buy things online and then return them to the store if you want to or even pick them up at the store. And so that requires, let's say, on a return, that item actually has to be reticketed. It happens a lot, especially when you buy stuff online, it doesn't fit or you didn't really like the color, et cetera, et cetera. And so what we found is that there's just no difference between the branding and ticketing. And we have come up with solutions to help retailers manage a more seamless interface between, again, their bricks model and their clicks model. Could be some upside for PSM, by the way. It means there's more bar code labels out there, so as people buy online and get stuff shipped in cartons.","Operator","And with that, we have time for one more question, and that will be from Christopher Kapsch with Topeka Capital Markets.","Christopher Kapsch - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Yes, just one follow-up on RBIS. You mentioned you're -- you felt like you're on track with your -- the progression towards your longer-term margin targets in that business. And I'm just wondering if -- as RFID grows at a higher growth rate than the core RBIS business system, if that's going to influence those margin targets at all, just -- as that business is growing, are those margins accretive to the overall segment or is it something that's just consistent with the targets that you already have out there?","Mitchell R. Butier","So they're absolutely consistent with targets. The targets we have out there are targets for 2015, which is only 2 years from now. And the -- so they're consistent, and the margins for RFID are comparable to the overall margins we have for the overall RBIS business. It's modestly higher, currently.","Christopher Kapsch - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one last one. You mentioned layering in some higher employee-related costs in that segment. Is that associated with a broader RFID adoption? Or what's driving that?","Mitchell R. Butier","No. That's just part of the fundamental to this business. This business, as we've talked about, is more labor-intensive than pressure-sensitive, and a lot of that labor is in the emerging markets where the wage rates are higher. So when we've talked about this business, forget restructuring and productivity, but this business needs to grow 1.5% to 2% to kind of maintain margins, if you will. That is because it needs that level of growth to offset the natural wage inflation headwinds.","Operator","Mr. Scarborough, there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back to you. Please continue with your presentation or closing remarks.","Dean A. Scarborough","Well, thanks, everyone, for participating today. I'm pleased with the excellent progress we've made so far this year. Our value creation formula remains straightforward. With modest top line growth, ongoing productivity improvements and highly disciplined capital management, we'll continue to drive double-digit earnings growth and solid free cash flow, most of which we'll give back to shareholders.","I would like to thank the Avery Dennison team members for delivering another strong quarter. And thanks again for joining us today, and look forward to speaking with you again soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today.

Please go ahead sir.","Garrett Gabel","Thank you, Kama [ph]. Today, we'll discuss our preliminary unaudited fourth quarter and full-year results. The non-GAAP financial measures that we use are defined, qualified and reconciled with GAAP on Schedules A-4 to A-8 of the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release and Appendix B of our supplemental presentation materials. We remind you that we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. These forward-looking statements are made subject to the Safe Harbor statement included in today's earnings release.","On the call today are Mitch Butier, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Anne Bramman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mitch.","Mitchell Butier","Thanks, Garrett, and hello everyone. I'm pleased to report another year of excellent progress towards our long term goals. We delivered strong organic sales growth and double-digit growth in earnings per share with return on total capital expanding the 17%, all while increasing our pace of investment to drive future growth. Our Label and Graphic Materials business continues to outperform, Retail Branding and Information Solutions is now on track to achieve its long-term margin goals, and the newly created Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment while down in the near term is well positioned to create significant value.","2016 marked the fifth consecutive year of solid organic sales growth and double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. This consistent performance speaks to the resilience of our market positions, the depth of talent in the Company and the strategic foundations we\u2019ve laid. We continue to make great progress and accelerating growth in high-value categories such graphics, tapes and RFID, both by capturing share organically and through acquisitions.","And our constant focus on driving productivity and instilling more pricing discipline have improved the organic growth rates as well as significantly increased margins in our base businesses such as pressure-sensitive barcode labels and department stores apparel tags. These strategies have further reinforced our already strong foundation, which we are beginning to leverage through the disciplined execution of our M&A strategy.","Now, let me describe how these strategic priorities are playing out within each of the segments. Label and Graphic Materials effectively the former pressure-sensitive material segment excluding performance tapes had another outstanding year of solid organic growth and margin expansion. Our strategy to expand our position high-value categories is working. These categories which include specialty Label, Graphics and Reflective Solutions were approximately 10% for the year.","I'm especially pleased with our progress in graphics. We\u2019ve gained share by improving our quality and continuing to provide differentiated service as well as by bringing innovation to the space particularly in cast films. Now, with the addition of Mactac Europe, graphics is a roughly $500 million business for us.","With this scale and the ability to leverage our operational excellence and expertise in material science, this business is well positioned for significant value creation. In addition to delivering above average growth in these high value categories, we generated solid organic growth and sizable margin expansion in our base product lines for the second year in a row.","Our focus here has been to position ourselves for sustainable profitable growth through tailored go-to-market strategies and a constant drive for productivity. And that would be re-missed, if I did not also highlight the importance of emerging markets which continue to be a significant and consistent growth driver in the segment, and we expect to continue to benefit from our broad-based exposure and leadership position in these geographies.","We have and will continue to increase the pace of investment to leverage this high return business, as demonstrated by our acquisitions of Mactac Europe and Hanita Coatings and Ink Mill as well as our investment to expand our flagship plant in Luxembourg. You've heard about Mactac and Ink Mill, so I\u2019ll just comment briefly on the acquisition of Hanita Coatings that we announced in December.","This is an Israeli developer and manufacturer of coated films, the great standalone business today, operating in market segments that expand our reach; and we see immediate opportunities to cross sell their products through our global network. The Company had a closure of innovation and longstanding commitment to R&D, which are strong fit with our own record and commitment to innovation in material science. We expect this deal to close in the first quarter.","Retail Branding and Information Solutions delivered solid growth driven by radio-frequency identification, which grew an impressive 40% for the year. The growth was driven by both the implementation of new programs and the acceleration of active rollouts. The case for RFID is clear and we remain the go-to supplier in the market, so we will continue to invest in innovation and capacity in this space.","Outside of RFID, we saw volumes increased across customer categories over the last few quarters, despite a difficult retailer apparel market, demonstrating early success of our multi-year transformation strategy. We continue to move more and more decision making closer to our customers, reduce complexity as well as our cost structure, and qualify lower cost, locally sourced materials to support more competitive pricing.","Our improvements in service flexibility and speed continue to resonate with our customers, and are the force behind our accelerated pace of margin expansion. To that end, I'm pleased to say that we are on track to deliver on our long-term profitability and value creation objectives in this business, even should we remain in a relatively low growth environment for apparel.","Turning to Industrial and Healthcare Materials, this newly created segment includes our performance tapes business previously reported in pressure-sensitive materials, our fasteners business, which was previously in RBIS and Vancive Medical Technologies, which was previously a standalone segment. We've spoken before about reestablishing the linked between tapes and Vancive to better leverage our core competencies as well as our cost structure.","This new segment reflects that strategic shift as well as the alignment of businesses that share common and markets namely automotive, electronics and healthcare. These are attractive high value markets for us where we are currently underpenetrated. The growth prospects for this business reflect broader trends such as the conversion from mechanical fasteners to tape that reduce weight and provide other functionality such as noise and vibration dampening.","We expect this business to return to a solid growth trajectory by mid-2017 in both Industrial and Healthcare categories. This segment has a comparable margin to Label and Graphics Materials, and we expect it to enter 2018 with the comparable growth rate as well. Given the growth potential and the ability to leverage, our key competencies including process technology in R&D of our two materials segments, this is an area of focus for future investment including M&A.","Speaking of which, I'm pleased with the overall progress and our M&A strategy, both in terms of the quality of the deals and the size and quality of our pipeline. We will continue to pursue opportunities that increase our exposure to high-value lines, product lines, add to our core capabilities and provide greater scale. All-in-all, 2016 was another great year, and we are looking to continue our strong performance in 2017.","As always, we aim for the upper end of our guidance range and are targeting solid revenue growth and double digit EPS growth this year. We are confident we will continue our momentum and achieve our long-term goal by maintaining our focus on delivering exceptional value for our customers, our employees and our shareholders as we execute the key strategies I outlined earlier.","First and foremost, we will drive outsized growth in high-value segments. We will continue to invest disproportionately here both organically and through both on acquisitions. Overtime, this will improve our portfolio mix and bolster our leadership in these key segments.","Second, we are relentless in our pursuit of productivity improvement to enhance our competitiveness across all product categories and of course to drive margin expansion.","Third, we are maintaining our high degree of capital efficiency while increasing investments to support profitable growth and long-term value creations; and of course, we will continue our disciplined approach to returning cash to shareholders.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Anne.","Anne Bramman","Thanks, Mitch. I'll provide additional color on the quarter and year, and then I'll walk you through our outlook for 2017. In Q4, adjusted earnings per share increased by 17% compared to the prior year above our expectation due to higher than expected organic sales growth of approximately 5%. Acquisitions lifted sales by 2.7% while currency represented a headwind of approximately 1%.","Adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter improved 70 basis points to 9.4%, driven by the impact of higher volume and productivity initiatives. Restructuring savings net of transition expenses were approximately $14 million in the quarter and $82 million for the year in line with our expectations. Our adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 32% and approximately 33% for the full year in line with both our expectations and the prior year.","Free cash flow was $139 million in the quarter. For the full year, free cash flow was $387 million driven by higher income and working capital productivity. As expected, we increased our combined spending on fixed and IT capital projects, and restructuring this year, as we continue to invest for profitable growth particularly in our high-value categories and in emerging markets.","Our balance sheet remains strong and we had ample capacity to continue funding acquisitions as well as returning cash to shareholders. As Mitch stated, we are committed to the disciplined return of cash to shareholders. We've repurchased 3.8 million shares in 2016 at a cost net of proceeds from stock options of $191 million and paid $143 million in dividends.","Before I provide commentary on segment performance, I want to point out that we have provided a bridge for a previous segment to the new segment, for both the fourth quarter and full-year in Slide 7 and in Appendix A in our supplemental materials. Our Label and Graphic Materials segment is essentially what we previously referred to as PSM, less our performance tapes business, which is now included in Industrial and Healthcare Materials.","As you can see, the growth in margin profile of this segment is relatively unchanged. We have moved our high-margin Fastener Solutions business from RBIS to IHM, reducing the margin base-line in RBIS by approximately 80 basis points. The adjusted operating margin improvement of 230 basis points since 2013 is unchanged for the segment.","The Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment includes performance tapers Fastener Solutions and Vancive Medical Technologies which was previously a standalone segment. Today, the margins in these segments are similar to LGM, and once we move pass the headwind in the first half of the year, we would expect the sales growth to be similar as well.","Now, turning to segment performance for the quarter, in Label and Graphic Materials sales increased approximately 7% on organic basis impart due to improved volumes and matured markets which increased mid-single digits in the quarter. We saw continued solid demand in Western Europe while volume in North America improved from the relatively soft conditions in Q3.","We believe that we have recovered some of the market share we ceded in North America earlier this year. Broad-based strength in emerging markets continued with organic sales growth of low double-digits in the quarter. China grew mid-single digits, sustaining the improvements we saw in Q3, while growth in India moderated to a high-single digit growth rate due impart to the government demonetization campaign.","From a product line perspective, sales in Label in Packaging Materials increased mid-single digits and the combined Graphics and the Reflective businesses increased low-double digits organically. LGM's adjusted operating margin increased by 70 basis points to 11.5% due to the impact of higher volume. As expected, margins were negatively impacted by nearly 50 basis points due to the Mactac integration. We expect this acquisition to contribute approximately $0.10 to 2017 ETF when we move pass the integration phase and margins come in line with the segment average.","Turning to Retail Branding and Information Solutions, sales grew 5% on an organic basis driven mostly by growth of RFID which exceeded expectation increasing 20% for the quarter. We continue to expect this business to grow at a 20% plus rate going forward, and we\u2019ll continue to invest in this important growth catalyst. Despite a challenging retail apparel environment, volume growth improved in the base business, and we continue to see signs that our efforts to transform the business model are gaining traction.","From a regional perspective, we continue to see strong unit volume growth among European retailers and brand owners, partly driven by continued progress in expanding our share among fast fashion retailers. Unit volumes for core products were essentially flat in the U.S. consistent with what we saw last quarter, and this market remains challenged as demonstrated by macro indicators.","Adjusted operating margins in this segment improved by 220 basis points to 10% as the net savings from the business model transformation and the benefit of higher volume were partly offset by higher employee related cost. This brought the full year margin expansion to a 110 basis points as we progress towards achieving our 2018 profitability target. The margin improvements objectives remain the same for this business and despite moving the high-margin Fastener Solutions business to IHM, we are confident in our ability to achieve a 10% operating margin in 2018.","Industrial and Healthcare Materials sales declined by 8%, as growth in Industrial Materials were more than offset by the decline in the broader healthcare category, reflecting the program loss in personal care and the decline in Vancive we\u2019ve discussed previously. Industrial categories were up high-single digits on an organic basis. Adjusted operating margin declined by 310 basis points to 9.7%, as the lower volume with only partly offset by productivity initiatives.","As I previously mentioned, we expect this business to return to growth in the second half of 2017, and have an organic growth and margins similar to LGM. We look forward to share a more detail on our strategies and long-term goals for each of the segment during our Analyst Meeting next month.","Now, turning back to the total company; our results in 2016 represent another year of progressions towards our long-term target. We are on track to deliver on our 2018 goal and have achieved a 17% return on total capital. Our net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio remains below our targeted range. Our balance sheet is healthy and we have ample capacity for investments.","Turning now to our outlook for 2017, we anticipate adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.30 to $4.50. We have outlined some of the key contributing factors to this guidance on Slide 12 of our supplemental presentation material. We estimate between 3% and 4.5% organic sales growth in line with the range we've experienced over the last few years. The impact of acquisition on sales is approximately 1.5% from close deals and approximately 2% including the impact of the announced Hanita deal.","At recent exchange rates, currency translation represents a pretax earnings impact of approximately $22 million or roughly $0.17 per share. We estimate that incremental pretax savings from restructuring actions will contribute between $40 million and $50 million in 2017. About 40% of which represents the carryover benefit from actions taken in 2016.","At the low end of our EPS guidance range, we would expect modest improvement in consolidated margins. At the high-end, we would expect approximately 50 basis points in our margin expansion. We expect the tax rate in a low 30s due to stronger income growth in lower tax jurisdictions. We estimate average shares outstanding assuming dilution of 88 million to 89 million shares, reflecting our continued return of tax to shareholders.","We anticipate spending approximately $215 million on fixed capital and IT projects and approximately $22 million in cash restructuring, which combined is roughly flat to 2016 and consistent with our long-term capital allocation plans. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion of approximately 100% of net income.","So, in summary, we are pleased with the strategic and financial progress we made against our 2018 goals this year. Our solid and consistent free cash flow and healthy balance sheet give us plenty of room to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders. And our profitable growth strategies combined with the high degree with capital efficiency reflect our commitments to deliver exceptional value over the long run.","Now, we'll open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.","Matt Krueger","This is actually Matt Krueger sitting in for Ghansham. What were the major factors that led to your core sales growth out performance in Q4, relative to your initial expectations? And which, if any, of these factors are sustainable moving into the 2017 year?","Anne Bramman","So, well, we had a really solid quarter with 5% organic growth which really exceeded our expectations, and we saw this both in the LGM and the RBIS particularly RFID that was strong in both divisions. So, from a margins perspective, we saw this coming in slightly better due to higher volumes and then the impact of our transformation efforts in RBIS. As we talked about the guidance for 2017, and while we assume was on the top line is, if you look at our sales growth over the last couple of years, we've delivered anywhere from the 3% to 4.5% organic growth.","I mean, it really depends on what you see both from a retail apparel market as well as the broader economic market, and so that's why we gave the range of the 3 to 4.5. As far as on the margin side, what we believe on the margin for the guidance is that, we'll see productivity improvement in RBIS and it really depends on the degree as well as the volume flow through pickup. So, on the high end, we would expect to see more coming from top line growth from RBIS. Certainly on the high end of our guidance from a LGM perspective, we would expect to see a modest improvement in margins particularly coming up from really strong 2016.","Mitchell Butier","And just to build on that Matt, looking just in Q4, high level I'd say little bit stronger coming in from Materials in Europe. And I'd say the pace with which we were able to reverse the trend in materials North America beat our expectations. And then China for both Materials and RBIS came in bit stronger than we expected, and we think some of that maybe due to the timing of Chinese New Year being earlier in '17 than usual. So those are the key headlines for the beat. Overall though it reinforces the strategy that we've been laying out about wining in all categories and really speaks with resilience and strength we have our broad-based market positions in each geography.","Matt Krueger","And then, can you provide a breakout of your expected 2017 cost savings by segment? And can you provide any specifics about the timing of these cost savings as they flow through the year?","Anne Bramman","Yes, as we mentioned, we have some carryover savings coming into '17, which we really that piece to be more frontloaded. For additional new actions that we're taking, we really see those being more back loaded about I would say roughly 75% of the savings will be flowing through SG&A, and the bulk of the vast majority of those are going to be related to RBIS.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Up next, we have a question from the line of Scott Luis Gaffner from Barclays Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Gaffner","Question is more on the margin expansion. You talked about volume leverage you also talked about growth in the higher margin businesses. Just specific to 2017, it sounded like it more focused; let's say we get to the high end of 50 that's the margin improvement. Is that more focused on volume leverage? Or is it more focused on actually growing in the higher margin businesses?","Mitchell Butier","You can tease out any single component that you want. I think what you see is just it's a combination of volume leverages as well as driving productivity, is what we've lead out in our guidance for 2017, Scott. If we talk about the comments over the last couple of years, we've seen improved margins from the improved mix, but the biggest driver was actually instilling more disciplined within the base business that we've been talking through both from driving productivity, but also enabling us to drive more profitable growth and get volume leverage even within that category as well.","Scott Gaffner","So when you look at the incremental margins in RBIS. I mean is it -- are you able to generate incremental margins at a lower sales volumes figure now? And what is a typical incremental margin in that business nowadays?","Anne Bramman","So, I think Q4 was really a good representation that when you get growth in this business, it flows through, it's a very high variable margin business. As we continue to accelerate our strategy, our business transformation, we would expect to see the contribution margin continue to hold up in this business despite a microenvironment with the retail piece to it. So, it's really about volume in this. When we look through this and look at our general rule of thumb, you do need a couple of points to have it start flowing through a top line growth. But in general really trying -- we're positioning this business to be able to achieve the profitability goals even in the low growth environment.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. And are you generating positive economic value within the RBIS segment now at these margins rate?","Mitchell Butier","Yes. So, the margin rates that we are going into for 2017 and 2018, this business will be positive EVA. Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citigroup Global Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Anthony Pettinari","In the past two quarters, you have cited price net of cost as negative for the PSM business. I wondered how that trended in Q4, and what raw material trends you're seeing currently and how we should think about balancing price cost maybe in the first half of the year?","Mitchell Butier","Yes. So, overall, we\u2019re seeing a relatively stable environment on raw materials, but it's different by component. We buy a lot of specialty both chemicals as well as paper products. But within that seeing a little bit of modest headwinds in chemicals pretty broad based across regions, and seeing some specific inflation relatively modest but still enough within China that we\u2019re looking at a price increase there. So, the key message here overall relative stability, little bit modest headwind. But I\u2019d say it's relatively negligible overall.","Anthony Pettinari","And then looking at RBIS, I guess the apparel important data that we see in North America has been a little bit more positive in recent months. Just curious what kind of demand you\u2019re seeing in January? And I guess a related question, we have a new administration and there is been a lot of discussion around border adjustment tax and potential impact to apparel and retailer some of your customers. I'm just wondering, if you had any broad thoughts on that as well?","Mitchell Butier","Sure. So, just overall your first question about what we\u2019re seeing within the first quarter, first few weeks of shipments within our RBIS. So, it's tough to read, few weeks data is never a great read for a quarter or year is going to play out, and it's particularly challenging here because of Chinese New Year. With the Chinese New Year moving earlier, we really need to cycle through the first two months to every year to get a good read on it. First couple of weeks, we're positive and now it's off because we\u2019re in the middle of the Chinese New Year, which we haven't come through yet.","So, as far as the broader tax, we\u2019re in close contact and working with our retailers and brands to understand how they're thinking this through. The key message here is just way too early to tell what the impacts of that maybe and whether would even be implemented in its current form or even any other form. So, there is quite a few questions on it, we\u2019re close to this. I think as if anything related to this we\u2019re implemented, I think what you would expect is that retailers would have to get much more efficient in managing their supply chain, reducing inventories and so forth. And that would play to our strength as far as the capabilities that we bring both in brand management and information solution business, not just help elevate brands, but also to help accelerate the supply chain.","Anthony Pettinari","And then just maybe one last housekeeping question. In terms of the guidance for 2017, is there any pension expense or cash contribution that we should be modeling for 2017 versus last year?","Anne Bramman","So, on the pension expense side, we do see it going up about a $0.06 EPS impact in 2017 primarily due to foreign pension discount rates declining, which increases the pension expense. So that is a headwind for us in 2017. As far as the cash contributions, we did make the required '17 payment. We didn\u2019t make that at the end of the 2016. It was offset by some favorability and cash taxes. So, from a free cash flow perspective that kind of washed out, but for '17, we would expect to make about a $50 million payment, normal payment that we would see for some of the foreign cash taxes foreign pensions.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of George Leon Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","George Staphos","Mitch and Anne, congratulations on the quarter and year. Certainly better than we would have expected in the quarter. One question I had, just to maybe piggyback on Anthony's question on order deductibility, would you expect supply chains to be disrupted, are your customers at all talking about maybe needing to move the needle so to speak, back towards the U.S.? And aside from following your customers, how would you contend with that?","Mitchell Butier","So, George, I'd say it's far too early to say what the impact would be. As I think about it, if you think of the shared numbers, it's a labor intensive industry, the shared number of people engaged in this industry globally. I'm not sure we have the labor force in the U.S. to be able to accommodate tax. So, I think that if you think about and then you consider couple of that with the fact of the lower wages outside the U.S. where these things are manufactured today even a tax hit, but still be relatively lower cost.","I think the impact would be more on what it would do to end demand, if my assessment. Again given the implications of all of these things, it's essentially consumption tax is what it would mean in the end. I think this question whether it would even be adopted anything close to its current reform, but we're looking to be well positioned regardless of what the outcome is and work with our retailers and brands to customers to make sure that they are successful relative to whatever happens on the horizon.","George Staphos","Fair enough, Mitch. A related question on RFID growth continuing at 20%, can you provide a bit more color in terms of launches, new adoptions? I remember the comparison being also very, very challenging versus last year's quarter. Can you give us a bit of color on that, and what the comps are in the first half of '17 for RFID?","Mitchell Butier","Sure. So, just overall looking at the pipeline for the growth for the year and including within the quarter, you got a couple of customers that were already in active rollout, ramp-ups that will rollout and actually moving quicker than we expected them to and they were basically were hitting their more aspirational targets for rollout. And so we knew it was within the realm of possibility for Q4 specifically, but we weren\u2019t banking on it. We make sure that we have the right capacity to ensure that we could fulfill the orders that they've come through and ended up coming through in hitting.","In addition to that, there was a couple of key customers that went out or moved out of pilot and started that into the early adoption phase and that it is also as contributing to the growth within the year. And then there is a quite few, I'm talking that about major customers here, quite a few midsized and smaller retailers and brands that are also going through adoption right now. So that was what was the positive of the upside, looking forward 2017 or beyond, we continue to expect RFID to be at 20% plus growth business.","George Staphos","Mitch, not to get too pedantic, maybe, but do you expect 20% pretty linearly over the course of 2017, and can you remind us what the some of the comparisons look like first half? I remember first quarter being a tough one for RFID.","Mitchell Butier","Yes, we had a big surge in Q4 of '15 and Q1 of '16, and you've seen another surge within Q4. I think that message here George is that we've talked about it being relatively choppy in the past towards as far as when the exact timing of these programs will come whether it would somebody an active rollout accelerating the next phase the rollout or just new customer suddenly just want decide they want to move, takes the long time to make the decision. Once, they decide they want to move, they want to move quickly. So, except some choppiness quarter-to-quarter, the key thing I'd focus on is just the growth trajectory and focus on 20% on an annual basis going forward.","George Staphos","Understood. My last question and I'll turn it over. Can you give us some guidance on depreciation and amortization for this year, remembering that you have some roll off occurring in RBIS related to Paxar from years gone by, and what that adds to earnings if anything this coming year? Thank you.","Anne Bramman","So, the Paxar piece to it, the amortization is roughly $8 million this year and about $7 million in '18. You would get over the next two years of at a point of favorability in RBIS from that amortization.","George Staphos","8, this year, 7 in 2018; correct Anne? ","Anne Bramman","Correct, yes.","Operator","And thank you sir. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan Securities. Please proceed.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. Just one more question on border taxes. Do you import much raw materials that you turn into products? Or is your import intermediate products relatively low?","Mitchell Butier","Very low the import of our products. So, Jeff, we work with the retailers and brands principally in the mature regions of the Western Europe and the US. And spec our products and basically set pricing and so forth, and then our direct sales are to the apparel manufacturers that are distributed globally around the world. And so, we actually don't -- our sales are not in the U.S. even though the end markets are the U.S. or Western Europe.","Jeff Zekauskas","So in theory, your own tax rate from border taxes might be and reform might be more advanced, if this were to go through leaving aside what happens to your demand?","Mitchell Butier","Yes, given the current contract it's not impact to our tax rate. Overall, I think that the -- the border tax if you think of is what does it do to retailers and how they're thinking through the supply chains. We are working with them to make sure they can go through any transition that happens. I have my own questions on well that would and what reform. And then the broader tax adjustment that they're working through, I think you've highlighted this in one of your reports, we would expect would be a benefit to us and how they're talking about it from tax rate perspective.","Anne Bramman","But I just want to emphasize that as you know this is still very early stages with not a lot of concrete, we're seeing very close to this obviously. But anything we did, be interchanged or reduced our tax liability we would change our guidance accordingly.","Mitchell Butier","Yes, I think for this is baked into our guidance right now given the global uncertainty.","Jeff Zekauskas","Can you talk about price mix trends in the fourth quarter for your two main segments? Were the price mix up or down or did they stay the same?","Mitchell Butier","So, the net impact of price in raw material cost within the material segment was relatively neutral. As I mentioned, we're starting to see a little bit of on the sequential basis raw material input cost trends going up. We constantly work to within this level, use our material reengineering, innovation capabilities to be able to hope reduce the material content of our products to offset that, so net-net between all of them relatively neutral, between price raw material input and material reengineering productivity that we have.","Within RBIS, so we\u2019ve been -- as we talked through focused on maintaining our high degree of variable margins within that business, but reducing the direct material cost input cost in that business and getting more price competitive. So, we have prices down in this business, but Q4 was the quarter we have predicted where we cycle through and where we wouldn\u2019t on an net basis no longer have a hit from that perspective and that\u2019s out played out and that\u2019s stabilize that we expect we can see be stable going into 2017.","Jeff Zekauskas","Do you expect core RBIS volume to grow in 2017 that is exclusive of RFID? Or it's too early to tell?","Mitchell Butier","We expect it to grow.","Operator","Thank you for your question sir. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","This is actually Michael Boink [ph] sitting in for Adam, thanks for taking my questions. Just a quick one for me. Can you just talk about what FX rates your guidance assumes this year?","Anne Bramman","Sure. So for the euro, we\u2019re assuming around 1.045ish and the RMB was another piece to our currency basket is 0.1437.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Mr. Butier, there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to you. Please continue with your presentation or closing remarks.","Mitchell Butier","Well, thank everybody for joining the call today. Just want to highlight again our consistent performance we\u2019ve had over the last few years speaks the resilience of our market positions, the depth of talents in the Company and the strategic foundations we\u2019ve laid. I really just want to thank our teams globally for their continued creativity and commitment in delivering phenomenal results.

Please go ahead, ma'am.","Cindy Guenther","Thank you, Ash. Today, we'll discuss our preliminary unaudited third quarter results. Please note that, throughout today's discussion, we'll be making references to non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP measures that we use are defined, qualified and reconciled with GAAP on pages A-4 to A-8 attached to the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release and the appendix of our supplemental presentation materials.","We remind you that, we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. These forward-looking statements are made subject to the safe harbor statement included in today's earnings release. On the call today are Mitch Butier, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Lovins, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I'll now turn the call over to Mitch.","Mitch Butier","Thanks, Cindy, and good day, everyone. We delivered solid profit growth in the third quarter despite softer-than-usual market demand with EPS once again up double-digits over prior year on a constant currency basis. Our focus in this slower growth environment has been to protect, even expand our margins in the base business, while driving faster than average growth in high-value categories like RFID. We're executing well on both fronts.","We appear to have recaptured most of the share we've recently lost in LGM. Our intelligent labels platform continues to drive over 20% growth from RFID enabled solutions and IHM's commercial execution continues to improve. At the same time, a relentless focus on productivity was again a key driver of margin expansion for the Company this quarter. In sum, we are making good progress against our key strategic priorities and are on track to deliver our long-term financial targets.","Label and Graphic Materials posted strong profitability on roughly a point of organic growth for the quarter driven primarily by volume. High value categories again grew faster than the base. As I mentioned, though all the market data isn't in yet for the third quarter, we have good reasons to believe that by the end of the quarter, we had recaptured the bulk of the share we ceded at the tail end of the inflationary cycle. In terms of global market trends, it appears that the soft market conditions that we saw in the first half of the year largely continued into the third quarter with a modest improvement in Europe offset by a moderation of demand in South Asia.","Retail Branding and Information Solutions delivered solid organic growth, driven by ongoing strengthened RFID and external embellishments, which more than offset declines in the base apparel business. As we mentioned in July, we thought trade-related uncertainty impacting orders in the second quarter. This is uncertainty was reinforced when additional tariffs were announced in August.","Now, while trade related issues are causing near-term uncertainty, we are well positioned in the base business given our global footprint and differentiated product and service capabilities. As for RFID, the growth trajectory continues to be resilient, with continued strength and apparel and even faster growth from other promising verticals, though obviously off of a small base.","Our total pipeline with customer engagements continues to expand, up more than 40% from just the beginning of this year, driven primarily by categories outside of apparel. As the leader in ultra high frequency RFID, we are positioned extremely well to capture these opportunities with industry leading innovation and manufacturing capabilities and the best most experienced team in the space.","We continue to increase our level of investment in business development and other resources to drive this growth. As we build out our intelligent labels platform to enable a future where every item can have a digital twin and digital life. In Industrial and Healthcare Materials sales growth was relatively strong on an organic basis, due in part to lapping the slowdown in China's automotive market last year.","That said, given the high proportion of this segment portfolio that is focused on industrial and markets, I'm pleased with the solid top-line performance the team delivers. And importantly, we made excellent progress in the quarter towards achieving our operating margin target for the business.","Ensure another solid quarter overall in the midst of a challenging environment. Our strategies to deliver outsized growth in high value categories are working. And our relentless focus on productivity continues to enable us to increase our pace of investment in these categories, increase our competitiveness overall and grow profitably in our base businesses, while importantly, continuing to protect and expand operating margin.","Well, we lowered the hind end of our near-term outlook for top-line growth due to recent market trends and currency shifts caused us to reduce the high end of our EPS guidance for the year. We are confident in our ability to achieve our long-term objectives, including GDP plus growth and top cortile returns. We will continue to seek opportunities to leverage our positions of the strength commercially, operationally and financially and as you've heard me say before, be prepared to lean forward even as others may pull back.","Now turn the call over to Greg.","Greg Lovins","Thanks and hello, everybody. As Mitch said, we delivered another solid quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.66, up 14% despite the currency headwind. We grew sales by 2.1% on an organic basis, and currency translations reduced reported sales growth by two points in the quarter, and our adjusted operating margin increased by a full point to 11.7%.","We realized $18 million of restructuring savings net of transition costs in the quarter due in part to LGM's restructuring in Europe that was largely completed as of the end of Q2 and our cash generation has been strong. We've delivered $327 million of free cash flow year-to-date up $67 million compared to the same period last year.","As we've discussed, we've increased our pace of fix capital in IT-related spending for a few years to support our long-term organic growth and margin expansion plans. With capital spending expected to be up by about $20 million this year and we continue to return cash to shareholders.","In the first three quarters of the year, we repurchase roughly 2 million shares at an aggregate cost of $204 million and paid $141 million in dividends, for a total of $346 million in cash return to shareholders.","Importantly, our balance sheet remains strong, with net debt to adjust EBITDA kicking down slightly in the quarter. Our current leverage position gives us ample capacity to continue executing our disciplined capital allocation strategy, including investing in organic growth and acquisitions, while continuing to return to shareholders. We are well positioned to take advantage of any dislocations in the market should they occur over the next few years.","Turning to the segment results for the quarter. Label and Graphic Materials sales increased by 1.2% on an organic basis, driven primarily by higher volume, as we've now left, the bulk of last year's price increases. Growth in LGM's high value categories led by specialty labels, continue to outpace the growth of the based business.","And breaking down LGM's organic growth in the quarter by region, North America was roughly flat, while Western Europe was up low single-digits. Emerging markets also grew at a low single-digit rate with China up low single-digits in South Asia up mid single-digits.","Adjusted operating margin for the segment was strong at 13.5%, up 120 basis points compared to the prior year, reflecting the benefit of productivity initiatives, including restructuring and material reengineering, partially offset by higher employee related costs. The net effect of changes in price and raw materials and freight input costs was neutral for the quarter.","Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions, RBIS delivered solid top line growth of 4.1% on an organic basis, driven by faster growth and high value categories, with RFID's sales up roughly 28% and external embellishments growing even faster.","Our based business adjusted for the migration of products to higher value RFID solutions was down low single-digits. Adjusted operating margin for the segment increased 10 basis points to 11.5%. As productivity gains were largely offset by long-term growth related investments primarily related to RFID.","Turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment. Sales are up 3.7% on an organic basis, reflecting both volume growth and higher prices. Sales for industrial categories were up low to mid single digits, driven by solid growth in auto related categories. And healthcare categories grew even faster, up high single digits with medical up in the high teens.","We made excellent progress on the margin front in IHM. Adjusted operating margin increased by 180 basis points to 11%. As a benefit from higher volume and productivity more than offset higher employee related costs. The normal seasonality does call for sequential easing in margin for the fourth quarter, I am confident we will exceed the 10% we targeted for IHM for the full year.","Focusing now on our outlook for 2019. We've lowered the high end of our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share, reflecting incremental currency translation headwinds, largely offset by stronger operational results in a modestly lower tax rate compared to our previous expectations. We have reduced our outlook for full year organic sales growth to a range of 2.0% to 2.3%, which implies 2% to 3% growth for the fourth quarter.","As you know in our short cycle businesses, visibility to demand is very limited and we've seen increased variability in order patterns from month-to-month. So, the lower end of our organic growth outlook assumes a continuation of the 2% we've seen year-to-date including the first few weeks of October. On the high-end reflects the fact that comparison to do easier for us over the balance of the quarter.","We've outlined some of the other key contributing factor to our guidance on Slide 9 of over supplemental presentation materials. In particular and just focusing on the material changes from our assumptions in July, at recent exchange rates, currency translation represents a roughly 3.5% headwind to reported sales growth for the year with a pretax operating income hit of $37 million, an incremental $9 million headwind relative to the 28 million we were anticipating in July.","Partially offsetting this, we now estimate the incremental pretax savings from restructuring, net of transaction costs will contribute approximately $50 million. As the teams have been executing very well against our plans, we look to deliver at the high-end of our previous expectations. We realized about $35 million of these savings in the first three quarters of the year. And a tax rate should come in slightly lower than our previous outlook, which I assumed 25% at the midpoint of our guidance range.","In summary, we delivered another solid quarter in a more challenging environment and we remain on track to deliver on our long-term objectives to achieve GDP plus growth in top quartile return on capital, which together drive sustained growth EVA.","And now we will open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird & Co. Your line is now open.","Ghansham Panjabi","I guess first off on LGM. Maybe you can just give us a little bit more color, Mitch, how volume kind of played out through the course of the quarter? Which regions did you capture share within from a geographic standpoint? What's your sense from customers as it relates to the outlook for 4Q and 2020? Are they kind of managing inventory very tightly? More optimism, less optimism, how would you sort of characterize that dynamic?","Mitch Butier","So, a lot in there, Ghansham. So, specifically with the quarter, basically if you look within July growth started out relatively soft, soften further in August and then came back in September. We're now seeing a bit of moderation as Greg talked about early October again. So, a little bit more of the choppiness that we talk through.","In North America, so just from a market perspective, in the markets, we're seeing pretty consistent low single-digit growth between last year and this year. Our growth, of course, was lower than that in the first half of the year because of the share losses, which we since believe we are on the solid path to recapturing. And, in Europe, we saw low to mid single-digit growth last year as you know, in the first-half, really no growth pretty flat environment and we're announcing a little bit of a pickup low single-digit growth in Q3, mostly in Southern Europe are not in North or Central Europe overall.","And then in China, we saw low mid-digit last year growth and we saw frightened first-half of this year and started to see some positive growth here in Q3, mid single digits, and South Asia as we called out that's where we saw a shift and its really beyond. So India continue to have strong growth high single-digits and specifically, Malaysia and Thailand where we're seeing some softness which we attribute broadly to softer market conditions and the link between China and U.S. trade matters.","So as far as sentiment of the customer, basically the sentiment reflect those market trends overall. So generally, the customer sentiment we've had at Labelexpo recently, it was well attended by customers particularly from Europe, once in Southern Europe and Eastern Europe, sound a little bit more confident about near-term outlook than the ones from Northern and Central Europe specifically. Overall, a lot of excitement though about the innovations, and a lot of interest coming from customers of what we can bring to the table to help to together grow the market.","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay. And then just my second question, sticking with LGM, looks like prices starting to kind of flatten out year-over-year. That's been pretty consistent with what you said last quarter as well, but just kind of looking at the next few quarters. How would you have us modeled price mix? Do you expect a negative sign in front of that? Or do you think that, that will be essentially flat just it was in 3Q? Thanks so much.","Greg Lovins","This is Greg. So overall, we have seen pretty neutral net price inflation here in the third quarter versus prior year and also relatively neutral sequentially. So, we have seen a little bit of sequential deflation, largely coming from some easing and paper here in the third quarter. At the same time, we have got some pockets of price down as we have seen some sequential deflation over the last couple quarters. But overall, we're looking at kind of price inflation relatively neutral year-over-year in Q3 as well sequentially a little more sequential modest deflation we think in Q4, but not a material impact overall.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Adam Josephson","Mitch or Greg, just one question on Greg's comments toward the end of the prepared remarks, you talked about seeing increasing their variability in order patterns from month to month. Just hoping it could clarify what you tribute that to. And then you talked about on the first couple weeks in October being upload to similar to what you had in 3Q. But I think for the quarter, you're thinking anywhere from two to three, I guess because the comps get easier as the quarter goes on. So I'm just hoping I understand those two issues a bit better.","Mitch Butier","Yes, it's quite simply Adam. The volatility we called it out a little bit more for us to choppiness in demand last quarter. We're continuing to see what do we attributed to it's basically just some of the uncertainty that's going on in the environment. If you look at political uncertainty around Brexit impacting Europe, if you look at what's going on in Hong Kong, and then the trade matters tariffs on again, off again, on again.","So those are what we attribute in general the more lumpiness or not uncommon and LGM in particular, to have a few weeks of just goes above normal or below normal. But we're just been seeing it more consistent into a somewhat larger degree. And we're talking about still within a relatively tight band. It's not dramatic swings, but we are seeing more choppiness than we've traditionally seen in the LGM, as well as in RBIS. As far as the other part of your question about the, I think Greg explained Q4.","Greg Lovins","So Adam, this is Greg. In Q4 of last year, our strongest volume market was in October and then volume softened quite a bit November and December. So we do a little bit easier comps in the back part of this quarter. Whereas we started Q3 or started Q4, a little bit the lower end of our range for the quarter.","Adam Josephson","Just one on the raw material, I think Ghansham asked about raw materials or price cost specifically said it was flat and you expect similar trends thereafter. Can you talk about what exactly you saw with your paper costs and your chemical costs in 3Q obviously, there's been quite a bit of global paper market weakness and we're just trying to get a sense of precisely how much your paper costs fell either sequentially or year-over-year and what you're saying in terms of paper prices going down?","Greg Lovins","Yes. So, I guess, as we move through this year in the first half of the year, we've seen some benefits in chemicals as we're moving across the quarters. And then paper started to be a benefit for us in Q4 -- sorry in Q3. Overall though, still I think, kind of low-single-digit type of deflation sequentially, very low and total with a little bit heavier and paper. So still not a huge impact, but low-single-digit deflation as we came into Q3 from largely from paper.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","George Staphos","My two questions to start around margin. One question specifically within RBIS and then kind of a broader question on that in terms of cost saves. With RBIS, the incremental margin was quite a bit lower than what we've seen in prior quarters, it's not totally surprising, given the cadence of restructuring and every quarter can be phenomenal. And you also called out the spending on growth with an RBIS. Would it be possible to give a bit more color in terms of what some of those incremental costs might have been in the third quarter or any other sources of deceleration in incremental margin within RBIS to the extent that you can comment?","Greg Lovins","George, this is Greg. So, just as you said, the variable flow through we got from the top-line growth was largely in line with what we would have expected from that. The same time is, as you mentioned, as Mitch mentioned earlier, we have been continuing to invest particularly in RFID, and we had investments in the quarter of a few million dollars versus where we were a year ago. So that offsetting some of that variable flow through. Otherwise, generally in line with what we would have expected at that level.","Mitch Butier","Okay, George. And I think, just overall, just the margins you see for all of our business and in particular, RBIS, the expansions we've been able to achieve are I think even more impressive when you consider how much we've invested, particularly in Intelligent Labels over the past couple of years. So, between last year and this year, we will have added more than $20 million of organic OpEx to this business, really in the business development areas and so forth that we've talked through. And this just reinforces our strategies trying to invest more to accelerate growth in high value categories, and the relentless focus on productivity to both fund those investments as well as expand margins.","George Staphos","Mitch, the $20 million was over what period did you say, the last few years, was there a specific increment there?","Mitch Butier","\u201818 to \u201819.","George Staphos","And then, my second question, when we consider the restructuring, I think, you said you had $35 million of savings year-to-date. If I heard that incorrectly, if you can put in the correct number for us. And $50 million is the goal. What -- for this year, what's next? Obviously, Avery always focuses relentlessly, maybe to use your term, on productivity, some of it is driven by the growth initiatives that in turn drive the ability to then restructure once you get the top line growth. Sometimes, it's driven by the investments that you make. Obviously, you've had a new coder come up. What kind of pace on productivity should we expect over the next couple of years within your segments? Would we see a bit more perhaps in one segment versus another? Thanks.","Mitch Butier","So, George, I'm not going to get into specifics of that. Just overall, I think, you've captured it. This is a key strategy of ours; it\u2019s one of the key four strategic pillars, the relentless focus on productivity. And we see restructuring as one of a number of levers to pull. Our constant focus on material reengineering, lean sigma are key tenants of our strategy, and restructuring, we think of is innovation of our fixed cost structure. So, we will communicate that as we normally do with annual guidance on what we expect for the given year, and as we do these programs and so forth. So that's -- we\u2019re not going to comment on any specifics now. But, I think, the overall long-term strategy, you should expect that to continue to unfold.","George Staphos","Mitch, the pace should be fairly comparable from what we've seen over the last few years, not calling it dollar by dollar, quarter by quarter, but no reason to expect that to decelerate over time? ","Mitch Butier","Over a couple of year period, yes, individual years can be up or down, as you know. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan Securities Incorporated. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Jeff Zekauskas","In your LGM business, I think, you said that your organic growth in North America was flat in the quarter. Can you remind me what the trends were in the first two quarters of the year? And, can you talk about why North America is slow?","Mitch Butier","Yes. The organic growth was flat in the quarter overall. And in the first half, I commented that the market overall been growing low single digits, but we did have the share losses that we\u2019ve talked through, within that business. And the market comments I'm saying are on volume, in our growth, I\u2019m commenting on is organic growth. So we had the positive impacts of pricing and negative impacts from some of the share loss and volume.","Jeff Zekauskas","Right. I mean, it sounds like the North America -- is it fair to say that the North American market is slowing down and the Chinese market is accelerating a little bit sequentially, or you can't tell that as it\u2019s more\u2026","Mitch Butier","We don\u2019t have data for Q3 yet, Jeff -- sorry to interrupt. We don\u2019t have data yet for Q3 in North America. But if you -- from our own market entail and just what we\u2019ve seen, it seems fairly consistent, just low single digit growth. So, that\u2019s our revenue growth as far as volumes. And in China, China had been on a decelerating trend and then started to bounce back here in Q3. Not decelerating to negative, meaning from upper single digit growth for couple of years ago to mid single digit growth to low single digit growth and now -- and then, flat in the first half of the year and now we're starting to see a rebound here.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Spector with UBS Securities LLC. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Joshua Spector","Just a question on IHM. So, it\u2019s rare we\u2019ve been hearing about industrial\u2019s growth broadly. And you guys printed a pretty good quarter. Just wondering how much of that is an easing comp versus tough comp last year versus real growth in some of those markets. ","Greg Lovins","Yes. Thanks. This is Greg. So, overall, I think we -- as you said, we feel good about our performance against the generally weaker industrial backdrop. There is a few areas where in addition to the fact that last year certainly from a comp perspective was when we really started to the China auto market slow. So, that was a year-over-year benefit. But, in addition to that, our medical business, as you\u2019ve heard us talk about over the last -- really it\u2019s fourth straight quarter I guess where we\u2019ve had growth in the high teens in our medical business. So, that business continues to perform very well and has certainly been taking some share in some target applications. We\u2019ll start to lap some of that high teens growth here as we go into the fourth quarter, but feel very good about how that business performed over the last year.","And at the same time, on industrial for us, this is really an application by application based business. And here, we also feel like we want some share and some target applications in areas such as building construction tapes in North America as an example is an area we continue to grow very well in. And so, it\u2019s a little bit easier comps in automotive, but still, automotive market as a whole this year or in Q3 was still down, auto production globally, and we did grow in kind of low to mid single-digit range. So, feel good about the performance here, as you said against generally weaker industrial.","Joshua Spector","Okay. That's helpful. And then, on the LGM side, in terms of you guys feeling that you got back most of your lost share, if the market remains kind of tepid here, do you see any risk of more share shifts back and forth, maybe some context than prior cycles with slower general growth, is there a lot of kind of back and forth or price pushes to try to gain volumes back, now that you\u2019ve kind of got your share again?","Mitch Butier","Yes. Generally, when we see the share moving around, it\u2019s usually in periods of change. So, rapid inflationary environments or deflationary environments is when we tend to have seen it, particularly at the beginning or ends of those cycles. So, if we were to go into slow growth, if that\u2019s your question but stable environment, we haven't experienced that first the same period of time in our industry. Our industry is more resilient in that. But if we were to, I have nothing in our history to tell us that that would cause more variation in share position.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","John McNulty","With regard to the margin improvement that you've been seeing from the cost cuts, it sounds like you\u2019re going to end the year certainly higher than you started the year. So, I guess, when you think about the year-end run rate for 2019 and how we should think about kind of the improvement that you can see in 2020, without any incremental cuts, I guess, how should we be thinking about what that incremental bridge is from \u201819 to \u201820, based on the cost cuts you\u2019ve already put through?","Greg Lovins","Yes. So, just based on cost reductions, we would expect carryover from a restructuring perspective into 2020 of somewhere in the $20 million to $25 million range. A lot of that\u2019s driven by the European restructuring that we've talked about quite a bit, but that savings really started to kick in at the end of Q2, beginning of Q3 of this year. So, I think we have that as a tailwind going into next year. At the same time, we have some headwinds such as currency translation, which is a headwind for us here in the back half of this year that will be a headwind then in the first half of next year, if we stay at these rates, and a few other items as headwinds, I think as well there. But overall, carryover restructuring about $20 million to $25 million.","John McNulty","Got it, great. And then, with regard to -- I think, you\u2019d said autos were actually up in the quarter. And I guess, we understand that there were some relatively easy comps, but admittedly, you may be the only company we look at that actually had a positive auto number. So, I guess, what's driving that? Is that new vehicles that you are on, is it new applications that you're finding per vehicle, like I guess, how should we think about what's really driving that growth when auto comps are clearly going down?","Mitch Butier ","Yes. So, a lot of our auto growth in the quarter actually did come in China where we had some significant clients as we talked about over the past year and before this quarter that that market really slowed. And we saw some -- while that market is still soft overall from an auto production perspective, we did see some of our business start to pick up a little bit in the third quarter. So, that's really been the biggest area of automotive growth here in Q3.","John McNulty","Great. Thanks very much. For the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Anthony Pettinari","In RFID, it sounds like non-apparel opportunities are going better than you initially expected. And I think, in the past you've identified food, beauty, aviation and logistics as kind of four markets that were real opportunities outside of apparel. I'm just wondering if you can provide any color on those four markets maybe broadly and if there's any one in particular where you're seeing customer wins or what customer adoption has been kind of faster than you've expected or anything that surprised you there?","Mitch Butier","Yes. So, overall, the speed at which we've been able to build the pipeline has been rapid. And I don't think we gave projections about what we expected. But, we are hitting our ambitions on that. And as I\u2019ve mentioned, most of the growth in the actual pipeline is for categories outside of apparel. Specifically, the biggest growth driver of that has really been within the food category. So foods, we have quite a few programs in the pipeline that we're working.","As far as the actual growth, the growth levels, it's high in percentage terms but off of a very small base. So, our focus here is, leverage the strengths that we have within the apparel segment, both from a business development as well innovation and manufacturing capabilities, and identify other end markets where there are similarities to apparel that we think are right for adoption that begin to build that. We're having some wins along the way, but a lot of this -- the revenue right now outside of apparel, a lot of them are at the pilot stage and so forth to pilot revenue. And there's a couple of moving to full adoptions, but it's relatively small, less than 10 program. So, a vast majority of the pipeline is still early stage. And for us, it's really the growth opportunity, particularly in the 2021, 2022 beyond is what we're really focused on, as far as when it starts to become much more meaningful numbers.","Anthony Pettinari","And then, just sticking with RBIS maybe more broadly, you referenced uncertainty around tariffs. Did you see kind of a pull forward in RBIS demand, and maybe the first half with Chinese customers trying to buy ahead of potential tariffs on apparel? Are you seeing customers more kind of sitting on the sidelines? Can you say anything about sort of customer inventory levels currently and when they could resume kind of more normal buying patterns?","Mitch Butier","Yes. So, overall, we just saw tentativeness. We\u2019ve talked about the base apparel business slowing a little bit already, the rate of growth slowing in Q2 already, and it further moderated here in Q3. We didn't see people trying to buy ahead of time, because there was just -- there was tentativeness and people in general were just slow to move overall.","When we look at what's going on, our growth trends and we talk to other players in the segment suppliers, people who provide threads and so forth, what they are seeing is similar to what we are seeing. Now, when you talk about actual at the retail and brand level, you have some retailer and brands that are doing phenomenally well and others that are struggling. So, there is a bit of a mixed bag, if you will, as far as what's going on in retail environment. So, we didn't really see inventory builds or anything, if you look at the inventory trends. Inventories dropped dramatically in \u201818, built up a little bit at the end of last year, beginning of this year, but then has already started depleting again. And these are levels that are near all-time lows right now, as far as inventory levels, which I think just shows retailers and brands focused on the need for faster supply chains and lower inventory levels in this more uncertain environment, which just further reinforces the adoption of RFID.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company, Incorporated. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Thank you for taking my question. I was wondering if on LGM you have obviously reached your margin targets, it is a strong level you have. You are done with restructuring Europe. How much more do you think we can see this target improving? I mean, not the target, but the margin itself. ","Greg Lovins","Yes, Rosemarie. So, we've set a target of 12.5% to 13.5%. As you said, we are in the upper end of that targeted range. When we set those targets, we had -- last two times we had set long-term targets, we continually raised them and we said that we were focused on -- and we saw the opportunity for more. And so, we expanded them at that time. At this level, this business is \u2013 the returns are to multiple of the cost of capital. So, for us, we're not looking to adjust targets or anything for any of our businesses right now, somewhere within them, ones below it, making good trajectory to get it within and another being RBIS is above it. We're not going to adjust our targets or comment on that at this time. When we set our next set of long-term targets, we'll adjust accordingly. But, I think the key message here is we got a good growth, high return business here in LGM that we see, feel great about our position and prospects for.","Rosemarie Morbelli","And then, I was wondering if you could touch on M&A and the potential of seeing something between maybe not now in the end of the year but after the near future?","Mitch Butier","Yes. So, in M&A, timing is always tough to call, pipelines for part of engagements. I will say prices remain stickier for longer than we probably would have previously anticipated. So, we're going to be disciplined as we go through this. Our focus here is disproportionately focusing on areas that will increase our exposure to high value segments. And calling something specifically within announcing in a three, month, six-month period is just too tough to call. So, not going to comment on that specifically.","Rosemarie Morbelli","All right. Thank you.","Mitch Butier","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paretosh Misra with Berenberg Capital. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Paretosh Misra","Great. Thank you. So, in your IHM segment within the medical products, is there any specific product launch or application that is driving the strong growth?","Mitch Butier","Yes. It's pretty broad-based for us across the applications that we continue to grow well in some of our core business. We've also been growing in some of our antimicrobial business, what we call CHD that we've launched over the last year or so. So, we've seen a little bit of growth coming from new products from that perspective, but pretty broad-based across our portfolio over the last few quarters.","Paretosh Misra","Got it. And then a follow-up on the RBIS segment. I think, you mentioned something on embellishments. So, how big is that, and what do you think that growth rate is sustainable?","Mitch Butier","Well, we think this business can grow at a pretty high clip, well above the average, and it's been above 10%, above 20% this year. The business is less than 10% of overall RBIS. And so, it's relatively small. We've been talking about this for a few years and started off from essentially nothing about five years ago, and been growing it, and it's -- but it's still sub 10%. So, we see good amount of opportunities to continue to expand it. This is taking our capabilities, both innovation and product capabilities, as well as our manufacturing presence to basically move from trim and being -- having external -- having embellishments inside the garment, outside the garment. And the key driver for growth right now for us is in the European soccer clubs.","Paretosh Misra","I appreciate it. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Kapsch with Loop Capital. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Chris Kapsch","Yes. Hi. Thank you. Just a follow-up on the dynamics around your comments about gaining back market share within LGM. So, you said that -- in the past, you've talked about when these things happen, you tend to lean on superior service and quality more so than price as the means to get back share. Can you just characterize if that's sort of what the tactics have been in this instance, as you said, to gain back the share that you did or be in a position to gain back the share? At least, it sounds like you characterized it that way.","Greg Lovins","Yes. So, primarily, the tactics are if some business moves away for a bit, is be patient and diligent, and we know that we've got superior service and quality, and just continue the dialog with those customers, and eventually the share rebalances. The other thing that happens is, we went from the last price increase when we were at the end of the inflationary cycle to in some areas, some commodities seeing some deflation, so where we saw that we had a relative price premium that was maybe outside of the targeted band that we think a particular product or solution warrants. We will then adjust at that level. So there is some price in there to be focused on being competitive, and that's not broad-based, that's maybe targeted areas. But, the overall focus here is to patient and diligent. We've built tremendous capabilities as far as service and quality, and be confident in that and let it play out for a few quarters.","Chris Kapsch","And if I could just follow up on that, would you characterize the regained market share consistent by region? And then getting more granular on that. Is that enough to explain why the sales growth in Southern Europe and then -- and in North America where you were flat, if you gain back shares that to suggest that the overall market was negative in the quarter? Thanks.","Mitch Butier","So, it's important -- our share gain comments are mostly sequential comments. So, the share gain was not relative so much to Q3 of last year. It's more from the first half of this year. So, when we're talking about market growth, the comments that we made, those are year-over-year. So, the share gain was not a driver of year-over-year growth as much as it was sequential.","Operator","We have a follow-up question from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Adam Josephson","Thanks for taking my follow-ups. I appreciate it. Just one housekeeping one and one on sustainability. On the housekeeping one, Greg or whomever, can you -- and the Chinese one has strengthened quite a bit in recent weeks, so can you help me with what FX rates you are using for 4Q?","Greg Lovins","Yes. So, our RMB -- sorry, our euro rate is just under 1.10 in the quarter, so I think 1.09 point something in the quarter for the euro; and the RMB is a little over 0.14 for the quarter.","Chris Kapsch","And just on -- Mitch on sustainability, there is a lot of talk about potential shift out of PET bottles toward aluminum, just given CPG companies desire to rid themselves of plastic to the extent possible. Can you just give us your view of this whole sustainability movement and talk about what if any impact you're seeing on your business? I would assume it's negligible just given the types of labels that go on those bottles, but anything more, I would appreciate.","Mitch Butier","Yes. So, the largest primary focus right now is really around single-use plastic containers. And there's varying definitions for what that is. But, if you think of water bottles and straws and so forth, pressure sensitive labels are going very few of those products, and that's where you're seeing a lot of the migration over. In general, my view is, is that there is an appropriate focus on sustainability of packaging in general. It's a key focus of the industry. It's a key focus of ours. We've been -- we're out in front of many companies, especially packagers making sustainability a priority. And I'd say, the first wave of that was more around improving the sustainability of our own business. Dramatically, we've reduced greenhouse gases by 30% over the last number of years, buying more sustainably sourced raw materials such as more than 90% of our paper that we procure is sustainably certified such as for Stewardship Council. So, that is in the focus. And now, more recently, we've been shifting more on making sure that our products make recyclability much more easy and efficient. So, we think this is an overall longer term trend for us. We see this is something more of a longer term drive. We think it's important. We're the market leader. We're increasing our level of investment innovation in this space, because we intend to lead here.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","George Staphos","Hi, everyone. Just a couple of questions on topics that come up periodically on your calls that -- regarding displacement types of technologies relative to your core products. So we were at PACK EXPO recently, we saw -- it seemed to us anyway a lot more commentary by some of the other packaging providers around direct printing on secondary packaging, which obviously, if that really took off and it was scalable, would have some threat -- present some threat to labeling and pressure sensitive materials. Mitch, what are you seeing in that regard? Are you seeing a little bit more activity there from competing technologies, are you not? Would you agree with our perception that whether or not it\u2019s a threat, you're seeing a little bit more activity from competing materials and competing technology, I should say? And then, similarly, comes up periodically, are you seeing any increased attempts by brand owners and retailers to not necessarily go down the RFID path, but use other technologies to track product through supply chain, without having RFID, those revision systems or other things like that? Thank you very much, and good luck in the quarter.","Greg Lovins","Thanks, George. Yes. So, specifically, as far as other labeling technologies and commenting on direct print, we've actually been engaging with a number of firms on the direct print for a number of years now. So, we've seen some activity here. The technology we -- what we see as far as the economics of it, is still pretty far ways off. So, we're actively engaged. I think, as number of people are playing with and working through, but it's really going to be in the small volumes premium side of this industry.","As far as the use of other technologies to track products, yes, we've been consistent in saying when we think about the Internet of Things and everything physical having a digital twin, digital life, we've said RFID is one of a number of enabling technologies, and there's a number of areas where wireless radio base connection will be required, others where you maybe have more clear line of sight, less SKU complexity and so forth, will be using other technologies. So, we think there's going be a complement of technologies that enable that future overall. So, that's not -- we're working with a number of those companies and well aware of that and see this is actually a space where multiple technologies will prosper.","Operator","Mr. Butier, there are no further questions at this time.

Welcome, everyone. Today, we'll discuss our preliminary unaudited fourth quarter and full year 2013 results.","Please note that unless otherwise indicated, today's discussion will be focused on our continuing operations. The company's Office and Consumer Products and Designed and Engineered Solutions businesses are classified on our income statement as discontinued operations. The company completed the sale of these businesses on July 1, 2013.","The non-GAAP financial measures that we use are defined, qualified and reconciled with GAAP in the appendix of our Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2013 Financial Review and Analysis and on schedules A-2 to A-5 of the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release.","We remind you that we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. These forward-looking statements are made subject to the Safe Harbor statement included in today's earnings release","On the call today are Dean Scarborough, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mitch Butier, Senior Vice President and CFO.","I will now turn the call over to Dean.","Dean A. Scarborough","Thanks, Eric, and good day, everyone. I am very pleased to report our sixth consecutive quarter of better than 30% growth in adjusted earnings per share, reflecting the successful execution of restructuring actions and other productivity initiatives, as well as better-than-expected sales growth in both of our core businesses.","2013 represented another year of excellent progress toward our strategic and long-term financial goals. We accomplished a major milestone with the sale of Office and Consumer Products and Designed and Engineered Solutions businesses. The midyear completion of this transaction has streamlined our portfolio and allowed us to focus on our 2 industry-leading core businesses to drive long-term sustainable growth and economic value.","Both PSM and RBIS delivered strong financial results while continuing to invest to drive future growth and productivity improvement. Both businesses beat their sales growth targets for the year. As a result, we accelerated total organic sales growth by nearly a full point compared to the pace of the prior year, delivering results near the high end of our long-term target range of 3% to 5%.","Within the Pressure-sensitive Materials segment, the Label and Packaging Materials business continued to benefit from the relative strength of emerging markets, as well as solid growth in North America and Europe, driven by innovation and share gain. The smaller divisions in Pressure-sensitive Materials grew faster than the segment average. Performance Tapes delivered exceptional growth in the fourth quarter due in part to the successful execution of the strategic partnership with 1 large customer while the Reflective Solutions business sustained double-digit organic growth throughout the year.","Our investments in innovation are paying off, in terms of both new product sales, as well as material cost reduction. About 1\/3 of our growth in 2013 came from innovation projects launched since 2011 and that exceeded our target for the year.","Retail Branding and Information Solutions delivered excellent growth in the first half of 2013 against relatively easy comparisons and solid growth in the second half against soft comps. Overall, the business beat its sales growth target for the year, driven by share gain and continued momentum in RFID and brand embellishments. I am particularly pleased with the gains we're seeing in RFID. Even with the headwind of the prior year pipeline fill, the team delivered 24% growth during the year. 20 of the top 30 retailers in the U.S. are now testing or already using RFID, and we're seeing several new installations taking place in Europe as well.","Finally, Vancive Medical Solutions, our small but high-potential medical products business, achieved a number of key milestones, including the commercialization of new antimicrobial dressings that are more effective in preventing wound infection in hospitals and also more cost effective than existing products. This and other key developments with wearable sensors position the business for double-digit growth and improved returns this year.","Overall, 2013 was also a pivotal year in terms of our operating efficiency as the aggressive organizational changes we undertook in 2012 really paid off. With the successful execution of this program, we established a new baseline for our underlying cost structure, further strengthening the competitive positions of both PSM and RBIS.","We also delivered free cash flow above the high end of our expectations. As Mitch will explain, some of our overachievement was due to timing, and we'll see that offset here in the first quarter. But even adjusting for that timing effect, we delivered solid free cash flow for the year.","As promised, we are using proceeds from the divestitures and ongoing free cash flow to enhance shareholder returns. In the past year, we returned nearly $400 million of cash to investors through dividends and the repurchase of 6.6 million shares. We will continue our disciplined approach to returning excess cash in 2014 and beyond.","Of course, the year was not without its challenges. The Graphics business within PSM came in short of our expectations, especially in Europe, where sales declined and we failed to achieve our profit improvement targets due in part to a negative shift in product mix. Negative product mix in the Label and Packaging Materials business likewise worked against us this past year so we didn't see as much of the benefit of the incremental sales growth as we would have expected, particularly in the fourth quarter. In response to those challenges, we are putting more emphasis on improving product mix.","In addition, we recently announced our intent to close an old manufacturing plant in the Netherlands while consolidating operations and investing in new production capabilities elsewhere to improve the competitiveness of the European Graphics business. This restructuring plan represents a modest headwind to adjusted earnings in 2014 but will drive savings when completed in 2015 and deliver a strong return on investment.","While we're pleased with the progress we've made over the past 2 years, we won't be satisfied until we achieve all of our long-term goals. And our objective for 2014 is to continue to deliver on these commitments. We are investing in innovation and capacity expansion in key growth markets, specifically in Pressure-sensitive Materials. We're adding assets in Asia for our Performance Tapes and specialty coding.","In RBIS, we're investing in RFID and heat transfer assets to support growth and productivity improvement in these key segments. We're also continuing to execute our digital investment strategy to better meet the rapid turnaround times that customers require while improving operating efficiency and the quality and consistency of our products. We've increased digital printing capacity by over 60% over the past 2 years. Over 1\/3 of graphic tags and labels are now produced with digital printers, and we're targeting to increase that share to over half of total production.","I mentioned in last quarter's call that sustainability has become a key theme for many of our investments in innovation. I believe that sustainability can become an important competitive advantage over the long term, and we'll continue to invest in opportunities that benefit both our businesses and the communities in which we operate.","Finally, identifying and executing ongoing productivity initiatives will continue to be a top priority for all of our businesses. Besides the major restructuring plan for Europe, PSM will continue its ongoing efforts to reduce material and manufacturing costs through process innovation and material substitution. And RBIS is right on target with its footprint reduction strategy, taking out close to 20% of its square footage since 2011.","Our financial guidance for the year assumes 3% to 5% organic sales growth, consistent with our long-term range, which we believe to be prudent, given our limited forward visibility. We expect adjusted earnings per share to grow between 8% and 19% this year, and we expect to deliver solid free cash flow and continue to execute our disciplined capital allocation strategy and returning excess cash to shareholders.","Now I'll turn the call over to Mitch.","Mitchell R. Butier","Thanks, Dean. As you can see, we had a strong year with adjusted earnings per share growth of 37%, reflecting the successful implementation of our restructuring program and solid growth in both Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Branding and Information Solutions. We achieved organic sales growth of 5%, adjusted earnings per share of $2.68 and free cash flow of $330 million for the year, all in line with our long-term targets and at the higher end of the guidance that we provided at the beginning of the year.","In the fourth quarter, we delivered solid results with 6.6% organic sales growth and adjusted earnings per share of $0.69. As Dean mentioned, fourth quarter sales were well above expectations, particularly lower-margin products in Pressure-sensitive Materials. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter grew 110 basis points to 7.4% as the benefit of our productivity initiatives and continued solid top line growth in both segments more than offset the negative impact of product mix in PSM and higher employee-related expenses.","As part of our restructuring program initiated in the first half of 2012, we realized $15 million of savings in the fourth quarter and $75 million in the full year. Restructuring costs, net of gains on asset sales, were about $3 million in the fourth quarter and $23 million for the full year.","Full year free cash flow from continuing operations was $330 million, above the high end of our range, primarily due to the timing of both receipts and payments at year-end. The timing of receipts and to a lesser extent, payments, is relatively volatile around year-end due to the holidays. Based on past trends, we estimate approximately $30 million of cash flow withholds from the first weeks of 2014 into 2013.","As expected, the net proceeds from the sale of OCP and DES came in at about $390 million. As we mentioned in October, we used $50 million of the net proceed to make supplemental pension plan contributions in the fourth quarter. And as a result, we are currently comfortable with our pension funding status.","Given our solid free cash flow and the proceeds from the divestitures, we are below our targeted leverage position, giving us ample capacity to continue to return cash to shareholders over the coming years, and we will continue to do so in a disciplined manner. Speaking of which, we've repurchased an additional 1.3 million shares for $60 million in the fourth quarter, bringing the total for 2013 to 6.6 million shares repurchased for $283 million.","Turning to the segments. Pressure-sensitive Materials sales were up approximately 8% on an organic basis in the fourth quarter and 5% for the full year. Label and Packaging Materials sales were up mid-single digits on an organic basis in the quarter while the combined sales for Graphics, Reflective and Performance Tapes increased low-double digits. Performance Tapes had a particularly strong quarter with growth of 20% while the Reflective business continued to be in the low-double-digit range. On a regional basis, North America grew low-single digits, western Europe grew upper-single digits and the emerging markets grew low-double digits.","PSM's adjusted operating margins improved 100 basis points to 9.6% in the quarter as the benefit of higher volume and productivity initiatives more than offset the changes in product mix. The higher-than-expected sales in the quarter did not translate into as much profit as one might otherwise expect as the unfavorable mix trends we have been talking about over the past few quarters continued. As Dean mentioned, we're putting more focus on improving mix in this segment. Despite the mix challenges, PSM delivered an adjusted operating margin of 10.2% for the year, an expansion of a full point versus 2012.","Retail Branding and Information Solutions sales grew about 3% in the quarter and up 5% for the full year. The quarter sales growth was relatively strong given the tougher comps in RFID that we've been speaking about. This strong growth reflects continued solid demand among North American retailers and brands and strong demand for European retailers and brands. RFID in the quarter declined almost 5% yet grew nearly 25% in 2013, contributing almost 1\/3 of RBIS' overall growth for the year.","RBIS' adjusted operating margin improved 140 basis points to 7.5% as the productivity initiatives and higher volume more than offset higher employee-related expenses. For the full year, RBIS' adjusted operating margin was up 120 basis points to 6.3%. Sales in other specialty converting, which is now solely comprised of our medical business, grew 7% in the quarter and had an operating loss similar to that of last year.","2 years ago, we established long-term targets to aggressively improve returns through profitable growth, productivity and further capital discipline, and we are on track to deliver these 2015 goals. PSM has increased its growth rate to 4% on average over the last 2 years and has expanded the adjusted operating margin of the business from approximately 9% to 10%, achieving the high end of our target. RBIS continues to make excellent progress towards its long-term goals. The adjusted operating margin of this business has expanded by over 100 basis points in each of the last 2 years. We know we need to continue to deliver over a full point of margin expansion in both 2014 and '15 in order to achieve our goals, and that's what we intend to do.","Now for the total company, organic sales growth has come squarely within our range of 3% to 5%, with growth just over 4% for the past 2 years. Adjusted EPS has increased at a compound growth rate of almost 30%, consistent with our 15% to 20-plus percent target. And as I mentioned earlier, we are below our targeted leverage position, which, combined with our consistently solid free cash flow, enables us to continue to return cash to shareholders.","Now these targets are all focused on 2015, and as 2015 is getting close on the horizon, I want to mention that we'll be hosting an investor meeting in May, where we'll extend our long-term targets. We'll be reaching out to you all shortly on that.","So looking more closely at 2014. We expect adjusted 2014 earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.90 to $3.20, reflecting growth of 8% to 19%. This guidance is based on a number of assumptions, including the key factors listed on Slide 11, to highlight a few. To start, our 2014 fiscal year contains 53 weeks ending on January 3, 2015. The extra week will be in the fourth quarter and is expected to add about 1% to reported sales with no impact to organic sales growth. The extra week crosses over the New Year's holiday so it's usually a low-volume week with little to no earnings. The extra week is also expected to have a negative impact on free cash flow due to the timing of a number of factors, including an extra payroll payment.","Our estimate for organic sales growth in 2014 is between 3% to 5%, consistent with our long-term targets. Now we have recently experienced some modest inflationary pressure for certain raw materials, some of it currency induced. We are working to mitigate these challenges through our global sourcing organization and productivity actions. Should these actions prove insufficient to cover rising costs, we will raise prices. Speaking of which, we recently announced modest price increases in a few select regions and product lines.","Incremental savings from the restructuring actions are estimated at approximately $40 million for the year, more than half of which represents carryover savings from actions already taken. Total restructuring costs are -- that are adjusted to GAAP results in 2014 are expected to approximate $45 million pretax, which includes the costs for continued restructuring within RBIS and the intended consolidation of our graphics capacity in Europe that Dean referenced earlier.","Free cash flow is expected to be in excess of $300 million, after investing approximately $185 million in capital expenditures. And we are estimating 97 million shares outstanding on average, which includes an estimate of roughly 2.5 million shares of additional dilution in 2014.","In summary, 2013 was a pivotal year for us, a year in which we focused the portfolio, made a step-function improvement in our operating margins and returned almost $400 million to our shareholders. Our 2 core businesses are market leaders and are well positioned for profitable growth, which, combined with our continued cost and capital discipline, enables us to expand margins, maintain our financial strength and return cash to shareholders. We are pleased with the progress we've made towards our long-term targets, but we are not content. We are as focused as ever on driving profitable growth and further increasing returns.","Now we'll open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just looking at the restructuring expense. If you kind of backed out, in 2014, you talked about $45 million. Mitch, I think you mentioned net $23 million of spend in 2013. And as far as the $45 million, you mentioned RBIS and then some consolidation in the Graphics business. Why the acceleration in the restructuring spend, though, in 2014? Are you identifying more projects? Or any color you can provide around that would be great.","Dean A. Scarborough","Scott, the decision around Graphics is something we hadn't communicated previously. And as we looked at the market there, we realized that we could get another step-function level of improvement by closing an existing factory and putting a new, more modern asset, an encoding line in the facility in Europe and basically, take out the fixed costs of that factory. So this is a new program but one we think will really accelerate our competitiveness in that business.","Mitchell R. Butier","And as far as the comp versus 2013, the 2013 number includes gains on the sales of a number of assets, our headquarters and some other facilities. And if you exclude all those gains, we're actually in the low $40 million worth of spend in 2013 as well.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. I guess if I look back to 2011, 2012, looks like you spent somewhere between $40 million and $50 million a year then as well on restructuring expense. Is that -- should we think of restructuring as being more of a normal item going forward? I mean, or was there a point in time where we think this could maybe drop off?","Mitchell R. Butier","Yes. So a couple of things. If you look at the restructuring trends over time, it ramped up in 2012, kind of peaked. In '13, it started to trail off, with the exception of this action in Europe that we've been talking about. RBIS, we've said will continue to be restructuring for the next few years. We are far along but still have more footprint consolidation to do. And as we look at further expanding the margins by over a point every year, we -- I've been pretty consistent, I think, in saying that we should expect that for the next few years. As far as the normal level of restructuring, if you will, I think the $20 million, $25 million level for the next few years is the right number to use.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, I mean, I realize you're going to have an Analyst Day in May, and we'll probably get an updated thought around the operating margin for PSM at that point in time. But just looking at 2014, if we assume you go back to the long-term target, that's actually down operating margin for PSM. Is there a mix issue that -- in 2014 that would cause operating margins to come down slightly from the 2013 level?","Dean A. Scarborough","Our -- Scott, our goal is to continue to improve margins. I mean, one of the objectives of the European restructuring is to improve our operating margins in PSM in Europe. So I think you'll hear -- you'll obviously hear a summary of that in the May meeting. But certainly, as you might guess, it would be really unusual for a corporation to set targets for businesses lower in the next year after you just completed a pretty good year. So it's just not our mentality.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup Global Markets.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Given that you've had close to 2 years of kind of fairly stable mid-single-digit organic growth and your -- your organic growth guidance for 2014 is maybe in a little bit of a tighter range than what you gave for 2013. Do you feel that your visibility into underlying demand has improved over the last year? Or do you feel maybe a little bit more confident about your end markets or -- I'm just wondering if you could compare your outlook for 2014 in terms of visibility into demand. Has that changed or improved versus maybe this time last year?","Dean A. Scarborough","I think we feel more confident in sort of the overall economic situation, and we feel more confident about the strategies in our businesses around innovation, around taking market share. We feel good about things like RFID taking hold in the apparel retail industry. But I would say our visibility in the short term in terms of predicting quarter by quarter what's going to happen isn't any better now than it was before.","Mitchell R. Butier","If you look at Q4, we were well over our expectations for the fourth quarter just because of visibility.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So the confidence is more in internal things that you can control within the company as opposed to maybe a brighter view on your customers or global macro or anything like that?","Dean A. Scarborough","I think for us the -- especially on the long-term targets, we feel good about, let's say, packaging markets for PSM. They're consistent. We feel like emerging market growth is going to continue. We know the long-term trend for apparel, 2% to 3% growth every year, and it can be somewhat volatile. But we feel really good about the trend in RFID, and we feel good about our competitiveness and our ability to capture market share. So I think it's a combination of both.","Mitchell R. Butier","And if you're comparing to last year the fact that our low-end guidance started with 1%, part of that is the macro, where there was more uncertainty a year ago as to what the macro environment would be. So it's very difficult to do that.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And maybe just following up on RFID. You referenced the 24% growth in '13. Do you have a target or a rough estimate for what you can accomplish in '14? And then you referenced large retailers entering trials, if not already using RFID. Are you finding that the speed of those trials are accelerating or shortening as the technology becomes more commonplace?","Dean A. Scarborough","Yes. I think every retailer goes at their own pace, although the process is somewhat predictable. They start with some pilots in a few stores, and then they expand it to certain product lines. And then, eventually, we've got a couple of customers literally go wall to wall for all of their items. And we just attended the National Retail Federation show in New York a couple of weeks ago. And we -- there was a panel discussion about RFID, and there were major retailers there, as well as some industry pundits. And it was clear from the conversation that the ability to manage our inventory much more tightly is of enormous value to retailers, especially in an omni channel world because as retailers do more online selling, those retail stores are also acting as warehouses so that they can direct the consumer to come and pick it up or even ship it out from the store and not just from -- not from the warehouse. So it's -- what I see is it's picking up momentum, and the tide has really turned from -- RFID, if you're not onboard for RFID, you're really behind the curve, and that's, for me, a really positive move.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great, that's helpful color. And in terms of the growth rate for '14, is that something that you can...","Dean A. Scarborough","Again, it's tough to predict because retailers sometimes accelerate the delay in both -- the shorter the time period, the harder it is to predict. But I think 20% to 30% compound growth rate over the next few years is a decent forecast.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just sort of staying with RBIS. Obviously, this most recent fourth quarter for apparel retailers in the U.S. was one of the worst in many years. What are your customers saying about the outlook as you kind of progress through 2014, particularly for 2Q, which is one of your strong quarters for that business?","Dean A. Scarborough","Yes. We haven't seen major shifts. I think, Ghansham, and the challenges are different depending on the segment. I mean, the performance athletic channel did really well. Fast fashion did well. I think mass merchandise and the department store, kind of the fashion-type channels had a little bit more of a challenge. But I would say that we don't anticipate any major changes. I mean, we did see some slowdown in U.S. I think we -- our shipments were -- if you net out RFID, which is the right thing to do because we had some enormous headwinds there, we grew in the low-single digits from U.S. retailers. I don't really expect that to change going into the next season. But of course, the proof is in the pudding. We won't really have visibility on that until March.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then along the same vein, on RBIS for Europe, what's going on there?","Dean A. Scarborough","We grew in the high-single digits. We have a number -- again, we believe we're taking market share there. But on top of that, there has been an acceleration of RFID implementations there with a number of different retailers, and that helped us quite a bit.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe a question for Mitch on -- I'm sorry, go ahead.","Dean A. Scarborough","It was high-single-digit growth from European-based retailers and brands.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Got you. And then, Mitch, just kind of looking at the cash on the balance sheet. If you look over the last few years, it's basically above 2x the average level over the last few years. A fair amount of healthy free cash flow being projected for 2014 as well. Can you, first off, reconcile the end of the year share count versus your guidance for 97 million average for the full year? What does that embed in terms of actual repurchase?","Mitchell R. Butier","Well, if you just looked at average, the average of 97 million, it's about 3 million less than what we were the average for '11 -- I mean, for 2013. And it's a 2.5 million share dilution. And so basically comping that out, you're looking at 5 million and change [ph] of shares on average.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And in terms of the -- just one final one. On the raw materials side, you mentioned some inflation. I assume that's along the emerging markets. What's the sort of environment also shaping up here in the U.S., as well as polypropylene has pushed higher and so on and so forth?","Mitchell R. Butier","Yes. So we're experiencing pressures here in the U.S. as well, and then we're working to offset all that. But we are -- actually, the U.S. is one of the places where we are implementing some price increases and putting in a surcharge for propylene and freight and so forth.","Operator","Our next question from the line of John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","With regard to RFID and the RBIS business, in terms of incremental margins, can you differentiate the 2 so that we can kind of understand how to think about the earnings progression as RFID way outpaces the RBIS business?","Dean A. Scarborough","It's definitely accretive. So I would say, currently, it's at or above the margin range that we're at, and so it's a good trend for us.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess maybe looking at -- or cutting it a different way, I guess, if I think about $1 of incremental revenue in RFID versus $1 in the rest of your RBIS business, I mean, how should we think about what that incremental revenue brings to the bottom line?","Mitchell R. Butier","Yes. So if you talk about dollars, dollars per unit are higher than the rest of our business. But if you look at the variable flow-through on percent, it is somewhat lower just because they're higher price point items. But if you look at just a fully absorbed EBIT margins, it is higher than the average of the rest of the business. And that does -- in the early days, we've got quite a bit of business development costs in that as well, but we're funding for future development of getting new retailers up and going. So we haven't quoted specifically flow-through per unit or anything else, and we're not going to comment on that.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then just last question would be on the Pressure-sensitive business. Looking at kind of -- the revenue looked pretty solid, but actually the margins, on a sequential basis, didn't kind of improve the way I would have thought or the leverage didn't seem to kick in -- the operating leverage didn't seem to kick in as much as I would have guessed. What's driving that? Is it a seasonal issue? Is it a mix issue? I guess, how should we be thinking about that?","Dean A. Scarborough","Well, generally, Q4 has lower margins than Q3. That's a typical trend for us. A number of factors. Graphics sales tend to be lower. Those are higher-margin products. People aren't wrapping cars or putting up graphics on buildings when it's in cold weather. So those tend to be a slower period. We did -- we would have expected higher flow-through, and we don't really have a complete understanding yet. I suspect that there was just higher growth in lower-margin categories than there were in higher-margin categories. We don't have the market data yet so that's a hypothesis. But we are continuing to take share, and we have lower share in lower-margin categories. The business is profitable, and we like the business. So part of it is just that as we grab some share. And we certainly had more volume than we expected. So we did have some extra expenses that we didn't anticipate in the quarter either. I mean, if you look at our guidance range versus what we actually performed, there was a bit of a surprise. So there was an extra cost in the business that -- because we weren't prepared for it, that I don't expect to repeat.","Mitchell R. Butier","And the other thing I'd add is when I talked about some of the inflation that was currency induced with some of the currency movements that we had, it's a couple million dollars\u2019 worth, it takes time to raise the prices and push that through as well. So that was an impact in the fourth quarter, too.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it, okay. That's helpful. And actually, if I may, maybe 1 last question. Your 2013 margins in PSM, for the full year, are -- went above your 2015 targets. So I guess the question is, in terms of what drove that or how you got there, I mean, where, in your mind, were the surprises? Was it on the productivity or pricing or were volumes better? Like, when you kind of look back and kind of see your progression, what drove you to already exceed your 2015 target?","Dean A. Scarborough","Well, I think good execution in the business. There's a number of factors here. We had better-than-expected sales growth in the year. We had good productivity during the year, and innovation was another key driver for us. I think I mentioned that we had almost 1\/3 of our products that were new and improved. Some of that is lower-cost products. Some of that is just new-to-the-world products. And that's -- those are all a whole bunch of factors that were positive. So we will update our guidance ranges for the sectors in our May investor meeting. And I think we've got a good trend. We -- again, we did go above our target range. We're investing in restructuring in our European operations for our Graphics business, which will -- won't help us in 2014. It's actually a bit of a headwind, but it will certainly help us in 2015. And all of that will be reflected in our new targets for the next 3 years in May.","Mitchell R. Butier","And I guess, just to add to that a little bit. When you say what surprised us, it actually didn't surprise us. Our goal -- when we set the targets for 9% to 10% for Pressure-sensitive, we were hovering around 9% when we said that. And we said, \"This is the range where this is a good business, and we should focus more on driving profitable growth,\" but then our internal target was to get to the high end of the range. And so that was our expectation. That is what we've been doing. Whereas, with RBIS, when we set the range, it was just to get inside the range by over a full point of expansion every year. So I wouldn't call this a surprise, John.","Operator","Our next question from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess I wanted to pick up on Pressure-sensitive maybe to start. Can you give us a bit more detail -- you mentioned you're adding a coater somewhere in Europe. You're going to be shutting down your facility, I think you said, in the Netherlands. Will this add capacity or is it purely a cost takeout? And you were mentioning, in response to John's question, I think before as well, that there's a cost headwind associated with this action. So can you quantify that headwind for us?","Dean A. Scarborough","So George, yes. So we're replacing a 40-year-old asset in the facility. So I would say we're replacing it -- yes, there is a little bit of net add to capacity for the Graphics business, but we intend to grow that business. But we're replacing it with a modern asset that's a heck of a lot more efficient and productive than the one we're replacing and therefore -- that's why this investment has such a good payback. So I would say, as an investment in net -- Graphics coaters tend to run slower. They're not like the LPM coaters, et cetera, et cetera. It's a whole different product category.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So we shouldn't expect pricing pressure from the standpoint that you're adding a new coater, again recognizing that you're replacing capacity, older capacity with this newer coater?","Dean A. Scarborough","Yes. I don't really expect it.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And on the headwind you were saying?","Dean A. Scarborough","It's -- I don't know, it's, I would say, $0.02 or $0.03, something like that.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, okay. Now on RBIS, the -- were you pleased with the operating leverage that you saw in the fourth quarter? From our calculations, although this is neither here nor there, you actually had a little bit more op leverage in incremental margin than we would have anticipated. So if you could provide your thoughts there. And what went well, what didn't go so well from a margin standpoint?","Dean A. Scarborough","Yes. So we had a nice combination of stronger-than-expected volume growth against some pretty tough comps. We had better contribution margins. And with the footprint reduction that we've been executing, the productivity helped all at the same time. So I would say, again, we're happy but not satisfied. Actually, I think we could have squeezed that -- the team actually thinks they could have squeezed out a little bit more. So they're driven to hit their targets, but we were very pleased with the performance of RBIS in Q4.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I mean, is this an incremental margin that we can continue to see if you continue to put up this kind of volume given what you've already done with the cost structure and given what you plan to do additionally?","Dean A. Scarborough","If you just do the math, right, so we have improved our operating leverage in the business by over 100 basis points the last 2 years. We need to do about the same pace to get to the 2015 targets by 2015. And so our internal objectives are set to do that. I think that one of the pacing items for us is, as you can imagine in a network business, where service is critical, we are -- you have to pace how you move this capacity around, how you take some of these fixed costs out. I think one of the things I'm really delighted about is even with all the footprint reduction actions we've taken in the business, our service, our quality, our safety have all improved at the same time. So that tells me that the team is operating very effectively to, in a way, reduce footprint and increase sales at the same time. It's not an easy thing to accomplish.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sure. In terms of Pressure-sensitive, back to that, you -- I forget whether it was last year or 2 years ago, you talked about there being good EVA business to get after, particularly in Asia, to recall, even though it was perhaps lower-margin business, and maybe that's been one of the factors that's been driving. As we fast-forward to today, the margin -- or mix not being as buoyant you'd like. And if I heard you correctly, you now have some initiatives to improve mix. Do you feel that perhaps the strategy went too far in driving for the lower margin albeit higher EVA or positive EVA business or -- and that this is a turnaround from that strategy? Or how would you discuss it?","Dean A. Scarborough","Yes. I wouldn't describe it as a turnaround. We had a 100-basis-point improvement in margins year-over-year in Q4, and we exceeded the top end of our range. So I think this is -- there is variation in any improvement path, okay? And I think this is kind of a really good job of adjusting to the environment being incredibly agile. So -- and again, we don't have that much forward visibility. So I feel good about our ability to manage mix and price and productivity over the long term. And I think there's -- it's rare when you can sort of plot a super-steady course the whole way. So I think the team is doing a great job. We've got more productivity planned, again, with the European restructuring. I think we are intending to continue to take share, to continue to innovate, and we had good performance in Tapes and Reflectives. And that should continue as well. So I feel good about what we did. So again, I think if you catch a little disappointment in our voice, it's like we had a really good quarter and it could have been even better. And I think that shows more ambition in our voice and intent to continue to drive the business forward and the margins up.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Totally understand. Last question and I'll turn it over. Can you quantify -- perhaps you did and I'd missed it, what the impact of these targeted price increases and surcharges are thus far in Pressure-sensitive, which you've announced to your customers?","Mitchell R. Butier","No, we didn't quantify, but it's modest, George. It's a few million dollars in North America, and everywhere else it's -- we go to different levels of price increase depending on what's moving with the currencies. So for example, we did comment in 2013 that, in South America, we've been raising prices throughout the year effectively to offset some of the currency movements. So I'm not going to comment on that because it's really just looking to offset wherever the currency moves.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.","I was wondering -- I mean, if I heard properly, you did say that the game plan was to improve the mix in PSM. So if I understood properly, what do you think needs to be done? Is it a change in tactic, a change in marketing, going -- eliminating lower-margin product lines? Could you help me understand what you mean by that?","Dean A. Scarborough","Rosemarie, I think it's more about tweaking our strategy. And there's nothing I would say major here. It's again driving more innovation, a little bit of cost out here. This is -- our overall strategy is the same, and that's to continue to grow our business through innovation, through -- and a lot of the innovation helps us take market share, continuing to execute well in emerging markets. We had a great quarter in emerging markets. And so I don't think there's anything major here. It's just a matter of keep focusing on driving the business forward.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.","Okay. So it is not a question of eliminating some product lines that have lower margins inherently?","Dean A. Scarborough","No. Our mentality is, \"Let's figure out a way to either innovate in those product categories where we might need a little help or to get more productive.\"","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.","Okay, that is helpful. And one other question is regarding RBIS. Once adopted by a retailer, have you ever seen a case where money is running short and they canceled the program? Or once they adopt it, they mostly either stay where they are or go forward with more of it?","Dean A. Scarborough","I'd say, generally, most retailers continue to expand it. And we had one major retailer who's moved -- or 2 -- a couple of major retailers that have moved to mark everything in the store because once you get 60% to 70%, it just makes sense to convert. We did have a retailer last year who scaled back some of their ambitions. They didn't cancel the program, but I think that was more about their overall market position and strategy than it was related to RFID.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.","Okay. And if I may, and I'm sure others know that, but why is the big range in the EPS guidance between 8% to 19%? Where does the major uncertainty come from, retailers or something else?","Dean A. Scarborough","I think it's a reflection of our inability to really get a good forward look, and it's actually narrower this year than it has been the last couple of years. We just don't have any -- we don't have much forward visibility in our business. We don't have backlogs. We ship out a huge percentage of our orders in just a few days, and it's just kind of a reality for us. And so one thing I will tell you, and that is from an internal objective point of view, we target the high end of the range.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.","Okay. And what do you need to get there? Do you need help -- outside help from the economy, from any particular area?","Mitchell R. Butier","We need a continuation of the current -- the economic environment we saw in '13 and continued execution both top line, as well as the productivity initiatives we've laid out.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's Silke Kueck for Jeff. A couple of questions. So it looks like your depreciation and amortization expenses went down by $60 million this year. That's sort of like a diamond benefit to your earnings, I guess. Is that sustainable or do you expect your D&A charges to continue to move lower as you close down facilities?","Mitchell R. Butier","Yes. We -- you'd expect it to continue to -- I mean, if you look at the longer-term trend, it has been going down. Our CapEx for a number of years has been below our level of depreciation expense. A big part of that was just, when we moved OCP to disc ops, we had some depreciation expense in Q1 of last year and then all of DES as well. So it's a bigger reduction than you normally would see. And as we -- and as CapEx and depreciation start to converge, which they are getting close to doing, so you'd expect it to start to plateau a little bit.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And...","Mitchell R. Butier","So one thing to point out, sorry, is also -- in talking about investments in the business, we have said the amortization on the acquisition intangibles in RBIS start to drop off in '16 and '17.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And what's the magnitude of that?","Mitchell R. Butier","It's about $20 million.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A year?","Mitchell R. Butier","Yes. So the $20 million is total amortization expense. About half of that drops off in '16 and '17.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Secondly, the raw material prices you are seeing on the propylene side, do you think those are more seasonal in nature? Like, it seems that propylene prices move up every year sort of at the end of the year and early into the year, and then they come down in the spring.","Mitchell R. Butier","Yes. The spike, I think, happened a couple of months earlier than we had seen in the past, and I know you're very close to this, but it seemed to come a little bit earlier. So we're putting it through as a surcharge, and if it comes back down, then the surcharge will come up. That's one of the reasons we're using the mechanism of the surcharge.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So like, the surcharge is always, like, temporary? It's only like a quarter or so rather than being annualized?","Mitchell R. Butier","They're tied to -- if we do a surcharge, they're tied to something specific, whether it be freight costs or whether it be propylene and so forth, and one of the surcharges is tied to propylene.","Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And last, I was wondering what the size of the RFID business is now. I guess it contributed like another $8 million or so to sales this year, which is very nice. And I was wondering, like, what the size of the -- the absolute size of the business is by now.","Dean A. Scarborough","It's around $100 million, a little over.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Chris Kapsch with Topeka Capital Markets.","Christopher Kapsch - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Follow-up questions on the Pressure-sensitive division in particular. When you reported third quarter, there were some hints of softness late in the quarter, I think in September and then early into the fourth quarter, first couple of, few weeks into October. So given the strength of the Pressure-sensitive segment in -- overall, in the fourth quarter, which is this, I guess, 7%, 8% organic growth, I'm just curious what the sequential trends look like throughout the quarter. And if you could provide that sort of by region. Like, where did you see the more pronounced strengthening during the course of the quarter? And what's that sequential trend look like thus far into the first quarter?","Mitchell R. Butier","Yes. So I think when we spoke last time, we said it's a temp -- the trend was going down, particularly in September and October, as was consistent with the guidance we provided, which we wouldn't imply it was starting to come back. And it did come back, and November had the best month of year-over-year comps. It was pretty strong in most of the regions actually. And Europe came back stronger than -- as I've quoted, they were in high-single digits overall for the quarter. So Europe was particularly strong throughout the quarter but really ramped up. And November and December trailed off a little bit from a year-over-year standpoint, but strong, I'd say, pretty consistently throughout the quarter.","Christopher Kapsch - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And can you talk about thus far into -- trends into January?","Dean A. Scarborough","January is our lowest sales month. And so it's not really indicative, and we actually look to February to see -- get a decent read. So we're not going to comment on where it's coming out. I'd say, overall, it's consistent with our guidance expectations for the year, but it's not a good barometer.","Christopher Kapsch - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then if I'm just looking, I guess, on Page 10 of your -- the review presentation, just a couple of questions on that. So your outlook for 2014 free cash flow, calling it, $300 million-plus. I'm just curious, like, given the extra pension payments that you made in 2013 and considering higher discount rates, I'm just wondering how much, if any, pension contributions does that free cash flow guidance contemplate in '14?","Mitchell R. Butier","So the free cash flow in 2013 excludes the supplemental pension plan contribution. Is that your question, Chris?","Christopher Kapsch - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I'm just wondering if the '14 guidance contemplates any incremental pension payment?","Mitchell R. Butier","Well, the guidance has a -- the guidance, really, is just a floor. So we're saying it can be more than that. So it's going to be at least $25 million of pension contributions in 2014. That's what we're required to do. But we haven't locked down exactly what we're going to contribute. The factor there is the floor. I think the bigger factor for as you look at 2014 for free cash flow, bigger than pensions, is just the $30 million I commented on that seemed to move out of the first weeks of '14 into '13, as well as the impact of the 53rd week.","Christopher Kapsch - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then, in this net debt to adjusted EBITDA metric, you don't incorporate underfunded pension obligation in net debt here, right?","Mitchell R. Butier","No, we do not. This we use as a proxy just to -- for how we really look at it, which is full leverage, which is including the pension obligation. So this is kind of a shorthand for how we look at it, where -- if you look at total leverage. And our pension obligations -- our underfunded pension obligation is below -- across all the geographies is less than $300 million now, where it was north of $400 million last year.","Christopher Kapsch - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Right, right. Okay. So then considering this target of 1.7 to 2 on that shorthand version of your leverage metric and although you say, on average, it was 1.5 in '13, it looks -- it just looks like you're around 1.0, roughly 1x at the year-end 2013. So considering where the EBITDA is likely to be, considering the free cash flow, it looks like you have substantial capacity for incremental buybacks. And then I don't know if this target is sort of a year-end 2015, but if it's a year-end target for 2015, you get the benefit from another year of free cash flow in 2015, which would suggest potential of over $1 billion in capacity for buybacks. I'm just wondering when would you, I guess in conjunction with the Board, decide to take action on pursuing just a more appropriate leverage ratio using buybacks to get there.","Mitchell R. Butier","Yes. So a couple of comments. This isn't a year-end target. It's actually averaged throughout the year, and Q4 is always the lowest point on the leverage. I think you're right to call it, the 1.5 is a little bit higher than if you normalized our average for 2013 because, the first 2 quarters, we didn't have the proceeds in. So it could be somewhere between the 1 and the 1.5 overall, if you would adjust for that, which would imply, as I mentioned, some good amount of balance sheet capacity. And we do have additional free cash flow in 2014 after the dividend of a couple hundred million. So we recognize that, and I think the key thing here is we've said that we're going to continue to be disciplined as we deploy cash to shareholders and -- through increasing dividends, as well as through share buybacks. And if you look at last year, we did deploy almost $400 million, which was more than our free cash flow from the business, and we will continue to follow the same approach we have been.","Christopher Kapsch - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then just one final one. Just on, I guess, the investor day that you're planning for May, did you say you're going to update these 2015 targets or more likely extend the targets beyond where you put the current metrics are for 2015? In other words...","Dean A. Scarborough","We'll extend the targets probably another 3 years because if we update the 2015 targets, we'll essentially be giving guidance for 2015. And we're not going to do that in May of 2014. So these will be longer-term objectives for the company.","Operator","And with that, we'll proceed with our last question from the line of George Staphos.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two last questions. I'll ask them in sequence, piggybacking on Chris' last line of questioning. Over time, could you remind us, where do you think the dividend -- how should it proceed? What kind of pace should it grow at relative to your earnings or if you look at it more from a cash flow standpoint? And then in capital allocation overall, I noticed that capital spend in your guidance doesn't really move all that much versus 2013 despite the fact that you are adding a coater. How are you -- what are the offsets there relative to the investments that you're making in the coater? And do you expect EVA per share this year to actually move up more or less in line with your earnings guidance?","Dean A. Scarborough","Thanks, George. So on the first question about capital allocation, dividend versus share buyback, this is something the Board obviously spends quite a bit of time on. And we're going to make our dividend decision every year at the end of the first quarter, so in coincidence with our annual meeting. That's how the Board wants to deal with that. And I think both are important, and it's something we look at. On the second question, actually, we're installing more than 1 coater next year. We typically, especially in emerging markets, are adding a coater or sometimes 2 per year. So that's -- it's not a huge increase -- obviously, we're increasing capacity mainly in emerging markets because we need it for the volume growth. And the one in Europe is really more about -- it's really more about upgrading our capability and efficiency and driving more productivity. So I think on the sort of overall offsets, we -- our spending on IT has been up the last couple of years. We've been putting in a new financial system. We've had -- we're in the midst of building a new headquarters building for our materials business in Europe. So that's a little bit of, I'd say, a onetime thing. We don't do that every year. So there's some puts and takes. I will say that if RFID accelerates next year or we see substantial volume increases, we may have to spend a little more in capital spending, and it would be a delight to do so. It's a high-class problem path. Mitch, did you have any comments?","Mitchell R. Butier","No. I think, overall, it's just that, every year, we're making investments in different places, and there's not, I'd say, one general theme to the pull, to what's funding these increases. The overall investments, if you look at it relative to '13 to '14, there's increases in Asia. There's increases for the graphics coaters in Europe and modest increased investment in Tapes and the RFID business, so they're both growing.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So if that's normally the case, then EVA per share should grow at least in tandem with earnings overall would be the conclusion?","Mitchell R. Butier","Our goal is to continue to expand returns, yes, exactly.","Operator","Mr. Scarborough, back to you, sir, for your closing remarks.","Dean A. Scarborough","Thanks, Fran. I'm very pleased with the excellent progress we've made over the past 2 years against our long-term strategic and financial goals. Innovation will continue to be a hallmark for our businesses, further strengthening our industry-leading positions in all of our key markets. Our value-creation formula remains straightforward. Modest top line growth, ongoing productivity improvements and highly disciplined capital management will continue to drive double-digit earnings growth and solid free cash flow, most of which we'll give back to shareholders.","I would like to thank the Avery Dennison team members for delivering another solid year.

Please begin, Mr. Leeds.","Eric Leeds","Thank you. Welcome, everyone. Today, we\u2019ll discuss our preliminary unaudited third quarter 2014 results. Please note that unless otherwise indicated, today\u2019s discussion will be focused on our continuing operations. The non-GAAP financial measures that we use are defined, qualified and reconciled with GAAP on schedules A-2 to A-5 of the financial statements accompanying today\u2019s earnings release.","We remind you that we\u2019ll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. These forward-looking statements are made subject to the Safe Harbor statement included in today\u2019s earnings release.","On the call today are Dean Scarborough, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mitch Butier, Senior Vice President and CFO.","I will now turn the call over to Dean.","Dean Scarborough","Thanks, Eric, and good day, everyone. I am really please to announce Mitch Butier\u2019s election to position of President and Chief Operating Officer effective November 1. Mitch has played an integral role in defining and executing our value creation strategy. He knows our businesses extremely well having held senior roles in both pressure sensitive materials and retain branding and information solution, not to mention focusing the majority of his time as CFO on their strategies and plans for execution.","This move is consistent with the board\u2019s longstanding practice of leadership development and succession planning. You may recall that I also held the role of Chief Operating Officer before taking the helm as CEO, as did my predecessor. All businesses will now report directly to Mitch. In addition, Don Nolan, President of the Materials Group is leading the company. As a result, Mitch will be assuming direct oversight for the materials businesses and Don will stay on for a brief period of time to assist him in the transition. I am grateful for Don\u2019s leadership of the group over the past six and half years.","Mitch will also continue on as CFO until we find his replacement. That process is underway.","I\u2019m very much looking forward to working with Mitch in this new capacity. We worked together now for more than a decade. I know that he has the experience, vision and leadership to effectively partner with me as well as the rest of the leadership team to achieve our strategic and financial goals.","Shifting gears I\u2019ll now turn to the results for the quarter. While we reported EPS in line with our expectation I have to say it was a challenging quarter. We experienced pressure on both sales and gross margin but those impacts were offset through tight management of operating expenses and lower incentive compensation.","The Pressure Sensitive Materials segment delivered organic sales growth of 5% roughly in line with our expectations for the quarter. Volume growth was solid across all regions and stronger in emerging markets and performance tapes. We had another successful Label expo show in which we demonstrated several innovative new products. Our customers and end users look to us to bring innovation to this market and our leadership in doing so continues to drive top line performance.","Mitch will provide more color on results by region and product line but let me just touch on one key issue that we faced in this business during the quarter. In January, we announced a large and complex project to consolidate PSM manufacturing operations in Europe. The project is behind schedule and we incurred higher transition cost than expected during the quarter due to problems with the new distribution outsourcing arrangement that led to delays in meeting customer orders for graphic material.","Given our long track record of success in executing these kinds of projects this was a disappointment for the team. We estimate that the combined impact of the service disruption and other transition cost associated with this project represented about $6 million pretax in the quarter, a few million dollars more than we anticipated. That being said, we still expect a healthy payback on this investment.","We should get a nice sequential boost in earnings in Q4 now that things have stabilized and the project remains on track to deliver roughly $15 million of annualized savings when fully completed.","As you know, our strategy in PSM is to create value by growing the top line of this high return business at a 4% to 5% level organically. The team has done a great job of driving growth by executing well in emerging markets and developing innovative new products to enable share gain and application growth. And while we are happy that our adjusted operating margin is in the target range we are confident we can do better.","In addition to delivering the savings from the European restructuring, we are taking actions to improve variable margins and product mix in PSM. We\u2019re focusing our energy and resources to grow faster in higher margin product categories including specialty products, graphics and performance tapes.","We are also adjusting our pricing strategy for lower margin products in certain geographies. At the same time, we\u2019ll be accelerating our productivity and cost out actions. In other words, we\u2019re continuing to pursue the broad strategic priorities that we\u2019ve communicated in the past, fine-tuning where appropriate and tightening up the execution of our commercial and operational initiatives.","Now turning to Retail Branding and Information Solution, the team delivered another quarter of solid bottom line results in the face of a continuing soft top line. While growth remained strong with our Europe based retailers and brand owners driven by both RFID as well as share gain across most market segments, U.S. originated sales weakened further in the quarter with sales to these end customers down mid-single digits.","Consumer sentiment and retailer caution does remain part of the challenge domestically but we have also lost some market share with U.S. based retailers and brand owners over the past few quarters. To ensure that we win across all market segments we\u2019ve been refining our value proposition and we\u2019re continuing to bring innovation to the market. For example, we recently opened a new innovation center in downtown Los Angeles to better serve the market here on the west coast. And we created a joint venture with Ningbo Shenzhou, one of the world\u2019s largest athletic apparel manufacturers to accelerate the adoption of our unique external embellishment technology.","I\u2019m pleased to say that sales of RFID products remain robust. We continue to expect RFID to be a key long term growth driver for this business.","Finally, RBIS continued to make good progress in executing key productivity initiatives reporting another quarter of double digit earnings growth and taking another step forward on the path to our long term margin target. As you know, we targeted a full point of margin expansion for this business each year through 2015 and project a continuation of that trajectory through 2018.","With some of the issues I described continuing into the fourth quarter along with a new headwind from recent currency volatility we have modestly lowered our EPS guidance for the full year. That said, we still anticipate another year of double digit adjusted EPS growth for 2014.","In the near term, we are focused on completing the European consolidation to enable faster more profitable growth in graphics, executing our commercial and operational strategies in the balance of the materials business and driving share gain in RBIS. And we remain committed to achieving our long term financial targets. We\u2019ll continue to leverage our leadership positions and strong competitive advantages in both of our core businesses growing those innovation and differentiated quality and service. We\u2019ll further expand margins through productivity and leveraging our scale and we\u2019ll continue to execute our disciplined strategy for capital deployment.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mitch.","Mitch Butier","Hello everyone. Let me starting by thanking Dean and our board for giving me the opportunity to play a greater role in the company. I\u2019m honored, excited and confident in the company\u2019s position and prospects. As COO my focus remains the same, ensuring the long term success of the company by delivering exceptional value for our customers, our employees and our shareholders.","Now let\u2019s review the results. In the third quarter, we delivered a 12% increase in adjusted earnings per share on 3% organic sales growth with the top line in growth in PSM offsetting a decline in RBIS. The company\u2019s gross margin declined 100 basis points in the quarter due to declines in all three segments. PSM continues to grapple with negative impacts from net pricing and mix shifts. We also had challenges associated with manufacturing cost in the quarter primarily due to the higher than expected transition cost from the European restructuring that Dean described earlier. The lower gross margin RBIS was driven by lower volume. These factors more than offset the continued strong contribution from our productivity initiatives across the company.","Adjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded 30 basis points to 8% as the lower gross margin was more than offset by productivity, tight spending controls and reductions in incentive compensation expense. The adjustments in incentive comp provided a 60 basis point benefit while the European transition cost reduced operating margin by about 30 basis points. So the impact of these two items with the net benefit of about 30 basis point or $0.03 in the quarter.","Our adjusted tax rate for both the third quarter and year-to-date was 33% in line with our expectations as we continue to anticipate the full year tax rate to be comparable to last year.","Free cash flow was $153 million in the quarter and $82 million in the first three quarters. While free cash flow in the quarter was strong and well ahead of last year, we now expect full year free cash flow of less than $300 million.","As we approach the close of the year, we have a better view to the timing of vendor payments and customer receipts. A revised view also reflects the impact of lowering operating results including higher than anticipated working capital level and currency fluctuation. Importantly, a good portion of the shortfall to our previous free cash flow estimate for the year will be a benefit to the first quarter of next year.","With net debt to EBITDA at 1.3 times we remain below our long term targeted leverage position and continue to be disciplined with our share repurchase program. We have repurchased 5 million shares through the end of the third quarter at a cost of $247 million. As we have discussed, we repurchased more shares when stock trades at a greater discount to our assessment of intrinsic value within certain limits relative to daily trading volume.","To that end, we have recently ramped up our share repurchase levels. First, when the stock declined at the end of July, then even further at the beginning of October and there was a broad weakening in the market. So in addition to the 5 million shares repurchased in the first three quarters, we have repurchased approximately 1.5 million share in the first four weeks of October.","Looking at the segments, Pressure Sensitive Materials sales in the third quarter were up approximately 5.3% on an organic basis. At the product line level, Label and Packaging Materials sales were up mid-single digits. Combined sales for Performance Tapes, Graphics, Reflective products were likewise up mid-single digits with another strong quarter for Performance Tapes being offset by relatively weak growth of Graphics due to the service issues in Europe that we discussed earlier.","On a regional basis North America sales grew low single digit rebounding from Q2 levels. Western Europe sales grew mid-single digits reflecting solid market demand. However, we are cautious about the outlook for the European market for the remainder of the year. And emerging markets grew upper single digits. This is slower than recent trends as China slowed to a low single digit growth this quarter. While some of this represents inventory correction, we have seen a general slowdown in our end markets in China.","PSM\u2019s adjusted operating margin of 10.3% in the third quarter was 20 basis points lower than the last year. The net impact of raw material input cost and pricing, higher manufacturing costs including the transition cost in Europe and country and product mix more than offset the benefit of higher volume and productivity.","We\u2019ve talked about the challenge of the pricing in mixed dynamic in PSM and we are working to address it. It is the top priority but will take some time to adjust. The manufacturing cost challenges are already being addressed and should be back in line by the end of the fourth quarter.","Retail Branding and Information Solution sales declined about 2% in the quarter, reflecting some share loss in the US value and contemporary segments partially offset like continued strong demand from Europe based retailers and brands which reflected the growth of RFID and other share gains in that region.","RFID revenue was up almost 20% in the third quarter and up 17% year-to-date. Despite the overall sales decline in the third quarter, RBIS expanded adjusted operating margin by 80 basis points to 6.7% as the benefit of productivity and lower incentive compensation more than offset the impact of wage inflation and lower volume.","As Dean mentioned, we are focused on driving share gain in RBIS while continuing to drive productivity and expand the operating margin in this business.","Sales in Vancive Medical Technologies were down roughly 5% organically due primarily to the timing of orders. The operating income declined by about $2 million due to largely through an R&D milestone payment we received last year from one of our strategic partners.","As for our 2014 outlook, we now expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3 to $3.05. This reduction reflects continued softness in RBS's top line, the pricing and mix challenges in PSM and about $0.03 of currency headwind in the fourth quarter largely offset by tighter spending controls and lower incentive compensation expense.","Our full year guidance is based on a number of assumptions including the key factors listed on Slide 8 of our supplemental presentation materials.","We now estimate approximately 3.5% organic sales growth which excludes the benefit of an extra week of sales this year. At recent rates, we expect negative impacts from currency of approximately 1% through quarter sales growth and approximately $6 million of EBIT.","We expect average shares outstanding assuming dilution of approximately 96 million shares reflecting our increase level of share repurchases. As I mentioned, we now anticipate 2014 free cash flow of less than $300 million and we increased our estimate for restructuring charges by a $0.01 per share.","We anticipate the savings in 2015 from the restructuring actions implemented this year to be approximately $35 million net of transition costs. The rest of our key assumptions remain unchanged from what we shared last quarter.","In summary, we delivered another quarter of double digit earnings per share growth despite a number of challenges. We have had a couple of uncharacteristic hiccups from the execution front which I am confident we will address quickly and we are refining our strategy in a couple of key areas specifically optimizing the tradeoffs between priced volume in mix in PSM and recapturing share in the US and RBIS. With these refinements we are confident in our ability to achieve our longer term goals. As I said at the start, I'm honored and excited to be named COO. This is a great company with great people.","Our two industry leading core businesses are well-positioned for profitable growth which, combined with our continued focus on productivity and capital discipline will, enable us to further expand margins as well as increased returns and achieve our 2015 and 2018 targets.","Now we'll open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. You may begin sir.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird","Hey guys, good morning. And Mitch congrats on all these changes. Sounds like you will be a busy guy and hope for your business card can hold all these new titles.","Mitch Butier","Thank you, Ghansham.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird","On the title, I mean they all make sense but one that stands out is on the PSM side. So just on that first up, what changes, if any, should we expect for the segment going forward I guess with the leadership adjustment there?","Dean Scarborough ","Yes, Ghansham, I expect the fundamental strategy to be the same and I think we\u2019re in the process of tweaking the strategy a bit. The execution of the really complex project in Europe we would probably bit off a little more than we chew and lean forward pretty aggressively getting that back under control. And I think a more of a focus on growing in higher margin segments. And by the way, this graphics transition once it's done will help us be able to do that. So it's really fundamentally the same strategy. Just there\u2019s a little bit of shift in priorities and execution.","Mitch Butier","And Ghansham, as far as from an organizational standpoint, right now given what Dean just said for a period of time I want to spend some time really, I know this business well but I want to do a deep immersion with the team and just spend more time in that organization.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird","Okay. That makes sense. And then on free cash flow, can you just quantify some of these? You mentioned higher clarity on the vendor payment so on and so forth and the impact it will have on 1Q at the expense of 4Q, but can you just quantify that in fact for us?","Mitch Butier","There is a tremendous amount of variation around year end as we have talked about, Ghansham. So we are not going to quantify and that's what we just said it's now going to be less than and it's the timing of vendor payments and customer receipts as we have talked about, but also if we look at where we are in the productivity front on working capital, we are a little behind from where we want to be. And so the key focus her is can we achieve our objective by the end of the year where we are going to be on working capital. We do expect it to be lower than $300 million at this point, could be a pretty wide range, a good portion of that. Any shortfall will come through next year.","Our overall focus here is continuing to maintain long term capital discipline while we generate significant cash flow over the long time. So if you recall last year we made a significant Q4 free cash flow of $225 million and a big outflow in Q1. So we actually see a rebalancing of this is actually could be a good thing.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird","Okay. And just one final one. The caution on Europe, is that just being pragmatic based on the news headlines you are reading about or is there something specifically that you are seeing right now? Thanks\/","Dean Scarborough","Yes, Ghansham, I was just over with the team last week and we are still seeing a decent growth but it's just not as strong as it was. For the last few quarters we have seen good growth in Western Europe -- good growth in Eastern Europe but not at the higher rate that we have seen before. I actually think our results for Q4 will show okay but they will be different. In other words, our graphics sales weren\u2019t very good in the third quarter because we had some execution problems. I believe those will rebound as we drive down our backlogs but on the labeling and packaging materials we have definitely seen a little bit of softening I would say the last couple of months in Western Europe. And yes, we are being pragmatic about the news coming out of Europe especially.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird","Okay. Thanks so much guys.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead sir.","George Staphos - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Thanks, good morning everybody. Again Mitch, congratulations well earned on the new responsibility. I just take back a little bit off of Ghansham's questions to start, do you see yourself in the role of heading up PSM indefinitely or do you think that it's something that transitions to some other individual in the next year or two? And then similarly can you update us and really it's just perhaps started where you stand on finding the right CFO to run Avery from here and whether it's more likely internal or externally focused?","Mitch Butier","So as far as your question of do I see myself running it indefinitely, one thing I have learned is nothing is indefinite. So not making any decisions on that whole front right now. For me the key thing is we\u2019ve got the right strategy, we got a great team within the materials organization. We know we got to do, we know we've got to make some course corrections and that's what the team and I will be focused on. And like I said before, I want to spend a period of time doing a deep immersion with the organization and on the strategies. And we'll evaluate as time goes by about how we adjust of course from the organizational front.","Dean Scarborough","George, as far as the CFO search goes, we have actually started the process. We are going to do an external search. We do have some internal candidates as well, so we are going to be doing some very active benchmarking there. And I expect it will take a few months, because -- especially at this time of year.","George Staphos - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Understood. Well, good luck in that process. It's obviously an important seat to fill. If we switch to operation, can you talk a little bit about what you're planning to do to adjust pricing in some of your lower priced geographies if I'm paraphrasing correctly?","Dean Scarborough","Yes. So George, I think we talked about in a few regions we have been going after some lower margin business that was still EVA positive. I think we may have overcorrected there in a couple places. And so, fundamentally, we have adjusted prices in a few countries to capture that through a combination of factors either direct price increases or reducing rebates.","George Staphos - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Okay. I mean, just a quick question on that. If it's EVA positive then, why do you need to increase pricing? And then, I had a follow-on on RBIS and I'll turn it over.","Dean Scarborough","I think in Jan -- on the average it was the -- the moves have been EVA positive, especially even last quarter if you take the extra transition cost we had in Europe into account. But in some countries, in some product areas it wasn't EVA positive and that's where we are taking the corrective action.","George Staphos - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Okay. Understood on that. My last one, then I'll turn it over. With RBIS given all that you bring to bear and all that you've told us about in terms of your value proposition, how is it that you are losing market share in the U.S.? And then, Mitch, just a quick one, just on share buyback, some numbers that the team and I were running, looks like the average share buyback price we would calculate for the third quarter was around $49 a share, is that correct, and if not could you tell us what the average repurchase price was? Thank you.","Dean Scarborough","Yes, George, on RBIS, we've had very effective share gain in Europe and the strategies have worked extremely well there. In the U.S. actually there is some market segments where we are doing very well, especially in the performance and athletic segment and some of the fast-fashion segments. The area where we I would guess -- I won't say struggle, but we're trying to change the value proposition, is in the value and kind of contemporary fashion or probably easier to describe as department store sector.","We have a couple of issues. One is that the portfolio of customers that we have traditionally had unfortunately, it's doing worse in the market. And so, one of the strategies here is to get and attract new customers. And we are having some early term success but it does take some time for that to play out. Also -- and I want to give the team some credit here. We have been doing a good job of pricing for value in all of our segments. And I think we just frankly got a little bit out of balance in a couple of these market segments. And so, we are again in the process of adjusting that and capturing some new business. And here is a case where we had lowered our fix cost and the variable margin is still very attractive.","So again, I think it will take us a quarter or two to get back on track. But I think the team has good plans. We have made some changes in our commercial leadership in North America and actually moved one of our senior European leaders to North America who had been successfully executing that strategy. So I am confident we will be fine.","Mitch Butier","","And Gorge, your math is right. It's about a $0.25 less than $49 a share average for the quarter. If you look at our absolute share buyback within Q3, it was 1.9 million of shares, which is basically the same we had in Q2. So when this stock started declining at the end of July, we ramped up our share repurchase activity. But as is said, it's -- we have limits based on daily trading volume. And as you know, volumes drop quite a bit off in the summer month. So we accelerated, but it's relative to trading volume. And as I said further, we have accelerated even further in the month of October.","Dean Scarborough","","George, one more piece of color on RBIS, especially for the North American business. There -- in especially the value segment, customers tend to buy a couple different ways. They use either nominated programs. In other words, they say you get a 100% of either my business or programs or they qualify multiple vendors. We then focus more on nominating programs. We have had a lot of success there because that really leverages our scale. But we have been less successful in the open platforms. So again, we have the ability to go get some more of this open business and that's really where the teams are focused.","Operator","","Our next question from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays Capital. Please begin sir.","","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital","","Thanks. Good morning. Congratulations, Mitch.","","Mitch Butier","","Thanks, Scott.","","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital","","Just wanted to focus on PSM for a minute and some of the negative price cost issues, seems like they've been gone on for a couple of quarters. Does it make you sit back and may be reassess whether or not you put that business on more of a contractual faster going forward or do you think this is just a -- maybe your input cost for rising faster than you expect that input should take more time to get back go that price cost neutral situation?","","Dean Scarborough","Yes. First of all, we're not seeing a lot of raw material inflation right now as you might expect. I think the strategy here overall is the right one. Grow the top-line faster through innovation, grow in higher margin category, accelerate growth in emerging markets where we tend to have higher than average margin. And so, I like -- we like the fundamental strategy. What we've been faced with on the margin is that our variable margins in the short-term aren\u2019t as rich as we would like them to be.","So, how do we address that? We address that by more targeted segmentation around pricing, making sure that some of the business we go after is definitely EVA positive. We didn't help ourselves with the operational hiccups that we had in the quarter. We would have had at least 20 or 30 more basis points of flow through in the quarter without those hiccups. So we've got to hone in a little bit on the execution, I\u2019m confident that we'll get there. So it's a number of factors. And I think the team is -- understands what we need to do. We have got really good clarity about what's going on in the market. So we'll start to make some progress.","Mitch Butier","","And the thing I'd add on the mix front, from a product mix standpoint, this is something that we have been looking to address in focusing more growth on specialty and so forth. And so, we are seeing things. Despite the very slow graphics quarter in Europe, which is higher variable margin, we are starting to see a stabilization because of the successful implementation of those efforts. So that's one thing and the other is country mix I highlighted as well. So the very low growth in China. China has higher variable margins as well, also is impact for us, so, okay.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital","And you mentioned, may be a focus on growing the graphics business going forward. My understanding is that's a little bit of a leading indicator that segment just given its sensitivity to the economic situation. Is it \u2013 are you talking about growing it, because you\u2019d actually see things getting better? I know you mentioned Eastern and Western Europe may be getting worse but maybe there is some underlying trends within your customers that makes you feel better about that business or is that just a long term opportunity? ","Dean Scarborough","Well we have had great growth in Graphics in North America, in Asia and I'm going to carve up the piece of business that's been sourced from Europe or Asia, and in South America. And up until we had some of the operational hiccups we also had higher than average growth at Europe at the same time. So, in the third quarter it wasn\u2019t good because frankly we couldn\u2019t get orders up in to work and we will have that backlog driven down in this quarter and be back.","So, customers like our value proposition, we\u2019re going to be more competitive after we complete the restructuring program. So, it\u2019s an opportunity for us. We have relatively low market share and we have some fantastic new products. I think the one new product that is very popular right now is our Supreme Wrapping Film for automobiles. And it\u2019s a great product, it\u2019s got very nice margins, installers like it, customers like it. So, I encourage all of you guys to go out and stiff up your cars and try some of this new Supreme Wrapping Film.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital","Interesting, then just lastly on all of, on both segments and then even on the corporate line it looks like maybe you mention the lower incentive compensation, I assume there were maybe some reversal of prior accrual. Can you just quantify how much was for the each of the segments?","Mitch Butier","Well so we\u2019re just going to provide the information, Scott, at the overall company level but if you\u2019re trying to get a feel for what was for the quarter versus reversal of some prior quarter item. So I mentioned that it was a 60 basis point benefit to the quarter. So year-to-date it\u2019s about a 30 base point benefit year-to-date. So you can compare the impact of the various quarters and understand what the implication would be to \u201815.","And then within the segment, won\u2019t provide specific numbers but what I\u2019ll say is its less for PSM and more for RBIS meaning more of a benefit for RBIS and still benefit in PSM but less though.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital","Great, thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup. Please go ahead, sir.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup","Good morning and congratulations to Mitch.","Mitch Butier","Thank you.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup","Just a follow-up on PSM, you\u2019ve talked about this more targeted segmented pricing. And I'm just wondering how long it takes to implement this kind of change, is this something that we could see benefits from in 4Q or is it sort of a longer term project? And when you look within the organization in terms of people or systems or processes what do you really need to do to implement this kind of change in pricing, and again sort of what\u2019s the timeframe for this implementation?","Dean Scarborough","Yes, Anthony, it takes time and I think we have the data and we got the capabilities to do this. I don\u2019t think there is a lack of knowledge here. So I don\u2019t want to put a specific time frame on it because it\u2019s difficult to predict and let\u2019s face it. There are a lot of factors in here mix, what product lines are growing, country mix and as well as regional mix in terms of overall demand. But I think we will start to see some progression over the next few quarters.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup","Okay, okay. That's helpful. And then just on RFID I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about growth of RFID in the quarter and what kind of rate of growth you all can really see this year? And then just early look into 2015, you\u2019ve anniversaried the customer loss earlier. What kind of growth do you expect in RFID in \u201815?","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup","I think the -- we\u2019re not going to give guidance on RFID for 2015. We\u2019re happy to do that when we get to our Q4 earnings call and provide guidance next year. It\u2019s growing about 20% this year and \u2013 it\u2019s very much in line with our expectation. So we feel good about our position there and the market growth.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup","Okay. That's helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Operator","Our next from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.","Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Thank you, and congratulations to Mitch as well. If we get Europe and Russia, Ukraine you have a new distribution center in Ukraine, can you give us a feel for how that is doing? It was doing quite well last quarter, I understand it is small. And when you look at October, do you see continuation of the decline or continuation at this particular lower level?","Dean Scarborough","I think from, Rosemarie from European perspective we've definitely seen a slowdown in Russia which is probably not a surprise to most folks. And really all of Eastern Europe I don\u2019t have any specifics on Ukraine, so it is awfully small. I will say though that the rate of growth that we had forecast or it\u2019s part of our guidance range for the quarter, we\u2019re at or a little bit above for the whole company after three weeks into the quarter. So I still got my fingers crossed, we got a long way to go. And when things slow down they tend to slow down near the end of the quarter rather than especially at the end of the year rather than in the beginning. So I'm cautiously optimistic.","I think Europe, again, we\u2019re concerned about the economics like everyone else, in Germany and in France, but I think that some of that will be offset by the improvement in our graphics business as we drive down the backlog. So we may not be indicative -- our numbers for Q4 may not be indicative of what\u2019s exactly is happening in the market because we do have this large backlog of orders that we\u2019re processing now.","Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli and Company","Okay. And if we look at the issues on PMS the manufacturing consolidation, could you give us a little more details? And as you were enabled to deliver products to your customers when did you have any loss of customers because of that? And second more related to the European slow down, any increase in bad debt, potential customer bankruptcy filing?","Dean Scarborough","I think on the order side we defiantly lost the business during the quarter. When you can\u2019t fulfill customer orders they generally look for other places to go. I will say though that the sales rate as we\u2019re driving down the backlog has continued, the order rate I should say it continued to improve. So that I think is good. I think customers are always disappointed when you do that but once we get back into a normal service position they like our products, we've got a number of new products that we\u2019ll be launching in graphics in the beginning of the year and we\u2019ve got to execute obviously. And so we did, we did lose some business in the quarter for sure.","Mitch Butier","As for the collectability of receivables and so forth, Rosemarie, we haven\u2019t seen anything abnormal in the change. And actually if you look at our measures we have for quality of receivable they\u2019ve actually improved from where they were last year but we do have small adjustments and so forth and hits periodically but nothing else out of the norm right now.","Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli and Company","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John McNulty with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","John McNulty - Credit Suisse","Yes, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions, and Mitch again congratulations. So can you give us an update or remind us as to what percent of your raw materials are petroleum or petro chemical based?","Dean Scarborough","Well, so it\u2019s about half of our raw material base is driven by paper stocks and then the balance I say 35% are film and then the 15% are monomers, resins, other chemicals that we use in the manufacturing (inaudible). One thing I will note though and that is there is probably more of a decoupling between oil prices and some of the feed stocks that we buy mainly because of the -- especially in the U.S. when you have a lot more shale gas and oil being produced they don\u2019t have the same derivatives as oil, let\u2019s say, from the Middle East. And therefore, it doesn\u2019t have same linkage. In other words, there are some products that we would buy that are less sought in the market place because of that change.","John McNulty - Credit Suisse","Okay, fair enough. So basically what it sounds like is the big drop in oil volume may see some benefits that may, it may not be necessarily the link that we've seen in say the last 10 years or so. Is that kind of a fair way to think?","Dean Scarborough","That's correct. We haven\u2019t seen a big change now. Obviously, we\u2019re interested in making that happen if we can. So that's an area of focus for procurement there.","John McNulty - Credit Suisse","Okay, fair enough. And then with regard to corporate and other, it definitely took a noticeable leg down; it\u2019s actually the lowest level we've seen in five or six quarters at least. Is this all the competition accrual adjustment or is there something else, and I guess how should we be thinking about what that level is going forward?","Mitch Butier","That's a portion of the comp reduction there but only the portion that relates to corporate employee. So there is always some variation in this line. There is a number of things that can impact that. The right number to be thinking about is roughly $80 million per year.","John McNulty - Credit Suisse","Okay, fair enough. And then just the last question on the RBIS side, in terms of the business that you lost some maybe not necessarily where you were betting on the wrong horse but just some of the pricing issues you had mentioned. When you think about the type of competitor that took the business, is it typically a smaller regional competitor there where once you kind of adjust your pricing it\u2019s pretty easy to take that business back or are they may be slightly larger where you\u2019re going to really have to kind of scrap for? So if you can give us some color as to maybe where you think you lost the business that would be helpful?","Dean Scarborough","Yes, I don\u2019t have that much detail, John, but typically it does tend to be smaller regional competitors. I mean that's still the bulk of the market place especially for those types of customers.","John McNulty - Credit Suisse","Okay great. Thanks very much for the color guys.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Kapsch with Topeka Capital Markets. You may begin.","Chris Kapsch - Topeka Capital Markets","Good morning. I had a few follow-ups on this strategy to selectively adjust your pricing in pressure sensitive. First, just wondering which geography is this issue sort of most acute? And then second you mentioned adjusting pricing maybe reducing rebates, just wondering also if there is the willingness to walk away from business that you\u2019ve gained that you previously viewed as EVA positive but you may no longer view it that way. So are you willing to cede share as you adjust your strategy here? And then also just wondering if there is any sense for competitive response or maybe it\u2019s too early gauge?","Dean Scarborough","Yes, I think in places like Asia, that\u2019s where we\u2019re doing some of the rebate adjustments. And we have. We\u2019re constantly managing mix of our product portfolio. So there is business that we have \u201cwalked away from\u201d and we\u2019re \u2013 and the focus there is growing faster in higher margin profit category so. That's the balance that you\u2019re always trying to achieve.","Chris Kapsch - Topeka Capital Markets","Which geography generally have, do you feel like this issue is kind of most acute? I mean, you mentioned the reducing rebates in Asia but is this, is it across the Board or is it more in western markets?","Dean Scarborough","Yes, it\u2019s actually, Chris, this is fairly typical of the way the business works everywhere. I don\u2019t think there is one place where it\u2019s worse or better etcetera, etcetera. I mean this is a constant, I won\u2019t call it a balancing act but \u2013 we've done a, I think the team has done a really good job of improving margins very successfully over the past few years, part of its through innovation. So that's where we get a lot of that the margin increase newer products either with lower cost and, therefore, we can substitute products with higher margins or brand new products that just have higher margins. And then again growing in product categories like durables our specialty products or graphics where we have higher variable margins and flow through so. So this has always been part of our formula on a go forward basis.","Chris Kapsch - Topeka Capital Markets","Okay, and if I could just follow up with a sort of bigger picture one. If you think about the pressure sensitive industry notwithstanding the recent slowdown and sounds like in China obviously emerging markets are pretty good growth. Europe has been growing certainly better than doing better than the broader European economy most recently. And then at least North America it appears as though, and I think the industry data even suggest us that the pressure sensitive industry broadly is no longer a GDP plus industry. In fact, maybe this year it may have even grown less than GDP. So I'm just wondering is there -- can you just comment about the North American pressure sensitive industry and its growth vis-\u00e0-vis the broader economy in North America? Has something changed or it\u2019s just not as growthie or how do you see that?","Dean Scarborough","Yes, it\u2019s a little perplexing. You\u2019re right that Europe has the market in Europe has grown nicely actually above GDP for the last 18 months whereas the U.S. has been I think for the last three or four quarters has been pretty flat. I try not to draw too many conclusions from that. We had growth in North America in the third quarter and that was nice to see. We don\u2019t have the market data. So it\u2019s difficult for us to calibrate on that. So I am actually perplexed by it.","I still think there is growth in both geographies. And certainly for us whether it\u2019s in graphics or durables or some of those other more specialized niche markets. So I wouldn\u2019t declare that the business is sub GDP especially with Europe growing above. So I think this is too early to make a call like that.","Chris Kapsch Topeka - Capital Markets","Thanks for the color.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Selka Cook from JPMorgan Securities. Please go ahead.","Selka Cook - JPMorgan Securities","I have a question on your cost saving targets. So I think like year-to-date your cost savings were something like $27 million and it looks like maybe for the year by the end of the fourth quarter maybe look at it like $34 million, $35 million. And the restructuring spending last year was something like $35 million or $36 million. So my intuition is that whatever cost savings \u2013 you\u2019ll be pull out in the $55 million you\u2019re spending this year would be higher than the $35 million you\u2019re indicating. So essentially what I am asking is this, is the $35 million in cost savings the next year conservative given the level of restructuring spending this year?","Mitch Butier","You\u2019re right to call us out, Selka. So usually we get savings roughly equal to the amount of cost that we incur. The exception of the large European restructuring just restructuring in Europe are more costly relative to the saving. So that is why you see a little bit of a differential here, higher cost this year relative to the amount of savings we are expecting. And given the timing of the implementation of the European restructuring, there is actually also further about $5 million that will come in \u201816 from the action this year, but you\u2019ve right to call it out but it is a little bit different from the norm and I wouldn\u2019t call it conservative. Now we do expect to have further restructuring next year which is without further savings as well. Some of that would impact next year and some of that impact a year after as well.","Selka Cook - JPMorgan Securities","Okay, helpful. And in terms of the rollback of the corporate cost accruals maybe that must $9 million or $10 million this quarter. Is there a similar order of magnitude in the fourth quarter or is everything adjusted now?","Mitch Butier","No, so a couple of things. It\u2019s not hitting just the corporate line, those numbers that I quoted 60 basis point was across the company. So it\u2019s in fact --","Selka Cook - JPMorgan Securities","Yes, I apologize, I just meant like overall comp accruals, yes.","Mitch Butier","Yes. So it was about 60 basis points in the quarter; year-to-date it\u2019s about 30 basis points. So you\u2019d expect it to be, assuming everything plays out like we\u2019re planning, it\u2019d be roughly the 30 basis points.","Selka Cook - JPMorgan Securities","So that means no further adjustments in the fourth quarter. Is that what you said?","Mitch Butier","You would not be further adjusting down but you would be accruing less than you had in the prior year Q4. That's how that works.","Selka Cook - JPMorgan Securities","Okay. And can you quantify the magnitude what that may be on a year-on-year basis?","Mitch Butier","About 30 basis points.","Selka Cook - JPMorgan Securities","Okay that's the 30 basis point, okay, I understand, sorry.","Mitch Butier","No, I understand.","Selka Cook - JPMorgan Securities","And the last question I had is even though it seems that propylene prices haven\u2019t really moved yet because we had all these refinery outages, like it looks like that the raw material basket may be less sensitive to oil but once activities starts up again -- I mean I would expect that probably all the propylene based derivatives that you purchase will probably begin to come down. And in that environment it seems that it may be difficult to raise price? Or how do you argue for a better price with your customers if it turns out that raw material basket may not \u2013 may be it won\u2019t step down may be just be flat. So how do you think they\u2019ll get to higher price in an environment like that?","Dean Scarborough","Yes, I think the decision on prices is driven not just by raw material cost, Selka. It\u2019s driven but what we\u2019re trying to do with the business and as well as raw material costs and prices. And propylene is one factor for us in a whole range of factors whether it would be pulp \u2013 remember pulp and paper is half of what we do. So I mean I hope you\u2019re right about propylene. And if that happens our goal would be obviously to take advantage of that and, yes, customers will probably aware of those factors as well. But I think this is, I think in this environment we\u2019re constantly taking pricing actions whether it\u2019s being driven by currency or new products that we launch or number of factors and there are changes in raw materials all over the place. So I'm not too concerned about that.","Selka Cook - JPMorgan Securities","And a very last question on capital allocation. Do you envision that you can sort of continue the magnitude of the share buyback next year or do you have other plans for the free cash flow that you generate?","Dean Scarborough","Well we have a very disciplined strategy for the use of our cash and a good model. We said back in May at the investor meetings that we were looking as potentially some small bolt-on acquisitions and we have a pipeline of deals. And as you can tell so far we haven\u2019t found anything that makes sense. But if we find the right opportunity we\u2019ll do that. We\u2019re pretty -- we\u2019re well below our targeted range for our \u2013 on our balance sheet for debt to EBITDA. And so we've got plenty of capacity to do both frankly. So that's -- we\u2019re in a pretty good position actually.","Selka Cook - JPMorgan Securities","Okay. That's clear. Thank very much, I\u2019ll get back into queue.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos. Please go ahead sir.","George Staphos - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Hi guys. I\u2019ll try to ask you in sequence, I know we\u2019re getting late in the call here. I guess first of all, can you help us map out the savings of $35 million, how you expect it to fall over the next few quarters, they\u2019re pretty even or do you think it will be back end loaded? And given what you know right now recognizing that things can change obviously, do you anticipate much additional restructuring next year? I think to answering Selka\u2019s question said there may be a little bit but, could there be other endeavors that you need to do for getting the cost structure right in either RBIS or PSM? And then lastly at least in the sequence, Vancive, what\u2019s the long term strategy here? It\u2019s obviously a drag on the P&L. I know you\u2019ve got some products that hopefully will come out, but it\u2019s still a burden on the P&L. So what\u2019s the long term strategy there?","Mitch Butier","George, as far as your first question about the timing of savings for next year using roughly evenly distributing that throughout the year is the right to rule of thumb to start with. What you\u2019ll see on the carry over front, not talking about the new initiatives, on the carry over front more the savings will be front loaded to \u2013 to RBIS in the first part of the year, and as you go out through the later part of the year more of those savings would be in PSM as this European restructuring project comes to completion.","Dean Scarborough","Yes, George, this is Dean, on the additional restructuring we\u2019re going through our operating plan reviews in a few weeks. And our goal is to continue on our path of delivering against our long term financial target. So I think we\u2019ll have a lot better visibility on what we want to do on productivity and cost out and restructuring etcetera, etcetera in a few weeks. And we\u2019ll certainly let investors know when we do the fourth quarter call and provide guidance for next year. I think we have hopefully a good track record for identifying good productivity gains and executing them well.","I think this in the third quarter we got probably the first hiccup that we\u2019ve had and we\u2019re committed to crisping that up and having better execution. But I think our teams are really good at finding additional sources of productivity and that\u2019s going to be one of the areas just like we always did focus on the AOP. I think at Vancive, our goal is to have that business at breakeven next year. The new products that we\u2019ve launched are what are causing the losses, and we\u2019re investing in the future.","And the products are fine. We\u2019ve have a couple of commercial partners that haven\u2019t frankly delivered what they said they would do and so it was taking a little longer for us to ramp up some of those new product launches. So this is an -- I\u2019m confident and we\u2019ve got a good team and good products, but we\u2019re going to be very disciplined about how we move that forward.","George Staphos - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Okay, thanks for that. And maybe lastly in 30 seconds, why should we be comfortable that the transitional manufacturing cost issues in PSM are now behind in Europe? Thanks and good luck in the quarter.","Dean Scarborough","Yes, mainly George, I was just there again last week and we\u2019re now hitting the metrics that we need to drive down the backlog, to improve our inventory and service levels to customers. So through the first three weeks of October anyway we\u2019re making the progress that we, that the team is committed to so. And I\u2019m pretty confident that we\u2019ll get everything squared away by year end.","Operator","And with that, Mr. Scarborough, I\u2019ll return the call back to you for your closing remarks.","Dean Scarborough","Yes, thank you France. Just a quickly recap, our playbook hasn\u2019t changed. We\u2019re continuing to pursue the broad strategic priorities that we\u2019ve communicated in the past fine tuning were appropriate and tightening up the execution of our commercial and operational initiatives.","I know Mitch will continue to be an outstanding partner in driving our value creation agenda and I look forward to working with him and the rest of the organization to achieve our strategic vision and financial goals. Thank you, and we\u2019ll talk to you all in the New Year.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you all of your participation today.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Eric Leeds, Avery Dennison's Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Eric Leeds","Thank you. Welcome, everyone. Today, we'll discuss our preliminary unaudited fourth quarter and full year 2014 results. Please note that unless otherwise indicated, today's discussion will be focused on our continuing operations. The non-GAAP measures that we use are defined, qualified and reconciled with GAAP on schedules A-2 to A-5 of the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release.","We remind you that we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. These forward-looking statements are made subject to the Safe Harbor statement included in today's earnings release.","On the call today are Dean Scarborough, Chairman and CEO; and Mitch Butier, President, COO and CFO.","I will now turn the call over to Dean.","Dean Scarborough","Thanks, Eric. And good day, everyone. 2014 represented another year of solid progress toward our strategic and long-term financial goal. We delivered 3% growth in organic sales and 16% growth in adjusted earnings per share while boosting return on capital by nearly 3 points. We maintained our strong capital discipline, returning over $480 million to investors through dividends and share repurchase. We raised the dividend by 21% in 2014 and repurchased 7.4 million shares. Free cash flow came in below our original expectations for the year due largely to the combined effects of currency and actions we took to reduce the volatility associated with year-end changes in working capital level. Going forward, we expect to see return to our consistent pattern of delivering solid free cash flow.","We remain highly confident in our strategy and in our ability to achieve the long-term financial goals we communicated last May. We will grow through innovation and differentiated quality and service. Our significant exposure to faster growing emerging markets, global share gain opportunities in performance tapes and graphics, and our leadership position in RFID will continue to be key catalysts of long-term growth for the company. We will further expand margins through productivity and leveraging our global scale that reflected in the increase to 2014 and 2015 restructuring investments.","We will continue to optimize our use of capital in terms of both investment strategy and our disciplined approach to shareholder distribution. Any long-term strategy requires some mid course correction and we are in the process of executing some of those now. We are strengthening the long-term competitive positions of all of our segments including actions to adapt through recent challenges in RBIS. What continues to guide our actions is our commitment to achieving our long-term financial objectives, which we set with the view to delivering above average returns for our shareholders. In this regard, 2015 represents an important milestone for us as the final year of measurement for the full year financial targets we first communicated in 2012. ","I am very pleased to report that we are well on track to meeting those objectives. We included our scorecard in the supplemental materials we distributed earlier this morning. Without walking you through all the metrics, I'll just highlight that anticipated compound annual growth and adjusted EPS over this four-year period is expected to be roughly 20%. Last year, we established aggressive new five year targets through 2018 and we are already making progress towards achieving them. We\u2019ve had a slow start on the organic growth front, but are taking actions to strengthen our competitive position in all of our key market segments to ensure that we stay on track for both mid-teens compound annual growth in adjusted EPS as well as the four plus point improvement in return on total capital by 2018. Achievement of these goals will deliver strong growth in EVA for both of our core businesses and of course for the company overall.","So let me just touch briefly on our three businesses. Pressure-sensitive Materials delivered its third consecutive year of strong volume growth, while maintaining its profitability and high return on capital. This is a great business, but we believe it can be even better. I am really pleased to see our already high performance team demonstrating a heightened sense of urgency. The team has made good progress addressing the product mix challenges we faced last year and in the first half of 2014, by accelerating growth in high return segments.","We are continuing to invest in growth while reducing fixed cost to ensure we can win and grown in all key market segments. I know everyone is keenly focused on the raw material outlook for PSM. Now, recall that over the long run, material input costs and pricing rise and fall together in this business, albeit with some lag. It's very difficult to predict the overall impact to the full year. Though, while we may see some short-term benefits, the cost outlook for the second half is highly uncertain, as is the timing of any pass through. Retail branding and information solutions faced top line growth challenges this year, reflecting share loss in the value and contemporary segments of the market, offset by solid growth in RFID and the performance segment.","To address the recent top line challenges, we are focusing our sales efforts to recapture share while reducing fixed costs and aligning resources to better serve all segments of the market. We're expecting improvement in our growth trajectory by mid-year and to resume our strong pace for margin expansion. We continue to see significant opportunities for top line growth. RFID remained a key growth catalyst. Unfortunately, the sales trajectory can be somewhat choppy in this relatively early adoption phase for the industry as evidenced by a year-on-year decline for RFID sales in the fourth quarter. With the few customers driving a significant share of our total volume today, we do expect some continued volatility, but our customers remain fully committed to the technology and our partnership. And we are seeing quite a bit of new interest in pilots and rollouts and we continue to expect RFID to grow 15% to 20% through 2018. As far as the core market is concerned, I'm confident in the team's ability to adapt to recent challenges. Underlying demand for apparel hasn't changed. And our value proposition for the performance and premium segments of the market remains strong. Admittedly, we were not as focused as we should have been on meeting the needs of the value and contemporary segment, but we know what we have to do here and we have the will and the proven capability to get it done.","Finally, Vancive, our small but high potential medical products business delivered 8% organic growth for the year at the high end of our long-term target. We expect to significantly reduce the operating loss of this business in 2015, and are still investing here ahead of growth. We remain focused on achieving a sustainable breakeven run rate in 2015. Wrapping up, we expect this year to be a year of strong operational improvement for the company. Adjusting for a roughly $0.25 hit from currency translation, our EPS guidance reflects a growth rate of about 15% at the high end of our long-term target with further expansion of our return on capital and the continued commitment to returning cash to shareholders. ","Now I'll turn the call over to Mitch.","Mitch Butier","Thanks, Dean. And hello, everyone. As Dean mentioned we are focused on driving profitable growth to differentiate quality, service and innovation. With a specific focus on opportunities with greater growth in margin potential such as tapes, graphics, RFID and of course emerging market. We have and will continue to invest in these key opportunities. We are adding new coding capabilities to support growth for LCM and industrial tapes in Asia. We recapitalized a graphic business as part of restructuring program in Europe and we are expanding our commercial capabilities in a number of these important market segment. ","We will also continue to improve our cost structure and maintain our capital discipline. This has been strength of ours over the years and it is something we will continue to focus on as evidenced by our increased level of restructuring savings estimated for 2015. I want to highlight that our productivity focus is not just about lowering costs and expanding margin, which are both obviously very crucial but also about becoming more competitive so we can grow profitably and better serve the less differentiated segment of our market.","This is right overall strategy but I can tell you after my first 90 days as COO that we will be making some adjustments to the execution of this strategy that I believe will make us more competitive and further improve return in both of our core businesses. Let me just touch on some of these course correction. In the near term we face three key challenges. Rebalancing the dynamics between price, volume and mix and Pressure-sensitive Materials. Expanding margin in a less differentiated segments of this business. And winning in the value and contemporary segment in RBIS. ","In terms of PSM's price volume mix balance, we've already seen some progress with product mix actually being a modest positive to EBIT in the fourth quarter, we will continue to drive for improved mixed by focusing on the higher growth and margin potential segment of the market. In terms of other few challenges, the course corrections actually share a common thing. Both PSM and RBIS are in the process of further reducing the fixed cost structures to be more competitive in the less differentiated segments of their market. As I said earlier, these aren't just short-term cost place, it is part of our long-term strategy to win in a market place, expand margin and improve return. With these refinements underway, we are confident in our ability to achieve our long-term goal. My focus here is same as it has always been to deliver exceptional value for our customers and employees and our shareholders. ","Now I'll provide some color on the quarter. In Q4, we delivered a 30% increase and adjusted earnings per share on 1% organic sales growth with modest top line growth in PSM offsetting a decline RBIS. The impact of currency translation and the extra week were significant. Currency translation reduced reported sales by 3.7% in the fourth quarter and the extra week added 4.5%. Adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter improved 70 basis points to 8.1% as the benefit of productivity initiatives and higher volume more than offset the net impact of raw material input costs and pricing. Restructuring saving in the quarter were $8 million and approximately $35 million for the year. And our adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 26% and 31% for the full year better than expected due to the benefit of tax planning in the fourth quarter. The difference in our tax rate compared to the prior year contributed about $0.07 of EPS to the year, all which came in Q4. And the extra week provided a modest benefit to EPS for the year approximately nickel per share, all of which also benefited in Q4. ","Free cash flow was $122 million in the fourth quarter and $204 million for the year. Full year free cash fell well short of our usual 100% plus conversion of net income reflecting a combination of currency effects and higher working capital. As Dean mentioned, those higher working capital levels were due in large parts to steps we took to reduce the volatility associated with yearend customer receipt and vendor payment. We've begun to see the impact of those actions in 2015 with a roughly $40 million favorable swing in cash flow in the first weeks of January. Going forward we expect to resume our pattern of delivering free cash flow above the levels of net income. ","We repurchased 7.4 million shares in 2014 at a cost of $356 million and ended the year with roughly 92.5 million shares outstanding including dilution. We remained committed to returning cash to shareholders and have sufficient capacity to continue our share buyback program in a disciplined manner. But we are not as under leveraged as we look based on the simple net debt to EBITDA calculation of 1.4 yearend. As we said in the past, this ratio serves as a simple proxy for the rating agency measure that guides our policies for maintaining a solid balance sheet and optimal long-term cost of capital. The rating agency measures included a number of adjustments to debt that are exclusive from our simple metric such as the addition of under funded pension liabilities. The change in discount rates in 2014 among other factors increased our under funded pension liability by $170 million reducing our near-term leverage capacity, but again we have sufficient capacity to continue or disciplined share buyback program. ","Looking at the segments. Pressure-sensitive Materials sales in the fourth quarter were up approximately 2% on an organic basis due in part to tough comps against the prior year. Label impacted immaterial sales were up low single digit while combined sales with performance tapes and graphic were up mid-single digits, which graphics back on track as a services use in Europe are now largely behind us. ","On a regional basis, sales in North America declined modestly due to a combination of weekend market demand as well as loss of some low margin business. Western Europe was up low single digits slower than the pace we've seen earlier in the year and emerging regions grew mid single digits with the continuation of the softer growth we saw in Q3 for Asia Pacific, continued strong growth in Latin America and a modest decline in Eastern Europe. ","PSM's adjusted operating margin of 10.6% in the fourth quarter was up 100% basis points compared to last year as the benefits from productivity and higher volumes were partially offset by the net impact of pricing and raw material input costs. Results from Retail Branding and Information Solutions were disappointing. Sales declined 5% on an organic basis and operating margin contracted as the benefit of productivity initiatives and lower cost run incentive compensation were insufficient to overcome the impact of lower volume and other factors. ","We commented during previous earnings call on the share loss we've been experiencing within the value and contemporary segments in the US. While the rate of decline lessen in the fourth quarter for these segments, demand by European based retailers and brand owners which have been relatively strong for the better part of the year slowed in Q4. A large part of the slowdown among European customers reflects lower than expected sales of RFID products. RFID revenue was down by more than 10% on an organic basis in the fourth quarter due to the choppy demand that been discussed earlier. ","Outside of RFID, as I've said, we are focused on recapturing share in less differentiated segments of the market by redirecting efforts of our sales and customer service teams who serve factories in Asia particularly in China. At the same time, we are reducing our cost structure to improve competitiveness and continue to expand margins. ","Sales in Vancive Medical Technologies grew over 30% in the fourth quarter partly reflecting a delay in order that negatively impacted the third quarter. The segment's operating loss declined to nearly breakeven due largely to volume growth. ","In 2015, we will continue to focus on a milestone needed to drive long-term growth of this platform with the objective of achieving positive contribution and earnings by yearend. ","Turning now to the outlook for 2015. All things considered, we anticipate adjusted earning per share to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.40. Now I have to admit that this is one of the more challenging years we've had to call in a while due to extreme volatility in currency exchange rate and commodities markets. Having said that, we are focused on accelerating our cost reduction initiative to position ourselves to achieve our long-term goals regardless of the macro environment. We've outlined some of the key contributing factors to this guidance on slide 9 of our supplemental presentation materials. We estimate between 3% and 4% organic sales growth which is adjusted for the loss of the extra week of sales in 2014. While we are optimistic that the commercial actions we are taking will bolster organic growth in the back half of 2015. We are cautious about the near-term outlook given the weaker volumes we saw in Q4. Certainly in RBIS but also for label and packaging materials in North America and Asia.","At current exchange rates, we estimate that currency translation will reduce net sales by approximately 6.5% and pretax earning by roughly $35 million or $0.25 a share. Combining carryover benefits from 2014 with new actions taken this year, we estimate that restructuring initiatives will contribute roughly $60 million pretax, or about $0.45 a share. ","We expect that 2015 tax rate back in the normal range. We've seen over the past few years in the low to mid 30% range. ","We estimate average shares outstanding assuming dilution of roughly 91 million shares reflecting our continued return of capital to shareholders and our outlook for free cash flow includes fixed and IP capital expenditures of approximately $175 million and cash restructuring cost of approximately $35 million. ","Importantly, our guidance for 2015 is consistent with the progress necessary to achieve our long-term financial goal. Slide 10 of the supplement materials highlight our progress against our 2012 and 2015 targets while Slide 11 shows progress against the new 2018 targets we provided this last year.","We are pleased with what we expect to accomplish through the end of 2015, a roughly 20% compound annual growth and adjusted earnings per share over four years. And ROTC well on its way to the 16% plus target we set for 2018. We are confident that we will achieve the new set of objectives we've laid out for 2018 and we will continue to adjust course as necessary to ensure we do so.","As we've said before, while we may be please, we won't be satisfied until we achieve all of our goals. ","In summary, we delivered another quarter and year of strong earnings per share growth despite a number of challenges. Our two market leading core businesses are well positioned for profitable growth which combined with our continued focus on productivity and capital discipline will enable us to expand margins and increase returns and achieve our 2015 and 2018 targets. ","Now we'll be happy to open it to questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","And first our question from the line Ghansham Panjabi, Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead, sir.","Mehul Dalia","Hi, good morning. It is actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. How are you doing? What are you expecting in terms of free cash flow for 2015? Any range that you can give us.","Mitch Butier","Just that basically a converting a thing, we are going to get more than 100% of net income and free cash flow going forward. ","Mehul Dalia","Okay, great. And with working capital [Technical Difficulty] -- lower raw material cost in 2015, is there any reason that shouldn't be the case for the year? ","Mitch Butier","I am sorry, can you repeat your question, some one kind of walked over your -- first part of your question. ","Operator","And our next question will be from the line of George Staphos, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. ","George Staphos","Hi, well, maybe out of a question of fairness. You want to put Mehul back in the queue and then I'll go next. ","Mitch Butier","We will go for Mehul after you, George. Thanks.","George Staphos","Okay, understood. Thanks and good day everybody. I guess the question I had to start was on strategy. So if we rewind the tape and correct me where I am not phrasing it correctly, in the years -- last couple of years, you have been trying to grow more aggressively potentially even in markets where there was maybe lower margin because you thought it was positive for EVA, and if we fast forward to the current time, and this isn't a shocker. You've talked about this on evolving base for last few quarters, it sounds like you need to further reduce cost to be able to grow in some of the markets that you would like to grow into. So the question is did you initially as an enterprise misgauge your cost competitiveness versus peers and some of these markets that you wanted to grow at? And if that's the case, how do you know that you\u2019ve still got the correct bead now on where your cost position needs to be going forward? ","Dean Scarborough ","George, this is Dean. That's a good question. In PSM specifically, our strategy has been pretty much the same in terms of growing in the higher return segments, so that's graphics, performance tapes, our specialty products, et cetera. I think where we\u2019ve got a little bit out of balance was in some of the more paper based segments especially in Asia, what was clear that we had room to grow on a positive EVA basis last year and we just overshot the mark. I think the teams were a little too aggressive, and the mix started to deteriorate somewhat and we didn't need to do it. And then, the course correction has actually helped us, and you can see the numbers certainly in the fourth quarter I think are a good indication of that. That being said, I think now with new management in materials, we're just taking another look and saying we wanted to be even more competitive in those segments, are there things we can do to tweak the strategy and accelerate our growth a little bit more. So some of that is around innovation in some of those lower margin segments, it\u2019s material cost out, and it is also a reflection of our cost to survey, since I think we have a more precise view on what it takes to compete in those segments. So we are going to continue to grow our share in those segments, and we are confident that we can hit our 2018 goals for growth as well as deliver the margin targets that we had for PSM in 2018.","George Staphos","Okay. I guess two questions, and then I'll go back in queue. If we think about RFID, everything that we've heard from the company and our contacts over the last couple of years, the price points have become even more competitive for somebody wanting to explore RFID making payback period even much more attractive to a retailer looking to roll this out, recognizing that it is very lumpy, it is driven by a couple of customers at a time, why do you think rollout for RFID has maybe slowed a bit despite what you would advertise as a really good return to your customers if they adopt this? So that\u2019d be question number one. And then on the restructuring and other savings that you expect for this year, I think you said $60 million. Correct me if I am wrong, I thought the last goal on that was $35 million, so an incremental amount here. Where are you finding, where should we find if we had visibility into this -- those incremental savings would come from? Thanks. I'll jump back in.","Dean Scarborough ","Okay, George, I'll handle the first question on RFID. I\u2019d liken RFID to EAS, Electronics Article Security which also has a good payback for retailers and I would say it took probably 25 years for it to become 80% penetrated in the retail market. The fact is that retailers, because of the complexity of the number of stores they have, because of the opportunities they have to invest in a lot of different things, the technology investments by retailers simply take a long time to roll out. So, as I look at RFID, I think that's reflective of why we think this business which is nicely profitable for us will continue to grow at a nice rate. In the fourth quarter, we had a large customer who is big in RFID that expanded the number of items that they had in their stores last year. And then this year, reduced their inventory say probably weren\u2019t as competitive as they wanted to be in the market place. Interestingly enough, they didn't cut back on the percentage of items that are tagged with RFID, but they said they\u2019ll lower their inventories and that did have an impact on us. I will say that at the National Retail Federation show early in January, we probably heard more excitement, enthusiasm by US and Asian retailers than we've ever seen before. So we remain highly confident that this product line is going to continue expand.","Mitch Butier","Yes. Just I guess the only thing to add on that Dean said earlier demand has been choppy over the years. And this decline isn't similar to the decline we had a couple of years ago when one major retailer was pulling back. There is nobody really pulling back from what we are seeing. It's just because it's concentrated with relatively few number of retailers it will be choppy for a while as they roll out their programs. So as far as restructuring you are asking did the number increase. So we have basically accelerating restructuring initiatives for going forward, for all the regions we've laid out and $60 million of the anticipated levels of savings for what we are planning on right now. And roughly half of that is carryover from actions that we implemented in 2015, and the rest of it is from new actions as well, which will obviously have a carryover benefit going into 2016 as well.","Operator","And our next question will be from the line of Ghansham Panjabi. Please go ahead. ","Mehul Dalia","Hi, it's actually Mehul still. Thanks for getting me back in. My second question is also free cash flow related. Working capital, it seems like it should benefit from the timing of tender payment and also lower raw materials cost. Is there any reason not to assume that?","Mitch Butier","Well, free cash flow will benefit from the timing of payment and the yearend of timing that we talked through earlier. And that had about -- we estimated about $40 million swing which is how much free cash flow we saw in the first few weeks of the year improved in 2015. As far as the lower raw material costs, yes, that will have lower inventory but it will also have lower payable so it is really the question of how much sticks through on the bottom line which we commented on pretty hard to predict overall and over the long run as been commented earlier. Raw material and our end pricing end up matching up over the long run.","Mehul Dalia","[Multiple Speakers] Okay, great. And just one last one. How much do you think working capital -- the working capital initiative that you talked about in 2014, how much do you think that cost it you free cash flow for 2014?","Mitch Butier","How much it cost us for 2015?","Mehul Dalia","2014, so then working capital initiatives that you talked about just trying to see what normalized free cash flow in 2014 would have been without that initiative?","Mitch Butier","So impact is about $40 million.","Mehul Dalia","$40 million. Right, great, thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Gaffner from Barclays Capital. You may proceed.","Scott Gaffner","Good morning. Dean in your -- I am sorry, Mitch in your commentary on the guidance, you mentioned that was one of the more challenging years to call and sometime-- so I was just wondering if you could walk us through maybe the level of conservatism you baked into the guidance, how you thought about it as you are coming into the year, did you approach it in any different way than you have in the past? Thanks.","Mitch Butier","Sure. We approached a little bit different because you can see that our guidance range is narrower than we've given at this time of the year which implies more certainty when actually that's not what we are trying to communicate here. So reason why it was more challenging is just as you saw what was going on with the currency exchange rates between December and January. The euro was just in free fall for a while and so that's one of the things that made it more difficult as we were going through just a month of January continue to update our outlook on that. And then two is just the full impact of raw material deflation that we are seeing. And how long if is there any gap, how long that it can hold down to and so forth. So that's what made it more challenging if you will. The other key question is on the top line. So we got 3% to 4% organic growth picked in, we said things slowdown as you heard in Q4 for RBIS as well as we had in North America for the materials business some declines. So that obviously impacts our thinking as well. We expect growth to come back and it's going to be little bit more second half weighted on the top line perspective given our starting point.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. Would you say it slightly more conservative than usual or how would you feel about that? ","Mitch Butier","No. I think over the last few years we've actually called it pretty well as far as setting guidance overall. And if you look at where we started off with the guidance at the beginning of this year, it was at $3.05, we ended up at $3.11 and that was largely due to the lower tax rate, a lot of factors going back and forth. And what we are trying to say is we've got the high ended numbers things up to go for us and at the low ended numbers things go against us, but we've got also some counter measures that go against those as well. So now I'd say it is pretty consistent with our methodology. It is definitely not more conservative. ","Scott Gaffner","Okay. I think going back to George's question on the restructuring actions or the incremental savings of $60 million. When I look back at last year, the cash restructuring costs that you guided to was about $55 million, the cash restructuring this year 2015, looks like it is going down to $35 million and yet the restructuring savings are increasing. Can you kind of walk us through how that is flowing through? ","Mitch Butier","Yes. The biggest reason just has to do with the large restructuring we did of our graphics business in Europe. Europe restructurings tend to be more costly relative to the payback and lots of those costs were incurred in 2014. Some of will still be in 2015. So that's a little bit the reason for the disconnect. ","Scott Gaffner","Well, last question on working capital 2014. You talked about these working capital initiatives to reduce volatility, so it sounds like you actually took some sort of corrective action whether that was securitizing some of your receivables or something along those actions. Can you talk a little bit more about what the initiatives were that you took that cause a working capital changes? ","Mitch Butier","It was just operational measures nothing securitization or anything else specifically being done. So we had seen -- if you recall last year and the year before we had seen significant free cash flow in Q4 and then large declines in Q1 and we were down over $150 million of Q1 of 2014 negative cash flow. And what we saw that there was -- from a number of terms and so forth that we had set up that there was just more cash being pulled into the previous year and we've commented on that at the end of 2013 that was look like $30 million had been pulled into 2013 and we basically took some actions to make sure that wasn't happening. And we have free cash flow measures across the business and it looks there was just more cash getting pulled into Q4 at the detriment to Q1 and we wanted to normalize that. ","Dean Scarborough ","This is Dean. Just one more comment on the guidance and that is the other thing that's in our mind is how do we predict things like currency or raw material inputs for the back half of the year. And I think given the volatility that we saw in the first -- just recently, we are basically pegging our guidance based on the current rate for the euro. And lots of the commodities that we buy are forecasting cost increases for the back half of the year. Now whether or not you choose to believe that I mean it just makes a difficult because we just don't have that greater forward visibility. So I think we've been fairly conservative in the sense that we are kind of taking today's stake and clearly if things change, if the euro does something much different or raw material prices do something much different, I think from an investor point of view, you have to realize will be agile and will shift as need be.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Good morning, all. I was just wondering either Dean or Mitch, when you talk about raw materials and pricing, are you expecting to give back all of the benefit on the raw material side that you maybe expecting -- that you may get? Or there some of your operations where you can actually hang on to some? ","Dean Scarborough ","Rosemarie, typically what happens over the cycle is that pricing levels on our industry tend to track over time when raw material prices are up -- across are up, prices go up when raw material cost go down, prices tend to trend down over time. And there is always lag time in the business and there are a lot of others obviously strategies that go in, in terms of pricing and cost out. So we are constantly looking for ways to thin our materials, get more productivity in our operation et cetera, et cetera. So it is actually very difficult I think for us to predict and project exactly what that looks like especially over a 12 months period.","Mitch Butier","And the only thing I would add is we've talked over the last couple of years about net headwind if you will price and raw material cost. Paper prices have gone up from where they were a couple of years ago and that's over half of our spend as paper based in sourcing, the drop in oil as everybody is focused on -- and we buy a number of raw material inputs that are based on oil but not highly linked to it. So we are seeing a little bit deflation right now. But we've actually been seeing a headwind on the net price and our objective here what you see in the guidance is to stem that tide if you will.","Rosemarie Morbelli","And just making sure I understood properly what Dean said in answer to a previous well actually additional comments, did you say that there is talk about raw material cost increases in the second half and if I understood that properly then you probably should be able to have more of a tailwind know for the short term?","Dean Scarborough ","Yes. The IHS forecast that we look at for again some of the either derivatives or close to the commodities that we buy. If they go up in the back half we would expect to see a short term benefit and then in the second half we could expect a bit of headwinds. So again I would say those forecasts are just they are forecast. We don't really know what's going to happen in the back half of the year. And we will adjust our pricing and our approach as we changes in the raw material market. ","Rosemarie Morbelli","Okay, sure. So now still on the cost side but not sure necessarily but because gasoline prices I mean fuel prices are down while I guess that's the same as gasoline. Consumers are ending up with more money. Are you expecting or are you seeing sign or hearing anything about retailers actually getting ready for that which would be a net benefit on your RBIS and RFID possibly?","Dean Scarborough ","Well, I think RFID is not so much impacted by that. I do think that the hope is that consumers with more money in their pockets will buy more things. I think I read out just recently though that many consumers are just saving the money and putting in their pocket right now so I would say our forecast doesn't really consider a broad increase in end demand our market.","Mitch Butier","Yes. I think it's important to think about these -- the different dynamics regionally as well. So in Europe things are different obviously with what's going on there and where the currency is moving. There is not actually as much deflation as we would be seeing here in the US. And when you look at despite the economy having grown in the US, end consumption on the unit level of consumer package goods and so forth have been relatively flat. So would expect there is going to be an improvement here in the US, given -- if things continue where they are, sometime over 2015. But by and large we are not expecting a large broad pickup.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Okay, thanks. And if I may ask one last question. In your assumptions, in your guidance on the top line, do you already -- have you included the impacts from FX and then on the bottom line, have you included the potential impact from lower share count and is that 7.4 million share buyback should get in 2014, could you duplicate that in 2015?","Mitch Butier","So as far as the top line, our guidance is based on organic growth, the 4% that we've laid out there. So and as far as the share buyback, the implied amount of shares outstanding on average that we have for 2015 at $91 million is still more than $1.5 million to $2 million of dilution. It implies a level lower than what we did in 2014. We really stepped up our share buybacks in the third and fourth quarter given where the stock price was. And so this is just an estimate but really one of the biggest factors that dictate the level of share buyback is really how the stock is trading. And we look to opportunistically take advantage of market dislocation. So that is our estimate, but as we proven this past year, we estimated beginning of year we thought we'd have 97 million shares outstanding on average, we ended up with less than 96 million. And so we'll continue to monitor and adjust accordingly.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Jeff Zekauskas","Hi. Thanks very much. Can you speak to the utilization rate and PSM industry wide meaning I guess in the United States and Europe currently. Are we in the 70, low high 70s or low 80s or high 80s? Where do we set?","Mitch Butier","Well, I think it's a very difficult number to put your finger on as we said before; you don't have to run your coding lines 24x7, 365. You're not like paper machine and some of these assets run different product lines. I think the way I look at it is in Europe, there's not been a lot of additional capacity added over the last few years if anything describing a little bit of take out. In the US, we do have a competitor, small, privately held competitor that is adding capacity what I think as we said before. My guess is that they will not utilize some of their other lower productive capacity as we go forward. So people are expanding capacity in Asia as you might expect given decent growth there including ourselves, but I don't see fundamentally any big disruptions to the marketplace from capacity adds or reductions anywhere in the world. It's not a big task in our thinking.","Jeff Zekauskas","So I think this year if I remember previous calls correctly, volume growth in North America and pressure sensitivities of \u2013 it's maybe flat or flat to up for the four quarters. And that's a slower rate of growth than GDP. And in the old days Pressure - sensitive Materials used to be sort of a GDP grower or GDP plus. Is it fair to say that the industry now is GDP minus or was there something peculiar about 2014? And are utilization rates in general tight or snug or are they loose?","Mitch Butier","Well, I think it is certainly we've been disappointed by the market growth in North America, I think its too early to make a call to say it's a GDP minus business because we've had over the average if you look over a multiyear period, it is probably around a GDP business in North America and when you juxtapose that with Europe actually, we've definitely GDP plus business over the past couple of years. So all I know I think in mature markets I look at the GDP business and then the business grows at a multiple of GDP in emerging markets, we don't really see a change to that trajectory. I think as I said before in North America have a little bit of a net increase to capacity this year, again we had a small competitor add capacity. And in Europe, I don't think there have been any real big changes. I know one of our competitors bought a company and ended up shutting down the factory. So I guess technically that would be a net reduction. So it is a very difficult thing to get any kind of precision on, Jeff.","Jeff Zekauskas","So going into 2015, do you feel that demand conditions -- in PSM are strengthening or weakening? And with raw materials coming down, is it the case that your customers are maybe delaying purchases helping to get better price realization, so little bit later in the year. So how do you see the demand trajectory in PSM over the coming couple of quarters?","Dean Scarborough ","It's a great question. We definitely saw a slowdown in the fourth quarter in terms of organic growth. Customers don't try to either build inventories or reduce inventories in anticipation of raw material pricing mainly because most of them are small. They don't have a lot of place to store inventory. It tends to be a very customized business where they have to respond quickly to the customers, so most customers are reluctant to that, that their customer is going to actually order something. So we try not to see those kinds of -- those kinds of shift. Definitely, we saw Europe slowdown in the fourth quarter, we had been \u2013 I been anticipating that for two years and it's finally happened, so it had actually -- had much better buying demand in Europe over the past couple of years than I would have expected. North America continues to be relatively soft; we did see growth in the third quarter in the market. We haven't seen the fourth quarter numbers yet. It was interesting to hear that fourth quarter GDP wasn't as strong as everyone expected. So I think overall this year we're kind of expecting maybe a little smaller growth than normal. And you can see it reflected in our guidance range for organic growth for the year.","Jeff Zekauskas","So in the quarter I think you said that PSM prices maybe edged to down. And if that's true why did they edge down or what was the source of the pricing pressure?","Mitch Butier","Well this is a theme we've been talking about for a number of quarters now. Jeff. And so big, good portion of that was actually carryover to the comments where year-over-year price impacts, but it's basically just looking to net impact and some of the less differentiated categories, there has been more pricing pressure and one of the thing we're looking to focus on is to make sure our pricing strategy ensure we have the right, long-term profitable growth to remain competitive and continue to invest over the long run. So that's a key area of focus right now.","Jeff Zekauskas","And then lastly, how much was your pension funding in 2014 and what you expect it to be in 2015?","Mitch Butier","So it's over $400 million about $430 million of under-funded pension liability across all of our plans, the biggest one obviously being in the US, but we have a number of overseas plans. So that's the large adjustment just from the discount rates and everything else. So and it's not considered, it's expected to change that much between the end of 2015.","Jeff Zekauskas","Right but when you funded it, in other words your pension contribution in 2014, what was that and what might it be in 2015?","Mitch Butier","So we did not have pension funding requirements in the US, it was nothing in 2014 and we don't have another pension funding requirement for the next couple of years in the US","Operator","Our next question from the line of Chris Kapsch from Topeka Capital Markets. You may proceed.","Chris Kapsch","Yes. I had a follow-up on the FX headwind for 2015, just wondering if that, how much of that is Europe, it sounds like a lot of it. And then just on FX, are there any instances where the changing currency rates have actually changed the competitiveness of your local businesses overseas or is this truly just a translation issue?","Mitch Butier","This is by and large translation, I mean us as well as our competitors manufacture the products in the regions where we did business. So this is essentially all translation and it was essentially all Europe. Now one of the things in the past that tailwind that we've had was the fact that Renminbi was appreciating over the years that did not happen in 2014. So we lost that tailwind and then had the new headwind of FX in our second half that going into this year as well and will continue. And other thing is just to give rough rule of thumb for the Euro is very simple on high level but for every cent movement in the euro to the U.S. dollar would basically have a penny movement on EPS as well. So cent equals a cent, roughly.","Chris Kapsch","Okay, and then just to follow up in pressure sensitive, the margin improvement year-over-year in the quarter 100 basis points. Just wondering was that fairly consistent across the regions or where was the improvement most pronounced?","Mitch Butier","Improvement was pretty broad-based, but we thought Latin America a little bit more than we saw elsewhere, but we've seen it in Europe and Asia as well. So we've seen it pretty broad-based, I'd say North America was the place that we saw the least amount of overall improvement, if you look at this pure operational standpoint, which lower volume environment makes that challenging of course.","Chris Kapsch","And then just on that lower volume that you saw in --a lower demand you saw in North America, was that -- and I know you haven't got any industry data yet, but your sense at this point. Was that more market driven or was it intentional, intentionally rationalizing some of your lower margin, maybe your paper-based roll stock grades, or was it just a competitor sort of taking share? If you could just provide a little bit more color on why the demand being down?","Mitch Butier","Yes. So we don't have the data right now as you highlighted, so we don't know is the short answer. But we think that a big chunk of it was just the market continued to be rather anemic, but there was a couple of specific opportunities that were extremely low margin, that we let walk, if you will. They were extremely low, variable margin. So that the impact. I will say things can be choppy in this industry, given where we are in the overall value chain. Earnings as top line growth in the first few weeks of this year in North America have actually picked up, whereas all the other regions, the trends basically continued with what we saw in Q4. So things picked up a little bit in North America, so whether that's end demand or just broad inventory movements throughout the entire value chain and so forth, it's hard to predict.","Chris Kapsch","I see, and then I had also a follow-up on the RBIS business and this issue was having lost share in the value and the contemporary segment. I think Dean had talked about when we were out there visiting, and possibly when he was in New York late last year, about one of the tactical things that might address this was focusing on conveying to the customers that they should -- in that particular value and contemporary segment, that they should shift more towards nominated tags and ticketing program versus open. And I think there were some initial successes with the big customer there. I'm just wondering is that something that you still sees as a way to recapture share in that segment and how is that going?","Dean Scarborough ","Well I mean that is part of our strategy, which is to convince our customers to use nominated programs, because we at the end of the day believe that they will get the best economics there. Now, not every customer chooses to go with that strategy. And frankly, the mistake we made was not listening to customers who work in those programs and deciding to be competitive. Now we changed the strategy in the fourth quarter, and I would say the decline, the amount of decline was arrested. Unfortunately, the business in Europe slowed down, certainly the trend of the business look worse. I think from my perspective, the team is -- we're doing a lot better job listening to customers. And we're getting a lot more competitive in winning the battles in Asia. Fortunately for us, in some of those types of programs, customers don't insist on using sort of global raw materials back. So the opportunity is local materials which are lower cost, so we still believe we can be competitive in that business. We have in the past and frankly I think we just lost our focus, so we are taking additional actions though as Mitch talked about to ensure that we're more competitive in those segments. And that's part of the acceleration in our restructuring, because frankly, we're really disappointed about our performance in RBIS for the year, and we don't have a good excuse for it frankly. So we're going to be more competitive, we likely won't see a huge change in trajectory really until the second quarter when we have a seasonally strong quarter. But the team is focused, we've got a renewed sense of energy there, we've got more aggressive sales programs as well as a focus on further reducing costs and our material costs in that portion of the market. So we feel we had a better performance last year again, but we're focused on delivering in 2015.","Mitch Butier","I think one of the key overall things is we're looking to provide a value proposition that's fit for purpose for each segment and each customer values overall. And most of the market wants a global consistency of products and so forth, others are less concerned about, and so we need to adjust accordingly. And I'd say it's too broad-based, we've been talking about the value in contemporary segments, you actually can't make comments about each segment broad-based of what the customer behaviors are. Each customer is in a different level of cycle and has some different needs, and so we're basically adjusting our approach to be able to win success with those customers in those spaces.","Operator","Our next question from the line of John McNulty with Credit Suisse, please go ahead.","Rob","Good morning guys, this is Rob batting for John. Just a quick one on your 2015 targets. On your most recent Investor Day, you highlighted that you guys think you can hit the low end of your RBIS, adjusted EBIT margin range that you put out in 2012. Is that so realistic given some of the recent challenges in that business? Thanks.","Dean Scarborough ","I think hitting to the 2015 margin target given the end of the year is going to be extremely difficult. We'll make good progress, we'll get back on -- our goal is to get back on track in the weight of performance improvements that we've shown in the previous two years. And we're still focused on delivering the 2018 target.","Mitch Butier","All targets we laid out for 2015, we're confident we're going to basically hit all of them with the exception of RBIS margin target. But we consider we've got a few years ahead of us, and some of the adjustments we're making are confident we'll hit the 2018 margin targets.","Operator","And we'll proceed with our last question from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Anthony Pettinari ","Good morning. Just had a couple of follow-ups on, I just had a couple of follow-ups on RBIS. I guess first if you strip out the value in contemporary segments, would you describe your market share outside of those categories as stable or growing or are you seeing any incremental pressure? If you were to look at in faster premium or performance segments. And the second question, do you have a sense of what overall apparel industry volumes grew at in 2014 versus your organic growth in RBIS?","Dean Scarborough ","Yeah so in the performance and the premium segments I would say we're taking market share, there our strategies of global consistency, of innovation, really good focused sales efforts are helping us win business. I mean that's the good news in the story. And we're quite pleased about that as well as RFID. We have more than 50% market share in that category and I think it reflects a successful execution of our strategy there. Actually apparel unit growth importing into the US was pretty -- was quite robust this year","Mitch Butier","Low to middle single digit.","Dean Scarborough ","Low to mid single digit, so the disappointing part for me is that we should have had a terrific year because the market is there. And that's the real good news there is that market demand for apparel in the imports for actually for both Europe and North America was quite robust. And so it's really up to us to tweak our strategy and get more competitive. And I actually expect that trend to continue.","The trend of market growth for apparel I should say to be clearer.","Anthony Pettinari ","Okay. That's helpful and then just one last follow-up on the $60 million cost savings. Apologies if I missed this earlier, but do you have a sense of the timing of the realization of those cost savings as we move through the year?","Mitch Butier","They will be coming throughout the year, more weighted towards the last three quarters.","Operator","Mr. Scarborough, I'll be turning the call back to you. Sir, so you may continue with your presentation or closing remarks.","Dean Scarborough","Thanks, Frank. Just a quick recap. Our playbook is the same. We're continuing to pursue the broad strategic priorities that we've communicated in the past. And we're making some fine tuning right now where appropriate. And we look forward to seeing that strategy and execution translate into superior total shareholder return over the long term.

Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Cindy Guenther, Avery Dennison's Vice President of Investor Relations and Finance. Please go ahead, madam.","Cynthia S. Guenther - Avery Dennison Corp.","Thank you, Dimitra. Today, we'll discuss our preliminary unaudited first quarter results. Please note that throughout today's discussion, we'll be making references to non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP measures that we use are defined, qualified, and reconciled with GAAP on Schedules A-4 to A-7 of the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release.","Please also note that we have adopted the new pension accounting requirements under ASU 2017-07, applying the rules retrospectively to facilitate comparisons. These changes in presentation do not impact net income or earnings per share, but they do have a modest favorable impact on operating margins for the total company and our business segments generally in the 20-basis-point to 30-basis-point range. You can find reconciliations of historical results reflecting the impact of this accounting change at the Investor section of our website.","We remind you that during this call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. These forward-looking statements are made subject to the Safe Harbor statement included in today's earnings release.","On the call today are Mitch Butier, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Lovins, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Mitch.","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Thanks, Cindy; and good day, everyone. We're off to a good start for the year. Sales grew 7% on a constant currency basis, adjusted operating margin expanded by 30 basis points, and adjusted EPS grew 30%, with all three of our operating segments meeting our expectations.","Label and Graphic Materials delivered another quarter of solid growth with sales up roughly 3.5% organically. High value categories in emerging markets continued to deliver above average growth, and the price increases we implemented over the last few months are largely sticking. As expected, overall volume growth was a bit slower than usual due to the timing factors that we discussed previously, and we are already seeing a pickup here in the second quarter. Operating margins remained strong in Q1 for LGM, once again demonstrating the resilience of this business, given the inflationary pressures that we've been facing.","To ensure continued high returns for LGM and further improve our competitiveness, we recently approved a large multi-year restructuring plan tied to the consolidation of our footprint in Europe. Leveraging the added capacity and capabilities from both our Luxembourg expansion as well as the acquired Mactac plant, this restructuring will further enhance our competitive position in the region. The plan includes a series of actions including the shut down or movement of several coating assets, as well as the closure of a plant in Schwelm, Germany. When complete, the project is expected to yield $25 million of annualized savings beginning in 2020.","Retail Branding and Information Solutions delivered another strong quarter, with solid top line growth and significant margin expansion driven by the execution of our transformation strategy and continued strength in RFID. RFID grew more than 20% in the quarter as the markets for these products continued to build momentum. We're seeing increased engagement among apparel retailers and brands across all stages of the pipeline as well as promising early stage developments in other end markets. We continue to increase our pace of investment in both business development and capacity expansion to further strengthen our position here.","Excluding RFID, sales for the base apparel business were up modestly, reflecting demand in underlying apparel markets and the timing of holidays. The relatively low growth of apparel markets in the developed regions over the past few years reinforces our laser focus on productivity improvement in RBIS, while we continue to target share gains through product innovation and superior service and quality. Overall, we're pleased with the progress we've made in the business since the start of the transformation and expect to deliver another year of solid growth and margin expansion.","In the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment, we met our expectations for the quarter in terms of both the top and bottom lines, and the team is making good progress integrating last year's acquisitions. Operating margin declined significantly due to the impact of acquisitions and investment spending. Now while this is in line with our expectations for the quarter, we're obviously not where we want to be on this front. We're however ramping up our productivity initiatives and expect to see meaningful sequential margin improvement here in the second quarter. We remain confident that we will achieve our growth and margin targets for this business over the longer term.","All-in-all, another good quarter. Our strategic playbook continues to work for us as we focus on our four overarching priorities: driving outsized growth in high-value product categories; growing profitably in our base businesses; relentlessly pursuing productivity improvement; and remaining disciplined in our approach to capital management. By consistently executing this playbook, we are positioning the company for superior value creation over the long-term, including our plan to deliver our seventh consecutive year of strong top line growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth here in 2018.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Greg.","Gregory S. Lovins - Avery Dennison Corp.","Thanks, Mitch, and hello, everybody. As Mitch mentioned, we delivered a very solid start to the year. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.44, up 30% compared to prior year, which was about a $0.05 above our expectations, to equally to better operational performance and the benefit of currency translation. We grew sales by 6.8%, excluding currency, split roughly evenly between organic growth and the benefit of acquisitions. And currency translation added 6.2% to reported sales growth in the quarter, with an $0.11 benefit to EPS compared to the same period last year. Adjusted operating margin increased by 30 basis points to 10.6%, as the benefits from productivity and higher volume more than offset higher employee related costs and the impact of increased investment spending.","Productivity gains this quarter included approximately $11 million of net restructuring savings, most of which benefited RBIS. And free cash flow was negative $20 million in the quarter, roughly comparable to prior year. And recall that free cash flow is typically negative in the first quarter due to seasonality. And in the quarter, we repurchased nearly 450,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $52 million and we paid $40 million in dividends. Net of dilution, our share count declined by approximately 200,000 shares compared to the year-end 2017.","So turning now to the segment results for the quarter. Label and Graphic Materials sales were up 4% excluding currency, reflecting about a 0.5 point benefit from the acquisition of Hanita in March of last year. Organic sales growth of roughly 3.5% reflected modestly above average growth for high-value product lines and solid growth for the base business.","The results for high-value categories were driven by continued strong growth of specialty and durable label materials and low-single digit growth for the combined Graphics and Reflective product lines. Sales for Graphics and Reflective came in a bit below expectations, which appears to largely be timing-related as we've seen a pickup early in the second quarter. And recall that we had estimated our organic growth for total LGM in the fourth quarter of last year benefited by about a 0.5 point from customers pre-buying in advance of price increases that we had announced for January. This fact, combined with other timing related factors that benefited Q1 of last year, created a total growth headwind of roughly 1 point for LGM in the quarter.","And breaking down LGM's organic growth in the quarter by region, North America and Western Europe were both up low to mid-single digits. And growth in emerging markets was mid-single digits, with continued strong growth in South Asia and mid-single digit growth in China. And operating margin for the segment remained strong, up 20 basis points on an adjusted basis to 13%, as the benefits from increased volume and productivity more than offset higher employee-related cost and a modest net negative impact from pricing and raw material cost.","The impact of raw material inflation was in line with our expectations for the quarter. And while we expect some modest sequential inflation in the second quarter, we expect we'll continue to mitigate this through pricing and product reengineering.","So shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions, RBS (sic) [RBIS] delivered another excellent quarter. As Mitch indicated, the team continues to execute extremely well on its business model transformation, enabling market share gains while driving significant margin expansion. RBS (sic) [RBIS] sales were up 3% organically driven by RFID, which grew by more than 20%, and partially offset by a headwind from the timing of holidays that impacted base business growth.","Adjusted operating margin for this segment expanded by 170 basis points to 10.2%, driven by the benefits of productivity and higher volume, as well as the reduction in intangibles amortization. These benefits were partially offset by higher employee-related cost and the impact of higher investment spending. With our adjusted margin above 10% for the seasonally softest quarter, we remain confident it will be solidly within our long-term target of 10% to 12% for the full year.","And finally turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segments, with the benefit of the Yongle and Finesse Medical acquisitions, sales rose 42%, excluding currency, while sales growth on an organic basis was 3%, reflecting above average growth in Industrial categories, partially offset by relatively flat sales in Healthcare-related categories. And within Healthcare, sales in our Vancive Medical business, growth remained strong.","Adjusted operating margin declined by 430 basis points, driven largely by the impact of acquisitions and other investment spending. And as we've discussed, over the coming years, we expect to see operating margin for this segment gradually expand to LGM's level or better, achieving our long-term targets for the business by 2021.","So turning now to our revised outlook for 2018, we have raised our expectations for adjusted earnings per share and are now targeting to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.05. At the same time, we've increased our estimate for after tax restructuring cost to reflect the new LGM restructuring in Europe that Mitch described, which results in a reduction to our outlook for reported EPS.","And we've outlined some other key contributing factors to our guidance on slide 9 of our Supplemental Presentation Materials. In particular, we estimate that organic sales growth will be approximately 4% for the year, in line with what we've delivered over the last few years. The impact of acquisitions on sales is approximately 1.5% from closed deals.","In recent exchange rates, currency translation represents a roughly 4-point addition to reported sales growth and a pre-tax operating income tailwind of roughly $35 million. And we estimate that incremental pre-tax savings from restructuring actions will contribute between $25 million and $30 million in 2018. This estimate has been reduced from our original expectation for the year, reflecting the impact of higher transition cost associated with the LGM restructuring.","And we continue to expect a tax rate in the mid-20s and we assume 25% for purposes of our EPS guidance, consistent with our pro forma tax rate in Q1. And we anticipate spending between $250 million and $270 million on fixed capital and IT projects, a modest increase from our outlook earlier this year, reflecting an acceleration of capacity expansion for RFID as well as spending related to LGM's European footprint consolidation.","And note, the cash cost associated with our just announced restructuring charge, combined with modestly higher CapEx this year, is consistent with the cumulative five-year spending target and our long-term capital allocation plan. And, finally, we estimate average shares outstanding, assuming dilution, of 89 million to 90 million shares.","So, 14:15 in summary, we're pleased with the progress we've made this quarter and we remain confident in our ability to achieve both our 2018 and long-term goals.","And now, we'll open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Good morning, Scott.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Greg, you mentioned the $25 million of cost savings in LGM by 2020. Could you talk about cost to achieve those synergies and then also when I look at the estimated restructuring items, it went from $0.20 up to $0.95, it seems like a relatively large restructuring charge related to that project. Can you just explain why the restructuring charge goes up so much in regards to that?","Gregory S. Lovins - Avery Dennison Corp.","Sure. I think as we indicated here, we have about $70 million of costs related to this restructuring charge with about $7 million of that related to asset impairments and the other related to cash severance costs. In addition to that, as we said we have a little bit of cost that in our adjusted EPS is transition cost this year as well as a little bit of capital spending associated with that project as well.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And as far as restructuring within RBIS, have we run the course on restructuring on RBIS or is there more to come. I know you mentioned a rather sizable benefit from past restructuring, just can you give us an update where we stand on that effort?","Gregory S. Lovins - Avery Dennison Corp.","Yeah. So as you know, we've continued kind of a multi-year restructuring effort within RBIS and we continue to see some carryover benefits from things that we executed last year and have continued to execute as we've entered the first quarter. So largely the restructuring savings that we expect to get in 2018 are largely RBIS-related, offset by transition costs that we have in the LGM business in 2018.","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","And Scott, I'd just add that we're always looking for sources of restructuring and productivity to continue to drive competitiveness in margin expansion. So, I think as Greg laid out, larger charge right now and cash outlay related to this specific program, but as far as if you look over the five-year horizon, our overall capital allocation strategy, this fits right in within the overall long-term strategy and we consistently look for opportunities to drive productivity.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird & Company. Please go ahead.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Hello, Ghansham.","Gregory S. Lovins - Avery Dennison Corp.","Good morning.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Good morning, Mitch and everyone. So first off in Graphics and Reflectives and the low single-digit growth in the first quarter, you called out timing in your prepared comments, can you first off expand on that? And also, as a catch-up there, what is behind your view that core sales growth will be better in the second quarter year-over-year or are you seeing the growth pickup more broadly across your portfolio?","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Yes. So, as I mentioned, Graphics and Reflective were roughly low single-digit growth in the first quarter. We did see a little bit of a pick up here as we've entered the second quarter and as we said, most of that we think is somewhat timing related, as it is for much of the LGM segment in the quarter, and we would expect little bit better growth rate as we go into the second quarter as we had some of these comp issues last year that we've talked about that were an impact against us in Q1, we expect it to be a little bit of a tailwind in the second quarter from a growth rate perspective.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And just since you last reported, there's obviously been a significant increase in crude oil prices, lot of your customers across the CPG space are calling out freight costs having gone up significantly, et cetera. Can you just update us on your view on inflation and also the various pricing initiatives you have underway? Thanks.","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Sure. So inflation in the first quarter came in largely as we had expected it to from a sequential perspective from Q4 to Q1, driven by some of the things you mentioned around petrochemical related increases, particularly in North America and some paper-related increases in other parts of the world, Europe and Asia as well. And we expect to see some modest sequential inflation going into the second quarter also.","As we talked about last time, we implemented some pricing actions across the globe in early Q1, we announced most of those in late Q4, so they've gone into effect largely in the first quarter and we'll see some sequential benefit from pricing into Q2 as a result of those as well. So overall, we continue to expect to be able to largely mitigate the sequential inflation we'll see through both the pricing actions as well as through continued product reengineering efforts as we've done in the past.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research","Hi, everyone. Good morning.","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Hi, George.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research","Thanks for all the details. Hey, so I want to ask my first set of questions really just around the restructuring and I forget who asked whether it was Ghansham or Scott, but what's left on the restructuring program benefits beyond or separate from the one that you'll be getting out of the $25 million from this latest program that you shouldn't accrue. That should accrue this year.","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Not sure I exactly understand the questions, George.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research","Let me try it again. From your existing restructuring programs, not the one you just announced in Europe, what's the net residual restructuring benefit you should get this year from that and for that matter into the future what's left of benefits?","Gregory S. Lovins - Avery Dennison Corp.","Yeah. Some of the actions, as we said, we expect roughly $35 million or so of incremental restructuring savings this year, offset by some of the transition costs that we've talked about. Most of that savings is related to actions that we've taken in RBS (sic) [RBIS] and either executed last year or in the process of executing right now as well.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research","Okay. So $35 million and you've got $11 million of that so far in the first quarter, did I hear that right?","Gregory S. Lovins - Avery Dennison Corp.","Yes. From a net perspective, yes.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research","Okay.","Cynthia S. Guenther - Avery Dennison Corp.","George, just to be clear...","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research","Hey, Cindy.","Cynthia S. Guenther - Avery Dennison Corp.","...the $35 million is gross before transition cost, so the number that we provided for the first quarter would also be net of transition cost.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research","Okay. Okay. Understood. The second question I had, you went fairly quickly in going through what you're going to do in Europe and recognizing there are sensitivities around this sort of thing, can you give us a bit more color in terms of what you hope to accomplish or what some of the operating steps will be in the restructuring related to LGM in Europe?","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Sure. So we're closing a plant in Schwelm, Germany, and we are shutting down several coaters and we'll be moving one key asset from Schwelm, Germany to one of our other facilities in Belgium. So that's the plan we will be unfolding here over the next 18 months. And really the focus here is around getting the business continuing to focus on remaining competitive so we can grow profitably both within the base business as well as the high value categories. And this fits in with our long-term strategy for continuing to drive profitable growth across the product portfolio.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO. Please go ahead.","John P. McNulty - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. On the European restructuring, I know you've been bringing up some capacity or have plans to bring up some capacity. I guess how should we think about the net effect between the capacity that's coming out because it does sound like a little is coming out but maybe not all of it, I guess how should we be thinking about the net effect in terms of your growth in Europe around capacity?","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Yeah. So as we've said, the investments that we've been making are just consistent with the overall growth strategy that we have and what we're seeing within the industry. Now obviously, the investments as we make them, these are assets that last for a long time. So specifically within this type of asset that we've installed with Lux 3, we see we have enough capacity for growth for the next eight years or so within the emulsion, adhesive laminating that we have. So that's our expectations overall. And as we've talked about in the past, these assets can be ramped up slowly bringing on one shift and two as we rebalance capacity across various assets.","John P. McNulty - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. And then for the IHM business, you had indicated I guess in your prepared remarks significant margin uplift I guess coming even in the second quarter. I guess it didn't sound like a whole lot of the things that you were doing were necessarily kind of flip-the-switch type move. So I guess I'm curious where the confidence comes in and kind of what actions you're taking where sequentially you're going to see that big of a move in terms of the margins?","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Yeah. We've been talking about this for a couple of quarters now about the need to ramp up our productivity initiatives within this business, and we weren't where we wanted to be. And so, actually, this is not flip-the-switch to your point. This has been underway for the last few quarters, and we said by middle of this year that we would start seeing traction. And Q1 is where we're seeing the pivot point and from here on out we expect to see the margin expansion start to come through.","John P. McNulty - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thanks very much for the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Gregory S. Lovins - Avery Dennison Corp.","Hi, Adam.","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Greg, just a couple questions on the guidance, if you don't mind. So just to be clear on the moving pieces here, so you picked up $0.13 on currency. It sounds like you had better operations in the quarter which are, I guess, being offset by the additional transition costs that you're incurring. Is that right?","Gregory S. Lovins - Avery Dennison Corp.","Yeah. I think that's characterized fairly well, Adam. So we had beaten Q1, was roughly $0.05 or so from our expectations with about half of that from operating performance and about half of that from currency. And we essentially carry that and we have a little bit higher transition costs, as you said. And then we have a benefit of currency based on where rates are today in the outlook.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And what are your FX assumptions now versus before, Greg?","Gregory S. Lovins - Avery Dennison Corp.","Yeah. So our FX assumption going into the year, the euro was around $1.19. Today, we're roughly $1.23 on the euro rate (25:18) change in assumption.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Sure. And just on developed versus emerging markets, can you just remind me what trends you saw in the quarter and to what extent they differed at all from what you had seen throughout last year?","Gregory S. Lovins - Avery Dennison Corp.","Yeah. So I don't think we saw a significant difference. I think our growth in North America and Europe, particularly in LGM, was in the kind of low to mid-single digit range, relatively consistent with what we'd seen over the last few quarters. And our growth in the emerging regions overall was in the mid-single digit range. So we continue to see good growth in India and South Asia, continue to see mid-single digit growth in China as we mentioned before as well. So, overall, I think the growth in the quarter was pretty solid broad-based across the globe from a market perspective as well as from our organic growth rates across the regions.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup Global Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning.","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Hey.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","The restructuring program is quite extensive, and when we look at the CapEx step-up, it seems like CapEx is going to be around 3.5% of sales this year. Maybe going back five, six years it was below 3%. I guess my question is how would you characterize returns at this point in the economic cycle? Is your 17% plus returns target impacted at all by these moves? And then with the step-up in CapEx this year, should we expect that to roll off in 2019 or maybe stays elevated in 2019, rolls off in 2020, or any kind of broad thoughts you could share there?","Gregory S. Lovins - Avery Dennison Corp.","Yes. Maybe I'll first step back in terms of overall capital allocation. So we've talked a little bit about CapEx and restructuring, and I'll touch on the other components as well. Overall, our capital allocation strategy remains the same. We're looking at investing 30% to 35% of our available capital in organic capital investments and restructuring. And we will continue to be within that target that we've communicated over the last year or so. And then we're looking to continue to return about 20% of our available cash through dividends to shareholders. And then we have about 45% to 50% of our available cash for M&A and share buyback. And we expect with these changes to be able to continue to deliver within what we've committed to over the last year or so.","And these capital \u2013 or these capital spending and restructuring numbers are pretty much in line with those expectations as we had had and what we've communicated over the last year in regards between now and 2021. So we expect to still be within the targets that we've communicated there. And from a return perspective, we expect to still be able to continue delivering at that 17% or above level as well.","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","And so, Anthony, just to further elaborate on what Greg said. I think this program looks a little bit more expensive than a number of the other programs relative to savings, and we've consistently said, restructuring programs in Europe tend to be more expensive. So this is consistent with what we've seen in the past and our expectation. And the returns on this initiative, specifically are a multiple of our cost of capital and above the overall returns on capital. I think you're talking about \u2013 that we've talked about achieving around top quartile returns within the business. So it's consistent with our capital allocation strategy, as Greg laid out. It's consistent as far as costs relative to the benefit that is typical for what we see in Europe, and it's consistent with the returns profile for what we're targeting for the long-term within the business.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's very helpful. And then just two follow-on questions on IHM. I guess first, in terms of the sequential margin step up in 2Q, apologies if I missed this, but any quantification of what that could look like from 1Q to 2Q? And then second, you have a fair amount of balance sheet flexibility. Could you just talk about the kind of M&A environment for these kind of adjacent industrial and healthcare businesses, what you're seeing in terms of availability of assets but also just sort of valuation?","Gregory S. Lovins - Avery Dennison Corp.","Sure. So as far as IHM, we expect a meaningful increase from Q1 to Q2. What does that mean? I'd roughly say 1.5 points is what you should be thinking about going into Q2. On the M&A front, we continue to have a rich pipeline of companies that we're engaging with. These tend to be engagements that can last long period of time and then suddenly ramp up and move from a slow courtship to a quick deal. So it's hard to predict the exact timing of when things may come through, but we're having lots of good active discussions broad-based but particularly within IHM. But nothing to say that I'd say overall if you look over the coming years that the pace would be meaningfully different than what we've seen over the past few years.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan Securities. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. I'd like to go back to the cost of the restructuring. You're laying off 150 people, and so in the scheme of things, maybe that's $15 million or $30 million at the most, but the restructuring charges in cash is roughly $63 million pre-tax. Can you explain the difference of where the large costs are? And how much does this change your capacity in Europe? Does it expand it by 5% or 3% or leave it the same? Can you quantify something?","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Yeah. So, first of all, on the cost of restructuring, so the net impact of the head count reduction is roughly 150 head count reduction. The gross impact is higher, closer to the 400 head count reduction range as we're closing a facility and moving many of those assets into other facilities. So the gross reduction that leads to a higher severance cost is a bigger number than what the net head count reduction would be.","In terms of capacity, as we're moving a few assets from one site to other sites in that closure, we don't have a significant change in capacity and in this case we're utilizing capacity from the Luxembourg investment that we've talked about in the past as well as some capacity from the Mactac investment that we have made a little over year ago.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","How does the cash outlay split between this year and next year?","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","The majority of the cash outlay is severance related and the majority of that will end up in 2019.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So it's maybe 60% next year, 40% this year. Is that what majority means?","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","No. Much higher percentage, closer to 90% or so in 2019.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","90%. Okay. If I could just ask one question on RFID. Can you remind me, do your RFID revenues come from the use of RFID in warehouses in order to locate and track particular items, or are your RFID revenues stemming from more straightforward retail application?","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Well, the answer is both, Jeff. We see broad applications for RFID in general, and we're seeing a ramp up now. The biggest initial adopter is within apparel retail, which is \u2013 the RFID is used both from their supply chain because they're tagged at source all the way through to retail or omni-channel through e-commerce. So the apparel channel uses it through their warehousing, their entire supply chain, including the retail floor. And we're also seeing applications for warehouse management and so forth.","As I said, we're seeing a buildup of momentum within RFID. I was at the RFID LIVE trade show just a few weeks ago. I will say the pace of excitement continues to build, and it's becoming much more broad-based and our pipeline is up quite significantly from last year about 65% increase in the pipeline, and half of that now is coming from non-apparel category.","So significant ramp up in the amount of energy and excitement around this, and people seeing the benefits that it will bring. We've got the team that's the market leadership of how to adopt RFID, and we clearly bring unique capabilities as far as unique inlays that we can design around antenna design and so forth. So we're well positioned here. We're investing significantly to be able to capture this market share and drive adoption across a broad set of categories.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with UBS Securities. Please go ahead.","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Not sure if you addressed that already. I may have missed that. Volume trends seem to have decelerated a little bit for all the segments. Exactly what's going on there? Like are you seeing any softness in certain product lines or regions or is it something else, is it like purely timing or seasonality?","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Yeah. So I think as we talked about in LGM in particular, it's typically timing related. So as we mentioned, we had some pre-buys in the fourth quarter related to some pricing actions earlier this year. Last year in the first quarter we had some pre-buys related to the price increases that have been announced for the second quarter a year ago. And we had the timing impact of the Easter holiday which fell partially in Q1 this year and was in Q2 in prior year. If we net all those things together, for LGM it's about 1 point to the overall organic growth rates. So that puts us kind of squarely on our expectations if you adjust for that.","I think with the other businesses, at IHM we had solid growth in our industrial categories, around 5%, and we had solid growth in our Vancive Medical business. And we still had some impact from the program loss we had talked about over the last number of quarters. If you adjust for that, organic growth in IHM would have been closer to 4% and more or less in line with our expectations as well. So no other really changes in expectations on volume outside of the timing impacts that we have discussed.","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's fine. That's it for me. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.","Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Thank you. I actually would like to \u2013 well, good morning, everyone first, or good afternoon.","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Good morning.","Gregory S. Lovins - Avery Dennison Corp.","Good morning.","Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","I first wanted to look \u2013 ask the previous question differently. If I look at organic growth for the entire company, it has declined over the past three quarters at 5.3%, at 0.7%, and now 3.4%. So I was wondering what is behind that in raw material inflationary environment? Are you losing volume because of price increases, or are there other factors?","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Yeah. So, Rosemarie, if you look over the past couple years, I'd say the volume trends are very consistent with what we've been seeing. Specifically quarter-to-quarter, it's become a little bit more choppy, because when you're going through an inflationary period for one, you'll see pre-buy activity occur. And so last year, we talked about Q2 was below the normal because of both price increase levels as well as holidays. And then, Q3 and Q4 benefited from that and we knew that some volume is being pulled out of Q1 into Q4 and then, you also have the impact of holidays such as Easter, depressing Q1, which is why we're highlighting that.","We expect Q2 to be above the usual level of growth. So, if you look over a number of quarters on just an averaging basis, the volume trends are very consistent. And I think broad-based, we're seeing actually in the market as well as our performance continued solid growth pretty much across the board.","On the positive side, the exception to that would be India, which is coming out of the whole \u2013 Indian market coming out of the low point of growth last year because of the adoption of the Goods and Service Tax, and then the low point exception will probably be South Korea given the macro challenges that South Korea is going through. But overall, broad-based growth, pretty consistent our growth trends quarter-to-quarter just due to holiday timing and the effects of pre-buys which you will expect to see during an inflationary environment.","Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Thank you. That is really very helpful. And I was wondering if you have looked at the potential impact from tariffs on the retail side of your business and therefore on your operations?","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Yes. So, so far, our expectations on the tariff are pretty relatively at this point insignificant impact is our expectation right now. If over time that has an impact on volumes in retail or something that may be a different type of impact for us, but right now our expectation particularly to the tariffs is a relatively insignificant or immaterial impact at this point.","Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Kapsch with Loop Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Chris Kapsch - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. I had one question focused on the competitive dynamic in the LGM business and particularly in the wake of the price increases that have happened. So the way it kind of went down is one of your big competitors introduced a relatively large price increase. My sense was a lot of smaller guys immediately followed, and then you came in with a lower price increase. So I'm just wondering when all the dust is now settled, was there any share shifts that took place or did some of the competitors sort of backpedal on the order of magnitude of the price increases that they were looking to get?","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Yeah. So, Chris, it was pretty broad-based people, various companies putting through price increase. I'm not sure I'd say lead and follow. We put through a price increase that we needed and that was necessary to offset the inflationary pressures we were seeing. Now, when you go through this period of change, there's often a little bit of a share that might move a little bit within that period for a quarter or two. And so, you see account by account and that was pretty much what we've seen again, but on a macro I think our share position has been relatively stable. We don't have share data yet for Q1, but we expect it will be relatively stable through this period.","Chris Kapsch - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Thanks, and then just one follow-up on the growth rates around \u2013 in emerging markets in particular, I think, you characterized them as mid-single digits, including China mid-single digits. It seems like over a longer period of time that's definitely a deceleration. I'm just wondering how you would characterize that growth rate. Are you pleased or disappointed? Is there anything structurally going on there that would cause a lower growth rate over time other than simply the law of large numbers? Just wondering if you can provide a little bit color around the growth rate in emerging markets. Thank you.","Gregory S. Lovins - Avery Dennison Corp.","Yes. I think, over time, we've seen emerging markets at this pace mid-single to high-single digits over the last number of quarters through more or less in total roughly where we've been over the last four to six quarters. I think in China, it's been a little bit spiky given some of the price increase pre-buy impacts that we've talked about.","So we grew mid-single digits this quarter. On the back of last year, we had a strong Q1 driven by price increase pre-buys that happened in April of last year. So I think the growth rate that we had in China this quarter was pretty solid in respect to the timing issues that we also faced there. So no real changes to the overall underlying demand that we've seen in the emerging regions, a little bit spikier as Mitch said a few minutes ago, but otherwise still feel pretty good about the growth prospects and what we've been delivering in the emerging regions.","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","And, Chris, just to build on it. If you were to take a longer view, I think couple things to add. We had commented that China was in the consistently high single-digit for a number of years, and that's a moderated mid-single to upper single-digits. And South Asia has basically taken that place and ramped up the growth. And so, that shift within the emerging markets has been China continues to show strong growth, but slowed down a little bit, more consistent with GDP there. And South Asia continuing to grow well, ahead of GDP overall. And I think, your question about, is it the law of large numbers within China, I think that's absolutely part of it.","Chris Kapsch - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Right. And is it also maybe just obviously law of large numbers, I guess, but also just certainly not a saturation of the sort of the per capita consumption of labels. But it's just those economy where they are in terms of their maturation, I guess, is another way of thinking about it?","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","No.","Chris Kapsch - Loop Capital Markets LLC","In terms of the per capita adoption of sort of label materials.","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","We still see plenty of upside around the adoption of penetration of label materials, as well as the e-commerce trends.","Chris Kapsch - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Right. Okay. Thank you.","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","We have a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research","Hi, thanks for taking the follow-up, guys. I'll ask them in one shot just to expedite things. First off, Mitch or Greg, can you remind us what you actually mean by the pipeline within RFID? Is that numbers of customers, is that volume, is that revenue, if you could just discuss what's in there?","And relatedly, the RFID growth that we saw in the first quarter of 20% plus, congratulations on that. Is that still your expectation that we should see, if I remember correctly, that type of growth over the rest of the year, recognizing it can be a little bit chunky at times, might we see some deceleration in the next couple quarters after a strong 1Q?","And my last question and I'll turn it over. With IHM obviously you've given us the answer to the quiz, you're looking for 150 basis points of sequential improvement. Aside from when you put out the next press release, what can we see from our side either from a macro market standpoint that would give us more or less confidence in you being able to achieve that goal for 2Q? Thanks and good luck on the quarter.","Gregory S. Lovins - Avery Dennison Corp.","Thanks, George. So just look on the pipeline comments we're having, the comments were specifically around number of engagements. But it's basically number of customers as well. There's only a handful of customers where there's more than one engagement going on. So it's largely one and the same when you read the trends that I commented on earlier around the 65% increase in the overall pipeline being spread between apparel and non-apparel.","As far as our RFID growth expectations for the year, yeah, we said we expect this business to grow 15% to 20% over the long run and we commented that last year it was $250 million of revenue, we expect $300 million this year. So that's a 20% growth rate. So we'd expect the trend you saw in Q1 to continue through the rest of the year, maybe not quarter-by-quarter, but overall. And then last around IHM, this has \u2013 the reason we call out the amount of productivity that we're focused on here is I'd say that the ability to achieve the margin trends, clearly volume growth is key, but most of it's really around just internal productivity drive and not around macro trends outside. So our focus is really \u2013 the ability to achieve that's going to be more around our internal ability to execute more than anything else. Obviously that's barring any major slowdown in automotive or something else. So we're just assuming a consistent run of those industrial categories.","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","I think, the other thing on IHM that gives us some confidence Q1 to Q2 is as you know we've made the acquisition last year of Yongle Tape, which is largely a Chinese based business. And Q1 is its softest quarter, as well as the impact of Chinese New Year in the first quarter. So we would expect to see a lift there from Q1 to Q2 and that's a sizable portion of the IHM segment at this point in time as well, so it's another factor driving the Q1 to Q2 benefit that we expect.","Operator","Mr. Butier, I'll turn the call back over to you for any closing remarks.","Mitchell R. Butier - Avery Dennison Corp.","Okay, well great. Well, thank you everybody for joining the call and your interest in the company. We're off to a great start to what we believe will be another great year here within the company continuing to drive profitable growth across the entire portfolio focused on having GDP plus growth over the long run and top quartile returns. And just want to thank the entire team within Avery Dennison, truly tremendous capabilities and efforts across the entire team, and it's the strength of the team that gives me confidence that we're going to continue to drive forward.

[Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Eric Leeds, Avery Dennison's Head of Investor Relations. You may begin, sir.","Eric Leeds","Thank you. Welcome, everyone. Today we'll discuss our preliminary unaudited second quarter 2012 results. Please note that unless otherwise indicated, today's discussion will be focused on our continuing operations. The company's Office and Consumer Products business is classified on our income statement as a discontinued operation. The non-GAAP financial measures that we use are defined, qualified and reconciled with GAAP in schedules A-2 to A-5 of the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release. We remind you that we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. These forward-looking statements are made subject to the Safe Harbor statement included in today's earnings release. On the call today are Dean Scarborough, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mitch Butier, Senior Vice President and CFO. I'll now turn the call over to Dean.","Dean A. Scarborough","Thanks, Eric. The quarter came in just about as expected. Sales were up nearly 4% on an organic basis, and adjusted operating profit was down modestly. We're pleased with where we are on our free cash flow year-to-date, and we're on track to deliver earnings growth and free cash flow within the ranges of our guidance for the year. We are committed to returning more cash to investors, and we bought back an additional 2.4 million shares during the quarter to meet that commitment. As noted in our press release, we are accelerating our productivity and cost out plans to improve our competitive position and meet commitments to shareholders in an uncertain economic environment. The $100 million plus restructuring program announced today will enable us to deliver earnings growth in this unpredictable economy and provide nice upside when conditions improve. I'm also glad to say that we can fund this restructuring, while meeting our free cash flow targets as well. I'll provide additional color in a few minutes.","Turning to the segments. Pressure-Sensitive Materials had a solid quarter, both on the top line and the bottom line. Despite uncertain economic conditions in North America and Europe, Label and Packaging Materials had good sales growth in both regions, and we've gained back the share we lost in Europe a year ago. And, as we expected, emerging markets returned to double-digit sales growth.","Graphics and Reflective Solutions top line results were significantly weaker than LPM's. GRS is more economically sensitive, and the larger proportion of this business is in Europe, where it was especially hard-hit.","As you know, we've been investing in marketing and innovation in Label and Packaging Materials. We are gaining traction with a number of the new products we launched late last year, and we have a pipeline of new products that we'll introduce at Labelexpo in September. At the same time, LPM has been improving its already good service delivery time. And the combination of innovation and improved service are enabling us to gain share, and we're seeing this in our top line.","Retail Branding and Information Solutions results were disappointing in what has always been the seasonally largest sales quarter for this business. The retail apparel market is rebounding more slowly than we had expected. The second quarter did end positively after starting off with sales declines, and that positive trend is continuing into July. Despite sluggish market conditions, we made progress on our growth initiatives and believe we are continuing to gain share in our target segments. Sales of external embellishments were up nearly 60% over last year, and item-level RFID sales were up 35%. And our RFID division, which was integrated into RBIS at the beginning of the year, had a second profitable quarter in a row. Now recall that the RFID division results are reported in Other specialty converting. The RBIS team has done a great job improving both the RFID top and bottom line.","RBIS margins were down more than expected due to lower volumes and higher employee-related costs. We did raise prices, and we will see the full impact of the price increase in the third quarter. At the same time, as we noted in the May investor meeting, RBIS is focused on reducing its fixed cost structure, and has an objective to organize manufacturing more efficiently and reduce its footprint by 20%. Now that the second quarter is over, we are accelerating our cost-out actions.","Office and Consumer Products is reported as a discontinued operation. We still anticipate closing the transaction in the second half. In the business, net sales and operating profit declined from second quarter last year. As you know, the back-to-school season is spread over the second and third quarters, so it's hard to measure the full season's impact today. But based on what we've seen so far, we expect modest growth in back-to-school products this year. Also, OCP's new products, including the Martha Stewart line, are being well-received by consumers.","After the office products sale, we'll be focused on 2 core businesses: Pressure-Sensitive Materials in RBIS, and a group of smaller specialty converting businesses. Our core businesses are market leaders in their respective industries with great competitive advantages. We are going to build our niche advantages and further strengthen our ability to deliver on our long-term targets for double-digit earnings growth and improve returns by accelerating our restructuring initiatives to achieve more than $100 million of savings by mid-2013, with most of the savings coming next year.","First, we are going to continue the streamlining of the corporate organization that we began last year to eliminate the stranded class from the OCP divestiture. Over the past few years, our core businesses have developed scale in support functions, moving their organizations from small regional teams to globally managed functions. This enables us to reduce the amount of corporate support and better align these functions with the specific needs of each business. The streamlining will include the disposition of our headquarter's building in Pasadena, California, and a move to a lower-cost, smaller, leased location here in the San Gabriel Valley. Second, we are fully integrating Graphics and Reflective Solutions into Label and Packaging Materials. We've already integrated the GRS supply chain procurement and operations into LPM, and so now we are integrating marketing, sales and R&D functions to help Graphics and Reflective become more competitive as well as improving returns.","Third, as you know, we've been investing in marketing an innovation to get more external and to drive faster growth rates. We know from our experience so far that having technical people co-located with marketing professionals makes innovation faster and more efficient. To that end, we are consolidating our corporate R&D resources into Pressure-Sensitive Materials research centers in Ohio, the Netherlands, China and India. We want to move innovation closer to customers, accelerate time-to-market and focus activity on clearly defined opportunities. This will save us some money and enhance our innovation capability.","Fourth, now that we're past RBIS' peak quarter, we'll move forward with lowering its breakeven to improve its returns in a slower growth environment. As I said before, we have a 20% reduction in the RBIS footprint underway, and we're also identifying further opportunities to take cost out of this business. We're moving quickly to achieve more than $100 million of annualized savings in a little under 12 months. This leaner cost structure will make us more competitive and enable higher returns despite an uncertain economic environment. We have terrific core businesses with strong free cash flow, the ability to drive productivity, great capital discipline and innovation leadership. We have a high sense of urgency to achieve the targets we committed to in the investor meetings in May and thus are moving quickly and decisively to accelerate productivity.","So to sum up, with the first half behind us, we are tightening guidance ranges for full year EPS and free cash flow, and we are on track for the year. We're moving aggressively to deliver on our long-term targets, and at the same time we continue to increase cash returns to shareholders. And now  Mitch will provide more detail on the quarter and our initiatives.","Mitchell R. Butier","Thanks, Dean. Starting with Slide 4 and talking through to Slide 7 of our financial review and analysis. Overall results for the quarter were consistent with our expectations with adjusted earnings per share at $0.56, as strong performance in Pressure-Sensitive Materials was offset by lower than expected results in RBIS. Net sales in the second quarter of 2012 grew approximately 4% on an organic basis as the Pressure-Sensitive Materials business recovered from the slowdown in volume that we experienced in the second quarter of last year. RBIS sales were flat, and Other specialty converting delivered modest growth.","While we delivered solid organic sales growth, adjusted operating margin declined 30 basis points as higher employee-related expenses more than offset the benefit of higher volume and productivity. The higher employee-related expenses relate in large part to higher bonus expense versus last year. We had unusually low bonus expense last year, particularly Q2, due to poor business performance. The net impact from raw material inflation and price increases was relatively modest in the quarter as commodity costs continue to be relatively stable for us. Our second quarter effective tax rate on continuing operations was 33%. The year-to-date adjusted tax rate increased from 29% to 34%. We continue to anticipate a full year tax rate in the low- to mid-30% range, similar to the full year rate for 2011.","Our year-to-date free cash flow in 2012 is significantly improved from last year due to the lower bonus payments in the first quarter of 2012 versus Q1 2011 and the continued strong management of working capital. I'm pleased with the capital discipline we've demonstrated over the past few years and where we are on achieving our free cash flow objectives for the year.","Net debt is down by approximately $150 million from last year but higher sequentially from March levels due to the seasonality of our cash flow. We are committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet and expect to keep our net debt-to-EBITDA less than 2x for the year.","With the strength of our cash flow and balance sheet, we continued to repurchase shares in the second quarter, 2.4 million shares at a cost of $70 million. Year-to-date through the end of the second quarter, the company repurchased 4.8 million shares at an aggregate cost of $142 million.","Now Dean talked about our restructuring program earlier. These actions will structurally reduce our overhead cost and save more than $100 million. These actions will add to our ability to achieve our financial targets even with uncertain market conditions.","Now turning to Slide 8. Pressure-Sensitive sales were up 6% on an organic basis, an improvement in the year-on-year growth rate versus recent quarters as we have now lapsed the slowdown that began in the second quarter of last year. Label and Packaging Materials volume improved in all regions, with mid-single-digit growth in North America, high-single-digit growth in Europe, where we had the biggest decline last year, and double-digit growth in emerging markets. While the sales growth benefited from easier comps to the prior year, the volume was good in absolute terms as well, particularly in the emerging markets and North America.","Sales in Graphics and Reflective Solutions declined low-single digits. The market of this business is more discretionary in nature and a disproportionate amount of this business' sales are in Europe. PSM's adjusted operating margin was slightly -- up slightly year-over-year as the benefit from higher volume and productivity was largely offset by higher employee-related expenses including incentive compensation.","Retail Branding and Information Solutions sales were flat on an organic basis. As you know, we were hoping for growth in RBIS, but the market just isn't there right now. We saw improvement in all segments in the U.S., with the exception of the mass-market channel, while we experienced a general decline in Europe. RBIS' adjusted operating margin declined 160 basis points due to wage inflation, partially offset by productivity initiatives. As you've heard us say, given RBIS' current cost structure and manufacturing footprint in markets with rapidly rising labor costs, this business needs between 1.5 and 2 points of growth in order to deliver incremental margin. As you can see, in this quarter we didn't have that, hence the margin compression and our strong push to reduce cost in this business.","Sales in our Other specialty converting businesses grew 2% on an organic basis, due primarily to a strong showing in performance tapes. Adjusted operating margin improved 80 basis points as the impact of higher volume and productivity initiatives more than offset higher employee-related expenses and other items. The productivity savings in Other specialty converting were largely driven by the vertical integration between our RFID division and RBIS.","Moving on to the outlook for 2012. On Slide 10, we've highlighted the key factors that we think will contribute to our P&L and cash flow in 2012. Slide 11 has our EPS and free cash flow guidance. While there remains uncertainty in the macro environment and limited forward visibility, now that we're  halfway through the year, we've tightened our sales, earnings per share and free cash flow estimates. Our estimate for organic sales growth is between 2% and 3%. Based on recent exchange rates, the impact from currency on EBIT is now estimated to have approximately $19 million negative impact versus 2011. Our estimates for the tax rate, capital expenditures, pension costs and average shares outstanding remains unchanged for 2012 from what we shared with you just last quarter. We also continue to expect that the combination of free cash flow and net proceeds from the sale of OCP will total approximately $400 million.","Now for the big changes to our near-term financial outlook this quarter relate to the cost-reduction actions that we described earlier. We anticipate more than $100 million in annualized savings from this restructuring program, with approximately $15 million realized this year and most of the remainder to be realized in 2013. To implement these actions, we estimate that we will incur approximately $80 million in restructuring costs: $55 million in 2012 and $25 million in 2013. Based on estimated sales as well as other assumptions, including the listed factors, we expect adjusted 2012 earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.90 to $2.05 and free cash flow from continuing operations of $280 million to $310 million. Note that the midpoint of our free cash flow guidance has only changed modestly despite the incremental cost of the restructuring program. This is because we expect to offset most of the incremental 2012 restructuring cost with continued tight management of working capital.  Earnings in the third quarter are expected to be between 20% and 25% of our full year guidance.","In summary, the second quarter was in line with expectations. We've demonstrated our commitment to maintaining financial strength while returning more cash to shareholders. And the next phase of our cost-reduction program will save more than $100 million, adding to our ability to effectively manage through an uncertain macroenvironment and giving us greater upside when conditions improve. These actions reflect our continued cost and capital discipline and our commitment to delivering better returns. Now we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question, from the line of John McNulty with Credit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just to maybe flesh out the cost-cutting a little bit. You highlighted 4 major buckets where you expect the bulk of the savings to come from. Can you quantify how we should be thinking about each bucket in terms of what those savings might be roughly give or take a little bit in each of the segments?","Dean A. Scarborough","John, yes. This is Dean. Good question. I don't think we want to do that at this time, because we haven't announced all the actions in terms of different parts of the company. I will tell you that about 80% of the actions we're taking don't impact SG&A versus the balance obviously coming above the gross profit line.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. And then with regard to the timing of when they hit, I know you'd said you were hoping by the end of '13 to be at a run rate of $100 million. How should we think about, incrementally, in '13 versus '12 what the cost saves should be looking out to 2013?","Dean A. Scarborough","Well, we want to get to the $100 million run rate savings by mid-2013. So a lot of the actions we'll be taking between now and the end of the year. I do expect some actions will take a little bit longer and bleed over into the first quarter of 2013.","Mitchell R. Butier","And so of the $100 million, we're expecting $15 million net to hit this year and the following $85 million to mostly hit 2013, with a little bit blending into '14 for things that are implemented in Q1.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then just one last question, just on your guidance for the full year. Looking at your -- the 2 remaining core businesses. Normally your first half of the year seems to be a little bit stronger in terms of earnings than the second half, and yet your guidance isn't really implying that. So I guess I'm wondering what you're thinking starts to improve in the second half of the year, so that you kind of have it more even balance this year compared to normal years.","Dean A. Scarborough","I think, John, the biggest difference is last year in the second quarter, we basically reversed out our bonuses for the whole first half of the year. So the comps, frankly, just get a bit easier in the back half of the year, both on the top and the bottom line.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to come back to the restructuring relative to the environment. If I was tallying correctly, I think you mentioned an uncertain economic environment being the environment you've got around 7x or 8x on the call. So did anything change over the course of the year that prompted these actions? Or were these actions, Dean and Mitch, that you had been more or less planning on once OCP was done? And if you could provide a little bit more color on that, that would be great.","Dean A. Scarborough","Well, certainly the thinking about eliminating  stranded cost after OCP, that -- we took some actions in the back half of last year. But frankly, as we look forward and realize that the economic environment is probably, in the near term, not going to get much better, that we needed to take actions that would accelerate our earnings power now, and not just simply wait for a rebound in the economy. On the corporate overhead part, one of the things that we've realized is that we've added a lot of capability to the businesses. And we can eliminate activities that formerly were done at the center that can now be done in the businesses. And at the same time, the needs of the businesses are different, so that they can choose much better to how to or what to invest in and at what level. And I think it will get us definitely a better end result. There's one other factor here, and that is for some -- for example of our businesses, a good example is Graphics and Reflective Solutions. We had decided a couple of years ago after we had integrated the supply chains that we would leave additional infrastructure in the front end of the business to try to accelerate growth. And we had set an internal milestone of 2012 being the key when we would be able to demonstrate our ability to grow faster in that business. Now the near-term prospects, given the economy don't look good, so we simply triggered a milestone and decided to integrate that business and improve the returns immediately. So I think a number of factors have played into this. And I would attribute that to frankly just disciplined management and looking for opportunities for us to hit our commitments to shareholders as fast as we can even given potentially uncertain economic environment.","Mitchell R. Butier","Yes, our goal with this, just to add to Dean's points, as we both mentioned, is to ensure we can hit the earnings and free cash flow targets that we laid out in May, even if we come in a little bit on the low end of the sales growth. And these are -- we're always looking for opportunities to reduce cost, and these things have been on our radar, and we just, as what Dean said, triggered a few milestones in the works of implementing these things and finalizing the planning in Q2. We're now in a position to announce most of it.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's very helpful. Appreciate the color on that. I guess one question I had regarding the goal. In terms of hitting your goals despite the environment, you're purely referring to what you laid out for 2012. You weren't putting any kind of stake in the ground for '13, i.e. you still expect to be able to grow earnings despite the environment because of the savings that you'll generate here. Would that be fair that you're only looking at '12 right now in terms of promising on your goals?","Dean A. Scarborough","We're committed to hitting 10% to 15% net income growth and 15% to 20% EPS growth. We're not giving 2013 guidance here, and we certainly don't have any insight at this point about what 2013 is going to look like. Again, it just comes back to us achieving those targets, even if the economy looks worse. And let's face it, if it doesn't get worse or it gets somewhat better, there's upside for the business.","Mitchell R. Butier","George, those are the targets we discussed in May at the Investor [indiscernible].","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Understand. Just was not sure whether you were laying it out for '13 yet. Doesn't sound like you are, but certainly...","Mitchell R. Butier","No, we're not.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And how much of the savings will be actual cash? Will it all be cash, the $100 million, or it will be there as a non-cash expense that you avoid here? What might those be?","Mitchell R. Butier","Those are pretax cash savings.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then the last thing. As you're integrating the labels and Graphics and Reflective businesses, what are the obstacles, if any, to integrating? What thought have you put into that you can share here about areas that you may eliminate that are key points of connection between the 2 areas that if it's now eliminated might hamper your ability to integrate those groups? And more broadly, are there any areas that you may be looking to eliminate that again are key focal points in terms of how the organization communicates from one end to another that are challenges during the integration?","Dean A. Scarborough","I'll take a shot at your question, George. I'm not sure I understand it 100%. I don't see any challenges in integrating Graphics and Reflective Solutions into the business. We still will have a separate sales teams going after specific markets in Reflective and the Graphics business. What we've basically taken out is a lot of the overhead or we will take out the overhead in infrastructure and some of the G&A costs associated with that activity and will continue to leverage the scale of the Label and Packaging Materials supply chain and procurement operations. If you are referring to linkages between, let's say, RBIS and the materials businesses, there really aren't very many. So actually, potentially, I think what we have is dis-synergy trying to manage somethings at the center that should be more appropriately managed in the businesses with a focus on what's really driving value there. In other words, RBIS, obviously, is a different business situation than Label and Packaging Materials, and therefore may choose not to invest in some things at this point in their evolution.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Maybe this is a good one for you, Dean. The 3.5% sales growth that you saw in the core basis for the quarter, just kind of thinking 2Q '12 versus last year, is this just purely a function of easier comparisons from the volume inflection you saw last year or is it some encouraging signs on underlying volume growth?","Dean A. Scarborough","Yes. It's better than just the comparisons. When I look back to 2010, I don't have the numbers here in front of me, I am feeling pretty good about where we sit today. First of all, as you know, we've lost some share in the second half -- in the second quarter last year in Europe. In the Label and Packaging Materials business, as we pushed prices up. And over this last 12 months, we've recovered some of that market share. But interestingly enough, we don't have the market data yet, but market conditions still remain stronger than maybe I would have expected, especially in Europe. Emerging market growth has also rebounded quite nicely. We saw double-digit growth in Asia, we saw double-digit growth in Latin America, so I'm pleased with how the businesses are tracking there. So far, we haven't seen maybe early warning signs of economic slowdowns in emerging markets like we've all been reading about in the newspapers.","In RBIS is a different story though. I mean, RBIS, we did expect to get a better rebound in the second quarter. Now it turned out that April was negative, May was flat, and June we saw some sales growth, and that sales growth has continued for at least the first 3 weeks of the third quarter. And so it's modestly looking a little more positive, but we're not taking that to the bank just yet.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And so just sort of continue that thought on RBIS. Why would -- what do you anticipate or what do you allocate that improvement in the inter-quarter trajectory to, because it seems like the economy is worse, generally speaking, June versus back in April. So why would RBIS improve and continuing into the third quarter?","Dean A. Scarborough","Again, the sales that we capture in the second quarter are really for the fall and winter programs. So it really relates to retailer -- focus on their inventory, on what their prospects are for the coming season. We saw modest improvement in U.S. sourced apparel items, so we saw a plus figure. In Europe, it was down very low-single digit, and the 2 sort of offset each other. I do think we're gaining share in some of our key market segments. It's just not happening fast enough, and we're getting 0 help from the market. So it's really up to us to reconstruct this business model, so we can drive earnings growth with a -- in a very conservative market, which I don't believe retailers are going to invest a lot in inventories at least for not the foreseeable future.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just one final question on PSM. Mitch, I think you mentioned labor inflation as it relates to the operating margin variance year-over-year. Not a lot of your peers are talking about labor inflation. Just curious as to what's driving that for Avery specifically.","Mitchell R. Butier","Yes. So my comment on labor inflation was more focused within RBIS given the high labor content of that business. I commented on PSM about higher employee-related expenses, but specifically calling out most of that for PSM was around bonus expense. Last year, Q2, we had very poor performance in PSM and basically reversed out all the bonus accruals that we had from the first quarter as well as the second.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays Capital.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just wondering, is there any benefit on the tax rate for moving some of these corporate functions overseas into the businesses?","Mitchell R. Butier","There is not much benefit on the tax rate. There is a modest amount, but most of this activity is not, with the exception of some of the R&D activities and so forth, is not moving overseas. It's migrating within the U.S. or actually being eliminated.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just moving to PSM. Obviously, a strong result out of the Label and Packaging Materials, but can you talk a little bit more about which end markets were strong? Was it more in the package goods end markets? Or was it more in variable information end markets? Can you sort of parse that out a little bit for us?","Dean A. Scarborough","I don't have the details here. My sense is that we saw kind of strong growth across -- in most of our product categories. Certainly in emerging markets, we definitely saw that. We generally have good strength in the films product categories, which tend to be more consumer packaged goods related.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. What was -- how much did price cost help you out in PSM in the quarter? Was there any big lift from lower resin cost in the quarter? And do you expect any lift in the third quarter from the drop in resin cost so far?","Mitchell R. Butier","Commodity prices have really just stabilized for us for us the last couple of quarters as we've been saying. We're seeing the continuation of the same. And the year-over-year organic growth we've talked about in this business, and it holds true for all the regions, is basically driven by volume. Small puts and takes on price were the carryover for some price increase that happened last year in some regions or rolling back of some of the surcharges we implemented, but very modest. So overall, all the organic growth is largely attributed to volume.","Dean A. Scarborough","We are actually still raising prices in some economies, especially where currency -- certain currencies have devalued, and so we're -- still some pricing activity going on again in some geographies with declining currency.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then I think in RBIS you mentioned that mass-market was weak in the quarter. Was there any strength, any particular strength in any of the other end market channels that is noteworthy?","Dean A. Scarborough","Yes. I think for us the global retail, global brands has continued to be an area of strength for us. In the U.S., the premier in mid-market was also a strong driver for us. We're definitely seeing some lift because RFID uptick as well as some of the new embellishments we're selling. So we are gaining some traction there.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And just lastly, on the sale of OCP. I think you said before you thought it would close in 3Q early in the third quarter. You still anticipate that early in 3Q? And how are you thinking about the proceeds at this point from the sale, the net proceeds?","Dean A. Scarborough","Well, we said in the back half of the year, so that's -- we'll continue to say that. It's in the hands of the government right now, and they have their process. So when they get done with their process, we'll proceed. In terms of the use of proceeds, I think it's exactly the same as we've said before.","Mitchell R. Butier","Yes, essentially, if you look at the $300 million just using for simplicity of free cash flow we're expecting from continuing ops plus the $400 million of the net proceeds in free cash flow from OCP, $700 million in total, $100 million will go towards dividends, of course. We said we'd pay down some debt commensurate with the amount of EBITDA we're losing in office products, and then the remainder for focus on share repurchases. So no change from what we said before.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question, from the line of John Roberts with Buckingham Research Group.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","When you take that footprint of RBIS down 20%, is that taking the machines out of the customer site locations that install the ticket tags? And what happens to those when they're pulled out, if that's what's going to happen here?","Dean A. Scarborough","No. These are our own facilities that we're talking about. So we have equipment, printers located at, I would say, probably several thousand customers today. So that doesn't get impacted at all.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","That's not [indiscernible].","Dean A. Scarborough","In fact, we're encouraging customers to use more in-plant printing because it provides the best response capability for certain market segments.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. So the in-plant printing footprint doesn't come down at all?","Dean A. Scarborough","That's correct.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And then secondly on the updated guidance, the $4 million increase in the foreign exchange headwind, how much of that was in the second quarter just reported? And how much is that in the second half of the year?","Mitchell R. Butier","Very little of it was in the second quarter given that where the rates were at that time because for the second quarter, most of it was driven by the euro. Our average FX rate at that time that we use was 1.3. It's now -- what's baked into our second half is roughly 1.25 knowing rates are slightly lower than that now. So of the extra $4 million, I think it's like $1 million or so was Q2, the rest of it is for second half.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. Is there any hedge below the EBIT line?","Mitchell R. Butier","Hedge below the -- no, there's no hedge below the EBIT line.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","That incremental 4 flows all the way down to EPS?","Mitchell R. Butier","Yes.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Raw materials costs, you said, have stabilized for you, but they seem to be coming down particularly on the adhesive side of your Pressure-Sensitive. Have you seen some customers kind of waiting to see where the low-end is going to be and holding off on placing orders? Or is that not a factor in your business?","Dean A. Scarborough","It's generally not a factor, Rosemarie, because the label converting business is -- tends to be a custom on-demand business. So customers order when they need the products. So literally, we ship out about 80% of our orders within 2 days. So it's very unusual for customers to -- or they literally just don't have the physical ability to store a lot of our products, so we don't generally see that kind of activity.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay. That is very helpful. And I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the different businesses in your other specialty converting, what you saw for each one in the quarter and your expectations for the second half in 2013?","Dean A. Scarborough","So the largest business in Other specialty converting is our performance tapes business. It's a business that serves 2 primary markets: one is tapes for diapers, frankly, and the other one is tapes used for bonding in a number of industrial applications, including things like automotive and electronics.","We saw -- we've seen a decent growth in the business the last couple of quarters and expect that to continue going forward as we've been able to capture some new business that's going to roll out now over the next couple of quarters.","The second largest business is Designed and Engineered Solutions, which is a specialty label converting business that serves a diverse set of markets, including things like pressure sensitive postage stamps, battery labels, labels for automotive and other functional products, things like valves [ph] for coffee bags or for food products. That business showed as well decent results for the first half. And then we have a small medical converting business, which has been an investment business for us, good top line growth. It's kind of still an investment, so it doesn't have that much profitability at this point. And then finally, our RFID division is in that category, and we've had a pretty significant year-over-year EBIT improvement in that business. That's now been profitable for 2 quarters in a row.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","And the RFID is closely linked to RBIS, isn't it?","Dean A. Scarborough","It is. Much of the sales of that division are sold to RBIS, correct.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","So if we see RBIS sales growing, then we can assume safely that it is the same case for RFID?","Dean A. Scarborough","We're growing both externally with other markets, and the RBIS RFID sales went up about 35% in the second quarter, so we continue to see growth there.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","And if I may ask one last question. Have you seen any change in the Chinese demand for their own domestic consumption on either the Pressure-Sensitive or the retail business, RBIS?","Dean A. Scarborough","So for Pressure-Sensitive, probably 80% to 90% of the products we sell in China stay in China on consumer goods. So we've seen a rebound since the first quarter, and we expect continued double-digit growth there.","RBIS is completely the opposite story. Most of the products that we sell in China are attached to soft goods, apparel and shoes, that are exported to Western countries. So we have actually a small but growing domestic business for China's retailers and brand owners.","Operator","Our last question is a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The embellishments business is an interesting business and certainly it's leveraging what you have in RBIS, but it seems like it would be an even more difficult supply chain model than even what you do with tags and tickets. Do you agree with that assessment or disagree? And what challenges are you finding there? You mentioned I think 60% growth in the business from a bottom line revenue standpoint, what that contributed in the quarter.","Dean A. Scarborough","Yes. It's pretty small. I mean, it's sub $100 million in terms of revenue. And it's actually, I think, fairly easy to execute. We're selling to the same customers, and we're also using existing assets to do it. So I actually think it's a nice add. It tends to be sold -- the product tends to be sold more to designers, and therefore it has a slightly longer selling cycle, because you've got to get the designers to basically specify the product a couple of seasons ahead when they're planning their work. So we are pleased with the traction so far.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. I appreciate that. Back to the question of linkages, I guess what I was getting at, within Pressure-Sensitive Materials to the extent that you are eliminating much of what was the corporate infrastructure, a lot of that was in R&D, are there any areas where you're going to be particularly concerned about sharing of R&D, sharing of best practices since you are now driving a lot of that to the divisions and to the field as opposed to having it in Pasadena?","Dean A. Scarborough","Yes. I actually think it's a real positive. Our learnings had been that the more you can get your technical people and your marketing people together, you really accelerate the innovation process. And while we have a number of great people here at the research center, frankly it's isolated. It's a bit of a silo. We don't have any businesses, especially now with office products being sold, located anywhere close to here. So we are relocating some people to some of these other locations. And there is a small group of engineers that will also stay here at the corporate center, because in this case it tends to be more for the manufacturing engineering part of the business, so they don't need to be co-located necessarily. So I'm not all that -- I actually think this will enhance our effectiveness.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And to your point earlier that maybe having the corporate create some -- dis-synergies, I guess this is what you were referring to as well.","Dean A. Scarborough","Yes, I think the needs of the businesses, George, are sufficiently different enough. And if you try to manage things at the center, you're trying to average things. In that case, are probably wrong. We're going to get down to a smaller holding company structure that's very small. And we will still have some shared services where it makes sense, where scale really matters like buying things like IT, data, management, health and welfare, pension, et cetera, will still be managed by the center. But fundamentally, the businesses are going to drive what services they want and what investments they want to make.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Well, makes a lot of sense. I guess the last question I had, just housekeeping. You're again expecting proceeds on OCP of I think north of $400 million is how you phrased it. When I look at the balance sheet, when I look at the assets and liabilities held for sales, the net of those 2 is roughly around $350 million. So does that simplistically when you do ultimately collect those proceeds, should we assume there's a gain of whatever $50 million or more that hits you across those 3 figures or from those 3 figures? And then remind me initially when you announced the deal, I think there were proceeds that you talked about of $550 million, but the net of that is the working capital when all is said and done?","Mitchell R. Butier","So the net of the $550 million down to the $400 million, it'll vary depending on when this deal closes. If it were to go all the way to December obviously since it includes free cash flow as well as the net proceeds, that number would go north. So it's sensitive to when the deal actually closes. The difference between the $550 million and the $400 million is due to deal cost and taxes, essentially the 2 largest components, to answer the last part of your question, George. And so that's overall what we're expecting from the transaction. We said approximately $400 million, but it can vary depending on the timing of the close. As far as the gain question that you asked, yes, we do -- are expecting a gain, and just depends again if it were to close today, the cost base of that business will be a little bit higher given the working capital investments you have due to BTS, whereas if it were later the working cap will be lower and so you'd have a slightly higher gain. So it will move quite a bit through the year given the seasonality of the business.","Operator","Mr. Scarborough, I will turn the call back over to you now for your closing remarks.","Dean A. Scarborough","Great. Well, I just like to say that we're on track for the year. We're pleased with the performance in our Pressure-Sensitive Materials business, and we realize we need to accelerate the performance improvement in RBIS. We have a real urgency to deliver on our long-term targets. And that $100 million plus restructuring improvement plan really enables us to enhance our returns, deliver on those margin targets in an uncertain economy, but frankly give us some really nice upside when the economy improves. And we continue to be committed to capital discipline and returning more cash to shareholders. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today.

Please go ahead ma\u2019am.","Cyndy Guenther","Thank you Amanda. Today we\u2019ll discuss our preliminary unaudited second quarter results.","The non-GAAP financial measures that we use are defined qualified and reconciled with GAAP on schedules A-2 to A-4 of the financial statements accompanying today\u2019s earnings release.","We remind you that we\u2019ll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results.

And good morning everyone. I\u2019m happy to report another solid quarter with sales up 4% on organic basis, continued expansion in adjusted operating margin and mid-teens growth in adjusted earnings per share. We also delivered a $45 million increase in free cash flow for the quarter. As you know we are focused on achieving our long-term financial goals, both four-year commitments set through this year-end and new targets through 2018. I\u2019m very pleased to say we\u2019re on track against these goals for 2015 and a longer time.","That said it\u2019s fair to say we expect to arrive here in different way than we had planned for the current year. The pressure-sensitive materials business delivered exceptionally strong results in the second quarter which were offset by weakness in retail, branding and information solutions.","So let me give you some perspective on each of the segments. As I said, PSM had a great quarter with better than expected organic growth, combined with significant margin expansion. Organic growth was positive in all geographies, with Europe the strongest. Growth in China remained slow albeit better than pace we saw in the first quarter, reflecting weaker economic conditions there. We continue to benefit from growth of higher-value market segments in Europe and North America, which has been a key strategic focus for us. Graphics, for example, grew organically at a high single digit rate in these regions. While sales of Specialty Label products and Performance Tapes grew at mid-to-high single-digit rates.","Despite recent slowdown in Asia, believes in long-term growth of these markets and are investing to support growth. We\u2019re adding three new coating assets in Asia, providing additional capacity for higher-margin segments including Tapes, Specialty Products and Durables. And our project to recapitalize Graphics business, which was part of the major restructuring program in Europe undertaken last year, is now complete. At the same time we are pursuing growth of less differentiated products but with an emphasis on improving profitability through disciplined pricing, as well as, reduction in both complexity and costs, allowing us to be more competitive in these segments.","Our Strategic course correction which we\u2019ve discussed over the past couple of quarters to rebalance the price, volume and mix dynamics in pressure-sensitive materials is working. Repeating our long-term target for organic sales growth and that growth combined with ongoing productivity and a favorable raw material environment, is driving record operating margin. We will continue to execute this strategy, leveraging our strengths in innovation, quality and service across the entire materials portfolio.","Now let\u2019s turn to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. The results for the quarter were clearly disappointing. Sales declined 2% on an organic basis and operating margin contracted. The priorities for RBIS are very clear, accelerated top line sales growth for the core business and expand operating margins and return on capital. I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll get this business growing again and drive return above the cost of capital before 2018.","We are winning in higher-value segments of business. A good example is the performance athletic segment, where customers value global consistency and design capabilities that we offer. Growth in this segment has been consistently strong, roughly 17% annually over the last couple of years as we had taken share and leverage the full breadth of product solutions, including RFID and external embellishments. RFID is ramping up now as more retailers begin to adopt this new technology. We are the go-to supplier in this market with a robust pipeline of new programs that are building momentum. We have better than 50% share of RFID for apparel today; expects to maintain that leadership position through 2018 based on our competitive advantages. While, RFID sales has been down in first half of 2015, reflecting the timing of various rollouts. We still expects sales to be up 15% to 20% for the full year, with growth of better than 35% in back half.","External embellishments represent another strong growth opportunity where we\u2019re gaining traction. Over the past two years, we have seen this business grow roughly 30% annually albeit off a small base. We expect to continue growing these products at better than 20% annually, becoming $100 million plus business for us by 2018. Our strategy for value, contemporary and fast fashion retailers and brands needs and will change. Each represents roughly 60% of market for apparel labels. And we can win in these segments. We will reduce our fixed costs, localize material sourcing and respond more quickly to changes in customer needs by decentralizing decision making. We are rapidly moving to business model that will be competitive for all segments. This strategic shift actually shares a common theme with pressure-sensitive materials. In both cases, focused on reducing cost and complexity to be more competitive in less differentiated segments of the market, these aren\u2019t short terms cost [indiscernible], it\u2019s part of our long term strategy to win in the marketplace, expand margins and improve returns. I\u2019m confident that we have the right leadership team and employees in place to make that happen. And we will share the details of our plan during the October earnings call.","In summary, I\u2019m confident in our ability to achieve our long-term financial targets through 2018, adjusting course as needed to deliver double-digit EPS growth and top quartile return on total capital. We\u2019ll continue to deliver strong free cash flow and we\u2019re committed to returning majority of free cash to shareholders over long-term.","Now I turn the call over to Anne.","Anne Bramman","Thanks Dean and hello everyone. I will supplement Dean\u2019s commentary with more color on the financial results for the company in present. In Q2 the company delivered a 14% increase in adjusted earnings per share and 4% organic sales growth. Currency translation reduced reported sales by 9.5% with approx $0.10 impact to EPS. Adjusted operating margin in the second quarter improved 140 basis points, to 9.5% as the benefit of productivity initiatives, higher volume and the net impact of price and raw material input costs more than offset higher employee-related expenses.","The Company realized about $18 million of incremental savings from restructuring cost, net of 2015 expenses. The adjusted tax rate was 34%, consistent with the anticipated full-year tax rate in the low to mid 30% range.","Free cash flow was $130 million, an increase of $45 million compared to Q2 of last year, driven by improved working capital productivity and higher earnings. In the first half, the Company repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares, at a cost of $62 million, and paid $66 million in dividends. As Dean indicated, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders, and have sufficient capacity to continue our buyback program. Consistent with our philosophy and strategy, we continue to be disciplined and opportunistic with share repurchases, buying relatively more when the share price dips, and relatively less when the share price is higher.","Now looking at the segments. Pressure-sensitive Materials sales were up approximately 6% on an organic basis. Label and Packaging Materials sales were up mid single digits, as were the combined sales for Performance Tapes and Graphics. On a regional basis, North America delivered another quarter of low single digit growth, while Western Europe was up high single digits, benefiting from above average growth in Graphics and continued strength in products for labeling applications.","Organic growth for emerging regions improved compared to the first quarter, but continued to be relatively slow, mid single digits, due to softness in China, as Dean mentioned.","PSM\u2019s adjusted operating margin, a record 12.3% for the segment, was up over two full points compared to last year. This improvement was driven by productivity, including continuing material for engineering savings, and our recently increased level of restructuring activities, as well as fixed cost leverage from strong volume growth. We also saw a net benefit from price and raw material input costs, as we continued to re-enforce our pricing discipline, particularly in the less differentiated segments of the market.","Both North America and Europe continued to experience benefits from product mix, as both regions had faster growth in higher margin segment. Sequentially, adjusted operating margin for PSM expanded by 80 basis points, primarily due to incremental savings from restructuring and other productivity initiatives.","The Retail Branding and Information Solutions sales declined approximately 2% on an organic basis, and adjusted operating margin contracted by 40 basis points. Several factors contributed to organic sales decline in the quarter.","Once again, with sales up high single digits, we saw growth in performance segments for both Europe and North American based retailers and brand owners. However, we continue to experience declines in the value in contemporary segments, reflecting the share loss that we\u2019ve been speaking to over the last few quarters. Additionally, sales of apparel labels for Europe-based retailers and brand owners was further impacted by reduced orders for apparel, due to the impact of the euro devaluation on the cost of imported goods.","As expected, sales for RFID products declined due to reduced demand from a couple of large European accounts. However, as Dean mentioned, sales in the second half are expected to grow in the mid 30% range.","Returning to the total segment, the decline in adjusted operating margin reflects the impact of the lower sales, including reduced fixed cost leverage and negative price and mix, as well as higher employee-related costs. These challenges were partially offset by the benefit of productivity initiatives. We are focused on reducing costs and streamlining our processes, to position ourselves to grow and win in all the segments.","Sales in Vancive Medical Technologies declined about #% on an organic basis, following an 11% increase in the first quarter. Given the application-specific nature of orders in this business, we do expect sales growth to be somewhat choppy by quarter. We continue to anticipate that organic sale growth for Vancive will be faster than the Company average for the full year. The segment\u2019s operating loss was reduced by nearly $1 million, due to productivity actions. The team continues to focus on the milestones needed to drive long-term growth of this platform, with the objective of achieving a positive contribution to earnings by year end.","Turning now to our outlook for the full year, we have raised our estimate for organic sales growth modestly, to a range of 3.5% to 4%, reflecting the strength of PSM in the first half. We have maintained our adjusted EPS guidance, as we believe that out-performance by PSM will offset the combined impacts of weaker than planned performance by RBIS, and a higher than expected share count.","We outlined some of the key contributing factors to this guidance on Slide 8 of our supplemental presentation material. Several of the assumptions underlying our previous guidance have changed modestly. Specifically, for the full year, at recent exchange rates, we estimate that currency translation will reduce net sales by approximately 8%, a slight improvement from the rates in April. Our outlook for the impact of currency translation of pretax earnings and EPS has not changed.","As discussed, we now estimate average shares outstanding, on a fully diluted in the range of 90 million to 92 million shares. We divested a small, roughly breakeven industrial printer product line in Europe during the second quarter, which resulted in the recognition of a loss, and some related exit costs. We\u2019ve included the loss and associated costs in our pro forma adjustment for the quarter, raising our estimate from restructuring costs and other items by $0.03, to $0.43 per share. As a result, while our guidance remains for adjusted EPS remains unchanged, we have reduced our estimate for reported EPS by $0.03.","Summing up, we delivered another good quarter, and remained on track to achieve our 2015 and 2018 targets.","Now we\u2019ll open your call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird & Co. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Ghansham Panjabi","Yes, hey, guys, good morning. Can you first give us some color in what you\u2019re seeing in Brazil and China at current? And particularly if there was a change in the monthly sales rate, on a year-over-year basis, during the second quarter? The economy there seems quite fluid and secure, so if you\u2019re seeing any deviation in these regions, just on a monthly basis?","Dean Scarborough","Mitch you want to take that?","Mitch Butier","Sure. So looking at Brazil overall, I\u2019d say things, we\u2019ve got decent growth on an organic basis in Latin America in general, including Brazil, but it is all due to pricing. The volumes that we are seeing in Brazil have softened quite a bit the last couple quarters, to be quite honest. And within China, we\u2019ve been seeing softening within China. We talked about it last quarter, and we\u2019re continuing to see that again this quarter.","Ghansham Panjabi","And just on the \u2013 any comments on Europe as well?","Mitch Butier","On Europe? Well Europe specifically, Western Europe, extremely strong growth is what we\u2019re seeing, and the emerging markets all have been softer. So we\u2019ve seen a shift here, over the last couple of quarters, where Western Europe is actually growing faster than emerging markets within Europe.","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay, and then just on PSM, can you help us bridge, in any way, the improvement in operating profit year-over-year? There are a ton of moving parts with FX, and I would assume some level of impact from lower raw material costs, as well. So can you just break up a few of those pieces? Whatever you can share?","Dean Scarborough","Well, I think it\u2019s a good question. Every region has a slightly different story, so it is complicated, Ghansham. We have some markets where raw materials are more of a benefit. Europe it\u2019s actually not a benefit, because a lot of the commodity cost reductions are oil-based. And in fact there\u2019s some shortages in certain resins that are causing it to actually increase prices right now in the European market. I\u2019d say overall that the largest impact has been our focus in growing in the higher margin segments, especially in Europe and in North America. So we\u2019ve got quite a bit of productivity from material reengineering, from restructuring, from growth in higher margin segments, and raw materials also had been a benefit, but they\u2019re not the biggest factor in the quarter. And obviously even with the slower market growth in emerging markets, specifically Asia, we\u2019re still seeing margin improvements in that region.","Mitch Butier","And the only thing I\u2019d like to add Ghansham is just \u2013 one thing I\u2019d add here is just that mix of the key component, we\u2019re talking about driving growth in the high value segment as being spoke to. And while we had some of the net price benefit we received, it\u2019s really around our focus on expanding the margins within the less differentiated segments and holding onto that deflation where we are seeing it some of the less differentiated segments. [Indiscernible]","Ghansham Panjabi","That\u2019s helpful thanks so much.","Cyndy Guenther","Operator do we have another call?","Operator","We do indeed. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner from Barclays Capital. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Scott Gaffner","Thanks, good morning.","Dean Scarborough","Hi Scott.","Scott Gaffner","Hi, Dean. Just following up on that question for a minute on the raw material capture within pressure-sensitive materials, you were up, it looked like a couple hundred basis points operating margins, adjusted within this segment in the quarter, was up 160 in the first. Should we expect those sorts of gains to moderate as you \u2013 the lag between freight cost catches up in the second half of the year? Or these other issues around mix and the higher value more than offset any sort of compression there?","Dean Scarborough","Yes, I think there\u2019s a couple of factors. I think we had said at the end of the first quarter, we had a little bit of uncertainty of how raw material commodity cost would be reflected in the back half of the year. I think I mentioned that in Europe, we are actually see something raw material inflation, even despite this. And then our fourth quarter this year is a bit challenging because of the 53rd week last year moved from I would say a normal amount of profit into the first quarter of this year, and so the comparisons year-over-year in Q4 are going to be a bit challenging. So that\u2019s a bit of it. I think that, it has no economic impact on the business. It\u2019s just a number of good shipping days in the quarter shipping days in the quarter was less this year than last year.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. And moving to RBIS, I think you mentioned we were coming up with a new plan there maybe to decentralize the organization a little bit. But you have been on this footprint optimization within RBIS for a number of years, closing down a significant number of facilities and moving to digital printing in order to improve response times. I\u2019m just curious, I know you said you\u2019d share more details in October. But why this sudden shift? Is it more a volume issue, or is it a cost issue that\u2019s causing you to make this course correction?","Dean Scarborough","Yes, I think, we used the term sudden shift. So we had a very versus \u2013 as you know, we\u2019re very milestone based here, and we expected to see organic growth in the second quarter. So when we realized in the middle of the quarter that we weren\u2019t going to hit those targets, we understood that we needed to be more aggressive in our shift to capturing share in the value in contemporary segments. So as always, in retrospect, I think, there\u2019s a reflection that oh, shoot, we should have probably done this a couple quarters earlier. So shame on us. We do have the planning underway. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening a little bit more in value and contemporary, and that is more of the buying decisions are taking place where the products are made rather than centrally in the term market since we\u2019ve seen more of that shift.","So we need to give our teams in the regions more authority in terms of what business that they want to bid on, what raw materials they want to use. That was more centrally controlled before. So we have seen a shift in buying behavior for a lot of customers, so that\u2019s one of the major reasons that we need to move there.","I think also the footprint consolidation has gone quite well, actually. Because we\u2019re in a position new where we\u2019re a lot more productive than we were a few years ago, we have better service, quality, productivity and safety metrics. So going forward, I think we\u2019ll still tweak some of the footprint actions. But I actually feel better about our ability to execute across all segments today than I certainly would have five years ago.","Mitch, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything you\u2019d want to add to that?","Mitch Butier","Thank you. You captured it well. Basically this is something that we know [indiscernible] that we\u2019ve been speaking to over the last couple of quarters, about our performance relative to the market and the need to get more competitive in the less differentiated segments. As we saw what came in the culmination through Q2, we decided we needed to get it much more aggressive to get more competitive by reducing complexity, streamlining our processes and reducing cost to be able to be more price competitive and win. This business needs to consistently grow. Like what we\u2019re seeing in pressure-sensitive materials and expand its margins in line with the targets we\u2019ve laid out in 2018. And we\u2019re committed to that and confident we\u2019ll be able to get there with the adjustments to the strategy that we\u2019re talking about.","Scott Gaffner","Great thanks for all the detail.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open, please go ahead.","George Staphos","Hi, everyone, good morning. Thanks for all the details.","Dean Scarborough","Hi.","Anne Bramman","Hi George.","George Staphos","How are you doing? I guess \u2013 I wanted to start off if possible with \u2013 similar question as, I think, Ghansham was asking with PSM in terms of the bridge in RBSI. How much of the EBIT loss \u2013 or not loss, but negative variance was driven by the revenue drop and the incremental margin on that, how much of that is labor inflation? And if you could put some details or some color on it that would be helpful, and I have some follow-ones on RBIS.","Mitch Butier","George, maybe I\u2019ll make a high-level comment first, and of those things that I don\u2019t think we had is that a slowdown European brands and retailers, because of the increase in the cost of clothing. Because fundamentally, they\u2019re sourcing from dollar-denominated regions. And it looks to us like \u2013 well, actually, our customers are telling us that they\u2019re being a lot more conservative about laying an inventory into the business. So that was a bit of a surprise for us in the second quarter.","As far as the margin delta\u2026","Dean Scarborough","Yes so overall question about normal wage inflation. But we saw the normal level of wage inflation that you\u2019d expect within the quarter. So it\u2019s really around the volume price and mix elements were the biggest single driver for the reduction in these margins that we\u2019ve seen, the amount of productivity that we always do, but the real shift here was the volume price mix dynamic.","George Staphos","Okay. I guess, again, taking a step back, this business has been a defined segment for over ten years, you started building it out in the early 2000s. It has never hit your margin targets. And I wish I could be more diplomatic about it, but aside from maybe one quarter or two where you were over 10%, it\u2019s never performed as you had expected, as the latest strategy from your people within the division would have presented. So taking a step back, what should give us confidence that this latest plan from within the organization and RBIS team will get you the performance that, frankly, we would expect and that your capital providers should deserve, given what\u2019s been the history?","Dean Scarborough","Well George it\u2019s a great question. In our 2018 targets, we basically laid out a plan where the margins for these businesses will be converging. And to your to your point right now, they\u2019re not. They\u2019re actually diverging because we are off-track on the improvement targets that we had laid in for RBIS, and pressure-sensitive materials has done better. And so we clearly understand that to have an adequate portfolio for investors, these two businesses have to converge. So that\u2019s job one. We get it.","Secondly, I believe and the management team believes that we can improve the margins in this business. And to do so, we just need to be more competitive in 60% of the market that we\u2019re not competitive there. So it\u2019s \u2013 I think that the task going forward is fairly straightforward. It\u2019ll take us a few quarters to get there. But I don\u2019t know if I can give you comfort other than just saying that in every single other area of the business, I think we\u2019ve delivered on our commitments. And if we think we can\u2019t, George, we\u2019ll do something with the portfolio.","George Staphos","Understood. And I appreciate the thoughts in the question \u2013 I mean answer, Dean, on that. From where we sit, what would you have us most closely evaluate? Intraquarter is obviously difficult for obvious reasons. But during reporting season that would \u2013 aside from margins hopefully moving higher as you expect, that would tell the visitor and investment community that you\u2019re on track? I seem to remember that you needed typically 2% revenue growth in that segment just to cover inflation.","So should we be seeing 3% or better revenue growth in the segment by fourth quarter or first quarter? And what other one or two things would you have us focus on here relative to RBIS? And kudos to everyone in the pressure-sensitive. It\u2019s your largest segment. You knocked it out of the park. I don\u2019t want to overspend the time on RBIS, but if you could answer that question, I\u2019ll turn it over from there.","Dean Scarborough","Well clearly, George, revenue growth is important. So let\u2019s just reflect again on the RBIS business. Apparel unit growth is 1% to 2% per year and our focus has been really to gain a share in this marketplace through our various initiatives. We\u2019ve been successful in a couple of segments, actually. Maybe a little bit of the frustrating part is that we talked before about performance athletic, we\u2019re doing extremely well. And here\u2019s the other thing that\u2019s happening. RFID, I believe, is truly at an inflection point. So we are going to see pretty rapid in the back half of the year due to RFID.","So, I do anticipate good volume growth in the back half of the year for RBIS. Number one, we have easier comps. Number two, there has been definitely an acceleration of RFID programs being launched, especially in North America, and we have gained a significant share of a lot of those programs. I can\u2019t be specific about the retailers. But I can tell you that we\u2019re pretty enthusiastic about the way that looks. And it\u2019s a nice profitable chunk of business. And our external embellishment business continues to accelerate and grow at the same time.","So we believe that there is the opportunities there, but I think the key metric for us is all about volume growth and continuing to capture share in the business.","George Staphos","Okay, I\u2019ll turn it over, thank you, Dean.","Dean Scarborough","Sure.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Adam Josephson","Thanks, good morning, everyone. And forgive me in advance if I asked anything you already addressed, I got on a bid late. And one capital allocation question, can you talk about your appetite for share repurchases at these levels, appreciating that you guys are price-sensitive buyers of your stock?","Anne Bramman","We\u2019ve talked about this on past calls, and it was in the \u2013 what we talked about a little bit earlier was that we do have a pretty disciplined approach. We are very committed to returning to shareholders. We take a long-term view to this. So as we mentioned, we are more opportunistic when we have bits in the share price, and we pull back a little bit when we see rapid increases in the share prices for what we saw over the quarter. We are still very committed and do, as I mentioned, take a long-term view to this.","Adam Josephson","Thank you. And on TSM, just in terms of your expectations for margins sequentially, do you expect a significant sequential decline, just in light of the rolling off of the raw materials benefits or some other items that you called out? Or do you think they could in fact be fairly stable sequentially? And if so, why?","Anne Bramman","So in general in material piece, you do not see a change sequentially on that. What we\u2019re seeing on the back half is the natural shift in the mix for the materials group. And quite frankly, Q4 with the calendar shift is about $0.10 to $0.14 of impact of a bad guy to the headwinds for the second half of the year. That\u2019s really a big driver when you look at it overall.","Adam Josephson","You\u2019re talking $0.10 to $0.14 down from a year ago, Anne?","Anne Bramman","Yes.","Adam Josephson","And so the raw material, you still expect some benefit in the third quarter from raw materials, sounds like?","Anne Bramman","Not sequentially, no.","Adam Josephson","Okay. So you see modest inflation growth into Q3?","Anne Bramman","Yes.","Adam Josephson","That\u2019s what I was refereeing to. Okay, right, right, that was the gist of my question. And then in terms of the modest bump to your PSM \u2013 or your sales guidance, and that was attributable to PSM, was western \u2013 forgiven me if I missed this, but was western Europe the sole reason for that upward tweak to your sales expectation? And if so, are there segments within Western Europe are particularly strong for you at this juncture?","Anne Bramman","So maybe it was an overall sales improvement from PSM and they delivered 6% organic. So it wasn\u2019t one particular region that drove the increase in the overall guidance. It was just general overperformance by PSM.","Mitch Butier","And within PSM, we\u2019re seeing this strong performance in Western Europe pretty much across the board. But specifically, we are growing faster in the higher value segments such as graphics?","Adam Josephson","But just geographically, Mitch or Anne, any changes is other than \u2013 what regions were stronger than you had previously expected other than Western Europe?","Mitch Butier","Western Europe is the standout.","Okay.","Mitch Butier","Should be the takeaway.","Adam Josephson","Thanks a lot, Mitch, appreciate it.","Mitch Butier","Sure.","Operator","And our next question\u2026","Cyndy Guenther","Do you have any other questions?","Operator","Yes indeed. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with J.P. Morgan Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Jeff Zekauskas","Hi, your SG&A costs were down, I think $23 million in the quarter. How much of that was currency?","Mitch Butier","Currency basically made up a lion share of that and then productivity offset natural inflation, as well as some other investments.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay. In pressure-sensitive adhesives, were sequential prices in the United States up or down or the same?","Mitch Butier","We don\u2019t give specific color around the various regions of what\u2019s going on. What I will say broadly speaking, we are \u2013 we have seen sequentially some price reductions in some of the areas of segments where we are \u2013 have relatively higher variable margins, and where we\u2019ve seen some deflation. We\u2019ve basically been passing along to customers in some targeted areas. But we are, as we said, starting to see some inflation, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re watching out for right now. The key thing here about the net benefit that we talked about earlier that we saw that we talked about before this quarter, is really around holding onto it in the lower value segments where the returns we were getting on those segments were not necessarily the EVA positive, and using this to really force the discipline to get the EVA on those lower, less differentiated segments at above breakeven if you will.","Jeff Zekauskas","In the quarter, your severance costs were a little less than $17 million. How long will it be before you pay that out?","Cyndy Guenther","You\u2019re asking specifically about the timing of the cash-out on restructuring?","Jeff Zekauskas","Exactly right, yes, on the $16.8 million that you booked in the quarter.","Cyndy Guenther","So it should take several months for that to happen, it depends on the geography and several other factors.","Jeff Zekauskas","Several months. Okay. And then I guess lastly, the PSA growth of 6%, relative to, I don\u2019t know, pick a unit in a global GDP, U.S. GDP is way high. And obviously there\u2019s all kinds of weakness in the offshore markets. Is this you, or is this the pressure-sensitive adhesive market in general? Historically you said that PSA growth turns out to be a leading economic indicator. How do you read the overall organic growth of PSA and the strength in Europe?","Dean Scarborough","While thinking we had a competitor report numbers yesterday, they also had strong organic growth. Clearly for me, Europe is growing quite nicely. I think there\u2019s a bit of a rebound there in activity and probably easier comps from prior years. North America, as you saw last year, we didn\u2019t see much growth at all.","Jeff Zekauskas","Right.","Dean Scarborough","Actually we had a couple of deals and it was in the all the mid-single digits. I would suggest that that bodes pretty well for economic activity.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay. And then lastly, you talked about 30% growth in RBIS in the second half. What\u2019s the motivation for that?","Dean Scarborough","RFID.","Anne Bramman","RFID.","Jeff Zekauskas","Sorry, RSID. And those are new wins?","Dean Scarborough","Yes, because fundamentally, Jeff, we had moved from a scenario where retailers are not asking if or if RSID is a payback. It\u2019s all about when and how we should deploy. So we have a number of major implementations by retailers that are going to hit in the back half of this year. And it\u2019s all about getting the inventory accuracy required so they can serve their customers online, from mobile devices, as well as in the stores. We definitely have seen a shift in behavior in the RFID. So it\u2019s pretty exciting actually.","Jeff Zekauskas","Like in rough terms, what are your RFID revenues?","Dean Scarborough","That will be about a less than $150 million this year","Jeff Zekauskas","Less than $150 million. Okay, great, thank you so much.","Dean Scarborough","Sure.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Chris Kapsch with BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Chris Kapsch","Yes. Good morning, just wanted to get a little more granular on this variance and pressure sensitive. You mentioned a number of contributors, productivity, operating leverage, mix, and raws. But you also said that it was more than offsetting \u2013 benefits were more than offsetting increased employee costs. But your SG&A costs being down as much as they were, albeit partly from FX, somewhat contradictory to that. So I\u2019m just trying to reconcile, how much of a headwind was this employee cost or conversely, were these lower SG&A costs really a big source of margin improvement in pressure sensitive?","Mitch Butier","Overall, it\u2019s the amount of employee cost deflation is just a normal wage inflation that we have within this business.","Chris Kapsch","That\u2019s what you\u2019re talking about, local currency, local currency employee costs?","Mitch Butier","Local currency. As far as the SG&A overall, if you look at the \u2013 basically the lion\u2019s share of that shift in dollar terms for the total Company was currency. And then you had wage inflation, some investments we\u2019ve been making, we\u2019ve been making organic investments within the high-value segments such as our performance tapes business, and then all of that being offset by productivity.","Chris Kapsch","Okay.","Mitch Butier","Sequentially, the margin expansion PSM, Chris, is just pretty much productivity, a good chunk of that being restructuring, implementing the restructuring programs in the beginning of the second quarter. When we were talking through previously around increasing our competitiveness in less differentiated segments to implement some restructuring to basically get more cost competitive, to improve the margins in those sub-segments.","Chris Kapsch","Okay. And it sounds like on a year-over-year basis, productivity was also the largest contributor to the variance. Was raw material benefit the second largest? Just trying to get a little more granular on the benefit from raws.","Mitch Butier","The volume mix was the second largest.","Chris Kapsch","Okay.","Mitch Butier","It\u2019s very consistent with where we were. We\u2019ve mentioned the benefit on net price, if you will, between raws and the pricing element, because it\u2019s not negligible this quarter. But still, the biggest single item was productivity, followed by volume and mix, consistent with what we\u2019ve been saying and talking about in the last few quarters.","Chris Kapsch","Okay, got you. And then earlier in the Q&A, you were touching upon trends on a regional basis, and I think you were referring to trends during the second quarter. Just wondering if you could provide any color about order demand trends thus far into the third quarter. Albeit, we\u2019re just a month into it, but just by region if possible. Any color on sequential trends thus far into the third quarter.","Mitch Butier","So overall the trends we\u2019re seeing are consistent with the guidance we\u2019ve been giving. If you recall, going into April last quarter, it\u2019s a little bit softer than what we had seen in the first quarter. It then picked up dramatically in materials and in RBIS it didn\u2019t. So is it shows, again, lack of forward visibility within the business overall. So to answer your question, going into Q3, we\u2019re seeing trends relatively consistent with what we saw in Q2. So RBIS down a little bit from where we were this time last year, and PSM showing growth consistent with particular strength in North America and Europe.","Dean Scarborough","We are in the Ramadan period. So by the way, a year-over-year comparison because of South Asia for us in RBIS are really tough.","Chris Kapsch","Thank you.","Dean Scarborough","It\u2019s again consistent with our guidance.","Chris Kapsch","Okay. And then looking back historically at RBIS, particularly the Paxar business, there\u2019s always been seasonality and strength in the second and fourth quarters. And I\u2019m just wondering, with the sluggishness you\u2019re seeing, I know there\u2019s some specific reasons, but is there any change in this historical seasonal pattern in the RBIS business in your view, that\u2019s contributing to some of the lagging performance here?","Dean Scarborough","I don\u2019t think so. I mean yes, there are slight variations in the way retailers buy, I\u2019d say overtime, that seasonality gets smooth. RFID is also going to impact that as well, because that tends to be very chunky. But fundamentally, I would say no. I would expect the fourth quarter, the RBIS to be stronger than the third quarter. But not as strong as the second.","Chris Kapsch","I see, and just on the capacity additions that you mentioned you\u2019d be making, I think in Asia, I think you said those are focused on some of your higher-margin products, tapes, graphics. Are those fungible investments, or will those be dedicated assets for those product lines? And then are those, in the investments you\u2019re making, it doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s moving the needle on your overall CapEx expectations. Just wanted a little clarity on that, thank you.","Mitch Butier","So those assets are dedicated. Within China, they\u2019re focused on specialties, labels, and tapes. And then within Europe they\u2019re focused on graphics. And as far as they\u2019re not having meaningful impact, these were part of our plan all along as far as level of investments. So what you\u2019ll see within TSM, we\u2019ll talk about the major points of investment as they shift from one region \u2013 or one initiative to another year-over-year. But we have these types of investments about yearly.","Dean Scarborough","Actually, Chris, these investments are just about up and running. So they\u2019ve been part of our existing run rate.","Mitch Butier","The graphics one is actually up and run beginning in Q2. The rest of them should be by the end of Q3, early Q4.","Chris Kapsch","I see thank you.","Anne Bramman","Thanks Chris.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup Global Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Anthony Pettinari","Good morning. Just a follow-up on Jeff\u2019s question. In PSN, this is another quarter where growth in Europe seems to be outstripping other regions. Just to clarify, is that a more case of under-penetration of the product in Europe that might run its course at some point, or are you actually seeing stronger underlying demand from consumers in Europe?","Dean Scarborough","Anthony, that\u2019s a great question. Europe, PSM, the market has outperformed North America now for about three years in a row. And honestly, it is very difficult to understand why. We have had several different hypotheses over the last three years. Pressure-sensitive years, [indiscernible] does have lower penetration in Europe. So that could be a cause, but","Mitch Butier","It\u2019s a single application that\u2019s driving this overall. So we are seeing some higher growth in areas that might be leading to more export markets. So you\u2019d expect that, given the lower euro, that they\u2019re benefiting somewhat from that. That\u2019s a small factor. Another small factor, there\u2019s been some regulatory shift around some larger labels, sized that require larger font sizes and more nutritional information, for example.","So can\u2019t point to any one item, though, and say this is what\u2019s really driving it. So it\u2019s a number of smaller factors. And just in general, western Europe, what we\u2019re seeing and obviously what a key competitor report recently are seeing, it\u2019s just improved growth trajectories here.","Anthony Pettinari","Got it, got it. And then just more broadly in the PSM business, given the very strong results in the past few quarters, could you look at revising the long-term margin targets that you outlined at the last Analyst Day?","Dean Scarborough","I don\u2019t think that we would do that mid-year. So it\u2019s something that we\u2019ll keep under consideration as we go forward for the year. We only have a couple of quarters under our belt so far. So we\u2019d like to see how \u2013 the volatility right now in the world is a bit strange. I will say we\u2019ve got emerging markets slowing, mature markets speeding up. We have inflation in some regions, deflation in others, and there\u2019s a lot of moving parts right now.","So, yes, I don\u2019t think \u2013 we\u2019re not going to revise the guidance immediately.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay.","Anne Bramman","We\u2019re testing new limits and we\u2019re committed to continuing to test those new limits, and we\u2019re committed to continuing to test those new limits, and it\u2019s really about having a balanced strategy of growth as well as the margin expansion that we\u2019ve seen so far.","Anthony Pettinari","Fair enough, fair enough. And then just switching to RBIS. The value of contemporary segments, you referenced share loss, I think in the back half of last year. And if I remember the commentary from last quarter\u2019s call, there was a sense that had stabilized or maybe even reversed a little bit. And this quarter, maybe you lost some additional share. Is that an accurate timeline or characterization of your market share and value over the last year or so? It was down late last year and year to date it\u2019s been flattish? Or have you seen share loss accelerate? If can you give any color there.","Mitch Butier","Anthony we don\u2019t actually have a read on share for Q2. We just don\u2019t have any of the apparel in force data that would match up to that. Because remember, our sales basically precede by a couple months what we actually see as far as import volumes. When we spoke in Q1, because it seemed to be stabilizing a little bit, we\u2019ve since seen the import data coming in for Q1. As you recall, it was relatively choppy because the strikes at the port. But overall, import line was relatively strong. It did stabilized a bit, trends going the right way. The trend\u2019s still going the right way in the U.S., it\u2019s Europe where we have had the challenge for the reasons we talked about earlier.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Operator","And our next question is a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","George Staphos","Thanks, hi guys. A couple of quickies, I don\u2019t remember if you mentioned it on the call, if you did, I missed it. Why the taking up the share count guidance for the year? I think you raised it by one million or two million shares.","Anne Bramman","So we didn\u2019t buy back as many shares as we had planned in the second quarter, and so we back and revised some of our estimates for the full year.","George Staphos","Okay, so it\u2019s just a question of price to stock, but it\u2019s not necessarily indicative of what you might have before you turn toward other capital allocation decisions?","Anne Bramman","Well, we also had a lot of dilution in the second quarter, especially right at the very end of the quarter as the share price will ultimately have a lot of options that became of the money. So that was an element of it as well.","George Staphos","Okay. Thank you for that. And to RFID, can you remind us, what kind of payback period are your customers seeing on initial rollout of an RFID program? And if we could bracket the mid-30s growth that you expect to see in the second half of the year, you said a number of customers, I believe, Dean, Is that 5, is that 12, is it 2? Is there way to \u2013 if not to the single point, is there a way to bracket how many customers are bringing on these implementations? Thank you, and good luck in the quarter.","Dean Scarborough","Thanks. I think from in terms of numbers of customers, we have at least half a dozen retailers, there\u2019s probably a few more, ones they I know of. And we actually have a big application outside of the kernel as well. That for me also bodes well, we believe that RFID has relevance in other verticals other than apparel, so that was kind of a good early warning signal.","I can\u2019t recall the first part of your question.","George Staphos","The first part of the question was, just what kind of payback period are your customers seeing when they roll this out?","Dean Scarborough","Yes, I think, that\u2019s a good question. I\u2019m not sure \u2013 it all has a good ROI. And retailers are, as you might guess, reluctant to share with us exactly what the payback is because at the same time we\u2019re working with them, we\u2019re negotiating pricing for RFID tags. But I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s got to be less than two years, or otherwise the retailers wouldn\u2019t do it. And I think it really depends on the retailer. And a lot of it, again, is about customer satisfaction, driving higher sales growth, merging their online, their mobile and their in source. So I can tell by the \u2013 I think, I mentioned this in last call, I was at the RFID show and talked to at least a dozen retailers and not one of them had questions about if there was a payback. So it tells me that nothing is pretty good.","George Staphos","Dean, one, maybe follow-on, and perhaps you can\u2019t comment on this, but presumably when you\u2019re talking to your customers, you\u2019re advertising what the benefits are in terms of adopting RFID. So what kind or returns do you advertise to your customers in terms of if they adopt, what kind of payback they\u2019ll get?","Dean Scarborough","It\u2019s formulaic, George, so there\u2019s no one average. So we\u2019ve got a formula which we can share with you because it\u2019s public, it depends on the cost of your garment, it depends on the replenishment rate, and there\u2019s a number of factors that we can give retailers to plug those variables in, and then they can estimate what the benefit and what the value is. So it\u2019s positive in certainly I would say garments above $10 on a unit cost basis, with decent replenishment rates. In other words, a certain percentage of the garments have to be replenished.","George Staphos","Okay, no, that\u2019s very helpful, Dean, I\u2019ll turn it over, thank you very much","Dean Scarborough","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you so much. And at this time I would now like to turn the call back to presenters.","Dean Scarborough","Okay well thanks for everyone for listening today. And I would like to say, I\u2019m really pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making this year, especially in the light of some weaker economic conditions in emerging markets, and certainly the headwinds we have from currency. It takes quite a bit of agility in an organization to continue to deliver against all overall targets, given the shift. So I\u2019d like to thank all of our employees for their continued support, hard work and creativity in meeting our business challenges.","Again, really excited and pleased about our progress in pressure-sensitive materials. It\u2019s great to hit new highs on margin targets. So we\u2019re obviously going to work hard to continue to maintain our progress there. And then for RBIS, we\u2019re committed to getting this business back to the levels that we committed to for 2018, because we realize how important it is to have our portfolio relatively similar from a capital market perspective. So we certainly understand that.","We\u2019re going to make progress, and we\u2019ll all of you on some very specific plans in the October call. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines."]}}
