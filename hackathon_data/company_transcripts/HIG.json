[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference call over to Susan Spivak of Investor Relations. The floor is yours ma\u2019am.","Susan Spivak","Thank you and good morning and thank you for joining us today for our call and webcast on third quarter 2019 earnings. We reported our results yesterday afternoon and posted all the earnings-related materials, including the 10-Q on our website.","For the call today, our speakers are Chris Swift, Chairman and CEO of The Hartford; Doug Elliot, President; and Beth Costello, Chief Financial Officer. Following their prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A period.","Just a few final comments before Chris begins.

Replays of this webcast and an official transcript will be available on The Hartford\u2019s website for one year.","I will now turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher Swift","Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Hartford had an excellent quarter with strong financial results across all our business lines. Third quarter earnings rose 31% over prior year to 548 million or $1.50 per diluted share with lower catastrophe losses and continues to solid investment results.","Our businesses are performing very well. Book value per diluted share excluding a AOCI was up 8% to $42.55 from year-end. The consolidated 12 months core earnings ROE was 12.3% in impressive results in the current market environment.","The strong execution of our strategy is demonstrated by our consistent operating performance quarter-to-quarter delivering on key integration milestones and continuing to invest in our business to enhance customer experience in efficiency.","Dough and Beth will cover results in more detail, but I wanted to touch briefly on a few items. Commercial lines highlights in the third quarter include core earnings of 303 million up 14% over prior year. Solid top-line growth with and without Navigators and renewal pricing rate acceleration compared to the first half of the year.","When we announced the acquisition of Navigators more than a year ago, an important part of our strategy was to broaden our underwriting in product capabilities as a global specialty player and added benefit was the expansion of our distribution relationships into the wholesale channel to serve more risk needs of customers.","Nearly six months have passed since we have closed the Navigators transaction. The progress to-date is on-track and I'm very pleased with collaboration amongst the teams and the positive reception from distribution partners.","Our book is benefiting from the strong pricing tailwinds in the market, providing the opportunity to restore certain product lines within global specialty to targeted financial returns. Personal lines core earnings were 87 million up 85% benefiting from lower catastrophe losses in favorable prior year development.","While up slightly from prior year the underlying combined ratio of 92.3 for personal lines was a strong result. Our primary focus in this business has been returning to growth with new business up 34% in the quarter.","Overall net favorable reserve development for property and casualty was 47 million in the quarter, there were both favorable and unfavorable development in various lines. Our experienced actuarial and claims teams have demonstrated the ability to identify emerging trends within our data, which is used to update our estimates each quarter. Overall, I\u2019m confident in our last reserve estimates.","Group benefits delivered another excellent quarter with core earnings of 141 million up 38% the increase versus per year was driven by favorable loss ratio, higher net investment income and lower amortization of intangibles. This was partially offset by increased investments in technology, claims management and higher commissions related to our voluntary products.","Our total loss ratio improved 4.4 points, driven by favorable disability results partially offset by a deterioration in the life loss ratio. The improvement in the disability continues to come from favorable incidence trends.","Results also benefited from updates to our claim recovery assumptions and the recognition of an experience refund related to New York paid family leave product or accident year 2018. In group life severity was elevated in the quarter however, we don\u2019t see any consistent trend other than normal volatility.","On the top-line, fully insured ongoing premiums were just off slightly versus prior year. Persistency is running slightly below historical trends as we adjust pricing on targeted segments of the Aetna book.","Importantly earned premium on the Aetna book of business is in-line with our deal assumptions and conversions of cases continues to go very well from both the platform and pricing perspective. Overall, we are very pleased with the operational execution and financial performance of group benefits.","Before I turn the call over to Doug, wanted to make a few comments on the microenvironment. The property and casualty industry is facing a number of challenges that have been well documented. Net investment income is under pressure in what is likely a prolonged period of low interest rates effecting new money in overall portfolio yields.","The frequency of severe weather related storms as well as other catastrophic events such as wild fires are elevated, pressuring rates to keep up with CAT trends. Social inflation related to larger claim settlement continues to put pressure on loss cost trends.","However, social inflation is not a new phenomena, we have been monitoring these trends for years taking the appropriate actions to ensure our pricing models in underwriting reflect these realities. To conclude with one quarter left in the year, our experience through the first nine-months is generally consistent with the outlook we provided with no major surprises.","The successful integration and execution of our two recent transactions, strong financial results and capital management demonstrate our strategy is working. It is an exciting time at the Hartford for all our stakeholders, customers, employees, distribution partners and shareholders. I\u2019m confident in our ability to produce consistent results contributing to shareholder value creation.","Now, I will turn the call over to Doug.","Doug Elliot","Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. The Hartford\u2019s property and casual results for the quarter were strong. Top-line growth was fueled by the Navigators acquisitions, while underlying organic growth and commercial lines was a solid 4%.","In personnel lines, new business growth is up significantly from third quarter 201,8 but is moderated from earlier in the year. We are pleased with the underlying returns across all of our Property and Casualty businesses as each continues to execute effectively.","With a relatively benign quarter for catastrophes, as losses were below third quarter 2018. Current year CAT losses in the quarter total $106 million, $63 million less than a year ago.","In aggregate Property and Casualty reported favorable prior year development of $47 million this quarter improving severity trends across workers compensation, small commercial package business and personnel line auto all drove favorable reserve releases.","Partially offsetting these releases was a reserve strengthening and commercial auto liability and general liability driven by some large loss activity.","As Chris has already mentioned, there has been a fair amount of commentary during the quarter regarding social inflation and we are certainly not immune to these unfavorable tort trends. However, keep in mind our Hartford book is made up primarily of smaller customers with lower limit profiles.","In addition, the adverse development cover we purchased on the Navigators wants development provides another layer of protection. Over the past few years, while we have observed higher loss trends, we have also adjusted general liability and commercial auto reserves accordingly. At the same time, we have made underwriting and pricing adjustments to our book in response to these trends. We actively monitor these trends and will continue to take appropriate actions as necessary.","Let me now shift into the results for our business segments. The underlying combined for commercial lines which excludes catastrophes and prior development was 93.9 deteriorating two tenths of a point from last year but a strong performance nonetheless.","As expected the Navigators\u2019 book generated approximately one point of increase on the combined ratio. This was partially offset by favorable non-CAT property results. I'm encouraged by the pricing environment in the quarter.","Our renewal written pricing and standard commercial lines was 2.8% up 40 basis points sequentially from second quarter and up 90 basis points from prior year. This positive pricing change remains somewhat depressed by the current workers compensation pricing environment.","Middle market pricing excluding workers compensation was 5.6% in the quarter up 130 basis points from second quarter and up 180 basis points from the prior year. The strong improvement reflects the rate actions we are taking across our core lines. Given industry loss trends and operating performance in these non-workers compensation lines, I expect this pricing trend to persist.","Let's now take a look inside our commercial line business units. Small commercial continued it is excellent performance with an underlying combined ratio at 87.9. The margin improvement versus last year was driven primarily by lower non-GAAP property losses and lower underwriting expenses.","Written premium was flat to prior year due to renewal written pricing decreases in workers compensation and the completion of the new business rollover from the Foremost renewal rights transaction. Excluding Foremost new business premium growth was up a very strong 13% for the quarter driven by workers compensation and package business.","We expect continued new business growth to come from the launch of our next generation package offering we call Spectrum. This is much more than just a new product release. With this modular policy and the enhanced platform that supports it, we have taken our industry leading capabilities to a new level, making buying small business insurance easier than ever.","A consumer buying small business insurance from the Hartford now receives tailored recommendations for their coverage or the ability to customize their own. Their agent is able to view real time pricing much the same way an online retail shopper can see a running total of the costs or products placed in their cart.","As of today, we are live in 32 states and will be in 45 by year-end. We are already seeing increases in quotes and additional optional coverage selections. This game changing product launch only adds to our excitement about our long-term prospects for growth in this segment.","In middle and large commercial, the underlying combined ratio of 99.6 improved 1.6 points from 2018 driven primarily by the lower non-cap property losses. Notably, in the marine losses which were elevated in the second quarter have moderated.","Written premium was up 12% over last year due impart to the addition of certain legacy Navigators businesses within middle and large commercial. Ex-Navigators written premium was up 7% with strong production in national accounts, large property and programs as well as in verticals such as construction and energy.","We are achieving rate increases across middle and large commercial, our property and auto rate increases are up sequentially in the quarter over a 100 basis points with liability not far behind. In global specialty the underlying combine ratio of $96.2 deteriorated 6.4 points primarily the result of including the Navigators book this quarter.","Since the acquisition, we have been aggressively re-underwriting and reprising portions of the Navigators book. In the third quarter, we achieved double-digit rate increases on both the Navigators U.S. and international business with significant rate acceleration during the quarter and since the first quarter of this year.","In the U.S., we achieved strong underwriting results in our management and professional liability and surety lines. We are also pleased with both renewal pricing and new business generation from our wholesale distribution channel in the U.S.","In international, we have taken significant actions to address two plus years of sub-par returns in our Lloyd syndicate and London Market portfolio. In addition to the aggressive pricing actions, we are taking on this book we have exited certain underperforming lines and reduced significantly the number of binders, MGAs and line slips across the portfolio.","We have also materially reduced the overall limits deployed in several lines including DNO, ENO and casualty. Our global specialty team is off to a terrific start they are active addressing opportunities in the book as well as taken advantage of favorable market conditions where appropriate.","Integration efforts continue including expertise sharing and data science, technology, product design, claim and many other areas, executing across core risk functions will play an important role in improving the financial performance of this business. We fully expect global specialty to be a significant contributor to commercial\u2019s premium growth as profit returns to target return levels.","Moving to personnel lines, the underlying combine ratio of 92.3 deteriorated 50 basis points from the third quarter of 2018, but still a very good overall result. The expense ratio increased nearly one point due to the impact of lower earn premium while the loss ratio will improve 40 basis points. The loss ratio improvement is reflected in both our auto and homeowner results driven by earn pricing increases and non-CAT homeowner experience.","New business growth was up 34% compared to prior year, this is another positive new business quarter as marketing spend and product adjustments continue to gain traction. In ARP direct auto, our critical production levers including flow, close ratios and new sales all improved compared to prior year. Importantly, we are pleased with the underlying profile of this growth and encouraged by the improving trends.","Despite continued strong improvement in direct new business growth, total written premium was down 4%, though we have made progress to improve the profitability of our ARP book, more work is needed on retention and new business to return to positive growth.","In summary this is a very strong quarter across our Property and Casualty businesses, we are executing effectively against our plans while responding to last class trends and competitive market dynamics. We are taking appropriate pricing actions and making disciplined underwriting decisions. This is driving clear progress in-lines and accounts that need to improve overall profitability.","Meanwhile, we remain extremely encouraged by the product breadth and depth of the underwriting talent that the Navigators acquisition is contributing and we are already seeing the impact of these additions in our businesses and with our distribution partners. The positive progress on key milestones drive my bullish outlook on our future. I look forward to updating you all in another 90 days.","Let me now turn the call over to Beth.","Beth Costello","Thank you Doug. Today I'm going to cover third quarter results for the investment portfolio, Hartford Funds Incorporate and provide an update on capital management. Our investment portfolio continues to perform very well with strong limited partnership returns and generally stable investment yields.","Net investment income was 490 million for the quarter up 46 million or 10% from the prior year. Excluding Navigators net investment income was 462 million or 4% higher than the prior year. The annualized limited partnership return was 15.3% in the quarter due to higher valuation than underlying funds.","Lower interest rates and tighter credit spreads increased net unrealized gains on fixed maturities after tax to 1.8 billion at September 30th up from 1.4 billion at June 30th. Unrealized and realized gains on equity securities classified and realized capital gains in the income statement were 19 million before tax in the quarter and 181 million before tax through September 30th.","The credit performance of the investment portfolio remains very strong. Net interments in the quarter totaled one million flat with third quarter 2018 given the increasing likelihood of sustained low interest rates, I wanted to touch on how we manage the portfolio in this environment and the impact of the portfolio yield due to lower rates.","We have a broad range of investment capabilities and a well diversified portfolio. Our strategy does not pursue lower credit quality for the purpose of making up for lower yields and we will continue to invest in a diversified manner. For the quarter, our current yield before tax excluding limited partnerships was 3.6% equating to 425 million.","Taking into consideration potential lower reinvestment rates projected using the forward curve, we could see the portfolio yield excluding limited partnerships declined by close to 10 basis points in 2020 reducing the quarterly run rate of net investment income by approximately 10 million before tax.","Turning to Hartford Funds. Core earnings of 39 million were down 5% from last year, but up one million sequentially. Daily average AUM was 2% from second quarter 2019 reflecting strong market performance partially offset by net outflows.","Investment performance remains very strong, as of September 30th about 70% of Hartford Funds outperformed peers on a one, three and five year basis. Corporate core losses of 37 million improved by eight million from third quarter 2018.","The principal driver of the improvement this quarter was 11 million of income after tax from our retain equity interest in Talcott compared to one million in third quarter 2018. During the quarter, we continue to repurchase shares, year-to-date through November 1st, we have repurchased 2.2 million shares for 126 million, with strong capital generation and financial flexibility, we are pleased to be able to both invest in our businesses and return capital to shareholders.","During the third quarter, we issued 1.4 billion of debt comprised of 600 million 10 year 2.8% senior notes and 800 million, 30 year 3.6% senior notes. We used the proceeds to redeem approximately 1.65 billion of debt with the weighted average coupon of 5.3%.","The redemption resulted in the loss on extinguishment of debt of 90 million before tax. We continue to plan to repay our 500 million, 5.5% senior notes maturing in March 2020, which will put us in-line with our leverage target.","Book value per diluted share excluding AOCI was $42.55 up 8% year-to-date and 9% to September 30, 2018. Core earnings ROE over the last 12 months was 12.3% well in excess of our cost of equity capital. A few other items to comment on before I close. We have included disclosure in the 10-Q about the potential for subrogation recoveries on PG&E related to losses incurred uncertain 2017 and 2018 California wild fires.","Given uncertainties with respect to approvals of the PG&E bankruptcy plan, we have not recognized any subrogation recoveries to-date. Based on subrogation claiming submitted all insurers to PG&E and the terms of the proposed settlement which is contingent upon approval of the bankruptcy plan, we would expect growth subrogation recoveries to be approximately 325 million, although the actual amount we collect is subject to uncertainty.","The 116 million of any such subrogation recoveries would reduce reinsurance recoverable we have recorded under CAT reinsurance treaties. Accordingly, any benefit to income would be for subrogation recoveries in access of 116 million.","Turning to fourth quarter, it has already been an active quarter for catastrophe related events. Our budget for cash in the fourth quarter is approximately 80 million pre-tax. Before considering any losses from the current California wild fires, we are approaching 80 million of catastrophe losses in the month of October including losses from Tornados in the Dallas area and other wind events.","While it is still too early to make an estimate of losses we may incur from the current California wild fires, we are monitoring the fires closely in the areas we have ensured properties and businesses at risk. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter we will complete our annual study of asbestos and environmental reserves.","Under the average development we purchased in 2016, we have $977 million of remaining coverage available for increases in these reserves. Also, we did not feed any additional net loss reserves in the third quarter to our adverse development cover for Navigators, so we continue to have 209 million of coverage available on that book of business.","To summarize, the execution of our strategy is generating strong results across our business lines. The integration of Navigators is on-track and we look forward to continuing to update you on our progress.","I will now turn the call over to Susan, so we can begin the Q&A session.","Susan Spivak","Thank you, Beth. We have about 30 minutes for questions. Operator, can you please repeat the instructions for asking a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes. We will now begin the question and answer session [Operator Instructions] And the first question we have will come from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","ElyseGreenspan","Good morning. First off that they do, you know depreciate the new kind of stream line disclosure within the press release that was helpful this quarter. My first question for you is on capital. Just following up on some of your prepared remarks, it seems like you guys got the majority of the tax attributes you are expecting this year as the end of the third quarter just looking at the 10-Q disclosure. So I just wanted to walk through that and get a sense of repurchases for the fourth quarter and then for next year and then capital side could you just give us a sense of the dividends you could upstream from the PNC sub in 2020 and also there is any change in the tax attributes you expect as well?","BethCostello","Sure. So first of all, thank you for the comment on the press release. I\u2019m glad that you like the new format. So as it relates to holding company cash, I would say overall, we are on-track with what we expected at the beginning of the year. Yes, the timing of the tax benefit we received from AMT refund did come in a little bit earlier than we anticipated.","We were anticipating that this year. So we took all of that into consideration, as we have projected kind of our view of share purchases over the course of this year and into next year and we continue to target for this year about a total of 200 million in share repurchases then the remainder of our billion dollar authorization would be used in 2020.","As it relates to then dividend streams as we go into 2020. Again, as a reminder we did not take any net dividends from PMC in 2019, but we do you anticipate going back to our normal cadence in 2020. As we talked about in the past we see dividends sort of in the 850 to 900 million range, obviously it will depend on actual results from our group benefits, business typically in the 300 to 350 range obviously results group benefits have been very strong. So, we have seen some increases in those dividends through the years.","And then mutual funds usually isn't that 100 and 125 million. And then we do still have some remaining tax benefits that we would expect to receive in 2020 so when we look at 2019, we are probably a little bit over $700 million in tax benefits that will come through.","And as we look to 2020 we would be just slightly under 600 million. So again, very much in-line with what we have laid out previously. And then again, I will just remind you as I said, in my prepared remarks, we do still anticipate paying our maturing debt of 500 million in March of 2020.","ElyseGreenspan","Thanks that is very helpful. And then my second question on, if we want to kind of keep track of how Navigators is trending, you guys highlighted some earnings projections for that business going a couple years out. So just trying to get a sense can you kind of set the stage or give us a sense how much earnings came through in the quarter or is it best way for us just clearly look at the global specialty margin to get a sense of, you know how Navigators is tracking.","ChristopherSwift","Elyse, thank you for your question. I would say what we have commented on the past as far as our goals related to the financial performance of Navigators are really unchanged. I think we did say the slope of it might be slightly different the components might be, slightly different.","But we still see a path to earnings $200 million of core earnings prior to amortization of intangibles in that four to five year period of time and still excited. Obviously there is a lot of rate being taken in the specialty space broadly defined, but Doug that is what I would say over the long-term, but what would you say in the near-term.","DougElliot","Just to add that this quarter we made very few adjustments to the prior Navigators loss ratios across fair line, either prior year or in the current action year. We tweaked on a liability slightly in the quarter, but other than that is a pretty quite quarter relative to actuarial assumptions.","ElyseGreenspan","Okay. And can you give us a sense of the rate that you are getting just within their book of business?","ChristopherSwift","Yes. I mentioned in my commentary Elyse, there was double-digits and in the quarter essentially the U.S. book was right on top of 10, internationally they were getting closer to 16, and when you put two together we are talking 12ish, 11 to 12 points of price. I also said that it was accelerating in the quarter, so we are quite pleased about that as you think about the run rate July through September and an early peak of October keeps me optimistic, October looks a lot like September. So, I think we are off to a really good start I\u2019m very pleased with progress, Vince and his team is working hard to change the outcomes here.","ElyseGreenspan","Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate the color.","Operator","Next we have Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill.","PaulNewsome","Good morning. Thanks for the call. I was hoping you could way in a little bit more on some of the auto trends that we have seen at other companies, both the commercial auto trend and the severity and frequency seems to be a little bit different by company and kind of how you vary that. What you experiences have and so what you think is behind it. And then sort of second question, the private passenger and ask kind of the same question about frequency and severity in all see a little bit of the spike in their frequency physical damage and you have seen same thing. Those are my two questions.","DougElliot","Paul, let me just clarify personnel and commercial both do you want me to\u2026","PaulNewsome","Yes.","DougElliot","Okay. Let\u2019s start with personnel. We continue to be pleased by the trends we see in our personnel lines auto book, frequency has been in good shape for several quarters now and severity we are mindful of collision severity. But essentially a lot of trends are within our expectations and feel good about our progress and overall performance of the personnel line auto line.","In commercial, a bit of different story and the sense that our small commercial book, much smaller vehicle, we have been working right now for five to six years, we have transformed that book. We are essentially not on mono-line players acceptance certain circumstances improvement there, but more improvement necessary in the commercial auto, small commercial space.","In the middle, again, this is not a specialty auto sector, this is essentially commercial auto fleets attached to our middle market accounts, slightly heavier than the small commercial. We also have been chasing rate here over the last six to seven years. We have made progress, but not at all acceptable relative to our operating performance in the line today.","So, we continue to make underwriting adjustments, we will continue to work hard on rate, very pleased that our rate was up over 10 points in Q3 and auto will continue to work at that in Q4 and into 2020. When I think about loss trends, they look to us like during the mid single-digits maybe plus a little bit in that five to six, 6.5 range commercial auto we are mindful that which means our pricing needs to be on top of that plus some to make appreciable progress in combined ratio. Chris or Beth anything.","PaulNewsome","Do you have any particularly theory about the commercial business that might be different from other folks why we are seeing the severity trend and whether or not it is recovered?","ChristopherSwift","I would just offer that our book of business on the commercial side ex-Nav is largely primary auto, so we are not a significant player in the excess space. I do think the excess layers have had some pressure over the past, three to four years.","Navigators has especially auto book we are very mindful that, we are working closely with them sharing our trends working actuarial assumptions, et cetera and taking quite a bit of right there. So our rate change in the Navigators auto book is substantial. But I don't have any greater insight, because I don't have insight into other competitor books like I do our own.","PaulNewsome","Okay. Congratulations for the quarter. Thank you.","ChristopherSwift","Thanks Paul.","Operator","Next, we have Brian Meredith of UBS.","BrianMeredith","First, I'm just curious. In the commercial lines segment, the expense ratio declined year-over-year only around 17% growth G&A expenses as expected to be a little bit higher than that was there anything unusual there is as a decent run rate with respect to kind of G&A expense growth than what we are seeing with the expense ratio?","ChristopherSwift","Yes, good question, Brian and there are some things happening in both Q2 and Q3 that make that compare a little bit challenging. So let me do my best to unpack it. In three quarter, we actually had some credits that ran through from Texas licenses and fees and also some bad debt credits. And when you kind of laser them in you basically get a quarterly expense ratio more like 34.5.","In Q2, we had some one timers that put some upward pressure on the expense and I would also point out to you as the Navigators book comes into our expense ratios, as a typical specialty company sometimes they have got slightly higher expense base.","So between the U.S. and certainly the international, there is a little bit of inflation on the expense coming in from NAB that we work our way through over the next couple of years. As we meet, we earn our way toward those profit targets we have talked about. So I look at the run rate to Q3 more in the 34.5 range. I think that is kind of where we will be Q4 as I look out.","BrianMeredith","Great, thanks and then my second question, in a small commercial area, maybe you talked about how it is a little bit more insulated from the social inflation environment, given the limits profile of that business. I'm curious, have you seen any increasing competition in that area as a result of what is going in the loss cost inflation environment.","ChristopherSwift","In response to I would say again across many of our businesses there is always competitive pressure, there is new entrants, there is things FinTech related or EsnureTech related activities, but I wouldn't say it is rapidly changing in a more competitive environment where everyone is piling in.","I would say and you have heard us talk about this before. We have a 30 year history here with a lot of data, a lot of capabilities, a lot of deep trusted agent relationships that does provide an element of advantage to us.","But we are really tuned in on the emerging trends in our own mindset of what do we need to continue to get better every day, whatever we need to do to continue to differentiate ourselves as one of the top go-to-market. So that is our mindset and Doug if you would add anything.","DougElliot","Yes. So, maybe just a couple of comments about our new structure and then I will comments on what we work on the last couple of years. So, very excited Brian about this launch of NexGen spectrum, we have been kind of in the design and building stage for a couple of years now.","And I think it is going to be a terrific product in the market much in the way the digital experiences that we are all use to on our personalize. Because of that launch we have been laser focus these last couple of years to get our rate adequacies on our spectrum product where they need to be because is very difficult if your profit challenge in the current line and then go to launch new product.","So as we think about loss trends over these last couple of years, we continue to make sure we are on top of those trends with pricing, we see liability trends in that spectrum area still in the mid single-digits and our pricing has been matching that overtime and we feel good about our balance sheet in terms of the reserves that are recorded on our ledger. So, yes we have been very focused on loss trends here, I think good progress and now exciting that we launch our new effort into the latter half of the 2019 into 2020.","BrianMeredith","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next we have Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan.","JimmyBhullar","Hi, good morning. I have a couple of questions for Doug and first on commercial line. How do your ability to take advantage of improving pricing and the overall market, especially given that you have got a big exposure to workers comp your prices are actually obviously under pressure.","DougElliot","Well, we are optimistic that our non-workers compensation pricing continues to improve as I suggested that certainly was the case in Q3 and I expect that to continue into Q4. Yes, we recognized we have some headwinds on a worker\u2019s comp environment. I would again point out the profitability those books is excellent particularly small commercial.","So we are mindful of those headwinds and navigating in the middle of account-by-account and being thoughtful about class selection and state and geography and small commercial. And so, yes it is a tale of two where we are working hard to improve our core pricing while we understand is a very competitive worker\u2019s comp dynamic that matters greatly to us.","JimmyBhullar","And then on the personnel line, I think you have hope that at some point over the next few quarters you will start to see stabilizing premium and maybe an improvement in premium. But it seems like more and more companies are sort of shifting their focus from revolving margins to accelerating growth. Just comment on competition whether it is still rationale and your expectation when you can sort of get to flat deposit of premium growth in that market?","ChristopherSwift","Yes. Jimmy, we are not going to give any guidance there on a specific drivers, but the overall focus is both organize comment or has been a growth orientation. But you are right, I mean it is a dynamic marketplace just because we want to grow and there is a lot of other competitors that are shifting to that same mindset.","So the trick in that environment at least in my judgment is we got to remain discipline you got again segment appropriately your new business by states or territories that make sense for you compared to where your pricing is and the team is executing very well. It is just we are getting that the responses just not converting as many in new business opportunities as feasible. But, Doug that is what I would said.","DougElliot","I agree, Chris and I think we lay out a supplement, you can see we have made very good progress on the retention front, I still think there is a little more work to be done there. And it is a little bit more list. And then absolutely, we are focused on adjusting and thinking carefully about what we do on the new business front, because we want to raise those levels of new business successes.","JimmyBhullar","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next we have Ryan Tunis of Autonomous Research.","RyanTunis","First question to Doug on I guess on commercial auto, just thinking about it seems like over the past decade I was talking about commercial auto development and it was like we have been talking about a probably more hardcore competitors, maybe not so much over the past year, but I\u2019m just curious to maybe hear your thoughts on the extent to which maybe you feel like you got ahead of some of these trends maybe in 15, 16, 17. And to the extent you are seeing something new what is new in this 2019 environment that you potentially had reserved for contemplated prior to this?","DougElliot","Ryan thanks. Let us just start on the quarter and then I do want to come in because I think you are onto something relative to the prior trend. So in this quarter, we made an adjustment to our prior year development based on some large losses we had seen in our national account book.","So it is largely national accounts, I would say almost all national accounts 80% of the changes national accounts, and it's something that we had not adjusted in the last several years. So really excited our national book.","If you go back over five to six years, correctly stated we have been adjusting auto. I would say back in the 12 to 13 time period, we had a broader specialty auto book, transportation vehicles that caused some of the adjustment and actually raised our attention to this commercial auto dynamic that we have been working hard on for five or six years.","So I would agree with if you have looked at what we have done in the commercial auto space on our reserves, and our current next year underwriting and pricing. This has been an ongoing work in process for us.","We did some tuning in the quarter, more importantly, we continue to leverage the findings in our book of business to do the best job we can at underwriting and profitability book going forward and we are sharing them with Navigators as we come together.","RyanTunis","Perfect and then maybe for Chris, just on the benefit obviously we are seeing some very favorable trends there. And I guess what surprises a P&C analyst is how well pricing seems to hold off. So I\u2019m curious in your view, how does the pricing cycle kind of work for group benefits. Have you seen any increasing competition in that area as a - group beneficial. I'm seeing this transition to workers comp over the next couple years?","ChristopherSwift","Sure, Ryan. I would say yes we are performing very well and I said in my commentary, I think we provided enough data to say that there were a couple of one timers in this quarter. So I look at it that the quarter was roughly more in-line with 120 million earnings and an 8% margin.","But clearly above our long-term views that we have guided here, which is still six to seven. I think the thing that you just have to keep in mind is a lot of the results that are emerging today are based on pricing and commitments we have made two, three years ago that are just outperforming.","So unlike P&C, we generally make three year rate guarantees, we are very thoughtful and discipline in making those three year rate guarantees, because that is the commitment. So, we are just outperforming the expectations both on incidences and recoveries that is contributing to that current outperformance. So hopefully that helps you.","RyanTunis","It does. Thanks.","Operator","Next we have David Motemaden of Evercore.","DavidMotemaden","Hi. Thanks, good morning. Just a question for Doug, just wanted to get a bit more detail on the changes that you guys made to reserves and GL and also just talk about what you are assuming on severity going forward and in your loss picks and what sort of rate you are seeking in the market right now?","DougElliot","Yes that was a multiple component question. So let me do my best to working away through. In other liability, general liability we made some tweaks really across years, across businesses, I would say a series of small tweaks couple in the product area, a couple umbrellas, et cetera.","Nothing significant in any one pocket, but largely across our middle market book of business. Construction included a little bit of our specialty, general liability book. So that really is the basis for the tweaking we did in the quarter for general liability.","In a broader sense, we think about loss trends, overall our loss trends are somewhere in that mid single-digit range when you combine all our lines and I\u2019m thinking primarily about auto liability and GL which is two lines that really form the basis for most of your questions.","So, they may move a bit between small and middle and some of our specialty lines with the global specialty book. But we are talking about trying to be on top of mid single-digit trends and now our pricing across various lines is either on top of slightly advancing on or - on top of in the case of some of our specialty access area.","So, I share with you, we are really pleased about some of the specialty areas that we have had substantial movement in pricing double-digit moves in pricing where I feel like we are going to see the benefits of that kind of working into our book in 2020 and beyond.","DavidMotemaden","Got it. Great. Thanks. And a question for just for Chris on the group business and top-line specifically sales were down a decent amount year-over-year. Just sort of wondering what you are seeing competitively and also more specifically what you are outlook would be for top-line earned premium growth here over the next few years as Aetna is more fully integrated?","ChristopherSwift","Sure, David. I was trying to explain that, I mean it is still a competitive environment out there, but there is still an element of rationality that I see most of our competitors exhibiting. You might have an account or two where new business opportunity where someone does something more aggressive, but generally competitive but balanced.","So we would say the year-over-year numbers that you are looking at does look down, but really when you adjust for the New York Family Paid Leave product that launched in 2018, you really have sort of $40 million delta between year-to-date, 2019 compared to year-to-date 2018.","So, really you can consider it slightly down to flattish. So again I think we are still performing at a high level from our sales side, which is still some contributions to sales in that $40 million to $50 million range from Edna's medical staff that is still referring business and jointly selling. So we feel good about the overall sales performance.","So I said in my opening comments, your premiums are slightly down 1% on a earned basis, primarily due to just higher lapses, lower persistency on the Aetna book as we are taking targeted actions, since to re-price in those books.","So everything is according to plan, but as we look forward, I still see modest growth in top-line for group benefits, really supported by some of our ancillary lines anchored in ANH and voluntary.","DavidMotemaden","Great. Thanks for the answers.","Operator","Next, we have Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse.","MikeZaremski","Hey good morning. I wouldn't mind maybe trying to get more color on next gen spectrum, in terms of maybe you can isolate what the major changes are, from the commentary is it easier for your - the business owners to self service. I'm just curious, is there a direct selling component to potentially for small businesses and then also is there ultimately to measure the success you expect sales to accelerate or better profitability just anymore color would be great, it seems like it is a big deal?","ChristopherSwift","Good question Mike and thank you for asking it. I would start by saying yes, this is a sales tool that essentially will sit on the desktop of our CSRs, Customer Service Reps around the country and all the agents and brokers we do business with.","It is a tool that will allow them to be faster, more insightful and help their customers make choices, I would say inside the tool you should think about, good, better, best type dynamics. All the coverages, very tuned to what a certain customer or SIC class would require, what types of optional coverages are there et cetera.","So, yes I think it is a best-in-class selling tool with advice that either comes out of the box with a terrific offer for a customer or offers additional coverages that a CSR will work with a potential customer to purchase. So that is the basis of this exciting innovation for us.","And then secondly, yes we do expect overtime our new sales and spectrum to lift. It is hard to predict, but our expectations over the next couple of years is that we will see some change in our new business sales and we will watch that carefully and report on that as we go through time.","MikeZaremski","Okay, that is helpful. Lastly, if we step back and kind of talk about in a broader sense about commercial pricing versus loss cost trend. Is it fair to say that - if there is a gap, it hasn't changed much quarter-over-quarter taking into account workers comp and so it sounds like there hasn't been any meaningful, notable changes over the last quarter?","ChristopherSwift","And is your question more in the loss trend area or the pricing areas?","MikeZaremski","It is on both, it is kind of seems like pricing is moving north and trend might be moving a little bit north. So net-net kind of similar to last quarter?","ChristopherSwift","Yes, I would agree with your statement in the aggregate and then I think we would have to parse it apart by specialty by excess, by primary financial lines, spectrum et cetera. So in the aggregate, yes, we see lifting and pricing across middle, non-workers comp as we have examined our loss trends, I would say largely in the primary space pretty consistent with Q2.","Yes maybe we are a little careful to make sure we are catching some uptick in the social inflation dynamic. But I don\u2019t think material in any given way. And then in the specialty book, yes we are spending a lot of time inside our excess, our umbrella, our specialty areas and we are mindful of where trends are expecting a little bit of upward lift in those trends and therefore our pricing has been pretty aggressive there. So, pleased with progress on both front, but I think you have it about right.","MikeZaremski","Thank you very much.","Operator","Next we have Amit Kumar of Buckingham Research.","AmitKumar","Thanks. And good morning. Two quick follow ups maybe going back to Mike\u2019s question on rate versus loss trends. So if you blend I guess all the moving parts and look at small commercial. As we head into 2020, is your sense that the loss trend will end up running harder than what we expected hence the rate versus loss trend metric does not expand or is it more of a function of the book?","DougElliot","So, Amit let me start and Beth and Chris can go over the top. We are not prepare today that to take into 2020 - what I\u2019m very pleased about is if you look at our metrics and our access combine across commercial and you see in for our segments. I think we have done a nice job at dealing with loss trend, getting improving rate performance and across both our most profitable segment, which is small commercial kind of holding in margins that are terrific.","And we are mindful that we need to make more meaningful change in the middle and large commercial areas. So, I look at all-in Q3 number on top of Q2 and feel pretty good about it and as I mentioned in my earlier commentary, we know there was a little bit of upward pressure from NAV book coming in, we will work our way through that and at some point that will be a positive, because we will starting turning the tide on that number as we move into 2020.","AmitKumar","Okay. Then on Chris or anyone had to add something to that.","ChristopherSwift","Again, I think Doug is accurate as always. I think the tricks is going to be here everything is sort of more granular right these days, whether it be states, products, accounts so when you add it all up I think what Doug says makes perfect sense.","My particular point of view is that this could be a dynamic environment for the next couple of years for sure. Because I don\u2019t think it is you know realistic at least in my expectation that 15 points of rate in the specialty book in aggregate is going to get back to targeted returns.","As I said, particularly as it relates to Navigators we are taking a multiple year journey to get to targeted earnings and returns. And I think a lot of others are going to be in that same position where just one year of feeling good about high single-digit or low double-digit rates in certain lines primarily specialty isn\u2019t going to cut it and that is going to require a multi-year approach.","AmitKumar","Got it. The only other question is on the last call. I guess we have fine tuned Navigators a bit and Chris on that call you had said one 10ish was sort of the number for 2020. Are we still in the ballpark or based on what has evolved, are we somewhere in the middle or not?","ChristopherSwift","Yes. Obviously I\u2019m not going to give you any really specific details. But the ranges that we put out, I still think are valid as I said I would anchor in the low end of that range. And I\u2019m not changing our views right now at this point in time.","AmitKumar","Got it. Thanks for the answers. And congrats on the print.","Operator","Next, we have Gary Ransom of Dowling & Partners.","GaryRansom","Good morning, most of my questions have been answered. But I did want to follow-up on the new spectrum policy and I wondered specifically whether there is a little bit of leapfrogging going on with other competitors in their own system. Can you actually detect when someone else has something, a new star offering and see a little bit of lowering of your quote volume then you put something out, you see a little bit of higher, and if you do, does that last for a while does it have some duration. I'm just trying to get a sense of the growth components and how this might play out.","ChristopherSwift","Yes, thanks Gary. We do watch all those statistics carefully. So we are able to watch quote volume we are able to watch yield. So the number of hits or successful quotes against total quotes I would say relative to competitors rollout, we watch what they put out publicly and normally there is a little bit of a buzz or discussion about enhancements or innovations in the marketplace, I'm sure very similar to what is happening with our next generation spectrum offering right now.","I think that is the easier way to find out about things. But we study the numbers, we are mindful of even the statistics I quoted in my script right, we are watching optional purchases - optional coverage purchases right now we are watching number of quotes. And we have an expected trajectory that we expect to see over the next three or four quarters and so we will be right on top of that.","GaryRansom","Is this something that will roll out to all the renewals or is it just something for new business?","ChristopherSwift","Yes, we are quoting new business right now. As I said, we are in mid-30 states and by year-end we expect to be essentially 45 and then we will deal with the last couple of states next year, but new business I think Gary today.","GaryRansom","Okay. alright. Thank you very much.","ChristopherSwift","Thank you.","Operator","The next question we have will come from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs.","YaronKinar","Hi good morning everybody. I want to start with going on the reserve development in commercial lines and making another one on group benefits. So with reserve development I think in recent years we have seen kind of initial aspects in both general liability and commercial auto come in a bit below most recent picks for our prior years. Can you maybe talk about that dynamic and how comfortable you are with your picks for the more recent years considering the fact that you have an increasing the initial aspects there and is it just pricing that you have achieved that has offset some of the weaker picks in prior years?","DougElliot","Let me start and then Beth can work over the top. I would say over the past six plus years, we have been working both pricing and underwriting. So we have been adjusting our offerings across the marketplace, in classes, monocline grouped with other accounts, et cetera. So multiple different options that we have been working.","In general, I would agree with you that we have been light on our [XM] (Ph) picks at 12 months, which is the reason that if you look at our trend line, we have made adjustments to those prior year picks over the last six, seven years and I think we do a nice job of disclosing that in our in our supplement.","So the disappointment is that last year obviously has been higher than we expected, and we didn't get the punch that we expected on the underwriting side. And so we are doubling down now, I think we continue to make progress again. I would separate some of this discussion by class of vehicle whether we are talking small commercial with primarily private passenger and light vans or middle market with some heavier or the specialty area.","And I think that our success are like thereof is not very different than the overall marketplace. But what we have tried to do is when we see something in the book, we have addressed it both on our reserve levels and also on the underwriting. And that is why I don\u2019t think there is anything new here, we just need to dive even harder. Beth.","BethCostello","I think that summarizes it very well Doug.","YaronKinar","Okay. Thanks. And then on the group benefit side, the experience in claims recovery that you have seen for recent vintages, as you expect that kind of continue, is that baked into your estimate today or do you expect some of the version back I mean?","DougElliot","You know I would say Yaron that obviously we update our statistic and views periodically that is what we did this quarter. So, that reflects our best views of trends going forward that in essence we price product on and book reserves on. So, it is our best thinking from here.","Now, we have always talked about it, changes in incidence and\/or recoveries is somewhat employment centric related. So as long as we don\u2019t have any big shocks into the system I would expect our estimates here to hold, but as I have said it is a dynamic world out there and when things change, we just have to reevaluate our assumptions and we would change accordingly.","YaronKinar","Got it. Thanks so much. And thanks for sneaking me in.","Operator","That is all the time we have for today\u2019s questions-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference call back over to Susan Spivak for any closing remarks.","Susan Spivak","We appreciate all you joining us as well as your question. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any follow-up and if we didn\u2019t get to your question within the time period, I\u2019m available on, so please just give me a call.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Purtill. Ma'am, you may begin.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you.

Other members of our executive management team present today include Beth Bombara, Doug Elliot, Brion Johnson, Alan Kreczko, Andy Napoli and Bob Rupp.","As detailed on Page 2 of the presentation, statements concerning The Hartford's future results or actions should be considered forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

McGee","Thank you, Sabra. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.","Before I begin, on behalf of all of us at The Hartford, our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been affected by Storm Sandy. And on a personal note, we at The Hartford hope that each of you and your family are faring well during these very challenging times because, clearly, this was a devastating storm with a large footprint and tropical force winds that impacted a highly populated area. At The Hartford, our catastrophe team has been on the ground working 24\/7 to help our policy holders, and I want to express my deep appreciation to our claims teammates and others in the field. In addition, we are also very thankful for the emergency personnel and volunteers who are providing basic needs and critical services.","I know you all are interested in loss estimates, but it's much too early for us to provide data with any level of certainty. We're still waiting for clearance from local authorities to access some areas. Yesterday, for example, was the first day we were able to get adjusters into Long Island. Now clearly, this is a significant event for those who suffered losses. But Storm Sandy is well within the planning scenarios we use to manage catastrophe risk at The Hartford. This is a major storm, but it is a manageable exposure for The Hartford. As we have more certainty around The Hartford's losses, we will provide you with details.","Now let's cover third quarter results and activities. I am pleased with The Hartford's third quarter achievements. First, we announced the sale of the 3 Wealth Management businesses we committed to sell last March, ahead of our year-end target. The businesses are going to strong, strategic buyers. And the sales are expected to generate about $2.2 billion of statutory capital benefit for The Hartford. Second, The Hartford generated strong overall financial results in the third quarter, with core earnings of $378 million, significantly better than the $50 million last year. Net income was also up strongly, rising from $60 million to $401 million. Third, The Hartford's go-forward businesses demonstrated increasing earnings momentum, benefiting from strong pricing trends, along with improved retention in Property & Casualty Commercial and new business growth in Consumer Markets. Mutual Funds also showed improved net flows. Core earnings from the 3 go-forward segments totaled $294 million this quarter compared with $121 million last year.","Now while much of that improvement was due to last year's high catastrophe losses, combined ratios, excluding caps in prior development, improved in both Property & Casualty Commercial and Consumer Markets, as did the loss ratio in Group Benefits.","In Property & Casualty Commercial, we continued to generate sustained written price increases, with an 8% increase in standard commercial lines this quarter, up from 7% for the first half of 2012. Our focus on pricing discipline will continue in the fourth quarter and into 2013. Doug and his team are doing an excellent job balancing margin expansion with retention and pricing. Our primary goal, particularly in Middle Market, is to drive to acceptable levels of profitability. So there will continue to be a dampening effect on the top line as less profitable accounts move to other carriers.","We are pursuing similar tactics in Group Benefits. The Hartford was among the first to recognize and respond to the adverse incidents and termination trends. However, given the 3-year contract terms in this line, it takes longer for the results of pricing actions to fall to the bottom line. In the third quarter, core earnings trends benefited slightly from an improvement in termination rates, although they do remain lower than historical levels. Improving terminations, combined with our pricing initiatives, should slowly expand margins.","In Consumer Markets, Andy and his team are focused on maintaining margins in auto, expanding margins in homeowners, continuing new business growth and improving retention. We recently enhanced the pricing segmentation in our Open Road Advantage auto product, which has helped lift conversion rates. New business production is up, and we feel good about the mix of business. Homeowners continues to need rate, and we have been diligent in pursuing it. Efforts to improve retention are yielding positive results, with continuing quarterly improvements in auto and home.","The Mutual Funds business also made good progress during the quarter, as its balanced and fixed-income funds posted more favorable net flows. Overall flows remain negative due to continuing industry-wide withdrawals from domestic equity funds. However, the company's third quarter flows were the best we've seen since the first quarter of 2011. Several funds generated particularly strong performance in the quarter. For instance, the Balanced Income Fund had top quartile Lipper performance, both for the quarter and year-to-date, and was one of our top funds in gross sales at $385 million for the quarter. In addition, our World Bond Fund was recently recognized as a newcomer of the year by the Wall Street Journal.","In our Runoff division, third quarter financial results were in line with our expectations, with core earnings x DAC unlock declining 6% from the prior year, reflecting lower earnings from U.S. annuity. Beth Bombara and her team have been examining a range of options to address the legacy annuity blocks. One area of focus is on contract holder initiatives, such as the enhanced surrender value option -- offer that we filed earlier this week with the SEC. This option will be offered to contract holders who represent about 15% of our U.S. GMWB book in terms of account value, but more importantly, nearly 45% of the U.S. GMWB net amount at risk. Similar to programs introduced by several other companies, it offers the contract holder the option to surrender the policy at a premium to the current account value. We continue to aggressively examine other options to accelerate the runoff of the U.S. and international annuities and look forward to updating you on our progress. With any actions we take, we will continue to honor our obligations to contract holders.","Finally, I'm pleased that we reached definitive sales agreements for Individual Life, Retirement Plans and Woodbury Financial Services this quarter, ahead of our year-end target. We're selling these businesses at good values that will generate an estimated net statutory capital benefit of approximately $2.2 billion. Furthermore, they are being sold to market-leading strategic buyers who saw value in our innovative products, strong distribution and employee expertise. We expect to close the Woodbury transaction by year-end and Individual Life in the first quarter of 2013. We're working to close Retirement Plans by year-end, but it may slip a little into the new year as we work through the necessary regulatory approvals.","Chris will discuss the company's expense initiatives. The bottom line, however, is that we will reduce about $850 million in expense. The vast majority of which relates to the elimination of all expenses of the divested businesses. Moreover, approximately 90% of the expenses will be eliminated by the end of 2013.","With the sales announced, I know investors are interested in our capital management plans. We are developing holistic capital management plans, which we will discuss with regulators and rating agencies and which we will share with you in early 2013, after the transactions are closed. Our goal in managing capital is to pursue accretive actions for shareholders while both maintaining a balance sheet sufficient for adverse economic environments and the current ratings of our go-forward businesses and preserving financial flexibility to be opportunistic in taking future actions to address the company's legacy annuity liabilities. Therefore, we expect that our capital management plans will include: debt repayment to reduce leverage and improve our interest coverage ratios over time; share repurchases, which at current prices are very accretive; and retaining some capital to take future actions for permanent solutions to reduce the size and risk of the legacy annuity liabilities, which should create significant shareholder value.","To conclude, The Hartford had a successful third quarter. We reached agreements in all 3 of the planned sales ahead of schedule at attractive prices and with strong buyers who value the skills and expertise of our teammates. We had strong core earnings. We demonstrated pricing and margin momentum in our go-forward businesses. And our Life Runoff team is considering options to accelerate the runoff of the legacy annuity blocks, including the recent filing of the enhanced surrender value program offer.","The Hartford is becoming a more focused company that has the potential to create greater shareholder value while providing policyholders with the protection and service that they depend on. I am confident that we are on the right path, and I look forward to communicating our continued progress.","I'll now turn the call over to Chris, who'll cover our financial results in more detail. Chris?","Christopher John Swift","Thank you, Liam. Good morning, everyone. This morning, I'm going to focus on 3 topics: first, I'll cover key aspects of this quarter's financial results; second, I will provide an update on our expense initiatives, including efforts to remove all the direct and indirect expenses of the businesses we are selling; and third, I'll provide an outlook for fourth quarter and full year 2012 results.","I'll begin on Slide 5. Third quarter 2012 core earnings were $378 million or $0.78 per diluted share. These results were in line with our outlook of $0.75 to $0.80. On a run rate basis, core earnings were $0.77 per share, which excludes the items summarized on Slide 5, which totaled $0.01 per share. These items included a modest charge for reestimating current accident year prior quarter loss reserves for workers' compensation and commercial auto of approximately $0.05 per share. Restructuring expenses totaled $34 million after tax or about $0.07 per share, slightly above our August estimate.","Turning to Slide 6. The Hartford's book value per diluted share rose 10% over the past year to $48.13, including a $2 billion increase in net after-tax unrealized gains on fixed maturity investments as a result of continued low interest rates and tighter credit spreads over the last year. It also includes the approximately $900 million or $1.83 per share reduction in shareholders' equity due to the Allianz debt refinancing and warrant share repurchase in the first half of 2012. Book value, excluding AOCI, was $41.35 per diluted share, flat with prior year, as net income over the past year was largely offset by the impact of the Allianz transactions. For the last 12 months, our core earnings ROE was 7.2%, up from 6% for the 12 months ended September 30, 2011.","Slide 7 has a high-level summary of P&C Commercial results. Core earnings were $160 million, up 84% from prior year. Catastrophe losses came in at $7 million after tax compared with $60 million last year. In addition, the increase in core earnings reflects improved margins in Middle Market. The third quarter 2012 combined ratio, x cat, x prior year, was 97.5%, down from 99.4% in prior year. Favorable expenses and better experience in property lines were partially offset by a deterioration in commercial auto liability results.","Third quarter 2012 included $39 million of current accident year prior quarter loss reestimation or 2.5 points on the loss ratio. This compares to $47 million or 3 points on the loss ratio last year. This year's changes were due to higher severity in commercial auto, particularly in small commercial, and a slight adjustment for lost time workers' compensation claims. Even with this change, the 2012 workers' comp accident year loss ratio is approximately 4 points better than 2011 accident year. This reflects the pricing and underwriting actions we have taken over the last 12 to 18 months. Our pricing and underwriting discipline in P&C Commercial has resulted in pricing increases across the portfolio, and we remain committed to driving actions necessary to improve margins in the fourth quarter and beyond.","Middle Market workers' compensation is a key contributor to our achieved pricing increases, with rate increases averaging 15% this quarter, consistent with the rate achieved in the second quarter. In Middle Market property, rates increased 10% compared with 8% in the first half. Our team is proactively managing renewal rate increases, account retention and new business growth to optimize overall profitability. While aggregate rate increases may have leveled off, our focus on margin improvement will continue.","Group Benefits results are summarized on Slide 8.","Although below historic levels, we're pleased with the trends we're seeing in the segment. Core earnings were $23 million, up 15%, due to improved loss trends. The loss ratio was 79.3%, an improvement over prior year's 80.1% and reflected better LTD results, offset by less favorable mortality in Group Life this quarter. As a result of our sustained pricing actions over the past 2 years, Group Benefits premiums declined 7% year-over-year. We expect this trend will continue into 2013 due to the impact of our renewal pricing strategies on persistency. Year-to-date, persistencies averaged 62%.","Turning to Consumer Markets on Slide 9. Core earnings were $93 million, a turnaround from core losses of $10 million in the third quarter of 2011, which had a significant level of catastrophes. This quarter had no net catastrophe losses as the $16 million of after-tax losses from the third quarter events, including Hurricane Isaac, were offset by favorable development on catastrophes from the first half of 2012. We continue to be pleased with the progress that Andy Napoli and his team are making, balancing profitability and growth. Consumer Markets underwriting margins, excluding catastrophes, have expanded as we take rate increases.","The third quarter combined ratio, excluding cats and prior year development, was 93.3%, down more than 2 points from 95.5% last year, are duly because of improved homeowner results. Auto results were comparable to the prior year. We remain focused on achieving rate increases consistent with the loss cost trends. Loss costs continue to be slightly higher in auto due to physical damage severity, although it moderated from the first half of 2012. The increase in physical damage severity was largely offset by favorable trends on auto liability frequency this quarter. We achieved written rate increases of 6% in homeowners and 4% in auto this quarter.","On the growth side, new business premiums are up 9% this quarter and 18% year-to-date. AARP Agency is a strong growth source. In the first 9 months of 2012, written premiums in AARP Agency were $96 million, almost double that of the prior year period. Retention has also improved, up 2 points in auto and 3 points in homeowners compared to a year ago.","Mutual Fund results are summarized on Slide 10. Core earnings were $18 million, down from the prior year but flat with the second quarter of 2012. The principal reason for the decline was lower fees, reflecting lower average assets under management and higher distribution and marketing expenses as we execute our strategy with Wellington. Net flow performance has significantly improved from the past several quarters as a result of stronger deposits into our fixed income and balanced fund choices. We are optimistic about the prospects for this business as we work with Wellington to expand marketing for The Hartford funds.","The results of our combined Life and P&C Runoff division are on Slide 11. Core earnings x DAC unlock were $168 million, comprised of $147 million from Life other operations and $21 million from P&C. The DAC unlock included in core earnings for the quarter totaled a charge of $11 million compared with a $126 million charge in the third quarter of 2011. For the quarter, surrenders averaged 14.7% on the U.S. variable annuity book and 3.6% for Japan VA, slightly higher than historical levels but lower than the 17.5% and the 4.5%, respectively, we saw in the second quarter.","We recently filed for approval with the SEC an enhanced surrender value option, which Liam discussed. This represents our first of initiatives to provide contract holders with additional choices for their contract that also meet our objectives of reducing risk with reasonable economics.","Turning to the impact of the VA book in capital resources. Slide 12 provides a summary of VA hedging results for the quarter. During the quarter, the net statutory impact of our VA liabilities and hedges was a negative $4 million before tax, excluding fees earned in the quarter and other impacts to surplus. It's been about a year since we've completed the buildout of our Japan hedging program. The goal of all our hedging programs is to manage our economic exposure, which is our continued focus and which is performing as we expect in these market conditions. We have retained some market risk, although throughout 2012, we have increased interest rate protection. You can find our updated sensitivities in our 10-Q.","Slide 13 is a new slide that combines our statutory surplus roll-forward with our total capital resources. Total U.S. statutory surplus before dividends to the holding company increased by approximately $100 million from June 30, reflecting $215 million of increased P&C surplus that was offset by a slight decrease in U.S. Life surplus. After $200 million of dividends to -- from the P&C company to the holding company, surplus was essentially flat. Year-to-date, Life statutory surplus is up about $150 million. We perform our annual cash flow testing at the end of the year, which will impact full year results given sustained low interest rates and tighter credit spreads. Consistent with our prior outlook, we continue to expect U.S. Life statutory surplus to be flat or slightly down for the full year.","Our capital resources, which include U.S. statutory surplus, as well as the $1.3 billion in Japan capital, were equal to the $18 billion we had at the end of June 30. Holding company cash and short-term investments totaled $1.4 billion.","Looking forward, the 3 sales transactions are expected to increase our statutory surplus by approximately $1.4 billion, for a total net statutory capital benefit of about $2.2 billion based on current estimates. As Liam mentioned, we are working on our capital plans, and we look forward to sharing them with you in early 2013.","Turning to the second item on my agenda, Slide 14 sets forth our updated expense initiatives. As Liam mentioned, we expect to reduce expenses by approximately $850 million before tax, most of which will be completed in 2013. Slide 14 breaks out the components of the expense reductions. In addition to our prior efficiency commitments, we will reduce expenses by another $100 million related to putting U.S. VA into Runoff and $615 million related to the 3 businesses being sold. We have detailed plans for execution and have begun reducing expense levels in 2012, which will continue into 2013.","As a result of these initiatives, we expect to incur a restructuring charge of approximately $45 million to $50 million after tax in the fourth quarter. This charge will accrue for all planned 2013 severance costs for approximately 500 positions affected over the course of 2013, as well as other fourth quarter items, such as retention payments. At year-end, we will have expensed about 85% of ultimate restructuring costs we anticipate. In 2013, we currently expect to have approximately $30 million after tax of additional restructuring and other expenses. Bottom line, we have significant expense-reduction goals and have a high degree of confidence in our ability to achieve them.","Finally, my last item before taking questions is to look at our year-to-date results and our fourth quarter outlook. As summarized on Slide 15, our core earnings, excluding DAC unlock, prior year developments, cats above budget and restructuring charges for the first 9 months of the year, totaled $1.2 billion or $2.40 per diluted share.","Our current fourth quarter outlook projects core earnings of approximately $375 million to $400 million or $0.77 to $0.82 per diluted share based on an estimated diluted share count of approximately 486 million shares. This outlook does not include any estimate of DAC unlock or prior year loss development and is also before the previously mentioned restructuring charge, which approximates $0.10 per diluted share.","This outlook includes a budgeted cat load of approximately $68 million before tax. This cat load does not include an estimate of expected losses from Sandy. Our plan is to update you on the impact of this major storm event when we have good estimates.","Combined with year-to-date results, our current 2012 outlook, excluding the DAC unlock, prior year development and other items listed on Slide 15, totals approximately $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion for the year, slightly less than our December '11 outlook of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion. We are pleased with this result given the challenging microeconomic environment, as well as the significant strategic actions we took this year, which were not anticipated in our December outlook.","We are currently working on our 2013 plan, which we expect to share with you in February on our fourth quarter 2012 earnings call.","To conclude, I am pleased with both our business results and our strategic accomplishments this quarter and this year. Despite the weak economy and low interest rates, our business has performed largely in line with our expectations. Our capital resources remain strong and stable, and our hedging programs continue to protect us against adverse economic and market conditions.","At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Sabra to begin our Q&A session.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you, Chris. We have about 30 minutes of time for Q&A. Felicia, could you please give the instructions for asking a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Finkelstein with Evercore Partners.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","So first, a quick question on the enhanced surrenders that you're doing on the variable annuities. I'm just curious if the offers -- how do the offers and the -- kind of the premium that you're going to be offering, how would that roughly compare to the reserves that you're holding against those guarantees?","Liam E. McGee","Mark, this is Liam. I'm going to have Beth Bombara, who runs our Runoff division, answer that question.","Beth A. Bombara","Okay. Thanks, Mark, for the question. So the way I think about it is, obviously, with the enhanced surrender value option, we are paying a premium above the current account value. That might be slightly higher than the reserves that we carry today. But the way that we really look and evaluate these programs is we look at what it does to the requirements in our stress scenarios because, as you know, we hold capital for our stress scenarios, and we would anticipate that the cost of the program would be less than what the benefit is we would see from reductions in required reserves in those stress scenarios.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. Second question is for Chris. I guess on Slide 12, you kind of gave a comparison of the hedged mark-to-market asset versus the change in the VACARVM liability, which was essentially flattish in the quarter despite markets obviously being a little bit higher. I'm just kind of curious in a broad -- from a broad perspective, are we at that kind of point where we should start to see -- if markets continue to cooperate, if we should start to see statutory earnings in the Variable Annuity business?","Christopher John Swift","Mark, thanks for the question. I think your point's a good one. This quarter was negative $4 million, as we talked about. And I remind you that, again, we're -- our hedge programs aren't, I'll call it, managing all the economics, so we still have risk positions on. So you're always going to have, I'll call it differences between your VACARVM liabilities and your changes in fair value of hedge assets. But as we've said before, generally, at the 1450 S&P level, we start to feel very good about the performance of the VA block going forward. You could see it in I'm going to call it the net amount of risk coming down this quarter. So we're at that inflection point where if markets continue to improve -- and it won't happen overnight, Mark, where we would generate a lot of statutory surplus off the VA block, but over time, with steady market performance, it is very positive for us. I would have to point out that offsetting that is really the continued low interest rate environment. So as much as equity markets are positive around the world, low interest rates in the U.S., Europe and in Japan are still a significant headwind for our statutory surplus creation on the Life side.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one quick follow-up to that point. In your last year presentation, you kind of gave an estimated long-term economic cost to hedging, kind of 40 basis points on the U.S. block; 15 dynamic, 25 macro. As you look out, does that change at all with kind of how the block has moved in the markets?","Christopher John Swift","Not really. I mean, if I look at, I'll call it the cost, what we're expending and sort of the path-dependent performance of our hedges, I mean, it's fairly consistent with what we started, the year end [ph]. So as we head into '13, Mark, if we're going to modify any of our hedging programs, which we are always considering how to make it more economic beneficial, we'll update you. But right now, as we head into the fourth quarter, I'd say those estimates are still the best ones we have.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel with Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","So a couple quick questions. I'm looking at Slide 14, the expense reduction target. Obviously, 2 pretty large pieces of that pie won't really start to come through until the sales close. But with respect to the remaining $235 million of expense reductions, I'm wondering how much of that is already in your run rate earnings currently?","Liam E. McGee","I'll have Chris give you a little more detail, John. Thanks.","Christopher John Swift","John, thanks. I would say, let's take the pieces, the $100 million for U.S. annuity shutdown, there's probably -- we're probably 30% achieved on our mission through '12, so there is some in there. There'll be more that will come out, particularly as we shrink shared services in 2013. The $135 million of, I'll call it expense efficiencies, I'd say most of that will relate to our 2013 plan. So I wouldn't say that there's very much in our run rate at this point in time. That's the incremental goal that we established for '13.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, very helpful. Then sort of separately from the Variable Annuity business for a moment, thinking about the Fixed Annuity business. I'm just interested in whether you've seen any interest in that business given the continued M&A activity in that particular product line industry-wide. And if you could just remind us how much statutory capital, approximately, you currently have supporting that business.","Christopher John Swift","John, if I understood your questions, it's called the Fixed Annuity Transaction Market. I know Beth and her team, we work closely with her on those opportunities. I mean, we're aware, we have intel, we've got advisers that are working with us. I think our simple analysis right now of what we see, appetite in the marketplace compared to our book of business, we just see a disconnect, particularly given the low interest rates. And as far as the capital, I haven't provided capital by product line. We might do that going forward, but historically, we haven't. How I think about capital in total, John, is you think of the $7.5 billion of capital we have in the blue books, we have approximately 150 -- excuse me, $1.5 billion of that capital allocated to Group Benefits. And the rest would be supporting VA, Fixed Annuities and our Institutional Annuity blocks going forward.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And that $7.5 billion, some of that, Chris, is related to the Life business, no?","Christopher John Swift","Yes.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then last quick one for you is just, given the recent move lower in longer-term new money yields, plus you combine that with the fact that you're going to sell a few businesses that are at least somewhat rate sensitives, I was just wondering if you could just update for us your outlook for how we should think about rate pressure on your go-forward businesses into 2013. Because I think previously you had talked about something along the lines of $50 million in '13, another $50 million on top of that in '14, et cetera. Is it fair to assume that that's changed a bit given the sales and given rates?","Christopher John Swift","Thank you for the question, John. There's 2 aspects of rates that I just -- we'll touch upon. One we touched upon from a statutory cash flow testing in approaching year-end. I mean, so there is going to be some pressure on that as far as additional reserves, cash flow testing reserves, C3 Phase I impacts, so that would be the first pressure point. As we look forward then, after we sell Retirement and Life, and we'll talk more about this when we provide you the full '13 plan, we have about $4 billion of cash flows to reinvest in '13 and '14 for our ongoing businesses. And so I would say that the new pressure point for continued low interest rates on a run rate basis is probably in the $20 million range for '13. And then it would jump to $50 million in 2014.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I wanted to come back to the expense plan reduction of, Chris, I think you said $850 million all in. Just so I understand it correctly, the -- I heard, in response to John's question, what you said about the 2013 plan, which was you've only achieved 30% so far on the VA, $100 million, so that's an incremental $70 million there, and $135 million on other various initiatives. So let's just add this up to $200 million. That still leaves another $650 million. Should we assume this $650 million incremental is being offset by all the lost revenues that are going away with these asset sales? I just want to think about the other $600 million plus, and eventually, does any of that come through to the bottom line or not?","Christopher John Swift","Tom, it's Chris. I think on the slide, if you had a chance to look at it, the $450 million of your $600 million number is really going to the new owners, so it's the employees, it's the infrastructure. So really, when we close those transactions, $450 million comes out immediately. And then what we're left with is -- that really represents $165 million, which represents, I'll call it, reducing our shared service platforms: IT, operations, finance. That approximates the 500 positions that we'll eliminate in '13. That will come out somewhat ratably in 2013.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that explains that perfectly. The -- another follow-up on the Variable Annuity filing for the buyouts. Can you just give a little more color for what the target is here? I presume it's going to be the contracts that have the largest in-the-money type benefits that you'd be going after and the biggest VACARVM reserves. Can you frame it a bit in terms of size? Are you targeting -- is it 10% or 20% of your book? Is it bigger? A little more color on the scale for this and what you're sort of hoping for.","Liam E. McGee","Tom, we'll have Beth do that. She'll give you a little more color in addition to the comments I made about it being about 15% of the book and about 45% of the NAR. So go ahead, Beth.","Beth A. Bombara","Yes. Thanks, Tom. So a couple of things just to frame it as to what policies this impacts. So it's about -- in total, about $5 billion of account value, and it's related to policies that have our LIB II [ph] rider associated with them, which is a lifetime income benefit rider. And again, the way that these programs work, as I'm sure you know, is that they're made available to all policyholders that meet the criteria that is in the filing. So as far as targeting certain policyholders, again, it's open to all. When we think about the benefits that we might see, currently, this book we see about a 5% lapse rate. When I look at what might be reasonable expectations as to what we might see for sort of an increase in the take rate, I think to the extent that, that doubles or triples, I think that's a reasonable expectation because we would never think that this choice would be right for all policyholders that have this benefit. So that -- again, that's how we're thinking about it right now. And then as we go through the approval process and we're able to actually offer this benefit to policyholders, we'll trip those estimates as we see actual take rates from the program.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And is there -- when you say 45% of the NAR, is it also approximately 45% of the reserves in capital, or is it not that linear?","Beth A. Bombara","Well, I think in all things VA, things are never linear, so I wouldn't look at it exactly that way. But again, given the fact that it does have the profile that it has, you would expect that the reserves allocated to it are higher than maybe other reserves associated with other portions of our block.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And just the last -- one last, if I could sneak it in. Chris, just on Japan, the main concern I've been hearing on that lately is rates are low. There's -- is there a risk, because of how deep in the money those contracts are in terms of the VA, that there's going to be a higher utilization than you've modeled, so there's fear that you might have to add to capital and reserves in Japan? Can you just give us some idea for, over the next 2 to 3 years, whether Japan is likely -- more likely to be a consumer or a returner of capital or something that's kind of neutral?","Christopher John Swift","Tom, on low rates in Japan, I would say, right now, in sort of our baseline scenario out the next couple years, we don't see the need to inject capital into Japan. But as you pointed out, there are obviously pressure points from low interest rates. All I can say is that our assumptions, as I looked at them, and again, we updated all our policyholder behavior assumptions this quarter, I think are very, very prudent. We do assume a high utilization of that benefit going forward. So I think we've planned for it. But in, again, a baseline scenario, I don't think they're going to consume capital, but on the other hand, I don't think they're going to be releasing capital back to the U.S. in a short period of time either.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First one, can you just clarify your cat reinsurance program? I believe you've got a $350 million deductible on it. Is there anything else we should think about as we kind of look at Sandy and the potential loss impact here?","Liam E. McGee","At a high level, Brian, you've got it, that our maximum loss retention is $350 million.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great, great. And then also from where Sandy hit, how can we kind of think about your market share, is it disproportionately larger there, something like that? Anything you can kind of give us color on that?","Liam E. McGee","Brian, Doug Elliot and his team have done an incredible amount of detail work on that side. And again, while it's very early, I think he can give you a flavor.","Douglas G. Elliot","Brian, this is Doug. I would say from a commercial perspective, we don't see ourselves out of pattern in any of the areas. Obviously, these are early days, but as we go through both our zip code and our territorial analysis across all the affected areas, I think you'll see us in line relative to market footprint across the states.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then I'd like to ask a question on some of the workers' comp reserve actions you continued to take here. I'm just curious, what's the challenge here in actually getting kind of loss picks right and reserves right with that line of business? And is there anything you're doing that, going forward, we're not going to see some of this current year development and adverse development on this line?","Douglas G. Elliot","So let's separate the current and the prior, and let me see if I can add some color and give you some confidence about some of the actions we're taking, which we feel very good about. Number one, on the prior accident year, and we look at $18 million against the base of $6 billion. I look at that, Brian, really as tuning. We did do some minor strengthening to the accident years '11, '10 and '09, and we had some releases 5, 4 and 3. But $18 million and $6 billion, really, given what we've gone through the last 5 quarters, I feel very good about our position. And we will continue to monitor aggressively and not -- there might not be little bumps on the road, but we are in a completely different spot than we were 5 quarters ago. When I think about the current year, a little bit of 2 stories. One is 2\/3 of our comp actions in the year were in Small Commercial. When you step back and think about Small Commercial, our returns and combined ratios in Small  are really, really outstanding, and I think they will stack up with pretty much anybody in the industry. We saw a little bit of medical severity in the quarter and a little bit of larger cases. So nothing major, but enough so that we made some minor modifications to our current accident year pick in Comp in Small. It's the first time we've had to do that in several years, but we're watching and staying very careful again, albeit you see the combined ratios and saw very solid returns and in line with outstanding rate adequacy across Small Commercial. A different story in Middle. We've talked aggressively about the rate actions we were taking in our Middle Market book the last 5, 6 quarters. We feel good about those rate actions. They do not stop in third quarter '12. We continue to march on. And as Liam mentioned, we're marching on into quarter 4. So we're out beyond our trends both on a frequency and severity standpoint and we now are improving margins. The prior actions had a little bit of Middle to them, but as I look at the current accident year, there isn't anything that concerns me. And I feel good about the actions we're taking in the marketplace and reflected in the balance sheet. So maybe some bumps along the way and a few bumps in the quarter but really very, very steady progress. And our behavior in the marketplace, both from a new business perspective and a rate retention, I think is a completely different spot than where we were third quarter 2011.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then just one last quick question for you, Doug. In new business, Small Commercial actually declining this quarter. Anything going on? Is that something we should continue to see going forward?","Douglas G. Elliot","So for us in Small Commercial, we clearly are looking at our dials, and we're making some adjustments. Our pricing in Small Commercial moved up in the quarter. That was a good thing. We've got a little bit of pressure in automobile. We're watching that carefully, and so we've adjusted pricing, and I think that has affected some of the top line. Nothing that at this moment that concerns me, but clearly not -- you're right, not at the run rate that we had for the first 6 months. So we'll stay on top of that. I want to make sure our margins stay very strong in that business, but we also are mindful that it's a business we'd like to grow, and we're thoughtful as we move forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a few series of questions, I guess, on the VA buyout plans. I think last quarter, when I asked about sort of the buyout opportunity, there was a comment that, we don't know if there's evidence yet that consumers will actually kind of make that trade. So have you seen evidence now that consumers will make that trade? And then if you achieve some of the targets that Beth talked about, I guess, what would be the next most logical step for further runoff of the VA book? I guess are there conversations or extensions you may be having with other participants that some of the more deep-in-the-money contracts, if those can get cleared out, that additional opportunities would free up, or is that just too optimistic?","Liam E. McGee","Chris, let me make just a high-level comment. I'll let Beth comment on the market intelligence of others have done it. Beth and her team, to your -- the second part of your question, are examining every single possibility we can reasonably consider to accelerate the runoffs of the book. And as I just said in my remarks, eventually, a permanent resolution to the size of risk of some of the books as well. So we have a variety of things in the pipeline. Some will materialize because they'll make sense, some won't, but there's no stone being left unturned in our Life Runoff business. So with that, Beth, I'll turn it over to you for any additional context that you want to give.","Beth A. Bombara","Sure. So as it relates to the first part of your question, Chris, as to the success of some of these programs by others. Anecdotally, we've heard that there had been some success, but really, the way we looked at designing our program was really more about looking at our book and the characteristics of the policies that we're targeting through this. And so because of that, and when we look at the offer that we're making, we do think that this will be attractive to some of the policyholders. So we do expect to see some take rate as it relates to this program once it's launched.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Liam, just one quick follow-up. I'm not asking for specifics around the deployment of the $2.2 billion, but if -- did I understand you correctly that the $2.2 billion will be used for debt pay-down, buybacks, as well as some action on further runoff of the VA book?","Liam E. McGee","Well, Chris, let me take a step back, first of all. Our capital management plan will be a holistic plan, including the $2.2 billion. And as I said, our current intentions -- we certainly don't want to get ahead of our regulator and our other constituencies, and we're in conversations with them. So our current intentions would be to do debt prepayment. At these share prices, repurchases are very accretive, as you know. And third, to preserve some capital so that we could be opportunistic when opportunities to permanently reduce the size and risk of the legacy annuity liabilities, which we believe will be very attractive for shareholders.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR.","Daniel K. Altscher - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","This is Dan Altscher on for Randy. A question for either Chris or Doug, on some clarification on the workers' comp accident year loss ratios. I think, Chris, you said that 2012 is running about 4 points better than 2011. Could you maybe give what the 2012 and 2011 accident year loss ratios are looking like, actual numbers?","Douglas G. Elliot","Right, so Randy, let me -- this is Doug -- Dan, this is Doug. When you think about accident year '11, what we're referring to is accident '11 as it sits right now, which is the 7-quarter look at '11, and that is correct that our view about accident year '12 versus '11 is about 4 points different. At the moment, third quarter '12 accident year is in the high 60s, 68. And I would say again, that's our combined standard workers' comp ratio, so it includes Middle and Small. There are different dynamics inside each, but those are the components that roll up to the total, and also a little bit of National over the top.","Daniel K. Altscher - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay, that's great. And then just a quick follow-up for Beth. You said the premium option or that the takeout of the VA buyout, the premium that's being offered is relatively attractive. Can you size that a little bit? Is it 5% above account value, 10% account value? And now with the NAR being so much lower with equity markets higher, what does that take, like are policyholders really going to be interested in that now that their accounts are much closer to being made whole?","Beth A. Bombara","Sure. So a couple things as it relates to that. As it relates to the program, the way that it works is that if a policyholder were to elect this option, they would be able to take out their account value with a waiver of any surrender charges that might still be applicable. And about 55% of this book still has some portion of a surrender charge that's applicable. And then the enhancement that they get above that account value is if they get a payment of 20% of what the benefit base is, or think about that as the guarantee amount, subject to a cap of overall 90%. So it does provide an enhancement. Again, as we look at this book, a significant portion of it is in the money, so that most -- there are several policyholders that, if they elect to this benefit, they would receive an amount greater than their current account value.","Douglas G. Elliot","Dan, let me add one other detail to you. I want to make sure that when you look at quarter-to-quarter, you go back and actually look at when we roll out our quarterly triangles. You make sure that the 7-quarter look at accident '11 is there. The year-to-date September comp all-in 3-quarter look will be 64, 64 2 [ph]. So there are lots of questions coming whether the quarter-to-date change -- the quarter-to-date change is 68, but the year-to-date will be 64.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you.

I'll now turn the call over to Liam.","Liam E. McGee","Thank you, Sabra. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The Hartford delivered very good third quarter results, with core earnings up 17% to $505 million or $1.03 per diluted share. This performance reflects the significant progress we've made transforming The Hartford. This quarter, we saw strong execution in our go-forward businesses and an acceleration of Talcott Resolution's runoff, further reducing the overall risk profile of the company. With this performance year-to-date, we expect full year 2013 results to exceed the outlook provided during our April Investor Day.","In P&C Commercial, Doug and his team are executing on their strategies to improve margins. Written premiums rose 1% overall, with growth of 2% in both Small Commercial and Middle Market. Strong pricing gains of 8% in Standard Commercial lines were consistent with the prior 4 quarters and included increases of 9% in both Middle Market worker's compensation and property.","For the quarter, the combined ratio was 93.3, excluding CATs and prior year development, 4.2 points better than the prior year. Profitability in workers' compensation has improved dramatically over the past 2 years, as you can see in our Middle Market results.","I am encouraged by our continued success in the Middle Market in broadening product reach across workers' compensation, property and general liability, which is providing new growth opportunities for us. Recent feedback from key distribution partners at the CIAB Annual Meeting confirmed our forward momentum in the P&C Commercial marketplace. We have meaningfully improved profitability in Group Benefits, with core earnings margin rising to 3.9% this quarter, driven primarily by improved disability loss ratios and pricing actions.","I am confident in the favorable underlying profit trends of the business and pleased to see 2 consecutive quarters of new sales growth. Consumer Markets also had a successful quarter, expanding underlying margins and growing written premium by 3% over the prior year. The combined ratio, excluding CATs and prior year development, improved to 91.1, more than 2 points better than the prior year period. Andy and his team have repriced this book of business and our position to balance growth and margin expansion going forward. I'm also pleased that, in September, we extended the AARP partnership by 3 years to January of 2023.","Mutual Funds is trending in a positive direction, with solid fund performance and sales growth of 35% for the quarter.","In Talcott Resolution, Beth and her team continue to reduce the size and the risk of the legacy annuity blocks. The Japan VA block is in a fundamentally different place today than a year ago. Over the past year, 18% of Japan VA contracts have surrendered. In the third quarter, the annualized surrender rate remained elevated at 31%. This is a permanent and meaningful reduction in the risk of that block. In the U.S., the full VA surrender rate increased, again in the third quarter to 20%, driven by rising markets and policyholder initiatives like the Enhanced Surrender Value program. Over the past year, 14% of U.S. VA policies have surrendered.","We continue to evaluate potential transactions that can permanently transfer these exposures and accelerate a release of capital. There is a growing interest in the marketplace for runoff blocks of annuity liabilities. We would pursue those transactions that are attractive in terms of sales price and the capital that would be released compared to the underlying economic value of the business. We are executing our capital management plan, with $241 million of equity securities repurchased in the third quarter and $408 million through the third quarter since announcing the program in February.","As additional capital becomes available over time, we will take accretive capital management actions to create value for shareholders.","The Hartford has undergone a significant transformation. The company is more focused with a reduced overall risk profile. The go-forward business' performance is improving, and we are well positioned to generate higher returns for shareholders. We are on track to have a successful 2013 with momentum carrying over into 2014. I am very thankful for the hard work and dedication of all my Hartford teammates.","Thank you. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Doug, who will review Commercial Markets results.","Douglas G. Elliot","Thank you, Liam, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover our P&C Commercial and Group Benefits results for the third quarter of 2013. I'll also provide some insight on various initiatives. I'm pleased to share that our core margin gains continued during the third quarter. Our execution remains steady and consistent, with margin improvement being the focus across-the-board.","Let's begin on Slide 5. P&C Commercial had a combined ratio for the quarter of 98.1. Our results included continued solid underwriting improvement year-over-year, with our current accident quarter loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, at 63.4, 5.4 points lower than 2012. Year-to-date, we posted a 63.1 loss ratio, 3.2 points lower than the same period last year, demonstrating the strong underlying improvement in our margins.","This quarter saw $48 million or 3.1 points of CAT losses. Of that total, $19 million is attributable to current quarter events, with the balance due to increased estimates on late-May wind and hail storms that affected Texas and other regions in the Southwest.","Across commercial lines, we also strengthened our prior year reserves by $26 million. This change reflects releases in workers' compensation, general liability and Storm Sandy, offset by an $86 million addition to commercial auto. A significant portion of our adverse development in auto occurred in our Programs business, which I'll describe more fully in a moment. We also added modestly to our auto reserves in Small Commercial and Middle Market to address the general rise in bodily injury severity trends we've seen across the marketplace. Overall, our combined ratio for the quarter, excluding CATs and prior year development, stands in very good shape at 93.3, 4.2 points lower than the third quarter of 2012. Year-to-date, we've improved 2.9 points to 93.2 versus the same period in 2012.","Let's move to Slide 6. Written premiums of $1.6 billion were up 1% in the quarter. Small Commercial and Middle Market were both up 2%, with Specialty down 4%, primarily related to profit improvement actions in our Programs and Captive businesses.","Written pricing and Standard Commercial remained very solid for the quarter at 8%, generally consistent with prior quarters and well ahead of loss cost trends.","The components of overall pricing shifted slightly, with Small Commercial auto up a point to 7% from 6% and workers' compensation in Middle Market declining to 9% from 10%. All in, I'm pleased with our ability to maintain this pace of consistent pricing gains, given that we still have more work ahead before we achieve our target returns.","Let me now share some specific thoughts about each of our 3 P&C Commercial business segments, starting with our market-leading Small Commercial franchise on Slide 7.","Written premiums of $740 million were up 2% in the quarter. Retention and pricing remain very steady, and new business of $115 million was up 6% versus third quarter of 2012.","Our market momentum in Small Commercial has picked up over the last 4 to 5 months. We continue to see very positive returns from the rollout of our new quoting platform, ICON, for our business owner's policy. Feedback from our agent partners tell us that we've hit a home run here. Average quote time for a new policy is down to 5 minutes or less. Quote flow is up 10% in the quarter and our yield ratio is improving as well. We've embedded new support tools, increased our straight-through processing flow and delivered a world-class user experience to our agents. We now have both workers' compensation and our business owner's policy on this platform, and we'll complete the full product suite next year when we roll out commercial auto.","To conclude on Small Commercial, our returns in this business continue to be excellent, with an all-in combined ratio for the quarter of 92.4, and 87.1 excluding CATs and prior year development.","Moving to Slide 8. Our Middle Market segment also had a strong performance, with current accident quarter combined ratio, excluding CATs, of 95.9. Margins continued to improve while we're deepening our market penetration and target segments.","Top line was up 2% in the quarter on the back of strong written pricing gains at 8%, well ahead of our loss cost trends. And new business premiums at $107 million were up 24% compared to 2012.","We're encouraged by improving retention in this business segment. Policy count retention moved up slightly and premium retentions are also improving to stronger historical levels. This is a result of a much healthier book of business in the Middle Market after aggressive reunderwriting actions these last 2 years.","Reviewing our trends, much of the heavy lifting is behind us from an underwriting perspective. However, we've not backed off from our segmentation actions to correct pricing on underperforming accounts, but the good news is that we have fewer of them today. All-in, another quarter of strong progress for Middle Market.","On Slide 9, the performance of our Specialty businesses remains mixed. Success in national accounts continues, with written premium growth of 15% in the quarter. Rate levels remain consistent and we're pleased with our execution.","Turning to our Programs business, we are disappointed at the further deterioration to our results. We recorded a $60 million addition through our auto liability reserve this quarter, largely in connection with 5 transportation programs. Over the past year, we've exited 4 of the 5 transportation programs, and we will discontinue writing new and renewal business on the final program effective January 1, 2014.","Earned premium from these transportation programs will decline rapidly as expiring business moves to other insurance markets throughout 2014. We did not react quickly enough to the early signs of adverse trends in this book. Our profit actions have increased significantly in speed and intensity over the past 6 months. I'm confident that we are addressing the areas that have caused these adverse financial outcomes. More importantly, I'm confident that we're building a data-driven risk management culture that will act with greater speed and decisiveness moving ahead.","Let me now shift over to Group Benefits business summarized on Slide 10, which had an outstanding quarter. We've been very disciplined in our management actions and the results are clearly paying off. Core earnings for the quarter were up 57% over prior year, achieving an after-tax margin of 3.9%. Year-to-date, core earnings are up 66% over 2012, driving an after-tax margin improvement of 1.7 points. Our improved core earnings are largely attributable to a lower disability loss ratio, which came in at 87.9% for the quarter, favorable to last year by 3.6 points.","We've commented previously that our claim recoveries were improving across our long-term disability book and this trend continued in quarter 3. In particular, actual recoveries for accident years '11 and '12 have emerged better than our previous expectations. This has caused us to update our reserve assumptions for claim recoveries in accident years '12 and prior, which contributed to our loss ratio improvement in the quarter. This also gives us high confidence in our projection for accident year 2013 and confirms that we're making great progress on our pricing and claim initiatives.","Heading to the favorable outlook, we're encouraged by continued signs of declining incidence rates. As you recall, incidence rates have been stable for several years but at historically elevated levels. As our 2012 data has matured, and now with a very early look at 2013, we have continued to see a modest but consistent decrease in incidence rates, approaching levels more in line with long-term patterns. Looking to both recovery and incident trends, we believe they established a strong profit driver for us moving forward.","Shifting to the top line. This is the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in new sales, posting $63 million this quarter, up 15% from 2012 as conditions in certain sectors of the new business marketplace have improved. We're also working aggressively on our January 2014 renewal block, which is particularly important for the National Accounts segment. We're maintaining our disciplined approach to pricing and underwriting on our multiyear contracts. Our execution on renewals and new sales, in conjunction with favorable emerging trends in our book of business, indicate that we are well along our journey to achieve target profitability levels.","Stepping back from the details, this was a solid quarter for Commercial Markets. Our performance was consistent with the strong start in the first half of 2013, and we continue to see the positive results of underwriting and pricing decisions made over the last few years. Overall, written and earned pricing is still outpacing our loss cost trends and driving margin improvement across our businesses. We still have much work ahead, but I'm excited about our progress.","Let me now turn the call over to Andy Napoli.","Andr\u00e9 A. Napoli","Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone. Before we get into the details for the quarter, I'd like to briefly discuss our broader strategy.","First, we couldn't be more pleased with the 3-year extension of our contract with AARP. This long-standing partnership is the core of our business and has produced strong results over the last 30 years, and we expect that to continue.","Our AARP program, historically a direct model, has gained significant traction in our agency channel, which came at a good time as we work to reposition the non-AARP or other agency portfolio. That effort continues to pay off as we've achieved significant combined ratio improvement in that channel over the past couple of years. And we now view this channel as a more significant source of profitable growth as we move forward. More to follow as this strategy unfolds.","Now turning to our results for the third quarter on Slide 12. We had another quarter of expanding margins while improving growth. In both auto and homeowners, earned pricing exceeded loss cost trends, and we were able to accomplish this while maintaining premium retention. Growth was driven primarily by strong new business production in our AARP Direct and AARP Agency channels. But especially noteworthy was 2% growth in other agency new business. The combination of new business and policy retention, particularly in auto, led to our third consecutive sequential quarter of in-force policy growth.","Core earnings for the quarter were $68 million, which included a 2.2-point improvement in our x CAT, x prior year combined ratio. The quarter's core earnings were also impacted by a higher level of CAT losses and a lower level of favorable prior year development than in the third quarter of 2012. Current accident year CAT losses in the quarter were $18 million, primarily related to wind and hail events in Colorado and other Midwest states. The $18 million is above last year's levels, but as the third quarter is typically a seasonally high quarter for CATs, this was well below expected levels.","During the quarter, we also lowered operational costs while increasing our AARP Direct marketing. Those actions, combined with premium growth, have kept our expense ratio flat. We are committed to driving down our expense ratio further through additional operational and process improvements.","Turning to Slide 13 and focusing on auto profitability. Our combined ratio, x CAT and x prior year, improved to 96.8, over 3 points better than last year.","Here is our perspective on loss trends. For auto liability, which combined bodily injury and property damage, both frequency and severity are up low-single-digits. This is relatively benign from our perspective. Auto physical damage frequency increased, but primarily with smaller towing claims, so there was a favorable offset in severity. On a net basis, physical damage trend is up, but pricing continues to exceed loss costs.","In homeowners, our combined ratio x CAT and prior year dropped just over a 0.5-point to 77.6, reflecting strong earned pricing exceeding loss trends and continued favorable non-CAT weather and non-weather frequency.","Now let's transition to growth on Slide 14. Written premiums grew 3% for the quarter, in total and individually, for both auto and homeowners. Written premium has grown 2% year-to-date, and we're positioned to maintain that level on a full year basis.","Contributing to the growth were renewal written pricing increases of 5% and 8% in auto and homeowners, respectively, while maintaining policy retention in both product lines.","New business increased 19% to $100 million in auto, and 9% at $35 million in homeowners. New business production was driven in part by a 42% increase in our AARP Agency channel, as well as increased spend and marketing productivity in the AARP Direct channel. Homeowners growth has moderated, following the initial launch of our new Home Advantage product and targeted rate increases in a number of states.","In closing, we're pleased with our results for the quarter and the year so far, and we're positioned to deliver similar results as we close out the year. We'll closely monitor our loss trends, and we'll take the necessary rate to achieve our combined ratio targets while also continuing our growth momentum across all our channels. I'll now turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher John Swift","Thank you, Andy. Good morning, everyone. I have 3 main topics to cover this morning: First, I will review the quarter's results; second, I will cover the performance of the variable annuity books; and third, I'll provide a fourth quarter and updated full year 2013 outlook.","Let's begin on Slide 16. Third quarter 2013 core earnings rose 17% to $505 million. Core earnings were $1.03 per diluted share, an increase of 14%. Commercial markets, which Doug just covered, was a major contributor to the growth. P&C Commercial and Group Benefits achieved higher margins, driving core earnings for those segments up 9% and 57%, respectively. Andy covered Consumer Markets, which had a strong underlying quarter but lower core earnings due to higher catastrophes and less favorable development.","Touching on the other segments. Mutual Funds core earnings decreased slightly from the third quarter of 2012 due to higher expenses for marketing and advertising. Fund performance remains solid, driving sales up 35% over the prior year. Although net flows remain negative, they improved 18% over last year and 78% over the second quarter. Talcott core earnings were up 6% over prior year, higher than our July outlook largely due to $22 million of pretax limited partnership income versus our outlook of $0 million to $5 million for the whole company.","In the Corporate segment, core losses improved $60 million over the prior period, principally due to a total after-tax benefits of $55 million from an insurance recovery and items related to the spin-off from The Hartford's former parent. Including this quarter results, we achieved a trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 8%, which is at the higher end of our 2013 outlook.","Net income for the quarter was $293 million, a significant improvement from $13 million last year. 2 principal items reconcile core earnings to net income this quarter: First, net realized capital losses totaling $130 million after tax and DAC, principally due to Japan VA hedge losses; and second, an unlock charge of $67 million, mostly due to the annual assumption study, which we had completed this quarter.","Turning to Slide 17, you can see that core earnings included a total benefit of $87 million after tax or $0.18 per diluted share for certain items. The 2 largest items were the $55 million benefit in Corporate that I just mentioned and $43 million in favorable CATs, compared to our outlook of $86 million after tax.","Last year's quarter included $44 million in core earnings from Individual Life and Retirement Plans, which were sold in January of this year.","Turning to Slide 18. In September 30, The Hartford's book value per diluted share was $87.87 -- excuse me, $38.87, up slightly from June. Book value per share reflects a decline in unrealized gains on our investment portfolio due to higher interest rates, which is shown in the table at the bottom of this slide. Excluding AOCI, book value per diluted share was $38.91, up slightly from June.","Book value per share includes the accretion from share repurchases, which totaled $408 million through September. We expect to repurchase about $200 million or so each quarter going forward, subject to legal restrictions and market conditions.","Our principal focus at Talcott is to reduce the size and risk of that block. And as Liam mentioned, we have made significant progress this year. In the IFS, we provided some additional disclosures about policy counts this quarter.","Slide 19 shows that since September 2012, Japan VA contract in-force are down about 18%, resulting in a permanent reduction in the size and risk of the block. Japan's surrenders have been driven by the sharp improvement in in-contract moneyness due to a combination of market factors, including higher equity market levels and a weaker yen. In addition, 73% of total contracts are beyond the surrender charge period.","This slide also shows GMDB and GMIB net amount at risk, or NAR, over the past several quarters. GMIB NAR is down 92% over the past year to only $0.5 billion at September 30. Moneyness is another way to measure the improvement in the book. At the end of the quarter, 53% of the GMIB contracts are out of the money, which means that the account value exceeds our GMIB guarantee. This compares favorably with 43% at June 30 and 2% at year end 2012.","In August, the first tranches of Japan VA contracts become eligible for annuitization. To date, many contract holders are surrendering rather than annuitizing or deferring their annuitization, which is a positive for us and that we come off risk faster than expected. While the eligible number of accounts is small in 2013, it ramps up substantially in 2014, which will allow us to develop a more informed view of this aspect of customer behavior next year. 2015 is the peak for potential annuitizations, with about $5 billion of account value eligible to annuitize.","Again, it's too soon to know if our current experience will continue, but initial signs have been favorable.","Moving to Slide 20. Favorable markets and in-force management initiatives are driving similar trends in our U.S. VA block. As Liam mentioned, the annualized full VA surrender rate increased to about 20%, including about 6 points from in-force management initiatives, including the ESV program.","During the quarter, we finished the ESV program launch, extending the offer in 4 more states. As of quarter end, 91% of GMWB contracts are out of the money and 84% of total contracts are beyond the surrender charge period.","GMWB NAR has declined 67% since September 30, 2012, while total U.S. VA contracts in-force have decreased by 14%.","Based on the policyholder behavior across the VA blocks, we are confident that Talcott will be positioned to return capital to the holding company in late 2014 or early 2015.","Our capital resources are summarized on Slide 21. At September 30, they totaled $17.7 billion, down $400 million from June. The decrease was in holding company resources, while total insurance company capital was up slightly after the impact of the quarterly P&C dividend to the holding company.","Life surplus was flat this quarter, as operating income from non-VA books, including the Group Benefits business, offset the modest negative impact of VAs. Life capital margin remains strong, with an estimated RBC ratio of 460% in The Hartford Life and Accident group, allowing us to complete the Group Benefits legal entity separation project without utilizing holding company resources. We remain on schedule to complete that project by the end of the first quarter 2014.","The decrease in holding company resources reflects the $320 million debt maturity and $241 million of share repurchases. Going forward, we expect holding company resources to decline due to the equity repurchase program and the March 2014 debt maturity but to remain in line with our liquidity target of approximately 2x annual interest expense and dividend payments.","Before turning to your questions, let me provide a brief summary of our fourth quarter outlook, which is on Slide 22.","Our current outlook for the fourth quarter core earnings is a range of $420 million to $445 million or $0.87 to $0.92 per diluted share.","This outlook assumes catastrophe losses of $42 million after tax and Talcott core earnings of $165 million to $175 million, including approximately $7 million in after-tax costs for the ESV program. This outlook also assumes limited partnership income of about $60 million before tax, which equates to a 9% yield.","We are estimating an average share count of about 485 million shares based on $200 million of share repurchases. Also expected is a realized gain of approximately $15 million after tax from the sale of the AARP member contract center for health insurance products to a division of UnitedHealthcare. This center, which generates about $15 million of core earnings per year, is included in the Consumer Markets segment. This deal is consistent with our strategy to sharpen our focus on P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds. The transaction is expected to close before the end of the year.","If you add this fourth quarter outlook to our year-to-date results, which are summarized on the slide, 2013 core earnings would be about $1.7 billion. This is well ahead of our April outlook of $1.45 billion to $1.55 billion.","Our actual results will depend on a lot of factors, including no major CATs in the fourth quarter. However, we are very pleased with our 2013 results and appreciate the significant effort by all of our teammates to achieve these results.","We look forward to delivering both growth and progress on our strategic goals in 2014. We are in the midst of the planning process, and we'll share our 2014 outlook with you on our February call.","To wrap up, let me summarize a few themes from the quarter and the year. Our go-forward businesses are producing strong results, with top line growth in P&C and improving margins in P&C and Group Benefits. Talcott has made significant progress in reducing the size and risk of the legacy annuity liabilities, with favorable contract holder behavior, resulting in higher surrender rates. And capital resources remain strong. And with favorable trends at Talcott, we are confident in our ability to return capital from Talcott in late 2014 or early 2015.","Now I'll turn the call over to Sabra, so we could begin the Q&A session. Sabra?","Sabra Purtill","Thank you, Chris. We have a little less than 30 minutes for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Melissa, could you please give the Q&A instructions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just wanted to ask a few questions on Talcott. The first question is, does running off the VA block on your own still make the most economic sense here? But to another way of asking, is the bid-ask spread still too wide in your view to pursue risk transfer deals?","Liam E. McGee","Well, Tom, this is Liam. Our strategy on Talcott remains unchanged. That's to reduce the size and risk of the VA book. And as you heard in both my remarks and Chris' remarks, Beth and her team have been proactive against that strategy as evidenced by the increased lapse rates, the significant reduction in the policy count in the last 12 months, whether that's through the Enhanced Surrender Value or policyholder education. We've also -- we're also consistent in saying that potential transactions that can permanently transfer these exposures and accelerate a release of capital are things that we'll continue to evaluate, and we would pursue those transactions that are attractive in terms of sales price and the capital that would be released compared to the underlying economic value of the business. I'm not going to speculate on any theoretical transactions, Tom, so I think that's going to be the extent of my remarks on that topic.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And Liam, suffice to say, though, given how fast the lapse rates are moving and the -- also to Chris' comment about the now policyholders that could elect to defer or to annuitize who are actually surrendering, I'm assuming the view of fair market value continues to grow higher in your view based on those trends.","Liam E. McGee","Again, I'm not going to speculate on how the market might value it. What I'd say is that obviously we have a lot of flexibility because of some of the things you noted and that Chris and I have mentioned as well, and we'll look at all options, including continue the great proactive work that Beth and her team have done this far and including evaluating potential transactions. But we would also pursue those that are attractive in terms of sales price and the capital that would be released as compared to the underlying economic value of the book.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Understood, Liam. And then just a follow-up for Chris on -- what's the best way that we should be thinking about Talcott? You're looking -- between U.S. and Japan, lapse rates are running at 20% to 30%. And so if you look forward a year or -- more at a higher level, assuming 5% or 6% or so market appreciation, that would imply, all else equal, the year-over-year profit decline would be roughly 15% to 20%. And I know that's not the way you're thinking about it economically but that would be the way it's presented in your P&L unless I'm missing something else that might be major there. And so, a, is that the right way to think about it, or there are some other offsets? And b, would you all be better off giving net income guidance on this business, or guidance that somehow better expresses the way you're thinking about the economics?","Christopher John Swift","Tom, it's Chris. A couple of points. I think you are seeing that the trends right and Beth might be able to comment upon what she sees for fourth quarter lapses but they are elevated, particularly in Japan and in the U.S. So we'll talk more about it in February when we give guidance, but I do think your point of view on a substantial decline in Talcott's core earnings is right on. So I think you're wise to look hard at those forward views, given the elevated lapses in Japan and that the recent elevation we've seen in the U.S. Beth, would you care to comment upon fourth quarter lapses and what you've seen?","Beth A. Bombara","Yes, sure. So as we look at the activity that we've seen in October, we continue to be very pleased with the level of surrenders that we're seeing. In the U.S. we're slightly under the 20% that we saw for all of Q3. And in Japan, we're running maybe around 25% or so. So, again, I think as markets stay where they are, continue to rise, we'd expect our surrender rates to continue to be very elevated. And as Chris pointed out, that does have the impact of reducing earnings going forward. But more importantly, it reduces the risk, which is what we're focused on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of questions, I guess, probably for Doug. Two lines of businesses I would like to ask about on the Commercial side. First is workers' compensation. I've seen some industry data that suggests that claims frequency, after spiking in 2010, came down in '11 and '12, and I want to get a sense of what you're seeing in that line. And then secondly, in the commercial auto business, in the Program business, where the biggest reserve addition was taken, can you talk about the tail on that business? How long it is?","Douglas G. Elliot","Sure, Jay. This is Doug. Let me talk about workers' comp to start with. We are seeing very positive signs in our comp book over the last couple of years, particularly around frequency. And obviously, we spend time looking at it across our markets but certainly, in our Small Commercial and Middle Market businesses, our frequencies in the last 4 to 6 quarters have been flat to down, so I think consistent with some of the signals you're seeing in the marketplace. But we think both our underwriting actions and some of things we've done in the last couple of years have clearly driven our change. So good news on the frequency front in workers' comp. In terms of the automobile, transportation programs, we do have our arms around it. This is more an exit strategy than it is a fixed strategy. At the moment, I'll share with you, by 1\/1\/14, we'll be out of the 5 programs that have caused really much of our financial adverse positioning here. There is clearly a BI severity dynamic in the marketplace, not just in the Programs area but across commercial auto in general, and we're underwriting and pricing our way through that. The tail, when I think about commercial auto, clearly, it's not a workers' comp tail but it's also not a property tail. So I think of it in that 3- to 4-year period of time, and we're aggressively looking at '09, '10, '11 and '12 as we speak. So I feel like we took actions to deal with the increased severity over that period of time, and this book will run out over the period of the next 12 months.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Two questions. One, I guess, is for Doug. Doug, I'm just curious in the Commercial line's underlying loss ratios, obviously, very substantial improvement year-over-year. How much would you attribute that to just kind of lower than kind of trend loss costs?","Douglas G. Elliot","Brian, very difficult to articulate. I do believe that in our positive trends, more than rate is coming through. We have an have aggressive analytics program where we quintile our book of business and we look at retentions and price changes across classes, industries and geographies. And so probably, much of the change is rate driven. But I think an appreciable component of our 3-plus-points of improvement year-over-year is driven by, what I would say, underwriting quality of change in the book.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So more just is the changes in terms and conditions you're doing, not so much just it's been a lucky kind of weather situation, non-CAT weather?","Douglas G. Elliot","Yes, certainly, in the properties side. I mean, we've strengthened our ability to underwriting our product in the marketplace relative to Property over the last 3 years. And so deductible changes, policy form, et cetera, all contribute on the Property side. I was kind of giving you more of global across all lines of view of just increased attention to our risk product in the marketplace. And I think the analytics behind some of our choices have clearly driven some of that positive change in our loss ratio.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great, and then for Chris. Because I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of what you think the market consistent value is for the Japanese and the U.S. runoff books right now. Is it appreciably higher than it was at Investor Day?","Christopher John Swift","I think, directionally, I can comment upon that, Brian. We'll periodically update numbers when appropriate. But generally, I would say, for Japan, it's less negative. And for the U.S., it's greater, greater positive. So I mean, that's where we stand here right now at the third quarter, and we are contemplating updating that at least once a year. And give us a little time, and we'll put it out there at the appropriate time.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Is there any way we can kind of -- is it 20% higher in the U.S.? 10%?","Christopher John Swift","It's meaningful. I'd say in that range, yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Citigroup.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about just your expectations for capital return from Talcott. And I guess, specifically, the factors that affect the timing of paying dividends.","Liam E. McGee","Well, Chris will, I'm sure, want to give more detail. I'd reiterate what he and I have said is that we are confident that Talcott is positioned to return capital to the holding company in late 2014 or early 2015. I'd remind you, Erik, that there's a lot of work in process, whether it's closing the U.K. sale, or the completion of the Group Benefits realignment, et cetera. So there is still some work afoot. And with that, Chris, if you want to add any more perspectives to Erik's question.","Christopher John Swift","I think you're right to mention the moving parts, Liam. So I always just start by saying what's different today, Erik? I mean, for '14, for both Group Benefits and Mutual Funds, I mean, we're going to have cash flows coming to the ultimate parent company, holding company, that we didn't have in prior years. So there's probably about $150 million in new cash flows that are coming out of those, I'll call it former Talcott entities. With relation then to Talcott, the remain Co., we always think about it in terms of the Japanese balance sheet and the U.S. balance sheet. I think, for Japan, one of the things just to keep in mind is there is a little bit of a constraint on dividends. Meaning, you have to have positive retained earnings. We just barely turned positive at the end of the third quarter 2013 here. So our current thinking is we will inform the regulators, we don't have to seek their approval when we're in positive retained earnings. But we will bring them a 2014, early '15 plan for capital extraction out of Japan, make sure they understand it and begin to execute it in the second half of 2014. And then with regard to the U.S., similar constraints. After we spin off Group Benefits into its own legal entity, I mean, we're in extraordinary dividend land because, again, we have negative retained deficits at HLIC and ILA. So we'll, at the appropriate time, work with the regulators to extract capital. But that would have to be in the form of extraordinary dividend. Does that help?","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, that's helpful. And then, I guess, just over time, how quickly should we think about capital and reserves being freed as policies lapse? So maybe not thinking specifically in 2014 but just on kind of an ongoing basis, what is the lag between kind of seeing lapses and then when those reserves could -- reserves or capital could potentially become available for dividends?","Christopher John Swift","Yes, we'll cover a little bit more of our outlook of earnings and capital in February. But I would say that I think, generally, you have to keep in mind, I'll call it, we always talk about it, Beth and I, units of risks, right? We're still managing units of risk, and we run our stress scenarios that we are always going to manage to. So lapses, by definition, will always have a lag factor compared to units of risk in a stress scenario. And we'll describe that the best way we can in February.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. One, just on the -- I'm thinking about, especially in relation to Tom's question, about the pace of runoff, maybe pace of account value decline, in the runoff VA box and thinking about that sort of 15% to 20% type of pace of decline in Talcott earnings as a result. And I'm sort of connecting that to the fourth quarter outlook for Talcott, which suggests something, on an annualized basis anyway, that's a much faster pace of runoff when we adjust for some of the one-timers. Just wondering if there's anything you can help us understand there as it relates to the fourth quarter outlook versus the third quarter, which looks like it was more in the $200 million, $205 million range if we take out the ESV costs and maybe some strong results in the Other line.","Christopher John Swift","Yes, John, it's Chris. I think you got to think in terms of just going to the fourth quarter that the third quarter had, I'll call it, a couple of one-timers in it, particularly for, I'll call it, investment income partnerships. But generally, as lapses occur, we're going to have less fee income. We are projecting just less net investment income in total in Talcott from regular spread products and then any other income. And we did have a couple of one-time benefits for taxes and other, I'll call it, miscellaneous income benefits that just aren't expected to recur. So I really do believe the one -- the range that we gave, which, at the midpoint, $170 million, $175 million is really what you need to think in terms of just a basic core run rate going forward and really adjust for lapses from that rate.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And maybe we'll follow up a little bit off-line. And then just one other question on the -- you've updated us in the past on your progress on expense initiatives relative to your targets. There's nothing here in the third quarter presentation. But can you just update us, at this point, how much of your expense saves is in your third quarter results? And how much more should we expect as we move through 2014?","Christopher John Swift","Thanks for asking the question. I think we feel very good about all our expense initiatives here related to stranded costs related to our sales that we completed earlier this year. So we're right on track. They are beginning to earn in. And I think in February, when we get together and talk more about our run rate for '14 and even a little bit '15, I think will give you a better sense of the additional expense initiatives that we're planning above and beyond just getting the stranded corporate costs out from a deal perspective. But there is new rounds of initiatives that we're planning that, really, will take us forward for the next 3 years, with goals to become a more efficient organization.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if I can sneak one more in just thinking about the Japanese VA business. I think, if I recall correctly, you guys hold contingency reserves in the Japanese sub. I think that number was somewhere around $700 million. Has that changed? Well, first of all, is that right? And secondly, has that changed meaningfully as a result of this faster pace of surrender activity? Have you started to build in to the actuarial assumptions this higher pace of surrenders?","Christopher John Swift","I'll give you 2 data points just for clarity. You are right. It's a little light of $700 million on a U.S. dollar basis. It has been trending down just a little bit as the book runs off. So you're right. And then, the way we think about capital that supports the Japan, I'll call it block of business, 2 pieces, right? The $1.2 billion of capital in the legal entity that we disclosed. And then there's still, going back to what we disclosed in our Investor Day for Talcott, about $600 million of U.S. statutory capital that's backing -- that reinsurance business into the U.S. So those are the couple key metrics that I'll just share with you, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","For the Japan business, how would that $1.8 billion of total stack capital compare to a U.S. GAAP capital?","Christopher John Swift","Jay, it's Chris. I would say it would be -- the U.S. capital would be slightly higher in the range of $2.4 billion. Again, in total, in aggregate, supporting all the, call it Japanese risks, no matter if they're in the island of Japan or if they're in the U.S. But in aggregate, I would say approximately $2.4 billion of GAAP capital.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And on that same metric, what would you allocate the U.S. variable annuity business capital position?","Christopher John Swift","I don't have that right in front of me, Jay. So I guess I'd want to be more thoughtful. But, again, I think if you go back to Investor Day, I think if you look at some of our disclosures, adjust for Group Benefits, now adjust for Japan, you're really left then with, I'll call it, runoff Talcott. But I'd rather be more thoughtful and just give you that number when we talk about our earnings and guidance for 2014.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. On a statutory basis of the $6.9 billion U.S. Life capital position, can you give a rough breakdown of what that consists of currently?","Christopher John Swift","Yes. And I think I know where you're going, so of the U.S. statutory capital, how we think about it is x Japan, x, I'll call it, U.K. operation, HLL, and x recapitalization of Group Benefits, what Talcott will be left with is about $4.5 billion of statutory surplus. So when we get through the Group Benefits separation, when we sell and close on HLL in the fourth quarter, which is still on track, and you exclude sort of the Japan statutory capital that's allocated in the U.S. to it, you're left with $4.5 billion backing, I'll call it, the U.S. runoff liabilities, which are, again, are variable annuities and fixed payout annuities.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Giovanni from Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Liam, a follow-up for you in terms of you mentioned kind of a growing interest in the market for runoff annuity blocks. I'm curious if you could dissect a bit in terms of those that are showing interest. So maybe the mix of kind of PE-backed players, reinsurers or traditional insurers. And then how many of these guys are really just looking for kind of a lopsided deal versus maybe a more credible bidder and counterparty?","Liam E. McGee","Chris, I think you can understand, for a variety of reasons, it's not appropriate for me to talk about it. Such transactions or conversations involve The Hartford characterizing counterparties, describing motivations, I just don't think would be appropriate.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, for Chris. Just an update in terms of the legal entity separation. You had mentioned to kind of strip out the Group Benefits piece. Any timeline for when you expect to have that done?","Christopher John Swift","Yes, Chris. We feel very good about it. We've gotten, I'll call it, the legal entity approved in New York. And we got to get some product filings approved. We got to finish couple a little operational activities with admin systems. But I would say mid- to late-first quarter, we'll have that all done.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Mark Finkelstein from Evercore.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Maybe the first question for Doug. Doug, in the specialty programs that you've set for termination, already terminated, what is the total value of the premium, looking a year from now, that won't be on the books anymore?","Douglas G. Elliot","The total value of all 5 of those transportation programs that we're exiting is approximately $50 million annually, so think of that out -- and several of those decisions have been made over the prior quarter. So the last program to cease writing, new and renewal, 1\/1\/14.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And that -- the $50 million is still essentially in there? So that full value will go away over the next kind of 4 to 6 quarters or whatever?","Douglas G. Elliot","Correct.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, perfect. And then, I guess, a final question for Chris. Chris, could you just talk about J GAAP earnings a little bit? I feel like maybe we've actually kind of crossed over into positive surplus in Japan. Maybe a little quicker. I don't know if that's right or wrong, if you can comment on that. And then, secondly, kind of what are J GAAP -- or what have J GAAP earnings been kind of over the last 2 quarters?","Christopher John Swift","I think between Beth and I, we -- I'll try to give you a frame. But we are, as I said, at September 30, about $10 million of positive retained earnings. Some of that is, again, just more fee income, more spread income off the general account products. Some of it is the, I'll call it, contingency reserves that are, I'll call it, running off. So as we look forward, that's why we want to finish 2014, get through March, which is their fiscal year, that those accounts all closed up, see exactly where we are, we will have a better, then, forward view of the next 12 months, with just the next fiscal year for earnings. And then take a comprehensive 12-month capital extraction plan in to the regulator and inform them what we're going to. And then begin to execute it in the latter half of '14. But, Beth, from a run rate side on GAAP -- J GAAP earnings, any color you could provide?","Beth A. Bombara","Yes, just -- if you go back to June, just as a starting point, we had negative retained earnings of about $60 million. So that's kind of the quarterly earnings that we see, if we got the positive $10 million, so you're looking at $60 million to $70 million a quarter.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And have you turned positive a little quicker than your original plan was?","Christopher John Swift","I would say, generally, right on schedule. Maybe a smidge sooner, Mark. But generally right on plan. I mean, if you think about it, I really consider it breakeven right now. So we broke even. We'll then have 2 additional quarters of, I'll call it, activity to take to the FSA. We'll look then at the next forward activity. So you really could see and get a sense that we're already looking 6 quarters ahead for what that balance sheet looks like and then how much capital we could take out.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, actually, one last question, if I could sneak it in. Can you just talk about incidence trends in Group? And how they compared sequentially with the second quarter, which was obviously very strong?","Douglas G. Elliot","Mark, this is Doug. I would say that sequentially, the incidence trends in the third quarter compare very consistent with second quarter, right? So we're finally seeing some improvement relative to those patterns. And third quarter sat right on top of second quarter.","Christopher John Swift","Hey, Mark, just to tell you another point. Just -- as Doug and I look at that business, I mean, just to remind you, I mean, fourth quarter is our seasonally highest and best quarter in Group Benefits. So again, there'll be, I'll call it, seasonality and incident in termination improvements that will ultimately come through when we report fourth quarter earnings.","Liam E. McGee","And Mark, the other point I'd make is that, as you know, because of the waiting periods, the retention components of these programs, the back half of the year is important for us to stay on top. We're just beginning to take a peek at the '13 year, given how these contracts are set up.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you. Thank you, all, for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in The Hartford. Sean and I are available after the call for any follow-up questions you might have. And I would also note that Liam McGee is scheduled to present to the Goldman Sachs Conference on December 10. So we look forward to seeing you there as well.

Hartford delivered strong results in commercial lines and group benefits despite sustain competition this quarter, while personal auto performance remains under pressure from loss cost trends. Doug will cover P&C and Group benefit results in a few minutes. And I wanted to highlight notable 2016 accomplishments that demonstrate the Hartford\u2019s underwriting discipline, effective execution and fundamental strengths of our platform.","Commercial Lines delivered an exceptionally strong underlying combined ratio of 89.4 for the full year. The performance reflects the Hartford\u2019s best-in-class operating capabilities, strong market positions and disciplined underwriting. During the year, we also made progress on our strategy to broaden our risk appetite including entry into the E&S space with the acquisition of Maxum, expanded multinational capabilities through our partnership with AXA and the launch of a dedicated energy practice.","Group Benefits delivered very good results for the full year, with the core earnings margin of 5.7%. We generated profitable growth in this segment reflecting strong sales, persistency and an improved loss ratio. We continue to execute on our Group Benefits growth strategy, enhancing the products suite with the addition of dental and vision for the small case market in new voluntary offerings. ","At Talcott, we continue to effectively and efficiently manage the runoff of the annuity blocks. Over the past two year, Talcott has returned $1.75 billion of capital to the holding company and we expect an additional $600 million in 2017. During 2016, we also addressed our legacy P&C exposures, which over the past few years has generated substantial adverse development. ","In July, we agreed to sell the runoff UK subsidiaries to Catalina, which we expect to close in the next few months. And at year-end, we reinsured the remaining legacy U.S. A&E liabilities to National Indemnity. While these actions resulted in modest book value dilution, we believe that the economic trade-off was well worth the near-term costs.","Turning to Personal Lines, we are encouraged about moderating frequency, but remained concerned about bodily injury liabilities severity trends. As a consequence, we have strengthened prior year reserves and current accident year loss picks. In setting year-end calls for accident years 2015 and 2016, we placed higher weight on the most recently emerged bodily injury severity experience. We are intently focused on improving the profitability of this business.","During the year we accelerated pricing, distribution and underwriting initiatives, resulting in a sharp drop in new business. Doug will provide you with more background on these actions and the progress we have achieved over this past year and I am confident that we will deliver improved results in 2017.","Finally, before turning the call over to Doug, I\u2019d like to briefly cover our 2017 goals and expectations; Given the significant progress that Hartford has made over the past several years, I am confident in our ability to continue to perform well in an environment that we expect to remain challenging in 2017. ","We expect competition to remain robust for the coming year, with new entrance aggressively seeking in roads into our markets and peers fighting hard to retain their business. Technological, innovation and its potential effect on business models is also adding to the competitive intensity. In addition to these trends, 2017 presents higher regulatory, fiscal and macro-economic uncertainty.","We are closely monitoring developments on capital health, including corporate tax reform, infrastructure spending in the possible repel or replacement of ACA and other changes in regulations all of which could impact us. With that backdrop, our strategy and focus in 2017 remain consistent. Hartford will prioritize long-term growth initiatives by investing in products, distribution, data and analytics and digital capabilities to provide more value to our agents and customers. These investments are aimed at providing us with critical insights and creating seamless interaction for customers across each of our businesses. ","Specifically, in 2017 we intent to maintain strong margins in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits and to approve auto profitability. Our goal is to grow core earnings and book value per share, supported by continued capital management, including $1.3 billion of share repurchases and efficient debt management. We will continue to relentlessly scrutinize our expense structure, recognizing the importance of operating efficiency to competitive strength. ","In closing, I am proud of what the Hartford accomplished in 2016. We delivered strong financial results excluding auto, we returned $1.7 billion of equity to shareholders through repurchases in common dividends and continue to reduce debt outstanding and we significantly improved our operating capabilities and expanded our risk appetite. As we enter 2017, I am confident we are taking the right steps in our competitive markets as we continue to invest for long-term growth and shareholder value creation. ","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Doug. ","Doug Elliot","Thank you, Chris and good morning, everyone. We had an excellent 2016 in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits, particularly in light of the growing competitive dynamics we\u2019ve seen in these markets.","Before I share details on our commercial businesses, let me get right into Personal Lines, where I only can describe 2016 auto loss trends as challenging and our financial performance as disappointing.","For the fourth quarter, we posted a Personal Lines core loss of $17 million, cat losses for the quarter were $28 million, $7 million higher than in 2015. The underlying combined ratio which excludes catastrophes and prior year development was 101.8, deteriorating 8.3 points from last year. This is primarily due to higher auto loss costs, partially offset by lower expenses.","In homeowners the underlying combined ratio for the fourth quarter of 74.7, deteriorated 2.3 points versus last year. The fourth quarter of 2015 experienced very favorable results compared to our longer term average. Overall our homeowners performance remains very solid and we continue to effectively manage rate needs and underwriting execution. ","In Personal Lines auto, we continue to see higher than expected overall loss cost trends. On the positive side, our current estimate of the change in frequency for the second and third quarters of 2016 has moderated versus our estimates 90 days ago. The change in bodily injury severity on the other hand has increased and continues to be an area of intense focus affecting both current and prior accident years. ","We recorded $20 million of prior year development in auto liability, primarily related to accident year 2015. We also increased the accident year 2016 loss ratio by approximately 2.5 points. Throughout the year we have been executing on substantial rate underwriting, agency management and new business actions. We have provided a new exhibit in our slide package that depicts our progress within segments of our auto book. We are measuring and managing our actions by state and customer cohort very closely.","Let me provide commentary on three examples of the actions we\u2019re taking. First, written pricing in the fourth quarter was 9%, increasing 3 points from prior year and 2 points sequentially. I expect this number to increase an additional 1 to 2 points over the next few quarters. The earned premium impact of this rate is ultimately based on the customers we renew, but the combination of rate increases and mix change in the book of business will drive auto margin improvement in 2017 and 2018.","Second, we reduced our new business marketing efforts in many jurisdictions until more adequate rates are in effect. Auto new business for the fourth quarter was down 58% with other agency off 64%. We are confident that we can return to new business growth once adequate rate levels are in placed to deliver our target returns.","And third, lower new lower new business also results in reduced market expense and lower operational costs, which contributed to a 3.5 point improvement in the expense ratio for the fourth quarter. These actions and others will have a favorable effect on our loss ratio as higher average premium per policy and improved book of business mix are reflected in our earned premium.","In commercial lines, we delivered $277 million of core earnings for the fourth quarter, on a combined ratio of 91.3, 3.2 points higher than 2015. Catastrophe losses for the quarter were $20 million higher than in \u201815, driven mainly by Hurricane Matthew and hail events in the Southwest. The fourth quarter also included 1.2 points of unfavorable prior year development versus 1 point of favorable development in the fourth quarter of 2015.","The unfavorable prior year development was related to commercial auto and package business partially offset by prior year development and workers compensation being favorable. Commercial auto continues to be under pressure in our book of business and across the industry. We recorded $38 million pre-tax of prior year development to address severity trends, primarily in Small Commercial related to accident year 2015.","We continue to achieve high single-digit written price increases in this line and have taken aggressive underwriting actions including enhanced referral criteria, resulting in lower retention and lower new business. We also recorded $15 million pre-tax of prior year development in the package business to address general liability severity trends and Small Commercial. ","The underlying combined ratio for Commercial Lines was 88.2 for the fourth quarter flat compared to 2015. This reflects improve current exiting year results in workers compensation, offset by weaker results in commercial auto.","Renewal written pricing in Standard Commercial Lines was 2% for both the full year and the fourth quarter holding steady throughout the year. I'm very pleased with this outcome, which reflects the underwriting rigor and discipline of our team in our competitive marketplace. Written premium of $1.7 billion for the quarter was up 3% from 2015, driven primarily by growth in Small Commercial including the acquisition of Maxum.","Let me provide some detail of each of our commercial business units. Small Commercial had a solid fourth quarter to cap off an outstanding year. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 86 up 0.9 point from 2015. Written premium for the fourth quarter grew by 7% driven by strong retentions and a $145 million of new business including Maxum.","In middle market we demonstrated strong underwriting and pricing discipline delivering an underlying combined ratio of 88.9 for the fourth quarter improving 0.1 point from 2015. Written premium increased 1% based on solid retentions and new business production of a $133 million up 17% versus prior year. We are encouraged by these results, which we attribute to growing momentum on a number of strategic initiatives including our recently launched energy practice and our expanded multinational capability.","We\u2019ve received very positive feedback from our agents and customers that we\u2019re delivering a well-integrated and comprehensive solution for their international needs. As a result we\u2019re finding opportunities to win new accounts based in the U.S. with international exposures that we might not have quoted in years prior. In Specialty Commercial the underlying combined ratio 94.8 for the fourth quarter improved from 98.1 in 2015. This was driven by strong performance in national accounts workers compensation, bond and financial products.","Now let me turn to Group benefits. Core earnings for the fourth quarter increased to $59 million up from $40 million in 2015 with a core earnings margin of 6.5%. The Group disability loss ratio for the quarter deteriorated by 1.1 points compared to prior year due to higher severity, partially offset by pricing, as well as favorable incidence and recovery trends. The volatility we experienced in prior quarters in group life abated this quarter. The group life loss ratio improved 5.4 points versus 2015, largely due to favorable changes in reserve estimates. ","Looking at the top-line fourth quarter fully insured ongoing premium increased 2%, overall book persistency on our employer group block of business held in the high 80s for the year and fully insured ongoing sales were $43 million. Looking back on \u201816 we\u2019re pleased with the performance of our Commercial Lines and group benefit businesses. Particularly as we navigate these competitive markets. In personalized we\u2019re addressing our challenges with clear actions and our commitment to sustainable financial progress in 2017.","Before I turn over to Beth let me offer a few comments on 2017. We expect that the market will be as competitive or more than the market we say in 2017. We remain committed to underwriting discipline and delivering strong margins only seeking growth when it meets our profit targets. ","In Commercial Lines we\u2019re focused on leveraging our expertise and tools to aggressively compete at the front line. We\u2019ll continue to improve our capabilities to better meet the changing demands of both customers and distributors who are seeking new product capabilities, increased access to our expertise and greater convenience in their service transactions.","Due to the competitive markets in the marketplace, we expect that for lines of business with strong returns long-term loss cost trends will continue to outpace written pricing increases. As a result we expect an overall 2017 Commercial Lines combined ratio between 92.5 and 94.5 including 2.3 points of catastrophes. ","At the midpoint this is slightly higher than our results in 2016 yet still performing at attractive return levels. We will remain vigilant in addressing long-term loss cost trends, as well as taking immediate actions in areas that are under pressure.","In first lines we will continue our disciplined actions to restore profitability in auto by continuing to execute on our pricing, underwriting and agency management actions. We\u2019re investing in capabilities to better harness data and thereby refine our underwriting and pricing analytics. We remain deeply committed to our long-term partnership with ARP with initiatives to deliver greater customer value and achieve higher levels of customer satisfaction.","We expect to achieve a Personal Lines combined ratio of 99 to 101 including 5.8 points of catastrophes. This implies in the auto combined ratio of 101 to 103 with approximately 1 point of catastrophes. Although clearly not a very target performance levels, this presents substantial progress towards that goal.","In group benefits we're looking to drive growth in our core employer group offerings, as well as our voluntary product suite. January 2017 renewal retention is tracking consistent with prior year and January sales include a number of solid wins, but will be down from a year ago. We will add hospital indemnity in April of this year to our current voluntary lineup of disability flex, critical illness and accident. ","We expect group benefits performance to be relatively consistent with 2016, excluding a guarantee fund assessment for Penn Treaty. Our current estimate of this assessment is approximately $13 million after tax.","For property and casualty and group benefits overall, we will continue to compete in an aggressive and disciplined manner in 2017. Competition from not only traditional names, but newer entrance as well continues to intensify versus a year ago. Our core priorities remain unchanged, profitable product and underwriting expansion, deep partnerships with our distributors and outstanding value to our customers.","In summary, 2016 was a very strong year in so many respects yet very challenging in others. As always there is work in front of us for 2017 and we're fully committed to the journey ahead.","Let me now turn the call over to Beth. ","Beth Bombara","Thank you, Doug. I'm going to cover the other segments our investment performance and update you on our capital management plans. Mutual Funds core earnings totaled $17 million this year down from $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, principally due to transaction expenses for the acquisition of Lattice and the adoption of Schroders U.S. mutual funds. ","Asset management fees rose about 3% from the prior year due to higher average daily AUM. Although the growth in fees continues to be impacted in part by the shift to lower fee mutual funds. ","Total AUM increased 6% including the impact of both market appreciation and almost $3 billion from the Schroders funds. Talcott continues to perform well, core earnings were $111 million, up strongly from $83 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 due to higher returns on limited partnerships and a $14 million tax benefit from a prior year federal tax audit. ","Aside from these items Talcott\u2019s core earnings declined due to lower variable annuity fee income driven by the run-off of the book. During 2016 VA contract count decreased by 10%, which we expect will drive a similar rate of increase in Talcott\u2019s 2017 core earnings excluding the favorable items in 2016.","In the slides posted to our website last night we also provided our annual update of Talcott statutory capital allocation by product. The capital allocation has not changed materially since last year, consistent with prior year's significant portion of Talcott capital supports our institutional and individual fixed annuity blocks. At year-end statutory surplus totaled $4.4 billion and the capital allocation shows expected 2017 dividends of $600 million, $300 million of which we received in January. ","We also provided an update on capital margins in base stress and favorable scenarios. Our analysis of Talcott\u2019s capital adequacy remains focused on the stress scenario not based on current capital or market conditions. ","Our goal is to maintain at least 200% company action level risk based capital in the stress scenario and also considers liquidity, intangible assets and other factors. The assumptions used for these scenarios, which we also provided are generally consisted with prior years. The stress scenario has a 40% drop in equity markets from current levels are roughly 1350 on the S&P 500, lower interest rates and significant credit losses.","As summarized in the slide, in the stress scenario we estimate the capital margin to be about $1.4 billion at year-end 2018, compared with $2.9 billion in the base case. Both scenarios include $600 million of dividends in 2017. Consistent with prior year, the primary impacts in the stress scenario come from interest rates and credit losses, primarily in the individual fixed and institutional annuity blocks and decreased fee income on the VA block. This amount of capital margin demonstrates that Talcott is adequately capitalized for adverse capital market environments. ","Turning to investments, all-in results were strong this quarter and included high returns on real-estate and private equity LPs. Total LP investment income was $73 million before tax compare to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 for an annualized return of 12% this quarter and 8.5% for full year 2016.","Excluding LPs the total before tax annualized portfolio yield was 4.2% this quarter, slightly better than 4.1% last year largely due to non-routine investment income such as prepayment penalties on mortgage loans and make whole payments on fixed maturities. These items are episodic and were especially high this quarter totaling $32 million before tax, about 2.5 times higher than the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding LPs and non-routines the annualized portfolio yield was essentially flat.","For the P&C portfolio the annualized yield excluding LPs was 3.9% up from 3.7% in fourth quarter of 2015, but relatively flat adjusted for the non-routine items. Full year P&C net investment income was about $1.2 billion including $101 million for LPs. Looking at 2017, based on current interest rates we expect the P&C net investment income excluding limited partnership to decline about 7% to $1 billion before tax for two principle reasons. The first driver of lower P&C investment income is that we expect a slightly lower P&C portfolio yield excluding LPs.","The full year portfolio yield was 3.8%, the 2016 reinvestment yield were about 60 basis points lower than sales and maturities, resulting in a sequential decline in the portfolio yield during 2016. Although higher reinvestment rates could offset some of this pressure credit spreads have also tightened and we would expect a lower level of non-routine items in a higher rate environment.","To give you an idea of sensitivity to higher interest rate, we estimate that if 2017 reinvestment rates were 50 basis points higher across the curve, 2017 full year P&C net investment income would increase by about $20 million before tax. ","The second factor driving P&C net investment income lower in 2017 is that P&C investment portfolio will decreased by about $1 billion or 3% early in the year due to the net impact of the $650 million we paid in January for the National Indemnity Cover and the pending sale of the UK P&C runoff subsidiaries.","Turning to credit performance, our experience remains very good with total impairments in mortgage loan valuation reserve charges of $12 million before tax down from $42 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, which included losses on some energy, mineral and mining related exposures.","To conclude on earnings, fourth quarter core earnings per diluted share were $1.08 essentially flat with $1.07 in fourth quarter 2015 as the impact of our share repurchase program offset the 7% decrease in core earnings. For the full year core earnings ROE was down due to Personal Lines results and the second quarter charge for adverse development for A&E.","2016 core earnings ROE excluding Talcott was 8.9% and the P&C core earnings ROE was 9.9%. Excluding the A&E charge the 12 month core earnings ROE excluding Talcott was 10.3% and P&C was 12%.","Turning to shareholders equity, book value per diluted share excluding AOCI at December 31, 2016 was up 3% compared to a year ago. Before turning to your questions, I wanted to provide an update on our capital management plans. During the quarter, we\u2019ve repurchased $280 million of stock, which completed the $4.375 billion equity repurchase plan that expired on December 31st.","In January of this year, we repurchased about 2.3 million of shares for $110 million, which leaves approximately $1.2 billion available under the 2017 equity repurchase authorization. With respect to debt management plans, in October we repaid $275 million of maturing debt. As we previously announced, we will repay $416 million of senior notes at maturity in March, which is our only debt maturity in 2017. In addition to these two actions, we also intend to call our 8.125, 500 million of junior subordinated bond, when it becomes redeemable at par in June of 2018. ","To fund this call this month we will exercise our put option on the Glen Meadow contingent capital facility, which will result in the issuance of $500 million of junior subordinated debt. This debt will have a floating rate coupon of three months LIBOR, plus 212.5 basis points or about 3 and 1.8% at current rates. ","The impact of these actions are debt-to-total capital ratios will be modest as the Glen Meadow issuance will be largely offset by the senior note maturity in the first quarter and our 2018 ratio will decrease from the repayment of the junior subordinated bonds. In addition the coverage ratios will improve in \u201817 and \u201818 due to lower interest expense resulting from debt repayment.","To conclude, fourth quarter results were very strong for Commercial Lines and group benefits and the performance of our investment portfolio and other businesses was very good. In 2017 we are focused on achieving core earnings per share growth, driven by better Personal Lines results, continued strong margins and investment performance in our other businesses and the impact of our capital management plans. In addition, the new reinsurance agreement covering U.S. A&E exposures should eliminate the economic impact of any adverse development. ","I will now turn the call to Sabra, so we can begin the Q&A session. ","Sabra Purtill","Thank you, Beth. Elisa, I\u2019ll ask you to give the instructions for Q&A in just a second, but for in the meantime I just wanted to note that for those of you who are interested in catching up with us in person, Beth will be attending the Credit Suisse Conference in Miami on Tuesday next week and Chris will be in Boston at a lunch hosted by Deutsche Bank on Wednesday February 8th. ","In addition Chris, Doug and Beth will be at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch conference in New York on February 15th, holding a fireside chat as well as some small group meetings. And then finally, I would note that Doug will be on the Commercial Lines panel at [indiscernible] in early March this year. We hope to see all of you, at one or more of those events.","Elisa, could you give the directions again. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Ryan Tunis","Hey thanks, good morning. I had one question and then John Nadel had a follow-up. But I guess just looking at the guidance in P&C commercial, I guess this year on an underlying basis, combined ratio is 89 for -- and the midpoint of the guide you are giving implies a decent amount of deterioration after that and I realize that this year you had some favorable items with property, workers comp, but it also seems like rate worked against you, you\u2019ve also talked about commercial auto. So it seems like there is some headwinds as well.","So just trying to square, the type of scenarios that will potentially get you up towards that midpoint or above that, because I guess that just seems like a decent amount of volatility off of this year\u2019s results? Thanks.","Chris Swift","Ryan it\u2019s Chris. Thanks. I\u2019ll ask Doug to add his color too, but I would just ask you to consider just macro trends in general. The pricing environment has been soft and our views are its going to continue to soften into \u201817. So rates are coming down, pricing is not you know keeping up in aggregate what we believe are long-term loss cost trends. Capital is abundant in the industry and there is many competitors both in the traditional markets and those that are coming from offshore to compete in our market. So you put it all together and that\u2019s our view of the environment.","We\u2019re going to work our tail off to maintain those margins, but at this point and knowing our customer embrace so well we want to retain as much as our business as we can and if there is some give that we need to give on price to retain that we\u2019ll consider that. So we want to retain our best customers and we know that the price environment is very dynamic. So Doug what would you add from a color perspective?","Doug Elliot","Sure, Ryan the first thing I would say is that very pleased about 2016, pleased about the trends that we\u2019ve been to work on with our claim department and our pricing actions, very pleased about middle market as I lean into 2017 don\u2019t expect all those trends to continue. So as I think about what\u2019s in front of us with workers compensation we\u2019re still thinking that our medical trends long-term are in the 6% range and indemnity 3% to 4%. ","As I look at that line which matters a great deal for our company because we\u2019re slightly overweight in comp with our expertise, it\u2019s a line right now that is feeling some degree of pressure on the pricing side in the marketplace. So that is one of the things I think about, clearly we\u2019re at work on commercial auto and expect progress there and expect to improve results, but we\u2019re feeling a little bit of pressure on the general liability area across the book. And so as we planned into 2017 we try to be prudent with our loss assumptions, fair and thoughtful about what we\u2019re doing with the pricing.","I just feel a bit of pressure that yes we were able to withstand in 2016 and hope to do that again. We\u2019d love to repeat that performance in \u201817 I know that\u2019s our goal, but also want to be reasonable in our expectation.","John Nadel","So this is John, Chris there is increasing chatter about a potential sale of Talcott over the -- that chatter has been increasing over the past several months. I wouldn\u2019t ask you to comment on that, but I am interested in what your preference is for use of proceeds if you assume the transaction were to occur, should we expect you to focus on trying to replace those lost earnings contribution via acquisitions or should we expect that you\u2019ll continue to focus more on returning freed up capital to shareholders via incremental buybacks and debt management?","Chris Swift","Thanks for not asking about Talcott directly. I think the point in time where we\u2019re at right now John is we\u2019ve done a lot particularly you saw with the legacy P&C liabilities this year, so Talcott contributes as it does today. We talk about managing the risk effectively and returning capital and we\u2019re personally comfortable doing that, but hypothetically how we think about any capital that would be freed up. ","First we would focus on right sizing debt-to-equity ratios. And then we would think in terms of how do we replace those earnings via growth strategies both those that we can control from an organic side and then acquisition side, so that would be a high priority. I think we\u2019ve been talking about that for at least the last 9 to 12 months as far as the priority of our capital. So yes I would prioritize growth in earnings over just share buybacks at that point.","John Nadel","Appreciate that. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your line is open.","Jay Gelb","Thank you and good morning. I just wanted to level set for Talcott, I believe you said earnings will be down for Talcott 10% in 2017 adjusting for unusual items in 2016. So what\u2019s the baseline you\u2019re using for 2016?","Beth Bombara","Yes so if you look at our results over the last 12 months we have benefited from partnership return sort of an access of our plan and some of these one-time items. So if you adjust for that and take -- think about a 10% reduction in sort of run rate of Talcott. I think you\u2019ll see that you\u2019ll kind of get in that $300 million range for 2017.","Jay Gelb","That\u2019s helpful, thanks Beth. And basically in line with what we were expecting. The other question I had a little more broadly on the return on equity profile. Based on all the puts and takes you're expecting for 2017 and you've already known about the pace of share buybacks $1.3 billion. Where do you think that roughly puts you for return on equity in 2017?","Chris Swift","Jay it's Chris well I appreciate the call or the question on the call here. So if I look at and we've trying to talk to our key ROE metric is ex- Talcott, I think everyone knows there is a number of trap capital in Talcott. So if I look at where we ended \u201816 at 8.9 on a trailing 12 month basis. I think if we perform to the plan that we outlined and the metrics that we gave you that could be up 200 basis points especially without A&E charge in '17.","Jay Gelb","That's great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Gallagher for Evercore ISI. Your line is open. ","Thomas Gallagher","Good morning. Chris I will ask a direct question on Talcott, just from an M&A standpoint, can you comment on where you would see kind of bid-ask spreads right now. I think from I've heard from you guys before there were some challenges related to the VA part considering regulatory developments and some tax questions. But as you guys show majority of capital is not back into VA part it's backing to general account part. So I assume the environment has gotten a lot better from an M&A standpoint, but just curious what you\u2019re thinking there?","Chris Swift","Appreciate the direct question. And look we're not going to speculate on what we may or may not do. I think Beth and I've been consistent in talking in terms of risk is managed well. We have been taking excess capital out and plan to as you saw in '17. And if there are counter parties out there we'll continue to work hard to find parties that are interested in buying two legal entities that have both variable and fixed annuities both deferred and payout in them. ","And you can't just point to one block of business and exclude the other because just give the legal entity nature. And we're at the point in our cycle right now where simple reinsurance transactions really don't accomplish our mission Tom. So you put all that together and I\u2019ll let you conclude. Rising rates help, robust equity markets growth prospects for the future. So I'm actually bullish on our economic outlook in general which I think bodes well for these types of liability structures going forward.","Thomas Gallagher","Okay, appreciate that. And then just a question on the NICO deal, the $650 million of premium. I just want to understand would that -- did you transfer long-term bonds or was that cash. And can you comment roughly what the lost yield would have been for you on that transaction?","Beth Bombara","Yes so currently we transferred cash, but obviously when you think about taking $650 million of cash out of the system that comes with thinking about liquidating other assets. So we provided I believe in our press release when we announced the transaction that we'd expect some decrease in that investment income coming from there to be modest. And that's all contemplated in the guidance that we've given relative to P&C net investment income for next year. ","Thomas Gallagher","But Beth I guess my question was, I assume there was a long duration portfolio backing that line. And would those associated bonds the ones that were sold. So was there a disproportionate loss of yield or was it not that big of a yield?","Beth Bombara","Yes I wouldn't think about it at that way. Again to some extent yes there was -- there is assets backing that portfolio. But when we look to manage the portfolio on a P&C side it's a little bit probably more fungible than you probably think of on a life side. And so net-net we took all that into consideration and looking at what we're anticipating for the net investment income for P&C next year including some of the modest declines that we see in overall yield, but I wouldn\u2019t point to that as a significant driver of a decrease in P&C yield. ","Thomas Gallagher","Okay, thanks. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Your line is open.","Brian Meredith","Yes thanks a couple of questions here. First, Dough I just wanted to dive back into the Commercial Lines guidance a little bit here and the question I guess I have is how different is your kind of trend assumption that you\u2019re thinking about for \u201817 today versus when you were going into \u201816 and providing guidance. ","So are you still kind of thinking long-term trend or if things kind of deteriorated are you seeing that deterioration happening, which makes you more concerned about what\u2019s happening in \u201817 from a trend perspective?","Chris Swift","Fair question Brian, I would say in the comp area pretty consistent. Our view of go forward versus what we\u2019re experiencing very consistent. Auto, the severity in our commercial auto book we\u2019ve got higher expectations of lost trend in \u201817 than we did in \u201816, absolutely. And in GL, slightly higher as well. So nothing radically different, but we\u2019re feeling a little bit pressure across the liability book. We\u2019re on it, we\u2019re pricing for it, but we also see the market and the competitive dynamics around us. I think we just wanted to pick a prudent path.","Brian Meredith","Got you appreciate that. And then my second question is looking at the benefits business I know that you all had some initiatives to develop products and stuff basically to kind of cater to the ACA believe it was supplemental products. Has your thoughts on that changed now that there could potentially be repealed that or changes to that and kind of where you\u2019re thinking on that?","Chris Swift","Brian it\u2019s Chris. Generally no, I mean those supplemental products as you said had some strict definitions around of it given ACA. So if ACA gets repealed a little bit you have to watch to see the impact on the supplementary market, but we would not be interested in getting into any I\u2019ll call it mini medical plans or things along those lines. We think the nature of these products the more we market them, more we educate our customer base on them. We\u2019ll fit the needs with or without major ACA refinement.","Brian Meredith","Great. ","Doug Elliot","Brian the only thing I would add is that clearly last three years major focus on getting our voluntary suite up to par and where it needs to be. Secondly, and Chris I think has talked about this in the past we are leaning into A&H [ph] over the next year or so. We\u2019ve had an A&H product out there, we looked at it. We think it needs some retooling we\u2019re working on that now, and I think more to talk about as we move through 2017.","Brian Meredith","Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is open.","Meyer Shields ","Great thanks. If I can just jump up on Brian\u2019s question, do your 2017 auto spend expectations are those in line with what you saw in the fourth quarter of 2016?","Chris Swift","They are Meyer. ","Meyer Shields ","Okay. So that means you\u2019re not expecting further acceleration going forward?","Chris Swift","No but we are, similarly to first lines we do see this world in terms of the new norm. So we\u2019re expecting some of the pressure that we\u2019re feeling and have felt in 2016 to continue into \u201817 and we\u2019re making those types of choice in our trend assumptions both on personal lines and also on commercial. ","The difference in personal lines is that as you know we\u2019ve talked about a number of initiatives, we think we can bend the loss trend curve, based on the initiatives that we\u2019ve enumerated and we\u2019re working hard to do that, that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to make progress against that stated goal because we\u2019ve got some work to do to get our auto loss ratio, auto combined ratios into those 96, 96.5 category.","Meyer Shields ","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Two quick questions on the commercial side, one it looks like mall commercial pricing improved a little bit from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, I was hoping you could talk about that? And also maybe some more detail on the new entrance, I guess I'm a little more surprised that there are new entrance into the standard commercial lines rather than specialty.","Chris Swift","Yes we take them one-by-one. We\u2019re clearly leaning into auto and our package liability business and you\u2019re seeing that in the marketplace. So we are looking for more rate in Q4 and we\u2019re looking for little bit more rate in Q1 of 2017. So there\u2019s an escalation based on the pressures we\u2019re feeling with loss trend. That\u2019s driving what\u2019s happening in small commercial. And relative to new entrance, fourth quarter was pretty much a normal quarter for us.","So, yes there are new names they are coming at small from different directions. I don\u2019t think there is anything different in our results that was impacted by any of those names and we\u2019ll continue to respect and watch and think about our strategy going forward. But I feel very good about where our small commercial business is operating and pleased that we are leaning in relative to building new product and some of tools that we\u2019re rolling out for customers in the coming quarters.","Meyer Shields","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jay Cohen","Thanks. Just have couple of questions for Doug. First on the commercial side specifically in the small and mid-fourth quarter accident year loss ratio is going to the best you saw all year that was a very good trend as the year progressed, the fourth quarter being very good. Was there anything helping for that low level of non-cat whether or were you adjusting kind of the full year loss ratios in the fourth quarter?","Doug Elliot","There isn\u2019t anything that sticks out in my mind Jay, obviously when we get to year-end we want to make sure and do our best job in making sure the accident year full year is where it needs to be. In general fourth quarter weather is slightly better non-cat so there is a little bit of a positive bias on our property side both small and middle. And we experienced some of that in the fourth quarter, obviously December is the month that triggers where we have a good property quarter or not in fourth quarter. But there isn\u2019t anything to speak about that I think I would raise that level.","Jay Cohen","Okay, great. Second question, on the auto side, I guess it could be argue that size and scale are increasingly important in auto insurance and likely will be going forward you\u2019re shrinking this business obviously due to profitability issues, do you get concerned that by shrinking the business you\u2019re losing out on the scale that you might need in the future to keep very effectively?","Chris Swift","Jay, it\u2019s Chris, I would say we are taking the corrective actions necessary to improve our profitability and that will obviously require some top-line shrinkage. I think we focus primarily on the older age market, we think we have a niche that we\u2019ve understood for a number of years, our relationship with ARP is deep and very strategic for us and trusted.","So, I don\u2019t think scale in it by itself in that market is required if we were ever to think in terms of more of a mass market strategy then I would say scale and how we would think about it differently but we are not thinking about that. So, I think we have the appropriate underwriting skills the appropriate insights into that call a customer segment and I think we have the appropriate claim skills embedded in the organization across the country to effectively manage it. We\u2019re in a rough spot now no doubt, but we are not giving up and it continues to be a strategic niche for us going forward.","Jay Cohen","Great, that actually makes sense. Thanks Chris.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, good morning. Just a couple of questions on the personal auto side, we were putting together some of your comments it seems like when you came to your outlook you are assuming we are going to maintain the high BI [ph] severity trends so I\u2019m assuming kind of to start \u201817 is basically the trends that you ended \u201816 with. ","Just kind of confirming that. And then as you think about the components to get to your margin goal are you assuming that there is some improvements both from the loss as well as earnings through some of the expense initiatives, additional expense initiatives next year?","And then as we think a little bit further out you think is 2018 when you see obviously you pointed taking more rates that will return to profitably in the auto book as you think about going out a little bit further than \u201817?","Doug Elliot","Please let me try to tackle the pieces that all add up to obviously our overall performance. So on the pricing side we\u2019ve given you pretty clear inside into the progress we are making and just a few moments ago I also gave you a little bit lens into 2017 and the fact that our written pricing will go up over the next couple of quarter. ","So as that earns its way into the book we are getting a positive contributor to our progress against targets. At the core of your question relative to loss trends we are expecting from a gross perspective our loss trends in \u201817 to be about where they are in \u201816.","So as we think about our data our expectation for the accident year \u201816 is that our loss trend total frequency and severity put together is in that fixed range 5.5 to 6 and that's essentially where we are planning for our gross trend in \u201817. What\u2019s different about \u201817 is now the number of initiatives that we\u2019ve been working and putting into market over the past four to five quarters, we expect some traction and we\u2019re beginning to see that traction.","So, we\u2019re expecting several points of improvement against that loss trend and the combination of earned rate working through and a bending of the loss trend curve drives our expectation of improvement in performance both in \u201817 and candidly accelerating into \u201818 as well.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then there is -- when you think about that so do you think you also get some level of expense improvement in \u201817 when you come to your guidance or it\u2019s more driven off of improvement on the loss ratio side of the auto book?","Doug Elliot","The core of our changes in the loss arena, I think our expenses we\u2019ve manage our expenses according I don\u2019t see a lot there in fact two and three and four quarters and I expect to be in a very different rate adequacy spot and we\u2019ve got places around the country where we\u2019re feeling much better today that we are pricing for the norms of the exposures in loss trend and I think you\u2019ll see us begin to be more aggressive and thoughtful in our growth aspect.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Dwelle from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Mark Dwelle","Good morning. I wanted to ask a question related to the asbestos [ph] transaction. I mean is there anything left there at all or maybe sit differently when you do your A&E study next summer, is there anything that can produce the change to reserves that will impact result either positively or negatively?","Beth Bombara","So I\u2019ll take it, it\u2019s Beth. So couple of things one, just to be clear and this will be in our 10-K we intend to do our A&E studies in the fourth quarter going forward just given the transaction that we did. If we don\u2019t anticipate it to be on a significant obviously. As it relates to our exposure that's left as it relates to A&E again this Treaty covers substantially all of the A&E exposure that we have remained once we complete the sale of our UK subsidiary.","The one thing though that we did retain as part of the transaction is to the extent that there is any uncollectable reinsurance that comes from our A&E exposures we would still bear that risk. So, that has not been a significant driver of our A&E reserve increases over the last couple of years, but that is one aspect of it that we did retain.","Chris Swift","Mark, it\u2019s Chris, the only thing I would add is as you know asbestos language and policy forms changed in 85 for an absolute exclusion. There is some post 85 reserves that we had that we also seeded. So I think in terms of pre and post 85 A&E reserves are part of this cover.","Mark Dwelle","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then in your comments remain related to the group benefits you mentioned the $30 million charge related to Pen Treaty maybe I missed it in the early remarks did you specify when that would be taken or any timing on that?","Beth Bombara","So again that's going to be based on facts and circumstances, the charge we will incur once the assessment is made and liquidation again. We think that could be first quarter, but it\u2019s really outside of our control and we can\u2019t -- we won\u2019t book the amount until there has been a declaration.","Mark Dwelle","Got it, thank you. That's all my questions.","Operator","We have no further questions in queue. I turn the call back over to the presenters.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you, Lisa, and thank you all for joining us today and for your interest in the Hartford. If you have additional questions, please don't hesitate to follow-up with Investor Relations by email or phone and we\u2019ll get back to as quickly as possible.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Hartford\u2019s Third Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you.","Sabra Purtill, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Sabra R. Purtill","","Thank you, Tiffany. Good morning and welcome to the Hartford\u2019s third quarter financial results webcast. Our result, the Investor Financial Supplement, 10-Q and financial results presentation, which includes our fourth quarter 2014 outlook were all filed yesterday afternoon and are available on our website.","Our speakers today include Chris Swift, CEO of the Hartford; Doug Elliot, President; and Beth Bombara, CFO. Following our prepared remarks, we will have about 30 minutes for Q&A.","As described on Page 2 of the financial results presentation, today\u2019s call includes forward-looking statements as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results could be materially different. We do not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements and investors should consider the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from these statements. A detailed description of those risks and uncertainties can be found in our SEC filings, which are also available on our website.","Our presentation today also includes several non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations and reconciliations of these measures to the comparable GAAP measure are included in our SEC filings as well as in the earnings release.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher J. Swift","Thank you, Sabra. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. Yesterday afternoon The Hartford reported outstanding third quarter results. Core earnings were $477 million or $1.06 per diluted share, up 25% year-over-year on a per share basis. We delivered earnings growth in every business, and saw the benefits of the capital management program.","Catastrophe losses and limited partnership returns were both favorable in the quarter. The third quarter results reflect the progress we are making across the company. Profit margins expanded in every business. In total P&C, the combined ratio, excluding cats and prior-year development improved 2.6 points to 90.2 reflecting our sustained focus on pricing improvements.","We are also growing the top line in P&C. In small commercial written premiums were up 7%, fueled by positive pricing and new business premium growth. In both consumer markets and middle market the top line was up 3%, reflecting pricing and disciplined underwriting.","Doug and Beth will provide additional detail in insights about the quarter. When I reflect on the numbers, the most important takeaway for me is that the results demonstrate that the Hartford is on the right track. Investments we have made to drive profitable growth have taken hold and we are starting to see the positive results.","Looking ahead, our primary objectives are improving return on equity and growing book value per share to drive top-quartile shareholder returns. To do this, you can expect to see continued progress in four major areas. First, expanding product in underwriting capabilities; second, increasing distribution effectiveness; third, improving the customer experience in operating efficiency; and fourth, effective capital management including the ongoing runoff of Talcott.","Let me address each of these briefly. Since 2011, we have been expanding the P&C product suite and underwriting tools to diversify our business mix and meet changing customer needs. As you know, the initial focus in P&C Commercial was expanding our property and liability expertise to complement the existing workers compensation capabilities and we are pleased with the progress in these areas.","We continue to add new capabilities to allow us to meet more of the insurance needs for broader range of customers. Over the last year, we have updated our commercial auto underwriting tools, addressing changing trends in that market. We also recently signed a new property reinsurance program that enables us to underwrite accounts with up to $500 million of covered property per location.","Finally, we remain focused on expanding the voluntary product suite and group benefits, preparing for a more employee centric model as the market adjusted to the new healthcare environment. Employee choice benefits is an expanded group benefits of voluntary offering, which is being rolled out with customized educational materials to help employees to make informed decisions about their benefits.","On the distribution side with the ongoing consolidation of the brokers and agent channel, it is more important than ever that we offer intermediaries, products and services that position us as a go-to provider for their customer needs. More than 11,000 agents and brokers are licensed to do business with The Hartford.","Our objective is to continue to effectively serve larger brokers and agents by anticipating and meeting the needs of their evolving business models, while also continuing to serve and support the thousands of agents who are the lifeboat of small commercial, and consumer markets businesses. For example, the market leading ICON platform in small commercial helps agents of all sizes to get customer quotes in a timely and efficient manner. In addition, our award winning operation centers effectively handle customer service for many distribution partners, bringing them to spend more of their time on business generation.","Our third area of focus is improving the customer experience and increasing operating efficiency. Well, The Hartford has strong capabilities in claims and policyholder servicing. We have the opportunity to significantly improve the back office\u2019s efficiency and the customer experience with the previously announced investment commitment to improve our technology infrastructure. The objective is to increase The Hartford\u2019s ease of doing business and put the ultimate customer at the center of our activities.","One example is the ongoing rollout of a new P&C claim system, which will improve claims efficiency, enhanced by new data and predictive analytic capabilities. We are also working to upgrade digital and customer self service functionality across the P&C operations. These enhanced capabilities will help continue to differentiate The Hartford. Finally, capital management will be a critical element as we redeploy excess capital from two sources, the go forward businesses and Talcott Resolution.","With improving fundamentals, the P&C companies are positioned to continue to generate significant amounts of excess capital. In addition with the recent corporate reorganization both the group benefits and the mutual fund companies now represent independent sources of dividends to the holding company.","As we have discussed previously, we also intend to return capital to the holding company from Talcott over time both through the generation of statutory earnings and the runoff of the legacy annuity liabilities. In combination, capital generation from the businesses and from Talcott will continue to provide The Hartford\u2019s flexibility to pursue a broad range of capital management actions while we invest in new capabilities to drive future profitable growth.","In closing, I\u2019m confident that The Hartford is on the right track to achieve our goals of the higher ROE and growing book value per share. During the third quarter, we made progress in each of the four areas that I discussed today and we are committed to continue their progress in the quarters and years ahead.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Doug.","Doug Elliot","Thank you, Chris, and good morning. We posted an outstanding quarter across our property, casualty, and group benefit businesses. We\u2019re very focused on execution in our frontline teams where we worked closely with our distribution partners and make critical risk selection decisions. We believe that our energy here is paying off as we optimize pricing and retention to drive franchise value over the long-term.","Let me share some highlights by business beginning with P&C commercial, consumer, and then group benefits. Our results in P&C Commercial remain very consistent with recent quarters. Strong underlying margins were driven by written pricing gains, sound underwriting management, and growth in our target business lines. We feel very good about our performance as the market shows signs of increased price competition. For the quarter, we delivered core earnings of $268 million, up $92 million versus prior year on an all in combined ratio of 90.4.","Very low current accident year catastrophe losses in the quarter contributed $26 million to the improvement. The balance of core earnings increased is largely due to improved margins and slightly favorable prior year development. The underlying combined ratio excluding CATs and prior year development was 90.2%, an improvement of 3.1 points versus prior year. These financial results reflect our operating focus and discipline and give us confidence that we\u2019re making sound strategic and tactical decisions.","On the top line total written premium was up 1%, excluding our programs business P&C Commercial grew 4% for the third quarter. We also achieved written pricing gains of 5% for standard commercial outpacing current loss cost trends. While the measurement of writing pricing and loss cost is essential to our business. Our management of profitability is far more sophisticated than these two overall metrics convey.","Detailed insights drive our risk decisions, especially as written pricing and loss cost trends are converging. In every book of business, there are cohorts that are performing below targets. These might be defined by geography, industry class or underwriting profile just to name a few. Calling this business and taking corrective action is central to achieving and maintaining target margins. That\u2019s why I always say there is more work to be done whether it is in certain lines of business or specific risk classes we need to remain keenly focused on our operating risk discussions on an account-by-account basis.","Let\u2019s now take a more in-depth look at the results of our P&C Commercial businesses. Our performance in small commercial demonstrates the ongoing strength and momentum we\u2019ve developed in this business. The third quarter underlying combined ratio was 85.6, 1.5 points better than 2013. The all-in combine ratio was 86.4. Written premium grew 7% driven by new business premium growth of 11% and policy retention at 84. Both the new business growth rate and the policy retention rate were consistent with trends in the second quarter of this year reinforcing our strong momentum as we had for year-end.","As Chris noted, we\u2019re very excited to see our investments in this business coming together to deliver exceptional financial performance. In addition to our excellent technology and customer service platforms, we have robust analytics running behind the scenes on every facet of this business. We are successfully balancing growth and profit because we know where the business opportunities exists, we understand loss trends at the most granular levels, and we\u2019re partnering with our agents to manage pricing, appetite and growth.","Moving to Middle Market, we continue to make steady progress with an underlying combine ratio of 92 down 3.9 points versus prior year. Renewal written pricing remained ahead of loss cost trends building on our margin improvement from recent years. I\u2019m especially pleased to note that our underlying combined ratio in Middle Market workers compensation is down over 8 points for the quarter versus last year. After several years of disciplined pricing and underwriting actions on this book of business, it\u2019s gratifying to see the combined ratio within our target range. Written premium growth in Middle Market was 3% driven in part by solid results in property and general liability as we continue to have success in building our new business mix.","Over the last 12 months, we\u2019ve made several important changes to strengthen leadership in a number of geographies and to better align our field organization with key distribution partners. These actions help to deliver new business of $112 million, up $5 million from a year ago and consistent with second quarter 2014.","We view our Middle Market written pricing trends averaging in the mid single-digit range this quarter as being quite strong given our improved overall profitably since 2012. Commercial auto continues to lead the way for written pricing increases. I expect just to continue as we suspect many others are not at our target combined ratios for this line. Increased bodily injury severity is the primary driver, which we will continue to address through rate increases and underwriting actions.","In National Accounts, written premium was down 9% for the quarter, a sizable strength in the growth we posted in recent quarters. The decline is largely attributable to uneven timing of premium flows. When we peel back our operating metrics, we continue to see positive performance indicators within our core earnings. our retention rates remain above 90%.","We\u2019re writing two new accounts for everyone lost slightly behind our 2013 page, but still very solid. We\u2019ve been successful in growing this book of business over the last several years. We like our competitive niche and we\u2019re confident in our plan for growth and profitability.","In Financial Products, we had a solid quarter with written premium up 7%. This growth is coming in our E&O business where we\u2019ve developed some very strong industry-based solutions. In the E&O, we\u2019re seeing greater competition in the largest segment and we\u2019re tightly managing to our pricing standards.","Shifting over to consumer, we posted an all-in combined ratio of 91.2. excluding capacities and prior year development, the underlying combined ratio was 89.4, improving 1.7 points from a year ago, largely driven by lower expenses. Cat loss is well below our expectations. We\u2019re above our experience in 2013. Last quarter, we shared that weather and fire losses adversely affected both auto and homeowner\u2019s results. We have not seen any unusual patterns emerge and the third quarter was back in line with our expectations.","On the top line, written premium was up 3%, driven by continued success with our AARP through agents offering, where new business was up 11%. Auto and home renewal written pricing increases were 5% and 7% respectively, and we remain focused on improving rate adequacy, particularly in the homeowners\u2019 line.","Our expense ratio decreased this quarter to 23.1, which is essentially flat with the second quarter. We are ramping up spending in the fourth quarter on several technology projects and new business marketing efforts and we anticipate our full-year expense ratio will be approximately 23.7.","And finally, let me shift the group benefits, we have core earnings of $38 million, were up 6% from last year. Recall that the third party marketing relationship in our association financial institutions block will be terminated as of year-end, but will still be included in our year-over-year comparisons are based my comments now on results excluding this business.","We continue to see profit improvements driven by favorable life and disability results. The life loss ratio was down 2.9 points, due to continued pricing discipline and favorable mortality. Disability trends also remained favorable for prior year with the loss ratio improving 2.2 points that we\u2019re beginning to see the rate of that improvement decelerate. Long-term disability incident trends continue to be favorable, while claim recoveries were lower than prior year, although still in line with historical norms.","Looking at the top line, fully insured ongoing premium declined 2%, compared to prior year. Overall, book persistency on our employer group block of business exceeded 90% year-to-date through September and we\u2019re very pleased with our renewal pricing adequacy. Fully insured ongoing sales of $57 million for the quarter, was essentially flat with last year.","Given the lead times on large account business, we can see that 2015 is shaping up positively. Sales activity has increased and we\u2019re encouraged that our recent investments, particularly those to enhance our product, service and claim capabilities are resonating with customers.","In fact, we will welcome back several large case customers in the first quarter. As Chris noted in his opening, our overall suite of capabilities is allowing us to compete more effectively to win cases and then achieve greater employee participation through effective marketing and enrollment tools. These are positive signs for us. We like everyone else are adapting to the changing benefit landscape and we\u2019re very pleased with our progress.","Let me now wrap up by noting again, this is a very strong quarter for us across P&C and Group Benefits. We remain disciplined, thoughtfully managing our renewals and finding spots to compete aggressively for new business. We have a franchise that is getting stronger every quarter and we\u2019re focused on bringing shareholder value over the long-term.","Now, let me turn the call over to Beth.","Beth Bombara","","Thank you, Doug. Last evening, we reported third quarter core earnings of $477 million, or $1.06 per diluted share. The results reflect improved profitability in our P&C group benefits and mutual funds businesses, as well as favorable catastrophes and prior-year development. The impact of better than budgeted catastrophe losses and favorable prior-year development totaled $68 million after tax or $0.15 per diluted share. In addition to these items, we also benefited from strong limited partnership returns of $100 million before tax for an annualized yield of 14%.","Net income for the quarter was $388 million or $0.86 per diluted share, compared with the net income of $293 million or $0.60 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2013. The largest non-core earnings items this quarter was DAC unlock charge of $102 million after tax about equal to last year. This year\u2019s DAC unlock included a charge of $84 million after tax for annual policy holder assumptions review, reflecting modest changes in last benefit utilization expense and rate assumptions.","This quarter do not have any impact from discontinued operations given the sale of our Japan business in the second quarter. However, third quarter 2013 included a loss and discontinued operations of $72 million from the Japan business. P&C Group Benefits and mutual funds generated core earnings of $413 million, up 30% compared with $317 million in the third quarter of 2013, due to improved underwriting margins and P&C including lower catastrophe losses, improved results from group benefits and mutual funds and higher limited partnership income.","That covers the results from P&C and Group Benefits, so I will briefly cover the other segments. Mutual funds core earnings rose 22% over the prior year, primarily due to an increase in average retail and return in mutual fund assets under management compared with the third quarter of 2013. Performance remains solid, with 76% of funds outperforming their peers over the last five years. Mutual funds sales remain strong at $3.8 billion and equity fund sales rose 11%. Redemptions continue to decline resulting in positive net close for the third quarter in a row, after adjusting for the liquidation of our target date funds at the second quarter.","Excluding that liquidation year-to-date, net close were positive by nearly $400 million. Note that in October, we moved the management of some VA in retirement funds from the mutual fund segment to our investment operations. For reporting purposes this internal move will result in an outflow of approximately $2 billion from annuity mutual funds and about $700 million from retirement mutual funds in the fourth quarter. There will be no significant impact on mutual funds earnings as a result of this move.","Talcott\u2019s core earnings for the quarter were $122 million, which was above our outlook for several reasons, including lower than expected ESV and ISV program cost and higher investment income including limited partnership income.","We continue to see a steady run-off of our U.S. VA business, where contracts have declined more than 13% since September 30, 2013. Fixed annuity contracts decreased by 5% during the quarter and are down 19% since a year ago.","Although expenses for the ISV and ESV annuity programs were lower than expected this quarter, the surrender activity for both of these programs was in line with our overall expectations.","In the Corporate segment, core losses totaled $58 million, up from $16 million in the third quarter of 2013. Both quarters had favorable items. The third quarter of 2013 include a total of $55 million of benefits related to recoveries for past legal expenses on closed litigation and a favorable settlement on liabilities at the company\u2019s former parent. The third quarter of this year included $7 million of legal expense recoveries.","Keep in mind that the principal driver of the losses in the corporate segment is interest expense, which we expect to decline in the future because of our debt capital management plan. We intend to repay two 2015 maturities that totaled $456 million and also to spend up to $500 million to call or tender for debt under the current capital management plan.","However, with the recent change in market conditions we expect to execute the $500 million call or tender in 2015 rather than by year-end 2014. Our investment portfolio continues to generate solid investment returns with modest impairments. Portfolio yields have held up well despite the low interest rate environment without any material change in our credit risk or portfolio duration.","Excluding limited partnerships, the average pre-tax portfolio yield was 4.1%, consistent with the second quarter and down slightly from 4.2% in third quarter 2013. Total investment income increased 3% from the prior year quarter, which is principally due to higher limited partnership income partially offset by the effect of lower asset.","The Hartford\u2019s book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI at September 30, 2014 was $39.82, up 1% from year-end and 2% from September 30, 2013. The growth in book value per share over the last year was due to the positive impact of net income and share repurchases, partially offset by shareholder dividends.","During the third quarter, we used $845 million to repurchase common shares. We repurchased $320 million or 8.9 million shares through open market purchases at an average price of $35.78 per share. Under the accelerated share repurchase program, we began in July we paid $525 million and took delivery of 11.2 million shares during the quarter. This program has not yet been completed. Based on the volume weighted average stock price through September 30, 2014 there were approximately 3.5 million shares yet to be delivered under the ASR.","In total, through September 30, we have used about $1.5 million to repurchase common shares under our 2014, 2015 program, which will be little less than $1.3 billion to be repurchased through 2015.","As you know, one of our key goal is to drive our core ROE to a level that exceeds our cost of equity capital. For the 12 months ended September 30, 2014, our core earnings ROE rose 8.2%, compared to the 6.4% of September 30, 2013, reflecting the growth in core earnings, as well as the impact of our capital management program. Our cost of equity capital has come down, reflecting our restructuring action. We expected to continue to decline as Talcott runs off and the Company\u2019s earnings volatility and risk profile become more in line with our P&C peers.","Finally, before turning to your questions let me provide a brief summary of our fourth quarter outlook. Our core earnings outlook for the fourth quarter is in a range of $375 million to $400 million or $0.85 to $0.91 per diluted share assuming about 440 million shares outstanding. This outlook assumes catastrophe losses of about 2.5 points on the combined ratio or $42 million after tax and about $5 million after tax of prior year development for worker\u2019s compensation accretion.","Talcott core earnings are projected at $90 million to $95 million and Group benefits is expected to be in the low to mid 40s, down from $55 million last year, which had included some favorable items. In addition, keep in mind that limited partnership returns were strong in last year, averaging 11% annualized while our outlook for the fourth quarter assumes 6% annualized yield from limited partnership.","To wrap up, the third quarter was another quarter of significant progress. P&C and Group Benefits and Mutual Funds results were outstanding and we repurchased a substantial amount of equity under our capital management plan. We are pleased with our progress this year and remain optimistic about the future. We look forward to sharing our 2015 outlook with you in February, when we report fourth quarter financial results.","I will now turn the call over to Sabra to begin the Q&A session.","Sabra R. Purtill","Thank you, Beth. Before opening up the call for the Q&A period, I wanted to note upcoming dates for The Hartford. First please note that Chris, Doug, and Beth will be at the Goldman Sachs Insurance Conference in New York City on December 9th and we hope to see many of you there. In addition, as Beth mentioned, we expect to announce our fourth quarter results and our 2015 outlook on February 2nd with a call on the morning of February 3rd. Please note that consistent with the prior years on call on the morning of February 3rd will be a little bit longer than our normal quarterly call and we will note that and hopefully you can plan accordingly.","Tiffany, could you please repeat the Q&A instructions at this time?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Your line is open.","Jay H. Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Two things, first the small commercial property and casualty insurance earned premium growth of 7%. It looks like that\u2019s the fastest versus second quarter of 2012. Policy-in-force growth was modestly positive. So I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of what contributions were delivering that strong growth, is it more new business or pricing?","Doug Elliot","Jay, good morning, this is Doug. I think it\u2019s a combination of all, right. So we had steady progress across the pricing front. Our new business numbers that we layout in the sub but were also very strong in the quarter. And the combination that now we have in the entire platform are our ICON platform with all the products in it is being very well received by the marketplace. So we\u2019re hitting nicely across the board and I expect that moment to continue.","Jay H. Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then on a separate issue, I believe for Beth. For the Talcott earnings, we understand the guidance for 4Q, I believe previously it might have been either you or Chris did give the expectation for Talcott earnings growth for 2015 in terms of how \u2013 what order of magnitude that would decline? And if you could update us there that would be helpful, just so we can square our models.","Beth Bombara","So we I don\u2019t believe have given an outlook for 2015 as it relates to GAAP earnings for Talcott. I believe we\u2019ve talked about in the past is cash free earnings generation in and around that $250 million to $300 million range. As far as the runoff of the block for your models, it suggest that as you look at our surrender rate and you can view that as a proxy as you think about the earnings in that book declining offset by the fact that we have seen market improvement for that has the counter effect of improving the fees that we get on the accepting block.","Jay H. Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Okay. Any other insight you can provide there or it\u2019s a bit of a moving target?","Beth Bombara","","Then I think we\u2019ll provide more insight when we get \u2013 in February when we talk about our outlook for 2015.","Jay H. Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent DeAugustino with KBW. Your line is open.","Vincent M. DeAugustino \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi, good morning, everyone. Just to start with two comp questions. So one of the things that we\u2019ve, I guess, heard more often in the industry is, some of your peers trying to put on as much profitable business right now, particularly in small commercial workers comp. And so, the thought process here that we\u2019re hearing is that your peers want to put on as much profitable business on the small commercial side since it\u2019s sticky and then from that essentially have a profitable base to work through the next cycle.","And so, as we kind of look at your results and see the strong and consistent small commercial underwriting result and profitability and then also seeing your retention coming up, I\u2019m curious if you guys are taking a similar approach? And then secondly, we\u2019re hearing a lot of chatter around the strategy. Does that imply that we really are within workers comp starting to see that markets often?","Doug Elliot","Vince, good morning, this is Doug. A few thoughts for you. One is that we\u2019re very bullish about what we\u2019re doing in the marketplace in small commercial in both platforms. And more importantly, results-wise and we share those results with you. So as we think about areas we want to grow this franchise, clearly small commercial is right in the top row of that discussion.","Secondly, workers comp is a big product relative to our small commercial offering. It\u2019s been a profitable product work for us. It continues to be profitable and I expect that history to move forward in a very good trajectory. So we\u2019ve got aggressive plan moving forward. I\u2019m pleased with the progress in the third quarter, expect that to continue and I think we\u2019re seen as a market leader in this space.","Vincent M. DeAugustino \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Good call there and just a little bit more granular. So we\u2019ve also heard that New York and California from the comp side has been particularly challenging. I just wanted to see how the states are performing for you guys since I think they are two of your largest, and then more broadly, how loss trends maybe playing out between mid-market and small commercial within workers comp?","Doug Elliot","Good. So few questions inside your second piece. First, there are some headwinds in a few of the states relative to filings. I would say that those headwinds really are correlated to loss experience that has been improving across the books of business. So, not total surprised. As we look at the performance and the adequacy of our book still feel very, very good about that and we\u2019ll continue and monitor closely and obviously with the workers compensation line, as you suggest, it is a state-by-state march, very geographic centric.","Second part of your question, middle versus small. As I commented in my earlier remarks, we are very pleased of our progress on our workers\u2019 compensation book in the middle, slightly different tenancies, in our small book we tend to be on the micro end of small, but again, we see good signs on the frequency end; very-very low to minus frequency across both our books of business and the severity dynamics both wage and other have been very moderate over these past couple of years, so, to us the all-in loss trends are very much in check.","Vincent M. DeAugustino \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","All right. Good deal. Nice quarter.","Christopher J. Swift","Thanks. Take care.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open.","Brian R. Meredith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Yes, thanks. Good morning, couple of questions here. First, just on the reinsurance program you talked about the new property reinsurance, which related to $500 million per risk. Number one, was that alternative capacity, traditional capacity and then on the top of the reinsurance any other initiatives that you are looking at right now, i.e. internal reinsurance type programs to take advantage of the more competitive reinsurance market? And I have a follow-up.","Christopher J. Swift","Brian, it\u2019s Chris. Thank you for your question and joining us today. The $500 million per location policy was traditional. Reinsurance they are working with our long time partners. So, we feel good about it, gives us the opportunity to expand our property appetite in an appropriate fashion. I think, as it relates to \u2013 across the alternative capital in general, I know there has been a lot of discussions in \u2013 I think fundamental review is that \u2013 the market in general is just re-thinking how to support, risk taking in general and \u2013 but as it relates specifically to our books of business, I think we\u2019ve talked about it in the past.","I mean we feel good about our reinsurance programs, the cost of it and I will call it the more permanent nature of it over longer period, over different cycles. So, we are aware and participate in a lot of discussions and explorations of what\u2019s feasible from an alternative capital. But we are not heavy users of reinsurance right now. But we will continue to push ourselves to see if there is something creative \u2013 that can help benefit our shareholders.","Brian R. Meredith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Great and then second question, Doug. Curious, we\u2019ve seen a drop in gasoline prices, obviously with the big drop in oil prices. Have you guys seen any increase in frequency in the auto line or should we expect maybe that will start to pick-up here as we head into the holiday seasons?","Doug Elliot","Our trends really have not changed much in the last quarter or so. We will certainly watch carefully and that may indeed happen with the holidays upon us, but at the moment I would say pretty much as they\u2019ve been.","Brian R. Meredith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Great, thank you.","Doug Elliot","Thank you","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR Capital Market, your line is open.","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Yes, great. Good morning. Thank you. I\u2019d like to follow-up on what Jay Gelb was asking a little bit on Talcott. And so, I think what we\u2019re hearing is that when we think about capital that can come out or they\u2019re going forward as kind of the corollary to estimating earnings. Is it true that we can take contract count decline and thus AUM decline as a good proxy for the decline in required capital at Talcott? Is that going to be a pretty linear read for us going forward?","Beth Bombara","Randy, it\u2019s Beth. So, no, I was talking about earnings. When it relates to required capital, as we talked about in the past, a reduction is required. So that capital is not going to be on linear path on as the book runs off. It obviously will decline over time and obviously impacts our views as to excess capital within Talcott, but it\u2019s not a linear calculation.","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. Well, if it\u2019s not that, what would be our best kind of tool for estimating the draft and required capital? And while I\u2019m calling with this, the follow-up would be, I think, the RBC last was 500% there. So if required capital declines, it seems like RBC can be allowed to decline as well. So just trying to get a feel for how you can think about how capital could be freed up there as a result of these good surrender activities you\u2019re getting in Talcott?","Beth Bombara","Okay, so a couple of things. First, as it relates to our views around required capital in the Talcott entities and what their needs are, as you know, that\u2019s something that we continue to evaluate. RBC is one thing that we do look at as it relates to that. I\u2019ll remind you that we focus on RBC requirements in a stress scenario, not just the printed RBC in this environment. But as we talked in the past, we have been working to evaluate what should be their appropriate target going forward, taking into consideration RBC target as well as other things like absolute levels of surplus and liquidity.","And our expectation is that we will be sharing with you in February our views around the excess capital that we see in Talcott, as well as what we could see as a reasonable expectation and timetable for extracting that capital over time as the book continues to runoff. So I\u2019d ask you to wait until February, because I think we\u2019ll be able to provide you better information then that will help you see how we\u2019re thinking about the capital generation coming from the Talcott entities.","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. Then just one more if I could. I mean, what is the printed RBC? If we\u2019re not going to change the stress case conversation right now, what is the printed RBCs as off right now in Talcott, as of the third quarter?","Beth Bombara","So as of the third quarter, we\u2019re at about 500%.","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay, so 500%. Okay. Thank you","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Erik J. Bass \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker)","Hi, thank you. If Doug, can you talk a little bit more about the growth outlook for group benefits, which it sounds like you\u2019re pretty positive in your prepared remarks, but how much activity are you seeing in the market and how our pricing trends and then maybe also are you starting to see any benefit to premiums from employment growth or higher wages?","Liam E. McGee","Good morning, Erik. Maybe just a few comments and we\u2019ll be back in 90 days to give you the full 2015 layout. We are encouraged by the early look at some of our January 1 activity, which is why I shared the comments that I did. January just the beginning of the first quarter, but we\u2019ve had some nice success on both the new business front and feel good about our retention of key existing accounts. So let\u2019s leave it at that and we\u2019ll be back with a broader look in 2015 in a few months.","Erik J. Bass \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker)","Got it. I guess are you seeing any benefit though from just on existing business from either higher enrollments or employment growth?","Liam E. McGee","We are working hard on our penetration inside existing accounts for sure. I would say that that work is ongoing. As you know we\u2019re really right in the throes of enrollment season, so I would had a better sense probably out 45 days and we can share maybe some of that at Goldman Sachs. We are seeing relatively small growth in the employment area, so don\u2019t think the numbers of workers in our major cases, it is driving significantly upwards, in general small positive growth.","Erik J. Bass \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Thank you and just one more follow-up on Talcott. I guess your fourth quarter guidance is higher than what you had been guiding for the third quarter initially. Is that\u2019s just because of lower expenses related to the ESV program or is there anything else driving that?","Beth Bombara","Yes, so it\u2019s lower expenses for both ESV and ISV. There were two programs and then also as we\u2019ve seen markets improved a little bit of an uptake because of that as well.","Erik J. Bass \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Thank you.","Christopher J. Swift","Erik, it\u2019s Chris. In addition to what Doug said, I guess what I\u2019m particularly pleased with the teams performance there is \u2013 I\u2019ll share with you more in early 2015, but a number of clients, I would say large ones that we lost maybe three years ago between our replacing and some of our activities. I\u2019m going to come back to the form. And I think that\u2019s just speaks to one of our reputation, our claim handling capabilities, and just the power of the group benefits franchise, so more to come as Doug said, but I\u2019m particularly pleased with our new sales activities and old clients returning back to us.","Erik J. Bass \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker)","Great, thank you for the additional color.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel with Sterne, Agee. Your line is open.","John M. Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Hi, good morning everybody and congrats on a very solid quarter. A question for Doug, on the P&C commercial side, so we\u2019re seeing pricing begin to decline a bit, but it\u2019s still above your estimated loss cost trends. I\u2019m just wondering if there is any change in your outlook. Yes, I know, it\u2019s maybe a little bit premature, you want to talk about 2015 in a few months, but are you still expecting that you can generate improvement in the accident, your combined ratio moving forward maybe recognizing that some of the non-cat impacts have been probably a little bit below, what you have been pricing for.","Doug Elliot","Yes, good question, tough question and a critical one. We have seen the market become increasingly competitive over the last several months and I comment on that in my script.","John M. Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Yes.","Doug Elliot","On one front, it\u2019s not surprising given the overall improvement and accident year results crossed both our book and also in the industry. However I suggest still more work to be done in pockets, returns in the aggregate or not, what I would consider the long \u2013 at long-term targets for all lines. Especially with kind of the NII yield curve where it is and also cat risk, I mean, it\u2019s generally been acquired couple of quarters on the cat side.","So, putting all this in one basket, I continue to describe the overall market place is generally rational. Especially in the sectors, we compete in, which largely or small commercial and middle. And that\u2019s important to us in our franchise and I share those results in terms of stability. It\u2019s hard for us to predict these competitive dynamics going out, what I can\u2019t tell you is that in the fourth quarter we intent to execute much in the way we had these last several quarters, which is we\u2019re working hard to renew our best performing accounts and driving pricing in terms of those accounts that need improvement.","And I think, you know, our history we\u2019re not afraid to walk away from accounts that we believe, we can\u2019t get to price adequacy. So, our price is going to be very consistent, going to watch the market place, we\u2019re still on top of last trend and I expect that to continue in the fourth quarter and then we\u2019ll talk more as we get out to January about 2015.","John M. Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Okay, really helpful. And then maybe a question for you to Chris or Beth. Just coming back to Talcott in sort of the historical look at a stress scenario in maintaining that 325% risk-based capital ratio, I know that\u2019s not the only metric, but it\u2019s one that we\u2019ve talked about pretty consistently now for a couple of years. Given so much change and so much reduction in risk in that segment and I noticed you also mentioned a very high proportion of the remaining variable annuity reserve outside of surrender charge at this point. So potentially, we could see that surrender rate continue to stay very elevated here. I\u2019m just wondering whether you have actually finalized yet of you on whether the $325 million stress target income down and if so by how much?","Christopher J. Swift","Hey, John, it\u2019s Chris.","John M. Nadel \u2013Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Hi, Chris.","Christopher J. Swift","Let me just \u2013 I\u2019ll remind the units \u2013 let me just philosophically rate, remind you. I know you know this and others but we really want to run Talcott to be capital self-sufficient particularly in a stress scenario, so that philosophy is unchanged.","John M. Nadel \u2013Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Yep.","Christopher J. Swift","You\u2019re referencing the $325 million and all I would tell you is again it\u2019s best that \u2013 we\u2019ll cover more in early 2015, but we know that could come down. So it is going to be different going forward, we\u2019re working our process with our various constituencies, but particularly our regulators. So I believe we\u2019ll have an acceptable outcome that will talk through in early 2015. Beth, I don\u2019t if you would add anything more?","Beth Bombara","","No, I think you said it very well.","John M. Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Yes, that\u2019s very helpful, thanks. Look forward to February.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jay A. Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Yes, thank you. I\u2019ve got two questions, the first is you admission that the underlying portfolio yield in your investment portfolio held up pretty well without taking much more risk and seems to defy gravity given we know about the interest rate environment. Can you just talk about how that occurred and why that occurred?","Christopher J. Swift","Jay, it\u2019s Chris. I think \u2013 if you really look at the numbers this quarter that I think Beth talked to is our reinvestment rate was about 3.6%, the maturity I\u2019ll call it securities rolling off this quarter were 3.7%. So I think again our HIMCO professionals continue to look for the right opportunities, I don\u2019t think we are stretchy from a risk side. But we do have also had some core capabilities and real estate, mortgage loans I\u2019ll call it private placement that offers the opportunity to be very selective and try to get the best yield for the risk of return trade off.","Jay A. Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it, thank you. Second question on the commercial business, the expense ratio is kind of last couple of quarters has really been at the higher end and where it has been for the past three years. I think you\u2019re making investments in that business. Do you think this is sort of a peak-ish number or could we see that never rise a bit further, as you continue to invest in the business?","Doug Elliot","Jay, good morning, this is Doug. When we think about the expense these were really are balancing two parts of equation, one part is that we\u2019re investing back inside these business particularly on the technology side, so obviously, that\u2019s working against this relative to absolutes here, but we have a number of initiatives inside our businesses where we\u2019re looking at expense opportunities in general, we\u2019re harvesting ideas that are going to make us some more efficient, productive, place over time where that is particularly relevant is clearly in the middle market, as you know in the last couple of years, our middle market top line has come down a little bit between 2011 and 2013.","And so we\u2019ve got some experienced pressures there that we are coming aggressive with making adjustments forward. But albeit looking out, I\u2019m pretty comfortable with where we are today and very pleased with the trade off we\u2019re making between invest and overall outcome relative to combined ratio and margins.","Jay A. Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So this is not \u2013 it is sort of a peak-ish number. we wouldn\u2019t expect that to rise further from here, unless obviously the top line changes noticeably?","Doug Elliot","Certainly, true. correct.","Jay A. Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Thomas Gallagher with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Tom G. Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Good morning. Just a quick one for Doug and then one for Chris or Beth. So Doug, just I guess given what you mentioned on workers\u2019 comp, now hitting return hurdles, I presume that\u2019s an overall comment and I guess Commercial Auto is the other business where you had beginning rate, any \u2013 fair to say the heavy lifting is behind you from a rate standpoint, or any other businesses where you expect to get significant rate?","Doug Elliot","Tom, good morning. I would say that our comp strategy now is fine tuning and working the edges both in middle market and also in small. I did comment that we are still re-underwriting and working aggressively on the pricing front with auto, and that\u2019s a comment again, both across middle and small commercial as well. The property, and liability, and our specialty books all have different strategies and I would suggest to you that our pricing mean is probably not as aggressive there as we are approaching the marketplace in auto. So somewhere in the mid single digits three to six range probably for the other lines.","Tom G. Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Okay, thanks. And just shifting gears to Beth or Chris. so if I look at the initial 2014 and 2015 capital plan was split 80% buybacks and 20% debt reduction. and then if I look at the Japan sale got a bit more conservatives, led 60% buybacks, 40% debt reduction. So my question is, as we think about how would Hartford capital go down in the future, how should we think about that split?","Beth Bombara","So Tom, it\u2019s Beth. I\u2019ll take that. So what we\u2019ve said in the past is that any capital management actions that we would take in the future will continue to be balanced. We\u2019re very mindful looking at what our leverage and coverage ratios are and as we\u2019ve said our goal is overtime to be in the low 20s and so any actions we take we\u2019ll continue to the balance that. So it\u2019s not as I can say it\u2019s an exact percentage. It\u2019ll really be based on the amount and looking at overall of those factors as we think about the balance sheet going forward.","Tom G. Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","So, Beth, as a follow-up then. Since you\u2019re still above low 20s right now, it\u2019s fair to say that if you had extraordinary capital return actions on Talcott you probably lean more towards the conservative end of it, until you hit the low 20s threshold?","Beth Bombara","","So the low 20s is a target, we haven\u2019t set necessary a time table for working to when we want to achieve that, we\u2019ll just continue to be balance. So what I would say to you is I\u2019d expect there to be a continuation of both, but not necessarily that we\u2019re trying to be overly conservative.","Tom G. Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","","And then, so just one last one if I could sneak it in from a tactical standpoint, why bother with tendering for debt? Why not just sit on the cash, earn some yield, and pay it off as you go? I guess you have some fairly big maturities in 2017. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s too long to wait or what the view of tendering versus sitting on the cash and waiting to pay maturities.","","Beth Bombara","So again, our view has been that we do want to reduce the leverage on the balance sheet. When we look at the cost of a tender or call, we obviously take that into consideration to some extent what you pay in the PB calculation on that kind of takes into consideration about that, you won\u2019t be paying that interest in the future. So for us it\u2019s really a way to get us to our targets. And we\u2019ll continue to look for the best way to execute that at the best price.","Tom G. Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel with Janney Capital. Your line is open.","Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Good morning, Hartford. A question on hedging costs, which I don\u2019t think you breakout anymore with Japan, outage come down and clearly your assets are coming down against the dollar is up and interest rates are down. Any guidance just sort of the rough run rate of hedging costs that are below the line?","","Beth Bombara","So, Bob this is Beth. So as it relates to our U.S. VA book in the way that we thought about the spend for both the WB program and the macro program we\u2019ve really haven\u2019t changed those targets. I would say the macro program has probably cost us a little bit less. We used to talk about it in $5 million range, a couple \u2013 spending a little less than that now, but we really haven\u2019t changed our views on hedging. But you can see in our results because we still do breakout the VA hedging results that they were very modest for the quarter, which is what we\u2019d expect going forward with Japan, no longer in our result.","Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","I\u2019m sorry. The $75 million refers to what?","Beth Bombara","","What we refer to is the macro hedge program.","Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Okay. That\u2019s continuing or that\u2019s not continuing?","Beth Bombara","So we are continuing the macro hedge program. It\u2019s just that the cost of that program has come down a bit given market conditions.","Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","And that\u2019s below the line or is that in core earnings?","Beth Bombara","All of the hedging costs are below the line.","Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Okay.

I'm pleased with our overall third-quarter results. In commercial lines and group benefits, performance was strong and demonstrates focus on maintaining margins albeit disciplined about growth in a sustained competitive environment. I'm also pleased with the actions we\u2019ve been taking to improve personal auto performance. In addition, the balance sheet and capital generation remains strong and last evening we announced the board authorized a new 1.3 billion equity repurchase plan as well as a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend. Starting with personal lines, we are intently focused on improving auto profitability. We\u2019re implementing a range of initiatives including aggressive rate actions that address sustained higher loss cost trends caused by a multitude of factors including increased miles driven, speed and distracted driving. We are also addressing profitability through adjustments to our new class plan, more focused marketing and determination of unprofitable agency relationships.","I have deep confidence in the personal lines\u2019 leadership team and in their strategy to improve performance. Though results remain challenged in the third quarter, we will steadily improve profitability in personal auto and expect to see better returns in 2017 as the actions we take work their way through the book. In commercial lines, the underlying combined ratio excludes catastrophes in prior development was very strong at 90.0. This would represent a full point improvement over the prior year. I\u2019m pleased with our competitive positioning across commercial lines and with our ability to defend the margins we worked so hard to achieve. The team is successfully balancing underwriting discipline with profitable growth in selected markets. In small commercial, we\u2019re generating new business growth at very attractive returns.","For the quarter, written premiums grew 5% and the underlying complaint ratio was 86.8. The small commercial market has garnered a lot of attention recently with peers and new entrants launching first time initiatives. The Hartford has been the leader in the space, we have been investing in small commercial for over three decades and our end-to-end capabilities are the industry's goal standard. We continue to enhance our innovative approaches through customer experience, digital and the use of data analytics all backed by our industry-leading customer service centers. We are committed to innovating to advance our market position. Consistent with last quarter, competitive conditions in the larger end of the market such as middle market and national accounts remain challenging. Our primary focus is to maintain margins with selective topline growth. This quarter, we had continued success in that goal with improved underlying combined ratio on a relatively flat premium base.","In middle market, retentions remained strong as we work to retain our best accounts in our 93.1 underlying combined ratio improved more than 0.5 over the prior year. New business however declined 15% reflecting pricing and underwriting disciplines. Outside of our P&C businesses group benefits generated strong profitability with a 5.6% core earnings margin and improved disability loss ratio and good sales in a competitive marketplace. At Talcott, the business continues to perform consistently and in line with our expectations while mutual funds posted another solid quarter. And third-quarter investment results benefited from stronger limited partnership income. Excluding partnership returns, the solid underlying performance of our investment portfolio reflects measured risk-taking and disciplined investment decisions. We continue to make progress in executing our strategy to invest capital in our businesses to expand capabilities. We closed the acquisition of Maxum in July and the team's expertise in the E&S market is already paying dividends in broadening our commercial lines and risk capabilities.","We also expanded the mutual funds platform. We entered into smart-beta ETF space through the acquisition of Lattice Strategies and further broadened our actively managed investment offerings through a relationship with Schroder. I spent a lot of time on the road this year meeting with and listening to our distribution partners. As I reflect on those conversations what really stands out is their support of our consistent approach to new and renewable business along with their trust and confidence. And they like the fact that we are becoming a broader and deeper risk player. This is encouraging thing back from our partners whom share my confidence in the Hartford's ability to execute given the fundamental strength of our platform and the improvements we've made to the organization. As we close out the year, we will remain focused on maintaining margins and commercial lines and group benefits and improving profitability in personal auto. Though we continue to face industry and market headwinds, we have the skills, experience and commitment to successfully carry out our strategy and to create shareholder value.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Doug.","Doug Elliot","Thank you Chris and good morning. Overall this was a solid quarter for our property and casualty and group benefits businesses. We posted strong results in both commercial lines and group benefits where we continue to effectively navigate very competitive market conditions. In personal lines there are positive signs that our pricing actions and underwriting initiatives are gaining traction even as frequency trends remain elevated. In the third quarter, personal lines posted core earnings of 25 million, up 8 million from third quarter last year. The underlying combined ratio which excludes catastrophes and prior period development was 96.1 increasing 0.5 point from last year. This is primarily the result of higher auto loss, liability loss costs partially offset by a decrease in expenses. Catastrophe losses in the quarter were 37 million, down 31 million from third quarter 2015. In homeowners, the underlying combined ratio of 79.6 improved 2.8 points versus last year, driven by favorable expenses. The underlying loss ratio was in line with prior year but running above our expectations for the quarter. Year-to-date performance in this line has been very solid as we continue to take rate increases and effectively manage our underwriting execution.","In auto, the underlying combined ratio of 103.1 was 1.5 points higher than we posted in third quarter last year. This reflects the 2016 emergence of increased loss cost trends partially offset by lower expenses. The underlying auto loss ratio for third quarter 2016 is slightly elevated when compared to 2015 after adjusting for the unfavorable 2016 accident year development which we recorded in the first half of this year. For the 2016 accident quarter frequency trend was approximately 3%. Our first and second quarter 2016 loss picks have continued to hold. Severity continued to increase slightly on the 2015 accident year but remain within our estimates and we had no prior year development for auto this quarter. We expect the substantial rate, underwriting, agency management and new business actions we have implemented to being earning their way into the book of business in the coming quarters. We are beginning to see early signs of expected improvement in our business metrics and given persistent trends are moving aggressively on multiple fronts.","For example, we continue to accelerate our rate filings. We now expect to achieve nearly 240 million of annualized rate increases on the auto line based on our current in-force business. This is 30 million higher than our projection as of second quarter 2016 and double what we achieved in 2015. We expect written pricing in the fourth quarter to approach 9%. The earned premium impact of this rate is ultimately based on the customer's we actually renew. We expect the combination of rate increases and mix change in the book of business to drive auto margin improvement in both 2017 and 2018. New business marketing has been reduced in many jurisdictions until the increased rates are in effect in the market. In AARP Direct auto, new business was down 36%. AARP Agency auto was down 29% and other agency auto was down 45%. We've also reduced our direct marketing spend, lowered operational cost and reduced commissions which contributed to a 3 point improvement in expense ratio. As a result of these profit improvement actions, written premium growth for both AARP Direct and AARP Agency was flat for the third quarter 2016. Other agency was down 20% consistent with our strategy to shift our business mix toward AARP members and our more highly partnered agents.","Retention in our AARP channels was relatively stable, a positive outcome as we increase rates. The revised 2016 full-year underlying auto combined ratio of 101 to 103 that we shared with you last quarter is under pressure from continuing frequency trends. We were expecting the rate of change in auto frequency to moderate in the second half of 2016 based on the elevated levels that emerged in the second half of 2015. Given higher-than-expected auto frequency trends this quarter, we now expect the full-year underlying auto combined ratio to be at the higher end of our range. Achieving the 2016 full-year underlying combined ratio of 93 to 94 for total personal lines will be dependent on auto frequency trends and homeowner losses in the fourth quarter. Although auto frequency has been elevated longer than we expected, my confidence grows every day that we are moving in the right direction to restore profitability in this business.","Shifting over to commercial lines, we had a strong quarter with core earnings of 247 million, up 31 million from third quarter 2015. The increase is largely attributable to higher net investment income and increased underwriting gain. The combined ratio of 93.9 improves 0.6 versus prior year, due primarily to less unfavorable prior year development and a lower expense ratio partially offset by higher catastrophe losses. Workers compensation continues to perform very well. This is our largest line of business, our strong margins improved slightly in the current accident year and we continue to manage this line very closely remaining vigilant on pricing and lost cost trends. Commercial auto on the other hand continues to be under pressure across the industry and we increased our 2016 accident year loss ratio estimates to reflect the ongoing lost cost increases. We also recorded 18 million pre-tax of prior year development to address severity trends, primarily in small commercial in accident year 2015. Auto was a relatively small line for us representing approximately 10% of commercial TNC premium. We are achieving our highest written price increases in this line and continuing to take aggressive underwriting actions.","The commercial lines expense ratio was favorable in the quarter improving by 1 point versus third quarter 2015. However, we expect our full year ratio to be in line with prior year. On the specialty, we are pleased with our renewal written pricing in standard commercial lines at 2% for the quarter essentially stable over the past five quarters. To achieve a few points of price in this competitive environment is a positive reflection of the solid discipline exhibited by our front-line teams. Our strong performance in small commercial continued this quarter. We had excellent result in both the top and bottom line. The underlying combined ratio of 86.8 was consistent with last year. Excluding the results of the Maxum acquisition which closed during the quarter, the underlying combined ratio actually improved by 0.2 point versus third quarter 2015. This reflects an improvement in workers compensation and a lower expense ratio offset by deterioration in auto and package results. Written premiums in small commercial was up 5% in the quarter versus prior year. Maxum represents approximately 1 point of this growth. Retentions continue to be strong and new business excluding Maxum was up 5% to 135 million as we continue to execute in a very competitive market.","Moving to middle market, we posted an underlying combined ratio of 93.1 improving 0.7 point from third quarter 2015. This was primarily due to favorable workers compensation margins and lower expenses partially offset by higher auto loss cost and unfavorable non-catastrophe property experience. Middle market written premium in the quarter was down 0.7 point compared to prior year. New business of 99 million was down 15% from last year as we continue to maintain our pricing discipline in the face of competitive market conditions. Specialty commercial had another very strong quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 93.7 improved 5.4 points versus prior year driven by strong margins across national accounts, bond and financial products. Specialty commercial written premium was down 4% compared to third quarter 2015. In both years the written premium is affected by audit premiums and several retro accounts. Normalizing for these items, written premium is up modestly and specialty commercial driven by solid new business in national accounts.","We continue to navigate these markets effectively and I'm pleased with our pricing discipline and overall results. In group benefits, we had a very solid quarter with core earnings of 51 million, up 4 million from prior year resulting in a core earnings margin of 5.6%. The increase in core earnings was driven primarily by higher premiums, lower disability losses and lower expenses partially offset by higher group life losses. The group life loss ratio of 80% for third quarter 2016 was driven by higher-than-expected mortality claims from larger policy values. We've experienced similar trends in the first half of 2016 and are evaluating underlying factors and appropriate actions going forward. Fully insured ongoing premium was up 5% for the quarter, overall book persistency on our employer group block of business continues to hold around 90%.","Fully insured ongoing sales were 61 million for the quarter, flat to third-quarter 2016. We continue to feel competitive pressures particularly in long-term disability. As with our property and casualty businesses, we remain disciplined on pricing and underwriting successfully differentiating our offering on superior service and claims capabilities. In summary, this is a solid quarter for our businesses. Commercial lines and group benefits delivered strong results demonstrating our commitment to disciplined pricing, strong retention and maintaining margins as we continue to experience competitive market conditions. In personal lines, we\u2019re pleased with the early traction our initiatives are gaining. Pricing, underwriting and agency management actions are working their way through the book of business to address elevated lost trends and restore underwriting profitability in personal auto. And finally, I'd like to welcome our new Maxum teammates to the Hartford. Maxum's capabilities are perfectly aligned with our strategy to become a broader and deeper risk player in the marketplace and I look forward to working very closely with this team on the journey ahead.","Let me now turn the call over to Beth.","Beth Bombara","Thank you, Doug. I'm going to cover the remaining segment, the investment portfolio and capital management before we turn the call over to questions. Mutual funds core earnings were down 1 million from third quarter of 2015 due to 3% reduction in investment management fees. Total AUM was up about 6% from a year ago due to a 9% increase in mutual fund AUM which was partially offset by a 6% decrease in Talcott AUM. The decrease in investment management fees reflects the continued shift to lower fee mutual funds consistent with industry trends. Our team has been proactively responding to the changing mutual fund market. As Chris mentioned, our acquisition of Lattice add smart data exchange traded funds to our portfolio line-up. This is a fast growing market with positive net flows and Lattice is an innovative platform that we can grow and also use to launch actively managed ETFs in the future.","In addition, last week we added a new sub advisor relationship with the adoption of ten mutual funds managed by Schroder Investment Management with about 3 billion in AUM. These funds which have been rebranded as the Hartford Schroder funds broaden our platform and expand our offerings particularly in international and emerging markets. Talcott continues to perform well focused on running of the annuity books efficiently and effectively while returning capital to the holding company. Core earnings decreased this quarter by 3 million compared with third quarter 2015 but were well ahead of our outlook due to very strong returns on limited partnerships both from improved hedge fund performance and higher private equity returns. Excluding the impact of limited partnerships, the decrease in Talcott\u2019s core earnings was due to the decline in fee income as the book continued to run off offset in large part by reduced expenses. This quarter, full surrender activity on an annualized basis was 7.4% for variable annuities and 5.4% for fixed annuities.","Talcott DAC unlock charge was modest this quarter as adjustments to variable annuity lapsed and market assumptions largely offset the impact of writing of the remaining DAC on our fixed annuity book. The fixed annuity DAC write-off was caused by the impact of the sustained low interest rate environment resulting in lower expected growth profits on the book. As we said in July, during the third quarter, Talcott paid a 250 million extraordinary dividend to a holding company completing our expected 750 million dividend plan for 2016. In 2017, we expect to request dividend in the range of 500 to 600 million. Investment results were strong this quarter with a sharp improvement in limited partnership returns. Limited partnerships investment income totaled 93 million before tax this quarter compared to 22 million before tax in the third quarter of 2015. This quarter's annualized investment returns for LPs was about 15% which is well above our 6% outlook and has pushed our year-to-date annualized limited partnership return back up to 7%.","Hedge fund performance was slightly positive compared to losses in third quarter 2015. And private equity income was exceptionally strong including a significant valuation write-up for one of the partnerships this quarter. Excluding limited partnerships, the before tax annualized portfolio yield was 4.1% this quarter slightly lower than 4.2% last year due to the combined impact of lower reinvestment rates and lower income from non-routine items. Given the low level of current interest rates we continue to expect portfolio yield compression in the fourth quarter and into 2017. Turning to credit performance, our investment portfolio remains highly rated and well diversified. Credit experience was good during the quarter with total impairments and mortgage loan valuation reserve charges of 14 million before tax, down from 39 million in third-quarter 2015. In 2015, we had a higher level of credit losses including intent to sell impairments on some floating rate and non-investment grade securities including some energy related exposures.","To conclude on earnings, third quarter core earnings per diluted share were $1.06, a 23% increase from third quarter 2015. Excluding prior developments and limited partnerships core earnings per diluted share rose by 7% over last year or $0.06 cents per share. Catastrophe results were largely consistent with third-quarter 2015 with no major hurricane losses in either period. For Hurricane Matthew which was a fourth quarter event we currently estimate losses of 40 to 60 million before tax which would consume a large portion if not all of our fourth quarter CAP budget of 60 million before tax. The 12-month core earnings ROE excluding Talcott was 9.1% and the P&C core earnings ROE was 11%. Both of these metrics include the unfavorable prior development on personal auto and A&E reported in the first six months of 2016.","Turning to shareholders equity, book value per diluted share excluding AOCI rose 6% from a year ago resulting in total shareholder value creation including dividend over the past 12 months of 8.4%. Finally, during the quarter we repurchased $350 million of stock. During October, we repurchased 2 million shares for $85 million leaving approximately 195 million remaining under the 2014 to 2016 equity plan of $4.375 billion. Yesterday, we announced a new equity repurchase authorization and an increase in our quarterly dividend. The new equity repurchase authorization is $1.3 billion and is effective October 31, 2016 through December 31, 2017. We expect to use the new authorization ratably over 2017. The quarterly dividend was raised by $0.02 or 10% to $0.23 per share. As you know, reducing debt and improving our debt service ratios have both been important objectives over the last few years. This month, we repay 275 million of maturing debt consistent with our previously announced plan. In 2017, we intent to repay 416 million of senior notes in March, which is our only 2017 debt maturity.","Our 2017 capital plan was developed with the expectation that 2017 dividend and holding company cash flows in total will be about at the same level as in 2016. While Talcott dividend will be 500 to 600 million, which is down from the 750 million we received this year, we expect this reduction will be offset by higher dividends from our other subsidiaries and other holding company resources. To conclude, this quarter's results were strong and as Doug discussed our profitability improvement initiatives with personal auto are well underway. We continue to generate very strong margins in commercial lines and group benefits and we are growing profitably in small commercial our top performing business. Finally, with disciplined execution year-to-date investment results remain very good and along with generally favorable equity market levels have helped Talcott deliver good bottom line results. With strong earnings and capital generation, we were very pleased to be able to announce our capital management plans for 2017.","I will now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you. Michelle we have about 30 minutes for Q&A so if you can give the instruction for the polling for the Q&A and then we will start.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Ryan Tunis","Just a couple on personal lines on the auto. So I think you guys mentioned that severity and frequency were bolstered up 3% year over year. I'm just wondering if the actions that you've taken so far contemplate things continue and they get a little bit worse or still running at these levels or should we think about the actions you've taken - do those more assumed in 2017, 2018 do I have a kind of what\u2019s been like more of a historical normal in terms of frequency especially?","Doug Elliot","Ryan good morning this is Doug. Let me take that question and try to pull apart a few of the pieces. First thing is that we were a little disappointed that our frequency in the third-quarter was a little higher than we expected to be particularly given what we thought were ever going to be favorable trends against the 2015 patterns in the back half of the year. As we lean into fourth quarter, obviously we will watch those three months carefully. Encouraged by what we are seeing in October but need to finish the year strong for 2016 to complete itself. As we think about 2017, we\u2019ll share more when we get the January but I will say this, it looks to us like we are in an environment where loss trends don't look like averages over the past ten years. So we are anticipating an abnormal environment hoping that it isn\u2019t as abnormal as the last two years have been but we will talk more about that with more detail in January.","Ryan Tunis","And then my follow-up I guess is probably a little bit more of a modeling one around auto. But just thinking about the momentum on the expense ratio there? I mean the fact that that's improved a lot direct marketing costs have come out. I guess lower bonuses should that continue to come down over the next few quarters or it is sort of way you\u2019re running now reflect all the actions you've announced or have planned?","Doug Elliot","Two things I would say, first is, clearly we are taking extraordinary change leverage if you will based on our revised open road plans. So, yes, we did some things in the third quarter that were a bit outsized compared to our run rate. So yes, you need to step that back to get a more normal run rate going forward, but we\u2019re continuing to match our pricing adequacy, our view about profitability with our marketing strategies and they are incredibly correlated. So we will continue to do that quarter-by-quarter. This is an approach that we are keenly focused on margins and the margins have to be in line for us to be kind of ramping up marketing efforts.","So I hope to see a different day soon, but we\u2019ll work hard at that. The other thing I just want to say as well, I think you've seen and hopefully heard in my script, we\u2019ve worked hard on the rate change activity and many of you that have looked inside the state filings have seen the advancements of that strategy. I gave you a forward look into the fourth quarter, that's evidence of really what's happening at the desk level. So as our filing momentum continues, we expect fourth quarter to show nine point surprising activity that is very reflective of our aggressive approach to getting on top of these loss trends.","Ryan Tunis","Okay. And I guess just a follow-up real quick to that, I think you also mentioned, it's not just renewal rates, it\u2019s also mix change. I guess when you think about longer-term getting back towards the 96 to 96.5 [indiscernible] how much of that do you think really relies on getting renewal rate versus just kind of, maybe undoing some of the things that happened a year ago, in terms of just improving I guess the mix of the book?","Doug Elliot","Yes. I don't want to give you an exact definitive answer, because I\u2019m not sure there is one, but I will say this. There are clearly positive signs that are going to manifest inside the aggressive rate actions offsetting some of the trends that we are seeing in our book as well. I\u2019m also encouraged by the number of levers that we\u2019re working in our other agency and in our other channels. So as we think about kind of this roll forward into 2017 and 18, there are going to be benefits, important benefits on both sides of that equation, but I want you to know that based on my pricing comments this morning, we are leaning into what we need to do to address the costs and the loss trends that are in the marketplace today.","Chris Swift","Brian, it\u2019s Chris. The only color I would add for you is, remember, we are optimistic about the AARP book, its relationship, our knowledge in that market and so consistent with, Doug, I'm not going to give you a precise formula, but there is a substantial amount of improvement that will come from a retrenchment and a focus on our core, our core AARP, our abilities to market to them in a direct and an efficient fashion, while using the channel for those customers that want to go through an agent and really shut down some of the other agency non-member agency as we call activities where we\u2019ve tried to grow a little too fast in the past. So I would not underestimate the mix comment that you said, because it will improve the results over that two-year period of time.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Michael Nannizzi","Thanks so much. I guess just, Doug, just one question just on personal auto, when you talk about improvement in \u201817 from the actions you\u2019ve taken so far, what are your assumptions around loss trends. You mentioned you were a little bit surprised with 4Q sort of holding flat and not improving. Are you optimistic in your outlook or are you taking into consideration in that view of improving trends and profitability, what we saw here so far in the fourth quarter?","Doug Elliot","Thanks, Mike. The loss trend discussion is an interesting one today, right, so we\u2019re spending a lot of time in our day that we also are spending a lot of time looking at industry, the fast-track data that I know all of you look at. So as we look forward, we have expectations based on the actions we are taking that we\u2019re going to see improving signs in our book of business and based on some of the early progress across both retention of our existing book and also the new business we\u2019re putting on, we feel good that we are turning the dial in a favorable direction on things we can control relative from our own loss trends.","If you step back from that and you look at fast-track data and you see aggregate severity and frequency in this industry over the past seven, eight quarters in a very different spot. So our lens into \u201817, \u201818 has changed a bit over the last couple of quarters, as has our approach to rate change. So they are directly correlated. It\u2019s the reason we're ramping up, it\u2019s a reason that our rate activity in \u201816 is 2X what it was in \u201815, but Mike, I would say that we are willing to be mobile and agile and adjust to what we see going forward. We do think it will be a bit more tempered in \u201817, but at the moment, we need to see better signs across the industry that auto experience is going to demonstrate that.","Michael Nannizzi","Got it. Thanks for that. And then you mentioned marketing spend as a lever in personal lines, can you talk about how much room you have there as a lever if you want to, if that's an area where you decide you want to pull back further, how much sort of juice is there in that operating lever?","Chris Swift","Michael, it\u2019s Chris. I would say we\u2019ve been fairly aggressive in polling that lever over the last two quarters. How much more we do obviously is a function of where we see the ability to market on a more targeted basis, state basis, where we think there is still opportunities to acquire business at acceptable rates. So I'm not going to give you a precise formula, but I mean it's been cut back quite substantially already. We feel good about the level where it is right now from a run rate side, particularly as we head into \u201817, but if there is any additional discomfort, what we are seeing, it is a lever that we could continue to modify and pull. So if we are running pro forma about 50% of what our historical rate has been, we still theoretically have $0.50 on those additional dollars to pull.","Michael Nannizzi","Great. Thanks. And then just one last one if I could, just there has been some activity in the space on the acquisition side with rates sort of lifting up a little bit here recently, can you just talk about Talcott and the potential there or any potential interest from third parties, and if that's something that you are, you would consider more specifically now than maybe previously? Thanks.","Chris Swift","Thank you, Michael. I think you know the stock answer. We're not going to comment upon rumors or speculation. So, but I could share with you maybe just a framework that probably many of you have heard over the years in what our strategy and goals with Talcott were. I mean, really, we put that block into run-off five years ago, really with the idea of reducing risk and policyholders\u2019 liabilities reliability over time. We wanted to return excess capital to the holding company and we always wanted to meet our customer commitments. So I think over the last five years that it\u2019s played out exactly as we would have wanted. The book is - the liability side of the book has been reduced over 50% and Talcott\u2019s provided the holding company with a good deal of capital that has allowed us to manage in the most efficient way.","So as we look forward, we\u2019re perfectly comfortable running this off over a longer period of time, but myself, Beth and we've always said, we'd always consider a permanent solution if it was really truly permanent and that usually in our vernacular means a legal entity sale. So I think in the future, we will always be prudent in exploring opportunities, but I wouldn't foreshadow a lean one way or another at this point in time. I mean it's running off as we\u2019ve planned and if there are solutions out there that make economic sense for us, that would be acceptable with the regulators that take care of our customers and employees, we would explore that.","Operator","The next question comes from Randy Binner from FBR. Your line is open.","Randy Binner","Hey, great. Thanks. I'll ask a couple more on Talcott, one, with the run-off on contract counts, the 10% and 5% numbers, they\u2019re still good, they\u2019re slowing down a little bit, do you have any further initiatives planned to accelerate the movement of contracts out of the block?","Beth Bombara","Sure, Randy. This is Beth. I\u2019ll take that. At the current time, no large initiatives like the ones that you\u2019ve seen in the past. I think, as I\u2019ve commented on before, the team is always looking at things that we can do and I think we've done some of those larger initiatives which obviously favorably impacted the surrender activity over the last couple of years. And now I see it as continued sort of tweaks on that process, but we do not have a contract initiative underway at the present time.","Randy Binner","Okay. And then on the 500 to 600 requests planned for 2017, can you break that out between what\u2019s kind of operating free cash flow versus just capital release as the required capital goes down overtime? And then what the timing of that would be, up in \u201817, would be, I think this year, it came up more in the kind of the first half?","Beth Bombara","Yes. So a couple of things and it\u2019s hard to parse out an exact number. If you go back to the comments that I made in July, when we look at absolute surplus generation during the course of the year, given where interest rates are, I would expect before consideration of the dividends that we took out during the course of 2016 that our statutory surplus would be a little bit lower than where we started because we do anticipate needing to post cash flow reserves in the fourth quarter. So even those through the nine months, we've seen an increase in surplus before dividends, we would expect most, if not all of that to go away as we go towards the end of the year.","So when I think about the capital that we\u2019re taking out next year, it's really looking at what excess do we have under stress scenarios, how comfortable do we feel relative to the levels that that would mean that we\u2019re running Talcott at and based on that, I feel very comfortable with the range of 500 million to 600 million. As far as the timing over the course of \u201817, we haven't - and specifically on that, but I would expect that we would again not take it all out at once, probably take some out in the first part of the year and some in the second, but that timing is still to be determined.","Randy Binner","Just the last one is did you provide an update on the RBC ratio down at Talcott as of now?","Beth Bombara","No, we did not put an update in RBC ratio. I\u2019d say that the RBC ratio is getting a specific number. It continues to be very strong in these markets, in this market environment. Again, when we think about excess capital and ability to take dividend out, we\u2019re always looking at it in the stress. So to some extent, what the current RBC level is, it is not so much of an input for us as we think about the amount of capital that we can put to the holding company.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS. Your line is open.","Brian Meredith","Yes. Thank you. A couple of quick numbers question and one broader question for you. First, Doug, what was the impact on current year loss ratios in commercial lines from the increase in loss picks on the commercial art of business, I imagine there were some current year development?","Doug Elliot","There was, Brian. It was about a half a point across all the commercial, the impact from our auto changes.","Brian Meredith","Great. And the other quick numbers one, was the impact on reserve development for the Florida worker's comp reserve increased?","Beth Bombara","So I will take that one, Brian. So as we looked at our reserve position at the end of the quarter and worker\u2019s comp, we did take into consideration the impact of those rulings and putting that in the mix along with some of the favorable trends that we've seen, really resulted in no real change needed to our overall carried reserves.","Brian Meredith","Okay, great. And then my last question, Doug, I'm just curious, we've seen a tick-up in medical costs inflation this year at least recently. Are you seeing any signs at all that in the worker's comp line yet?","Doug Elliot","Brian, we are not, we're watching that very carefully and we\u2019re very pleased with our frequency and severity trends, very early in the accident year, but our 2016 workers comp book is very good shape, frequencies continue to be flat to down slightly in our medical and our indemnity severities are in pretty good shape. So we are not seeing the blips there yet.","Chris Swift","Brian, it\u2019s Chris. Just one point both Doug and I get a monthly report from our investment and management, just on detailed inflation activity. So it is something, as he said, we watch closely. I think also the important thing to remind everyone is no matter what the current trends are, I mean, what we\u2019d put upon the books has a long-term inflation trend associated with it. And that\u2019s in the 6% to 7% range, so to the extent that that trend is not needed, then obviously that creates successes, but to the extent it\u2019s needed, no, it\u2019s already there and built into our reserving philosophy.","Brian Meredith","Great. And just lastly quickly, Beth, could the DOL feature [indiscernible] Talcott as we look Q4?","Beth Bombara","So we are continuing to stay close to our partners on that to understand that. I think that it could have some impact as financial advisors look to implement the rules and think about what advice they give to their customers. At the present time, we\u2019re not expecting a significant change, but it\u2019s something that we will look at and monitored very closely, but wouldn't surprise me if we saw a little bit of a slowdown, potentially.","Operator","Your next question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is open.","Meyer Shields","Thanks, good morning. If I can start on the mutual funds business, I guess the press release talks about higher expenses related to Lattice, are those expenses associated with the acquisition or the operation business?","Beth Bombara","It's a little bit of both, Meyer. So obviously there were some costs relative to the acquisition and then just as we bring that platform onto ours, we will see some uptick on expenses.","Meyer Shields","Okay. And then within P&C, I guess can you talk about how Maxim is performing in terms of premium volumes and margins compared to expectations?","Doug Elliot","Meyer, this is Doug. It\u2019s very early days. It\u2019s just been what is really 60 days. No progress or aberration to speak of, so it's been a well performing underwriting group in its extended history. We\u2019re pleased about having them on board, but in the third quarter, there wasn't anything really to speak of it that would be a pattern for Maxim.","Meyer Shields","Okay. And then last question if I can, can you give us an update on the agency count, within I guess the non-AARP book?","Doug Elliot","The agency count has not moved a lot since the last time we spoke, I think just over 10,000 was the number of locations I think we shared with you last. So maybe a couple of tuning adjustments we made since then. I know that we made a few more moves in Florida since the second quarter call, but substantially it's the same book of business and same agents, we\u2019re just working our way through our changes.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Alex Scott from Evercore. Your line is open.","Alex Scott","Hi, I just had one quick one on Talcott. I know you mentioned the writedowns this quarter, and for 4Q, some of the statutory work, just thinking about GAAP reserves, I know some of them are kind of how it is embedded derivatives, some of them are not, is there any contemplation when exit value in those reserves, I guess how should we think about that impacting 4Q?","Beth Bombara","So, as I sit here and think about our GAAP reserves, I think you\u2019re asking about for fourth quarter, not a lot of changes that we\u2019d anticipate relative to sort of the annual assumption updates that we've looked at in the fourth quarter. There hasn't been a lot of change in those expectations. So sitting here today, I\u2019m not expecting that we would see a significant impact from the fourth quarter review of our assumptions on a GAAP basis.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your line is open.","Jay Gelb","Thanks and good money. Beth, the $1.3 billion of buybacks in 2017, I think that's slightly above what the street was kind of expecting going into the year, and it also feels like you kind of pulled forward the discussion of that at this point of the year. So is there anything else you can tell us about in terms of the decision that led to that amount of the timing?","Beth Bombara","So, Jay, really as we looked at our holding company requirements and the cash flows that we have and the dividends that we\u2019d be taking out of the subsidiaries and looked at that in total, it felt like a very reasonable number to us and generally kind of in line with what we did this year. As far as the timing of the announcement, we've always talked about announcing our 2017 plans as we came towards the end of the year and announcing that now and having that authorization obviously does give us the opportunity to be opportunistic in the fourth quarter, given that our previous authorization was running down, so that was really the thought process there relative to getting that authorization done now.","Jay Gelb","Okay. Where does that put you or put the company from a debt to capital standpoint, relative to your long-term targets, also taking into account the debt running off in 2017?","Beth Bombara","Yes. So when we look at both what the debt that we paid off this month and our expectation for the maturity that we will repay in March, we are definitely marching down towards our longer-term targets and so we\u2019ve always talked about sort of being in the low-20s and obviously both of those things are starting to put us there. So when I think back as to all of the actions we\u2019ve been taking on the debt front over the last several years and the way we have been going about it, feel very, very good about the progress that we\u2019re making and getting our debt stack to be more in-line with what our long-term expectations are.","Jay Gelb","And then one last one on Talcott, there is clearly a lot of moving parts including the benefit of improved limited partnership returns in the third quarter, is it too early to ask about where you see kind of a normalized trend in Talcott\u2019s earnings in 2017?","Beth Bombara","Yes. I would say let's wait until we get to our fourth quarter call when we talk a bit about expectations for 2017. I will remind you we did say that we will not be providing forward EPS guidance going forward, but we\u2019ll give some discussion on that, but the way I would have you think about it is obviously the limited partnership returns do provide some ups and downs as you look at the Talcott earnings over the course of the year and the majority of the sort of non-investment income return comes from the fees that are generated in the variable annuity book and we are pretty transparent in how that is running off, so I think if you use some of that, you get an expectations relative to run rate.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you, Michelle, and thank you all for joining us today and your interest in the Hartford.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. 2015 was a successful year for The Hartford. Core earnings per diluted share increased 15% over 2014. Core earnings ROE rose to 9.2% from 8.4%. Book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, grew by 7%. We reduced debt by $750 million and we returned $1.6 billion of capital to our shareholders. Doug and Beth will go into further details of our 2015 performance but I\u2019d like to touch on a few highlights.","First, Property and Casualty had a very strong year. The underlying combined ratio improved a half a point to 91 and top line growth continued, reflecting an increase in new business and the benefit of pricing and underwriting actions we have made over the past few years. Group Benefits had a very strong year. The business generated a 5.6% core earnings margin, exceeding our plan and pivoted to growth with a 2% increase in fully insured ongoing premiums. We continue to execute on our strategy at Talcott Resolution. The business is running off steadily, returning capital to the holding company and our hedge programs are working effectively. Our mutual funds business generated $1.5 billion of positive net flows in 2015, increased sales by 15% and delivered solid relative fund performance. And our ratings were upgraded by A.M. Best, Moody\u2019s and S&P, an affirmation of our improved balance sheet, operating performance and financial flexibility.","We delivered these strong financial results and increased our top line momentum while investing in the capabilities and talent that are making us a broader and deeper risk player in a more efficient, customer-focused company that can deliver sustainable, profitable growth. For example, the strong talent we attracted to the organization, particularly in underwriting, sales, data and technology is enabling us to judiciously expand into new market industry verticals. Doug will touch upon this in a moment.","The investments we made in new systems such as our claims system, our Group Benefits enrolment system and our middle market underwriting desktop are both reducing cycle times, and importantly, enhancing the experiences we are delivering to agents and customers. Our understanding of the business implications of accelerating technological change, shifting demographics and evolving customer expectations is informing the investments we are making in product, distribution and service.","And recent marketing investments have increased the visibility of our iconic brand. For example, our sponsorship of Major League Baseball fully rolls out in 2016 and we recently announced the extension of our 20-plus year relationship with the U.S. Paralympics through 2020.","As all of you know, the market is becoming increasingly competitive and the investment environment is less favorable. Consolidation amongst carriers as well as agents and brokers has accelerated. Legacy IT platforms are aging and are costly to maintain. We face disruption from the advent of big data, autonomous vehicles and new capital entering the market. Interest rates are low and are expected to be lower for longer. These dynamics are challenging insurance companies to reevaluate their operations and to adapt. We believe that The Hartford is well-positioned to address these challenges and to take advantage of the market opportunities they present.","We entered 2016 with a strong portfolio of businesses and capital flexibility. We remain focused on organically growing each of our business and we will explore acquisitions that meet our financial and strategic objectives. We will maintain underwriting discipline and tightly manage expenses to support ongoing investments in the capabilities and talent needed to be a top-of-mind company for the products we offer through our distribution partners. And we will continue to expand our core earnings ROE, excluding Talcott, with business performance and effective capital management that returns excess capital to shareholders.","Our 2016 outlook for core earnings is $1.575 billion to $1.675 billion. Excluding Talcott, this range represents core earnings growth of approximately 5% adjusted for favorable CATs in other items in 2015. We also intend to complete our capital management plan, including the $1.3 billion of share repurchases.","In closing, let me express how proud I am of what we accomplished in 2015 and my sincere thanks to our leadership team, our employees, agents and customers, and our investors for their continued support and confidence. We have a clear strategy, an experienced and stable management team, a powerful national distribution network, differentiated products and a brand that stands for strength and integrity. As we enter 2016, I am confident in our ability to navigate this dynamic and competitive environment and continue to create shareholder value.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Doug.","Doug Elliot","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll provide an overview of our 2015 results and Property and Casualty and Group Benefits, and then share some thoughts as we look forward to 2016.","2015 was another year of strong financial performance with improved results in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits. In Personal Lines, results were below our expectations but we remain pleased with the trends of our AARP Direct business and the progress we\u2019ve made to reposition Agency.","Let me get right into our financial results. In Commercial Lines, we delivered over $1 billion of core earnings for the full year on an all-in combined ratio of 92.6, eight-tenths of a point better than 2014. The underlying combined ratio excluding CATs and prior year development was 90 for the year, representing 1.5 points of margin improvement.","Recall that 2014 included a $49 million pre-tax benefit from New York assessments. Normalizing for this, the underlying combined ratio improved 2.3 points. This was driven primarily by improved results in workers\u2019 compensation, general liability and non-CAT property losses. Renewal written pricing and standard Commercial Lines was 2% for both the full year and the fourth quarter. In workers\u2019 compensation, our largest and most profitable line of business, loss trends continue to emerge favorably and as a result, pricing has flattened relative to the prior period. Conversely, commercial auto pricing was in the high single digits, reflecting adverse loss experience throughout the year. On the top line, written premium of $6.6 billion was up 4% from 2014 with growth across Small Commercial, Middle Market and Specialty Commercial.","Let me provide some details on each of our commercial business units. In Small Commercial, the underlying combined ratio of 86.6 was four times of a point better than 2014. Written premium grew by 4%, driven by strong retentions and $545 million of new business, an increase of $24 million or 5% year-over-year. New business growth in the fourth quarter was the strongest for the year at 9%, capping off another excellent year for this business unit.","In the summer of 2015, many of you were with us at our Charlotte operation where we demonstrated the core building blocks that form the foundation for our market-leading small business platform. These include our new business submission technology, ICON, our underwriting and service centers that handle over 2 million calls annually from customers and agents, and our sales team that is relentless in partnering with distributors. Hopefully, you are better able to appreciate how these capabilities seamlessly intertwine to deliver the results we posted in 2015.","In Middle Market, we made solid progress with the underlying combined ratio of 91.4, improving 3.1 points from 2014. Written premium growth was 3%, retentions were solid throughout the year and new business production of $474 million was up for a third consecutive year. The second half of 2015 was certainly more challenging and we saw that during the fourth quarter with new business premium down 13%.","We\u2019re encouraged by the results in Construction and Marine, both of which posted strong new business growth and profitability in the fourth quarter.","In Specialty Commercial, the underlying combined ratio of 98.8 for the full year improved from 100.2 in 2014. This was driven by strong performance improvement in bond and financial products. National accounts achieved nearly 90% account retention and posted positive written premium growth. Bond written premium growth was modest as we have yet to see a pick-up in public construction projects. And financial products gained traction with the growth in middle market and technology E&O, two strategic priorities for the year. Overall, specialty written premiums were up 3%.","Shifting over to Personal Lines, we delivered $185 million in core earnings, down 12% from prior year. The underlying combined ratio of 92 deteriorated 1.4 points from last year, driven mainly by higher auto loss costs and increased non-weather losses in homeowners. In Personal Lines auto, we experienced frequency trends above our expectations in the second half of the year. Our full year frequency trend is under 2% with the third and fourth quarters running at approximately 3.5% to 4%.","We saw an increase in the summer months, largely due to increased miles driven. Trends in September and October were quite benign, as well as the early read on November. In December, there was another uptick in frequency, mainly in liability. Some of the claim activity in December related to November accidents, causing the November frequency to develop several points higher than our initial indication. And we also had relatively favorable trends in those months of 2014, setting up challenging comparisons for the fourth quarter.","We continue to hone our rate plans and underwriting actions to address these frequency trends as the data matures. But it\u2019s clear to us that these patterns are a new norm and will be addressed in our rate filings.","Now let me turn to Group Benefits. Core earnings for 2015 increased to $195 million, up 8% from 2014. That results in a core earnings margin of 5.6%. The full year group disability loss ratio was favorable compared to prior year, reflecting our ongoing pricing discipline and favorable incidence trends. The Group Life loss ratio deteriorated due to slightly higher mortality and claim severity.","Looking at the top line for reinsured ongoing premium, ex-Association-FI, increased 4% for the full year. Overall book persistency on our employer group WoCo [ph] business came in at approximately 90% for the year. And fully insured ongoing sales was $467 million, up $141 million.","2015 was a very strong year for Group Benefits. First quarter sales were outstanding, followed by solid activity throughout the year. The overall loss ratio remains steady and at attractive margins while the expense ratio, ex-Association-FI, decreased 1.1 points. All these drivers contributed to an increase in the core earnings margin during 2015. We were especially excited to welcome back several large customers as further evidence of our outstanding service and product capabilities. As we wrap up 2015, we\u2019re pleased with our continued financial progress and by the growing market strength of each of our businesses.","Before I turn things over to Beth, let me offer a few comments on 2016. Although we\u2019re facing near-term pricing and competitive challenges, we remain committed to our long-term objective of profitable growth. Each of our business units has core initiatives underway for 2016.","In Small Commercial, we\u2019re adding to our digital capabilities as customers and distributors demand more access and convenience. And we\u2019re expanding our product and underwriting capabilities to accommodate both larger accounts and broader coverage on our platform.","In Middle Market, our priority is competing effectively at the front line, leveraging our talent with the tools we\u2019ve introduced over the past several years. Through advanced training and rigorous analytics, our field underwriters are continuously improving our reselection and pricing decisions. In product development and related areas such as claims and risk engineering, we\u2019re extending our capabilities in industry verticals such as construction, auto parts manufacturing and hospitality. Taken together, these actions allow us to effectively become a broader middle market player.","Within Specialty Commercial, we rolled out a new risk management platform for national accounts, allowing customers better access to claim data and other information needed by risk managers. This investment further strengthens our value proposition in this competitive market segment and will allow us to work more closely with our customers to improve long-term account performance.","We expect our overall Commercial Lines margins to remain generally stable with an underlying combined ratio between 89 and 91. We will remain disciplined with our pricing and underwriting actions, managing to both long-term loss cost trends as well as individual account performance.","In Personal Lines, we have three overarching goals. The first is to improve the margins of our products, both auto and homeowners. We\u2019re investing in capabilities to better harness data and analytics and thereby refine and manage our underwriting and pricing.","Second is to maximize the value of our long-term partnership with AARP. Investments in digital tools, contact service capabilities and direct marketing effectiveness are all designed to attract and retain more AARP members.","And third, we will leverage the agency channel to target AARP members and other customer segments that value the expertise of agents who actively seek the benefits of our product suite and who value our service model. We expect to achieve a Personal Lines underlying combined ratio of 90 to 92.","In Group Benefits, we\u2019re looking to drive growth in our core employer group offerings as well as our voluntary product suite. Our current voluntary lineup includes DisabilityFLEX, Critical Illness and Accident. We will add hospital indemnity in the first quarter of 2017. These products, along with our enhanced enrollment and marketing tools help individual participants to make sound decisions for their unique benefit needs. We expect our Group Benefits core earnings margin to be relatively stable between 5.5% and 6%.","First quarter 2016 renewal retention is strong as is new sales activity. January sales are well above our five-year average but down versus a year ago. Recall that 2015 was in many ways a unique sales year, recovering from low market activity in 2013 and 2014.","Overall, 2016 will be a year of competing in an aggressive and disciplined manner. Competition has intensified versus the year ago. We\u2019re putting our investments and enhanced capabilities to work to maintain our margins in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits and improve financial performance in Personal Lines. We will continue to identify opportunities for profitable growth and we remain committed to smart product and underwriting expansions, building deep partnerships with our distributors and delivering outstanding value to our customers.","In summary, we\u2019re very pleased with the successful year in 2015 and are looking forward to continuing our journey in 2016.","Let me now turn the call over to Beth.","Beth Bombara","Thank you, Doug. Today, I\u2019m going to cover Talcott Resolution, the investment portfolio and full year results before turning to our 2016 outlook and financial goals.","Talcott\u2019s full year core earnings summarized on Slide 19 rose 9% from the prior year to $472 million, much higher than our original outlook due to a tax reserve release, increased limited partnership income and non-routine investment income such as make-whole payments. Excluding these items, Talcott\u2019s results were largely in line with the February 2015 outlook of $340 million to $370 million.","On a statutory basis, Talcott\u2019s surplus during 2015 increased by approximately $375 million before dividend to the holding company. Year-end surplus was $5 billion which correspond to an RBC of approximately 550%. In mid January of this year, the Connecticut department approved our $500 million dividend request and it was paid to the holding company last week. This payment completed Talcott\u2019s $1.5 billion capital return program that we announced in February last year. In addition, we expect to request a dividend of approximately $250 million in the second half of 2016.","For 2016, we expect Talcott quarter earnings in the range of $320 million to $340 million. This outlook is based on the continued runoff of the VA in fixed books and does not include items like tax reserve releases or significant non-routine investment income that we had in 2015. I would note that our outlook does assume market value appreciation from year-end 2015 on VA accounts; and therefore, there is some sensitivity to market levels.","Statutory results for 2016 will depend on many factors, such as the level of admitted deferred tax assets, cash flow testing reserves, limited partnership and non-routine investment income and other items that may create volatility. Based on the underlying assumptions in our outlook, we expect statutory capital generation to be in the $200 million to $300 million level, although as we experienced during 2015, it can vary a lot between quarters.","Looking forward, our objectives for Talcott have not changed. We expect to maintain Talcott\u2019s capital self-sufficiency. Consistent with the past few years, we provided you an update of Talcott\u2019s capital margins on Slides 30 and 31 in the Appendix which are based on the market scenario summarized on Slide 32, pro forma for the $500 million dividend in January 2016 and the additional $250 million expected in the second half of 2016. Talcott\u2019s stress scenario capital margin at year-end 2017 is expected to be approximately $1.6 billion, well above our 200% RBC minimum.","This result gives us confidence that Talcott will continue to return capital to the holding company in 2017, although the actual amount and timing of 2017 dividends will depend on final 2016 results, market conditions, liquidity needs as well as the composition of surplus. And as a reminder, any dividends require regulatory approval.","Given recent capital market volatility, I wanted to touch on our hedging programs for Talcott. First, our hedging programs have been effective against their targets and due to the sale of Japan, we have far less volatility in our reported results. Our hedge programs target the economics of the VA liabilities which means that gains or losses on the hedges mostly offset the changes in the economic liability to policy holders. Within the VA GMWB liability, we are largely hedged for equity exposure although not for fees and we are not entirely hedged for interest rates.","Second, while our hedge programs are a key tool for maintaining Talcott\u2019s capital self-sufficiency, we will continue to have capital sensitivity to stress scenarios, including credit risk and interest rate exposures on the fixed and institutional annuity blocks. You can see these impacts on Page 32 of the slides which shows the key changes in capital margins in the stress and favorable scenarios versus the base case.","Lastly on Talcott, we completed our annual assumption update in the fourth quarter which takes into consideration recent experience, including withdrawals, surrenders, mortality and operating expenses. We adjusted some assumptions, including lowering surrender rates which had a modest negative impact on fourth quarter net income.","Turning to investments on Slide 20, total impairments for the quarter were $107 million. 2015\u2019s impairments are up from $63 million in 2014 largely due to intent-to-sell impairments on energy and other commodity-related securities.","As for energy-related securities, our holdings totaled $3.7 billion at December 31, 2014 and declined to $2.5 billion at year-end as we actively reduced our exposure during the course of the year. We believe these investments are well-positioned for a lower for longer oil and commodity price environment and we will continue to manage these holdings.","During the year, we upgraded the average credit quality of our below investment grade portfolio which totaled $3.2 billion at year-end 2015. As you can see on Slide 20, we increased our exposure to BB bonds and decreased our exposure to bonds rated B and below during the year, including some below investment grade energy exposures.","Turning to Slide 21, our portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, has held up reasonably well, averaging 4.1% largely consistent with last year. However, excluding non-routine investment items, the yield is down about 10 basis points from 2014.","The P&C portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, declined to 3.8% in 2015 from 4% the year before, reflecting the impact of lower reinvestment rates. As a reminder, the P&C yield is lower than the consolidated portfolio due to its shorter duration. Consistent with the decline in yield, 2015 P&C net investment income, including limited partnerships, declined 4% to $1.17 billion.","In total, 2015 core earnings increased 7% to $1.65 billion or $3.88 per diluted share, which you can see on Slide 22. The core ROE rose to 9.2%, an 80 basis point improvement from 2014. And book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI at December 31, 2015, rose 7% to $43.76 compared to a 4% growth in 2014. Taking together the $0.78 in common dividends per share and the increase in 2015 book value per share, ex-AOCI, equates to total value creation of 9% per share.","Let me provide a quick update on our capital management actions for the last quarter and the year. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we repurchased $450 million of shares, a little higher than the $425 million we indicated at the Goldman Sachs conference in early December. We also repaid $160 million of debt that matured in the quarter. For the full year, our equity repurchases totaled $1.3 billion and we used approximately $800 million to reduce debt, while paying more than $300 million in common stock dividends. As of February 3, 2016, we have approximately $1.2 billion remaining out of the $4.375 billion authorization for equity repurchases from 2014 through 20116. For debt management, we have $455 million remaining under our plan.","I\u2019ll touch on our 2016 outlook shortly but wanted to note that our 2016 outlook assumes the completion of this capital management plan by December 31, 2016.","Turning to Slide 24, I draw your attention to expanded disclosures in the IFS for ROEs. As of December 31, 2014, we began providing legal entity balance sheets on Page 4 of the IFS. Beginning this quarter, we are providing additional ROE disclosures so you can now evaluate net income and core earnings ROEs in total as well as excluding Talcott. In addition, we have provided individual ROEs for P&C combined companies, group benefits and mutual funds.","As noted on this chart, our core earnings ROE, excluding Talcott, was 10.9%. P&C is the largest driver of this result with a 2015 P&C core earnings ROE of 13.5%, offset in part by the impact of the corporate segment which has a lower ROE due to cash and liquid assets at the holding company. Talcott\u2019s core earnings ROE was 6.2%, about 2 percentage points higher than its run rate adjusted for the tax benefit and favorable investment results in 2015.","Increasing our core earnings ROE to exceed our cost of equity capital has been an important goal for The Hartford over the past few years. In 2015, we closed that gap by achieving strong financial performance and a lower beta driven by the reduction in risk and volatility as a result of our strategic and financial transformation over the past several years.","Before covering our 2016 core earnings outlook, which you can see on Slide 25, I wanted to let you know that this will be the last year that we provide a core earnings based outlook. Between the business sales in 2013 and 2014 and the financial disclosures that we provide in the IFS and our SEC filings, The Hartford is a much simpler company to analyze and model. Given many factors that cause a P&C company\u2019s results to vary, including catastrophes, prior-year development and investor returns, the vast majority of public P&C companies do not provide earnings guidance. However, we expect to continue to provide our outlook for financial metrics and capital management that will help you develop your earnings forecast.","Turning to 2016, our core earnings outlook is a range of $1.575 billion to $1.675 billion summarized on Slide 25. At the midpoint of the range, this equates to growth of about 5% over 2015 normalized for favorable CATs and unfavorable prior development and excluding Talcott. The table on this slide includes several of the financial metrics included in this outlook which were included in the news release last night.","I would note that this year we have an outlook for P&C net investment income, excluding limited partnerships, of just over $1 billion, down 3% at the midpoint from 2015. As I stated earlier, our outlook assumes the completion of our capital management plan. At December 31, 2015, holding company cash and short-term investments totaled $1.7 billion. In addition, we anticipate about $1.1 billion in dividends from our P&C Group Benefits and Mutual Fund businesses and $750 million from Talcott in 2016. These amounts are more than sufficient to complete the current capital management plans while also covering 2016 interest expense and dividends and maintaining holding company liquidity above target levels.","Finally, before turning to Q&A, I want to reiterate that 2015 was a successful year, both financially and strategically. Our strategy has not changed and in 2016, we remain confident in our ability to make progress on our operational and financial objectives as we have done over the past several years. While markets are more challenging, our financial strength, financial flexibility and underwriting and expense discipline are important competitive advantages that will help us continue to create shareholder value.","Chris and Doug shared many of our operational objectives for 2016. In addition to our 2016 outlook, our financial objectives in 2016 and beyond include the following - continuing to expand our core earnings ROE excluding Talcott, efficiently manage the runoff and return of capital from Talcott while maintaining its capital self-sufficiency, redeploy the excess capital generated by our business to create greater shareholder value, and generate average total value creation of at least 9% as measured by common dividends paid plus growth in book value per diluted ex-AOCI.","I will now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you, Beth. Just a reminder that we have about 30 minutes for Q&A which means we might run a little past the 10 AM deadline when some other calls begin. If you have to drop off or we don\u2019t have time to get to your questions, please email or call the IR team and we\u2019ll follow up with you as soon as possible today.","Jessa, could you please repeat the instructions for Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jay Gelb","Thanks and good morning. And thanks for the additional disclosure on return on equity. With regard to however you want to look at on overall basis or core basis, do you think Hartford has the ability to maintain or even potentially exceed a bit that 9% outcome on return on equity that\u2019s delivered this year?","Chris Swift","Jay, it\u2019s Chris. 9.2% is what we delivered this year on a core basis. And thanks for acknowledging the expanded disclosures that Beth and the team have put out there. We think it\u2019s important that you really continue to see the progress that we can make going forward.","So as I really sit here today, the 10.9% core earnings ex-Talcott, as Beth described, really does exceed our cost of equity capital today which we judge probably on a 9% to 9.5% range. And if we look forward in \u201816, I do think we could improve that 10.9%. So when I say that, really what I mean is if you look at the plan that we outlined, including normal CATs, we achieve our NII outlook, we maintain in the margins that Doug and his team are focused on and we execute the capital management plan, I think that core earnings ROE ex-Talcott could increase by 50% by the end of \u201816 - basis points, excuse me, 50 basis points.","Jay Gelb","That\u2019s great, thank you. And I just have one question on the guidance. In the P&C and other operations which includes a drag from legacy liabilities like asbestos, it\u2019s been negative for the past few years and I\u2019m just wondering why Hartford isn\u2019t including any impact of that in 2016 in the guidance.","Beth Bombara","Yes, this is Beth. I\u2019ll take that question. So we make our best call each year on what we anticipate for our A&E reserves. And to put a bogey out there as far as what we could expect for prior development, we don\u2019t really have a basis for doing that. The last several years, obviously we have seen charges. Years before that, we didn\u2019t. And we\u2019ll continue to evaluate any reserves in the second quarter like we\u2019ve done before.","Also note, we don\u2019t actually estimate any prior year development except for the accretion of workers comp discount, so it\u2019s very consistent with how we look at things overall. But it is something that we obviously take into consideration and thin about as we think about our expectations for 2016 and we\u2019ll make the call on what the reserves need to be at the time we do the study.","Doug Elliot","Right. For our own models, if we were to put something in for prior year development on issues like a asbestos south [ph], that would detract from the -","Beth Bombara","Yes, yes. We have not included an estimate for prior year development in our outlook.","Chris Swift","And Jay, the 50 basis point improvement I talked about obviously does not include that either. So like Beth said, we don\u2019t really outlook favorable or unfavorable development at this point.","Jay Gelb","I understand. Thanks again.","Beth Bombara","Just one thing before you take another question, Sabra, I just did want to clarify that in my remarks, I call that our impairments for the quarter were 107 million. That was actually a full year number, not the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cliff Gallant from Nomura. Please go ahead.","Cliff Gallant","Thank you for taking my question. I just want to talk a little bit about workers comp and what kind of loss trends you\u2019ve been seeing there over the last year. And then in terms of your guidance, what are you assuming going forward?","Doug Elliot","Cliff, good morning, this is Doug. Our indications across our frequency and severity triangles, these last several years have been very favorable. 2015, our frequency still is small single digits negative across all our markets.","Severity is a bit too early to predict on that tail line, but we\u2019re seeing favorable symptoms even at 12 months on the 2015 actually. And so very pleased about the last three to four action year. Indicators inside our loss triangles and it has been a driver of our improvement and profitability for sure.","In 2016 moving forward, we don\u2019t see a major change in the environment, but we\u2019re still predicting that we\u2019re going to see medical inflation and indemnity severity based on wage and medical as we expect over the lifetime of these workers comp claims. And frequency, I think it\u2019s a pretty flattish scenario in the frequency world.","Cliff Gallant","Okay, all right. So when we think about the guidance in the 80, 90, 91, I mean obviously those are very good numbers, but you could be painted as somewhat conservative in terms of your outlook as well.","Doug Elliot","Yes, I\u2019ll let you pick the word. What I would say is that we\u2019re pleased with the progress. Particularly in middle market, this line has gone from at the bottom of our profitability curve to near the top. And we\u2019re trying to do everything we can to maintain that level of profitability in our book.","Cliff Gallant","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","John Nadel","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. One on personal lines. I guess, Doug, you had mentioned in your prepared remarks that in auto that you believe the pattern of higher frequency is a new norm. I guess the question I have in response to that comment by you is the 6% level of renewal rate increases, does that appear sufficient as you look forward now based on this expectation that the higher frequency is the new norm?","Doug Elliot","So John, thanks. I guess I would say this first about 2015. First, the first six months of 2015 really were very quiet vis-\u00e0-vis frequency and then obviously very different patterns back after the year. As we move forward, we\u2019re reflecting kind of the increased economic activity which has got a lot of features to it as you know.","We weren\u2019t quite sure and we certainly didn\u2019t have that tenant [ph] when we\u2019re with you in October when we talked about the third quarter. But it\u2019s more than a blip. We think it\u2019s going to be with us and therefore, we\u2019re building those patterns into our longer-term framework. And I would say there\u2019s upward bias on our pricing actions moving forward, yes.","John Nadel","Got it. Thank you. And then just one quick one on Talcott, Beth, I think you had mentioned that if we had normalized 2015 for some of the unusual items that earnings would have been in the range that you guys had originally provided, if you compare that against the 2016, it looks like you\u2019re calling for sort of a core or normalized high single digit piece of earnings declined. Should we think about that as a longer-term trend as well in that is there really anything that should change around the case of the runoff of the underlying blocks of business within Talcott?","Beth Bombara","Yes, I would say over the near-term that is a reasonable estimation of the decline. So again, a large portion of the income that comes in on Talcott is from the VA book and fees there so that continues to surrender activity there, you\u2019d continue to see decreases in those earnings. So in the near term, I think that\u2019s a reasonable expectation.","John Nadel","Thanks very much. Have a good day.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Nannizzi","Thanks so much. Just a couple of questions on personal lines, again, but this time on the homeowners side. I mean clearly when we look at the whole P&C operations, middle markets and homeowners were areas for improvement, for harvesting some improvement at the beginning of the year, you\u2019ve clearly done that in middle markets, where are we in homeowners? And it would just seem that like now is probably a pretty good time to be fixing that business. Can you just sort of give us an update of where you are? And what sort of margin improvement are you anticipating in your outlook for 2016? Thanks.","Doug Elliot","Good morning, Mike, this is Doug.","Michael Nannizzi","Hi, Doug.","Doug Elliot","We\u2019re working. We are working hard and you know that across both auto and home. I would say this on the homeowners book, number one, our ability to price parallel and properly underwrite through all those parallels is going through a vigorous review. We\u2019re looking at our underwriting and risk characteristics. We\u2019re looking at agency management actions. So really for both lines, we\u2019ve made quite a few changes in the past 12 months. We\u2019re down about 2,200 agencies that have underperformed for us over a longer period of time. We\u2019re going to continue to look at agency actions in the AARP agency world. We have deauthorized over 2,300 contracts in the last six months.","So we\u2019re looking at every lever available to us both on the home and auto side encouraged by progress on both. But it\u2019s going to take time for those actions to earn their way in to the book of business which is why I think we\u2019re trying to be subtle and conservative as we play 2016 out.","Michael Nannizzi","Got it. And do you have a notion of for the year you ran at 77 give or take for homeowners to kind of square up with that guidance you provided for personal lines? Is that where you\u2019re assuming some of that margin expansion comes in?","Doug Elliot","Yes, we have hopes for improvement on both auto and home. I would say that if you look at our cat performance over a longer than one year period, we think that we can be a more thoughtful cat underwriter in the homeowners arena. Again, we\u2019re looking at pearls inside our product.","So yes, between agency actions and underwriting actions on our own part, we do expect to see improvement in home over the next year to two.","Michael Nannizzi","Got it. And then just back in middle markets for just a minute, that the gap there between middle and small is now 400 basis points or under 400 basis points. Do you feel like now kind of taking a step back and looking at the work you\u2019ve done and sort of what you\u2019ve achieved, I mean is there anything sort of one timing in the fourth quarter? Do you feel like this is a good starting point for you and\/or looking at that sort of differential to small commercial? Has that kind of dragged what you would expect and potentially, could we see that gap close further? Thanks.","Doug Elliot","Mike, I\u2019d love to see that gap close a bit further, but let me just offer a couple of comments. Number one, very pleased with the outstanding performance in small commercial. I think across the marketplace and historically against our own book of business, we\u2019re in a very solid spot and would like to grow and maintain that margin going forward. So that\u2019s a thought around small commercial.","In the middle arena, a bit more duration matched here. So this is a book of business that has improved mightily over the past four years. We\u2019re watching the yield curve because duration does matter. Workers comp is a key line here as it is in small. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve reported a quarter with 89 execs in the middle in my career.","So please with progress. I would say that between the pricing environment that we continue to compete in and the yield environment that affects our portfolio, we\u2019re going to stay close to those dynamics and be thoughtful in terms of our choices, risk by risk as we move through time.","And also, as Chris has shared with you, we have geography goals. And we think there are other places in the country that we can find and build new relationships and be able to leverage our products that are really very solid at the marketplace.","So like the progress. I think we can be a much bigger, broader player over time in middle.","Michael Nannizzi","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","You next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen. Please go ahead.","Jay Cohen","Yes, a couple of questions. One, you had mentioned I pretty notable reduction on the number of agents. Should we be factoring that as having an impact on your top line growth and personal lines?","Doug Elliot","If you look at fourth quarter performance, Jay, you can see some of that playing out because one of the lines is down. It\u2019s down most substantially relative to the other personal lines. It\u2019s not 50% of our agency book, but it has disproportionally impacted our profit inside the book of business, Jay.","So I don\u2019t think you have to make major top line modifications. I think you\u2019re going to probably see more quarters moving forward like what you saw in the fourth quarter. But we do expect to see some positive development inside our triangles from some of these actions.","John Cohen","Got it. Secondly, on the small commercial side, one potential major competitor is planning to form a kind of direct distribution platform with small commercial. Two questions on this. One, do you think this has a chance of succeeding? Secondly, if yes, is Hartford well-positioned to essentially explore that channel if in fact people want to buy that way.","Chris Swift","Jay, it\u2019s Chris. We\u2019re very aware of market developments and activities whether it be from traditional players of new players in the marketplace. And ultimately you\u2019re probably not going to like this answer, but time will tell.","But if you look at what it\u2019s going to take to be successful, product, service, brand, reputation, claims, I mean it\u2019s, I call it an entire business model you have to be good at to keep customers for a long term which we\u2019ve been particularly very pleased and proud of our retention.","So with $3.5 billion of premium and upstarts, they\u2019re going to try and we\u2019ll have to have a response which we\u2019ll be prepared for at the right time to counteract any of their measures in the marketplace. But I like our beginning point. But we\u2019re also very watchful as far as developments in the marketplace.","John Cohen","Got it. Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Please go ahead.","Meyer Shields","Thanks. I have two personal lines questions if I can. One, Doug, can you take us through the mechanics of the policies that are served by the agents that have been terminated? I\u2019m asking really whether that impact systems ratios going forward.","Doug Elliot","So we have contracts with individual agencies both personal lines and commercial contracts, Meyer. And we obviously have to buy better provisions so there are extended contract periods. So some of them having six-month, twelve-month provision that we will continue to be partners. And then at some point in the future, that business will move elsewhere. They do shift and are not exactly the same throughout the country, but we\u2019re adhering to them.","On the expense side, I think we\u2019re working hard to manage our expenses appropriately given what may happen to the top line. So I don\u2019t think you have to do any different to your models on the expense side. Chris.","Chris Swift","I would just offer, Meyer, just a context here. So agents across our platform are very vital to our success. So when we talk about shrinking agents, particularly in the independent agency side, I think it\u2019s important you have a context of market segment.","So our strategy here is to have meaningful relationships with our independent agents defined as being a top three carrier in their agency plan because that will dictate, I\u2019ll call it, long-term success with retention growth and profitability.","Those agencies particularly in personal lines that we don\u2019t have that type of relationship with is the targeted area here for shrinking.","On the other side, particularly given our AARP relationship and the importance of agents to certain AARP members that want advice and counsel, if we want to continue to support those independent agents that have the ability to attract and retain AARP customers for the long term.","So it\u2019s very targeted here, our actions. So I don\u2019t want you to have the impression that - or getting out of independent agency channel and personal line or fine-tuning the definition of success ultimately from a growth and profitability side.","Doug Elliot","And Meyer, I would say two other points that I would like to have. Number one, our research which we\u2019ve worked on now this past couple of years shows us that many of those AARP members do indeed prefer to work with an agent. So we\u2019re excited about the progress we\u2019ve made there.","And secondly, my comment about the number of agents that have been deauthorized for AARP, those were essentially relationships that had leveraged the value of what we thought we brought to the table with this enhanced offering.","So in the case that they haven\u2019t leveraged that, we\u2019d rather be contracted with those that are using it. And we think there\u2019s great value there. And working like crazy to build a very, very positive profile of customers that value our brand and our AARP members.","Meyer Shields","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Second question, when you look at the different channels that you\u2019ve got, AARP, AARP agents, et cetera, is there a difference in terms of frequency shifts by channel? Are you seeing, I would expect, less uptick in AARP? Is that panning out?","Doug Elliot","As we look at our trends across 2015, they\u2019re essentially very consistent across the channel. So our frequency uptick in third quarter and also fourth quarter as well as the very flat profile for the first half of the year, were essentially consistent across the channel. I think that leads down a path toward this economic dynamic with weather in the fourth quarter and a summer month vacation schedule in July and August that we felt the impact of as did many others.","Meyer Shields","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Randy Binner","Thanks. I got a couple more on personal lines. I guess the first question is there was a notion earlier, recently as last conference call that the AARP book was a more mature group of individuals who were safer drivers. And so I just want to check in on that dynamic. Is that overtaken by the, I guess, the miles driven argument that\u2019s going on here.","And if you quantify this - I missed it, I apologize - but are you getting on auto pricing price increase-wise, is the 4%, 5%, 6% bip? It would nice to hear that quantification because we are getting those numbers from other carriers.","Chris Swift","Randy, it\u2019s Chris. Let me just take just a step back and then Doug and I will partner on this one here. I think your point on AARP is still generally true, but if you look at sort of the progression of activity over the last 12 months, Doug said is earlier.","First half of the year is relatively benign from a frequency side and we\u2019re seeing normal severity trends in the 2% to 3%. I think what happened in July and August is we saw a little bit of a pop in frequency.","Then September, October, it went back to sort of normal in that 1% range. And Beth and I then had an opportunity to speak at a conference in early December where then we gave an indication that we thought November would be in that 1% range also and sort of smooth out the year.","But as we got into December, we had another sort of blip in frequency. And that impacted our quals on how we thought ultimately November frequency would develop. So there\u2019s a little bit of a lag factor that you have to put on this frequency trend. So when you put the third and fourth quarters together as Doug said, we\u2019re in that 3.5% to 4% range.","I think our thesis still is that economic activity defined by low employment, miles driven up due to lower gasoline prices coupled with particularly in November then December, some weather in the Southwest, Midwest and West whether it be rain, sort of torrential rains at California experienced - and California is our largest personal line state - or other weather activity. All that contributed to, I\u2019ll call it, the increase in frequency incidences.","That said, over a longer period of time, the AARP book still outperforms a mass market book so that when we\u2019re talking about 3.5%, 4% frequency increases, wish they\u2019ll think that is a lot lower than a broad mass market increase in frequency.","So as Doug said, we are beginning and have particularly with a fourth quarter filing and a couple of our - one of our large states, we have, in essence, we reflected this new level of activity in our filings. And we\u2019ll continue to do that in 2016 and earn that out and manage actions such as underwriting or agency management actions as Doug described. I think that is the context that I just would have you to keep in mind.","So Doug, would you follow up?","Doug Elliot","Chris, I think you hit most of the major points. I think maybe a few to add. One is I would not underestimate our view of how much the non-rate activity should improve our performance over time, Randy. So these agency actions and really becoming a better underwriter. I\u2019m thinking about selection and undisclosed drivers and appetite management and geography. Those are all meaningful priorities for us and we expect over the next year to two years. That\u2019s point one.","Point two is I don\u2019t think that dramatic change in our numbers were quite as dramatic as some of the other carriers we compete with. So yes, our frequency was not flat for the second half of the year. But it was mid-single, three-ish, three to four. So that\u2019s not 8, 10, 12. It\u2019s having an impact on our filings, it will be proportional to state. But we wanted to send the message today that we\u2019re not just at a point where we\u2019re thinking it was a blip on the radar and we\u2019re not going to adjust our patterns going forward.","Randy Binner","Okay. Thank you for all that. So your price would be something like 2% to 3%, is that the right was to think of it?","Doug Elliot","Our price filings are still in that mid-single digit range and probably will increase from there on auto going into 2016.","Randy Binner","Got. Okay. Thank you.","Chris Swift","And Randy, it\u2019s Chris. All I said is I mentioned, severity is not zero either, right? So I mean there are still more expensive cars and bumpers and devices to fix in cars when there are accidents. So I just want to be clear that severity is in that 2%, 3% range also.","Randy Binner","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Erik Bass","Good morning. Thank you. Can you remind us about the composition of your alternative investment portfolio? And in your guidance, I think you assumed a 6% return for the year. But do you have early read on the first quarter results just given the market decline that we\u2019ve seen year-to-date and the lag in reporting for some of the funds?","Chris Swift","Erik, I could get that to you. But I would just ensure focus on first quarter. First quarter is going to start out soft here just given market activities and the lag.","Beth Bombara","Yes. So a couple of things. And we do provide a breakout of our partnership investments and our 10-Qs and Ks so you can see the update. Obviously, we file the K at the end of the month. But when you think about our total partnerships where we ended 2015 at about $2.9 billion of assets, about $1.8 billion of that is in private equity and real estate funds and the rest would be in hedge funds.","And when we think about our returns in total, we plan for a blended sort of 6% return. We anticipate higher returns in the private equity funds and a bit lower in the hedge funds.","And as Chris just said, as we think about first quarter, a couple of things to keep in mind. For the private equity fund, those are on a quarter lag. So what we report in first quarter will really be where they ended 2015. And for the hedge funds, they are at about a one month lag.","And looking at what we expect to see for January results, we expect to see a little bit of downtick in the hedge fund performance and we\u2019ll just have to see how February comes in to see where we actually close the quarter.","Erik Bass","Got it. Thank you. And then Beth, could you just clarify one thing on Talcott? I for your guidance, I think you mentioned that it\u2019s as of on the market at 12-31. Can you just give us a sense of how much impact the equity market movements have on earnings for Talcott now given obviously the shrinking of the VA book?","Beth Bombara","Yes. So a couple of things. So the rule of thumb, what we typically look at is that for every 1% change and sort of an annualized look at S&P, that\u2019s about $2 million to $3 million of quarter earnings.","So when you think about how markets have declined since yearend and sort of extrapolate that, right now looking at it you\u2019d probably say about 15 million after tax sort of pressure on the quarter earnings number.","Erik Bass","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Gallagher from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Thomas Gallagher","Good morning. Few questions. First is just in terms of your energy exposure, if you could start with that. It looks to me like you\u2019ve been one of the more proactive companies in terms of derisking from a credit standpoint on energy. Would you say you\u2019re pretty much done with the significant reduction for that portfolio? And also related to that, how much of a gain did you book on the derivatives that were short oil as an offset against some of these impairments?","Chris Swift","It\u2019s Chris. I appreciate the observation of our proactivity regarding risk. So yes, we had been very proactive with our Hemco investment management professionals, our Chief Risk Officer, Beth, myself, so we did make some early moves that turned out to be good and wise.","Beth could give you the details on the exact percentage decline. But we took out approximately $1 billion of oil holdings in our portfolio. When we did that, we also decided to put on a more of catastrophic hedge on oil prices if it crashed for a long period of time.","But Beth, would you just comment about some of the details?","Beth Bombara","Yes. So a couple of things. So as I said, we ended the year with our portfolio at about $2.6 billion. About 91% of that is in investment grade securities. And then a little, obviously, the rest in below investment grade with 745 of that at a BB rating.","So as I said here today, we feel very good about our holdings. And as always, we\u2019ll continue to monitor it. And so if there are other actions we need to take, we would take them. But right now, we felt very well-positioned with all of the actions that we took over the course of 2015.","As it relates to the oil hedges, as Chris said, we put that on in early 2015 because as we looked at our portfolio, we knew that we did want to reduce our exposure there and we wanted some protection so that if prices were to decline significantly before we\u2019re able to do that, we had some offset.","So actually, the hedge position we unwound mid-December because we\u2019re basically done with our activities and we were put at a modest loss of about $9 million on it before tax. But again, overall, very, very happy with the actions that we took and the position that we find ourselves in today.","Thomas Gallagher","Okay, thanks. And then next question is just on the group benefits side. Doug, can you comment on - results are softer this quarter. It looks like you\u2019re assuming margins consistent with the full year. Should we take that to mean the fluctuation you saw on 4Q were just on the adverse side, you don\u2019t see any change there? Or do you need some rate there to get to the results that you\u2019re predicting for 2016 or you\u2019re forecasting for 2016?","Doug Elliot","Yes, good question Tom. I think that our full year results are more reflective of how we deal about group. There was some fine-tuning at yearend. We had a little adverse mortality and severity in our life block. And a little bit of activity in LTD, not anything major. And as I look at the full year, I still feel very good about the health of our overall book of business and our ability to compete in the marketplace. So we move ahead into 2016 feeling good about the progress made.","Thomas Gallagher","So Doug, no material rate needed in that business from where you\u2019re sitting?","Doug Elliot","We still want to stay ahead of trend. So we\u2019ve got medical and other trends in that book of business that will impact our future plans and activities. But I don\u2019t see anything out of the ordinary difference than how we would have thought about pricing over the last 12 to 18 months.","Thomas Gallagher","Okay.","Chris Swift","Tom, this is Chris. Our interest rates obviously are - I think if you look at our discount rates of how we\u2019re going to discount our implied discount and our liabilities are appropriate. But as Doug said, I mean it\u2019s a great business for us. It\u2019s a major contributor of our growth orientation and our strategies. It\u2019s integral. And I\u2019m glad you\u2019re recognizing its potential.","Thomas Gallagher","Okay. Thanks, Chris. And then just one last one on Talcott. And this is sort of a bigger picture question to think about not so much specific numbers related to beyond 2016. But I just want to understand conceptually how you\u2019re thinking about this. So you\u2019ve obviously taken out a combination of extraordinary dividends plus the earnings generation at that business for last few years here or at least in 2015 and then the plan in 2016.","But if I think about the shrinkage of that block, it looks like it is slowing a bit on the VA side. And now the majority of capital is non-VA related and those liabilities seem to be stickier. So as we think about our path over the next two, three years, is it fair to say more of the dividends coming out will just be earnings or do you still think there\u2019s a lot of latitude for taking out the bigger extraordinary dividends as well.","Chris Swift","Tom, Beth can comment on her views. But I think generally you\u2019re right with the view if you look at the capital allocation. We\u2019ve got a lot of capital tied up in, I call it, the fixed annuities. But again, the amount of derisking that the book has gone through, the hedge protection, the sensitivities that Beth gave you on capital margins, it still says that we have the ability to extract some excess capital out as the block shrinks and as we produce earning. Math-wise it\u2019s hard for us to predict right now, but that\u2019s what I would say. Beth.","Beth Bombara","Yes, I agree with that. I mean again you go back, we took out $1 billion of dividends last year and we anticipate taking $750 million out this year. What I think about 2017 and 2018 to your point, I first think about the capital that we generate, $200 million to $300 million range which I would point out still requires extraordinary dividend approval even though its earnings. It\u2019s a capital position of Talcott.","And then I do see there being the potential for excess capital beyond that. But when I think about going into 2017, I don\u2019t anticipate the dividends being higher than what they were in 2016. And as we go through the course of the year, we\u2019ll obviously continue to update that, but you\u2019re right, it would be on a downward trajectory, not increasing when we think about the excess capital.","Thomas Gallagher","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you. And Jessa, I think we have one more question in the queue.","Operator","We certainly do. Your last question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney. Please go ahead.","Bob Glasspiegel","Good morning. Doug, just a quick question on personal. Your outlook midpoint of the range is a one point improvement for personal lines. And in light of the fact that you\u2019re just trying to sort of address personal lines, auto pricing for the changed frequency environment and you\u2019re growing [indiscernible] in the second half, does that suggest that homeowners can offset sort of auto being in the fix mode or are there some things you can do on the expense side it gives you confidence that you can show an improvement?","Doug Elliot","So Bob, you now have the sense that we\u2019re working numerous levers on both home and auto. And I do think that the first half of the year in auto will be a tough compare relative to frequency because basically they had none in the first half of last year.","But they\u2019re underwriting actions. And these agency actions I described we think will improve our results over time. It\u2019s not going to be easy. And as you know, it takes a while for these actions to earn their way in. Both Chris and I are committed to making those changes and we believe we can hit the targets that we have out there. But we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do in front of us, no question. And I look at headwinds into 2016, personal lines is probably just at the top of that list for the need for us to work through change to get these books in a better financial state.","Bob Glasspiegel","Okay. You don\u2019t think having to put on the gas pedal in the second half contributed all to the deterioration. It\u2019s more macro trends.","Doug Elliot","We believe so. We\u2019ve been very selective about where we put the gas pedal on. We\u2019ve talked to you about the fact that we\u2019ve got a new class plan that have went in two years ago. And it\u2019s been rolling in over time. But Ray Sprague and his team have been very analytical about how we\u2019ve built in our marketing plans, where we\u2019re advertising. AARP obviously is at the core of that, Bob. We look at it by state, so we\u2019re very targeted in terms of within those states, what we\u2019re doing.","But I will also say to you that the overall answer is still not working. So we have more work to be done and confident that we\u2019re on the right path with the renewed team, actively engaged to get it done in 2016 and 2017 as we move forward.","Bob Glasspiegel","Well, awesome. Thanks, Doug.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you everyone for joining us today and for your interest in the Hartford. Please note for your calendars that Chris Swift and Beth Bombara will be at the Merrill Lynch conference on February 10th. And in addition, Beth and Brion Johnson, our Chief Investment Officer and Head of Talcott will be at the AFA conference in Florida at the end of February and early March.","We hope to see you at either or both of those events.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Sabra Purtill, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to The Hartford's First Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Our speakers today are Liam McGee, The Hartford's Chairman, President and CEO; and Chris Swift, our CFO. Other members of our senior management team here today include Doug Elliot, Alan Kreczko, Dave Levenson, Andy Napoli, Bob Rupp and Hugh Whelan. After Liam and Chris' presentation, we will have time for questions.

These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results may differ materially from these statements.

These documents are available in the Investor Information section of The Hartford's website. ","I also need to mention that our presentation today includes some financial measures that are not derived from generally accepted accounting principles. Definitions and reconciliations to these measures -- of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in our financial supplement, press release and 10-Q. I'll now turn the call over to Liam.","Liam E. McGee","Thank you, Sabra. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Yesterday, we announced strong first quarter results, with core earnings up 11% to $1.25 per diluted share. Our P&C combined ratio was 95.7%, a very good result. Strong pricing momentum continued in the P&C Commercial segment, and we had significantly improved new business growth in Consumer Markets. ","We also achieved several significant accomplishments. We concluded the strategic evaluation of the businesses and announced our plan to focus on the Property & Casualty, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds businesses. This is The Hartford's best path forward to deliver greater value for shareholders. So in order to increase transparency on our go-forward businesses, we expanded P&C disclosures this quarter, providing more details on Small Commercial, Middle Market and Consumer Markets. Going forward, our presentations will focus on greater detail on the performance about our go-forward businesses and the progress in reducing the size and amount of risk in the Runoff division.  We are moving quickly to execute the plan we outlined in March, including selling businesses, placing the annuity block into Runoff and exploring options for the Runoff division. Let me update you briefly on each of these. ","The sales processes for Individual Life, Retirement Plans and Woodbury Financial are going well. The offering memoranda for each are in the marketplace. There is great interest in each property. We expect to have a competitive auction process, and we expect definitive agreements later this year. I am proud of the hard work and dedication of the employees in these businesses. They are focused on delivering successful and valuable businesses to the ultimate buyers. The proceeds from these sales will give us additional financial flexibility that, over time, we expect to use for capital management actions and some debt reduction. We will also consider options for reducing risk in the Runoff businesses or reinvesting in our go-forward businesses. ","In addition, last week, we announced an agreement to sell the Individual Annuity new business capabilities. This sale does not change our decision to put the in-force block into Runoff, nor does it have a material financial impact on The Hartford. However, it does provide an opportunity for us to place our innovative products, strong distribution capabilities and talented employees with an organization committed to the annuity space. We are also working hard on initiatives to further reduce the size and risk of the Life runoff segment, which will shrink over time through policyholder lapses. While our ultimate goal is to isolate or separate the annuity block from our go-forward businesses, the management team is currently concentrating on transactional and operational opportunities for individual books of business. ","With respect to transactions, we are exploring a wide range of potential opportunities, including sales, reinsurance and other structural concepts. A variety of parties have expressed initial interest in parts of the block. Of course, any transactions will need to balance short-term economics with the long-term objective of reducing liabilities, which would allow us to redeploy some of the capital currently allocated to the Runoff block. It's still early, but we do expect some of these potential opportunities to materialize over time, particularly as the capital markets continue to stabilize. ","On the operational side, we are pursuing options such as outsourcing or different fund options that will reduce risk or expenses. And of course, we anticipate achieving expense reductions of $100 million before tax in 2013 by placing Individual Annuity segment into Runoff. ","In April, we also refinanced the Allianz debt and repurchased their warrants. The refinancing strengthens our balance sheet by reducing long-term interest costs and improving financial flexibility by extending the debt maturity schedule. The warrant repurchase eliminates a material source of future dilution. Allianz remains a major shareholder of The Hartford, and we appreciate their support. ","We are already beginning to execute on our strategy. By focusing on the Property & Casualty, Group Benefits and Mutual Fund businesses, we will, over time, deliver sustained superior returns and greater shareholder value. In order to achieve these objectives, we are focused on 3 key goals: first, improving margins and ROEs in our go-forward businesses; second, strengthening overall capital generation; and third, reducing the volatility of our earnings and capital. So let me go through each of these in a little more detail. ","Our go-forward businesses have strong ROEs, although there is room for improvement. Combined, we expect them to achieve a 12% to 13% ROE for 2012, and we are hard at work to improve this in 2013 and beyond. To achieve this, we're concentrating on improving margins in Middle Market and Group Benefits and growing the top line in Small Commercial and Mutual Funds. ","In the P&C Commercial segment, our Small Commercial business is a long-standing market leader, with good opportunities for continued profitable growth, particularly as the U.S. economy and small business formation recover. Written premiums were up 8% this quarter with a 91.8% combined ratio. We continue to be a preferred company for small business customers, driven by our long-term record of innovation, ranging from product to technology to service capabilities. ","In Middle Market, Doug Elliot and his team are improving product diversification and pricing, particularly in workers' compensation. I'm especially pleased with the pricing and margin improvements we've achieved over the past 6 months, although that has meant giving up some top line growth. Middle Market's combined ratio, x cats, in prior year was 99.2%, down from last year but still above what we need to achieve acceptable returns. In the first quarter, retention remained strong despite price increases of approximately 10% for the total Middle Market book. ","In Group Benefits, we achieved good rate increases on the first quarter renewals, but earnings are well below the segment's potential. The incidence in termination trends we are seeing are consistent with our competitors and largely due to the high unemployment rate, but we need to do better. With the new Group Benefits management in place, we have initiatives underway in sales, pricing, underwriting and claims. It will take time before the financial benefit of this work falls to the bottom line, particularly on pricing, given the 3-year contract terms in this business. Nevertheless, we like the mortality and morbidity underwriting margins of this business, as well as its long-term growth and return prospects. We have a strong franchise with a top-tier market position and excellent sales and distribution capabilities. With the success of our initiatives and some lift from an improving economy and unemployment trends, we believe that Group Benefits will once again achieve sustained superior returns.","The principal goal for Consumer Markets has been to improve margins, and Andy Napoli and his team have made great progress. The current year combined ratio, x cats, is improving year-over-year for 4 of the last 5 quarters, and we are increasing rates in homeowners to reflect high-cat and non-cat weather experience. With better margins, Consumer Markets is now striving for top line growth through both increasing retention and new business growth. We're doing well in both of these metrics. Retention has improved as a result of customer outreach and pricing initiatives, while new business levels have improved strongly. New business growth was favorable for the third quarter in a row and has now returned to acceptable levels. This success was due to improved response and conversion rates, as well as to our award-winning customer service. This week, J.D. Power and Associates announced that The Hartford was ranked highest in customer satisfaction with the auto insurance shopping experience, an important accomplishment for our Consumer Markets team and for our customers. ","In Mutual Funds, we are confident that going forward, we are well positioned to generate good growth in this high-return business. We are moving quickly to leverage our expanded relationship with Wellington. We want to transition all of the fixed income investment management to Wellington by the end of June, and we expect that the second half of the year will produce significant improvement in net flows. ","Improving margins and ROEs also requires us to remain focused on continued expense efficiency across the entire organization. After reducing expenses by $150 million in 2011, we took out another $30 million in the first quarter. We are continuing to execute on the efficiency objectives we established last year. In addition, we recently established a dedicated business transformation process to ensure that we remove all costs associated with the 3 businesses being sold and that corporate overhead and other shared service expenses are rightsized for the go-forward Hartford businesses. ","Our second goal for creating sustained superior performance is improving capital generation. Our go-forward businesses have historically been strong capital generators, but the Runoff businesses and Individual Life and Retirement Plans have not. As a result, our Life statutory capital generation has been constrained over the past several years. Statutory capital requirements in the Life company should decline over time, with the sale of the 3 Life businesses and the reduction of the Runoff book through lapses or management actions. The statutory earnings power of the P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds businesses will grow in the future.  Combined, we expect our total capital generation going forward to be stronger than what it has been in the last few years. ","Finally, a third goal is to significantly reduce the sensitivity of our capital and earnings to financial markets risks. Our go-forward businesses are less sensitive to changes in the capital markets. Of course, we're focused on reducing the size of the variable annuity block, which is the primary source of our current market volatility. Some of this will occur naturally over time through policyholder lapses and withdrawals. But in addition, we will be prepared to take advantage of potential opportunities to isolate or separate the Runoff block that are both feasible from a regulatory perspective and create shareholder value. Through these efforts, we will ultimately free up capital from our divestitures and Runoff businesses, and we will be able to redeploy in our go-forward businesses and return to shareholders. And over time, The Hartford's financial profile will evolve into more of a property and casualty company, with strong returns and capital generation and limited sensitivity to capital market volatility.","This was a strong quarter for The Hartford. We had good financial results, favorable momentum in many of our go-forward businesses and have successful debt refinancing and warrant repurchase. The sales processes are going well, and with our sharper strategic focus, I am confident that we are on the right path to generate sustained superior returns and create greater shareholder value going forward. I and the rest of the team are very optimistic and excited about our future. ","I'll now turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher John Swift","Thank you, Liam. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 5. First quarter core earnings were $612 million or $1.25 per diluted share, representing an 11% improvement over prior year. Excluding the $192 million DAC unlock, core earnings were $420 million or $0.86 per diluted share, so it's a 7% increase compared to prior year. These results were largely in line with the estimate we provided on March 21, except for catastrophes. Cats were running about $20 million favorable to budget through mid-March. But with the late March storm activity, total cats ended the quarter at $46 million after tax, in line with our budget. Prior-year development was slightly favorable at $19 million after tax, with releases in personal lines offset by some modest development in P&C Commercial. ","The investment portfolio yield was stable this quarter at 4.2%, excluding partnerships. We are modestly increasing allocations to higher-yield assets and purchasing longer-duration bonds. Returns on alternatives and limited partnerships were 8%, and we continue to expect an annualized return of 9% for 2012. Impairments and changes to the mortgage loan loss reserve remained low at $28 million pretax in the quarter. ","Slide 6 shows book value per diluted common share on a restated basis for the new DAC accounting standard. At the end of the first quarter, book value per diluted share was $43.25, an increase of 12% over last year. Excluding AOCI, book value per diluted share rose by 1% to $40.55. ","Let's turn to our business results by segment.  Slide 7 shows the summary results for P&C Commercial. Core earnings were $162 million, a decline of 8% from prior year. Results included $13 million, after tax, of prior-year net reserve strengthening across multiple lines. Importantly, there were no meaningful reserve adjustments related to our workers' compensation loss experience. The combined ratio, x cat, x prior year, was 96.4%. We expect this to improve as written price increases earn in over the remainder of 2012. ","We continue to see strong price momentum in P&C Commercial. In the first quarter, we achieved renewal price increases of 7%, the highest level since the fourth quarter of 2003. We're especially pleased with renewal price trends in Middle Market workers' compensation, where first quarter price increases were up 14%. Policy count retention remained strong at 83% for standard commercial. This metric is clearly influenced by the large number of Small Commercial policies. If you look at retention on a premium weighted basis, over the past year, Small Commercial retention has been flat, while Middle Market retention has declined. This retention decline has been more than offset by improved pricing. We are very pleased with this trade-off as this will lead to continued margin expansion and ROE improvement. ","Shifting to Group Benefits, core earnings of $5 million remain well below our expectations. The loss ratio of 83% reflected elevated disability incidence and the lack of improvement in termination trends. We're addressing these disappointing results in 2 ways. First, we continue to take rate actions on accounts that are not meeting profitability targets. As Liam mentioned, it will take some time to get the profitability of the book to targeted levels, given the multiyear nature of the rate guarantees. Given our rate actions and the very competitive marketplace, persistency declined in the first quarter -- on first quarter renewals to 66% from 72% in the prior year. Ongoing sales are down 7%, primarily driven by a 21% decline in group disability sales. Group life sales increased 5% from the prior year. ","Second, we are reviewing all operational processes to identify ways to improve profitability. We recently appointed a new leader for this segment, Mike Concannon. Mike's property and casualty background brings a fresh perspective for potential improvement opportunities in many operational areas, like underwriting, pricing and claims management.","Turning to Slide 9, Consumer Markets reported first quarter core earnings of $102 million, down $9 million from prior year. Andy Napoli and his team are successfully executing on the strategy for this business. The combined ratio and retention improved, and new business production was strong. First quarter combined ratio, excluding cats and prior-year development, was 88.8%, a slight improvement from last year's 89.0%. We continue to manage our rate increases appropriately, with a 6% renewal written price increase in homeowners and 4% in auto. Like the rest of the personal lines industry, our homeowners book requires additional rate and underwriting actions to respond to recent weather trends. Overall retention was up 2 points to 84% in auto and 85% in homeowners. While we are pleased with the improvement, we still need another point or 2 in order to reach our targeted levels. New business written premium was up 30% in auto and 32% in home. After declining in the first half of 2011, new business premiums are now back to historic levels. Most of the new business growth is coming from our more profitable channels. For example, written premiums in AARP Agency almost doubled to $27 million from the prior year. We provided additional granularity in our financial supplement on written and earned and premiums by channel, so you can track our progress. ","We're encouraged by these positive results. With improving margins, Consumer Markets is now poised to profitably grow while also improving their ROEs. ","Wealth Management results are summarized in Slide 10. First quarter core earnings, x DAC unlock, were $154 million, 15% lower than prior year. This decrease was largely due to a 7% decline in assets under management primarily from net outflows in Individual Annuities. Individual Annuity core earnings, x DAC unlock, were $96 million, down 11% from prior year. This segment will be reported in the Runoff division next quarter. ","The first quarter annualized lapse rate for the U.S. in-force VA block was about 14%, in line with our expectations. Since our announcement to exit the Individual Annuity businesses, lapses have increased approximately 20% in the U.S. and 4% in Japan. It's too soon to judge whether lapses will remain at these levels, but if they do, it will accelerate the runoff of the VA book. ","Core earnings in Individual Life, x DAC unlock, were $34 million, a decline of $4 million from prior year due to lower alternative investment returns, as well as slightly higher expenses. Individual Life sales were up 13% over prior year and increased across all key distribution channels. ","In the individual Retirement Plans, core earnings were $4 million, down $5 million from the prior year. Spread compression on the general account products continues to weigh on results. Assets under management had a record $57.2 billion, aided by rising equity markets and positive net flows. ","As a result of our planned sales, we have evaluated the goodwill balances for Individual Life and Retirement Plans in the first quarter. No impairment is necessary at this time. However, we will continue to monitor its recoverability. ","Moving to Mutual Funds, core earnings were $20 million, down $7 million from prior year due to lower assets under management. First quarter fund performance improved, particularly in our largest fund, Capital Appreciation Fund. Overall, more than 80% of the funds outperformed their benchmarks. This strong quarterly performance contributed to an increase in non-proprietary fund deposits of 18% on a sequential basis. ","The results of our Runoff division are on Slide 11. Core earnings, x DAC unlock, were $105 million, basically in line with prior year. As Liam discussed, we have a number of initiatives underway to shrink the size and risk of this book. This will allow us to redeploy the capital allocated to this business over time. As you know, rising equity markets, higher interest rates and a weakening yen are all positives for our in-force VA book. The economic value of the VA book is greatly improved as a result of these market conditions. During the quarter, the net amount at risk related to our VA book declined substantially. For example, the NAR related to the U.S. and Japan GMDB business improved $5.3 billion during the quarter. This improvement isn't always evident in our GAAP and statutory accounting results, given the mismatch between the carrying value of the hedge assets and the VA reserves. ","As you can see on Slide 12, that on a GAAP basis, the net change in VA reserves and hedge assets generated a loss of approximately $1.1 billion, which reflects the asymmetrical accounting for our U.S. GMDB and Japan guarantees. On a statutory basis, the decline in the value of the hedge assets exceeded the change in the value of the U.S. VACARVM reserves by $183 million.","It's important to note that our hedge program continues to work as designed. Its primary focus is economic risk, not GAAP accounting results. As the markets change, we will adjust our targets in order to maintain appropriate hedging levels. ","On Slide 13 is our statutory surplus roll-forward. U.S. statutory surplus increased approximately $600 million in the first quarter before dividends. Consistent with our practice, a $200 million dividend was declared from the P&C to the holding company in order to cover interest, dividends and other expenses. The P&C operations generated more than $300 million of statutory operating income and almost $200 million of other positive surplus impacts, including investment-related gains. Life statutory operating income, excluding VA, turned positive this quarter and was approximately $100 million. This was largely offset by the VA hedge-related impacts I mentioned earlier.  In total, the Life operations ended the quarter with a modest increase in statutory surplus. ","As you can see on Slide 14, we ended the quarter with $17.9 billion of capital resources. Holding company resources declined almost $100 million in the quarter, reflecting dividends, interests and share repurchase activity. We expect holding company resources to decline modestly in the second quarter due to this element of the warrant repurchase.","Turning to Slide 15, we were very pleased to complete the Allianz transactions, which were a major step in restructuring the balance sheet and enhancing our financial flexibility. On April 17, we repaid $1.75 billion par value of Allianz junior subordinated debt with the proceeds from the issuance of $1.55 billion of senior notes and $600 million of new junior subordinated debt. This new debt has a blended interest rate of approximately 6% versus the 10% coupon on the Allianz debt. This reduces annual interest paid by $45 million on a pretax basis. As a result, our statutory dividend coverage ratio is improved by almost 0.5 point to 4x. ","In the second quarter, we will take an after-tax charge to net income of approximately $600 million to reflect the premium paid to retire the debt and to write off the related unamortized discount and debt costs. We also purchased all the outstanding Allianz warrants for $300 million. This transaction reduced first quarter book value by $0.61 per diluted share. ","In addition, early in the first quarter, we purchased 2.6 million shares of common stock. To date, we have completed $394 million of the $500 million equity repurchase authorization. We intend to complete the remaining $106 million on a timely basis, taking into consideration market conditions and trading restrictions.","Turning to Slide 16, I wanted to conclude with our outlook for the second quarter. We expect second quarter run rate core earnings to be in a similar range to the first quarter, absent higher loss cost seasonality. In the second quarter, we expect higher cats with a budget of $84 million after tax, which is $0.08 per diluted share, higher than the first quarter, which brings our total estimate to $0.70 to $0.75 per diluted share. This estimate does not include DAC unlocks, prior-year reserve development, restructuring charges related to the Wealth Management division. These restructuring charges, which include retention awards and other expenses, may be up to $20 million or about $0.04 per share. ","Our businesses this quarter performed largely in line with our expectations, with the exception of Group Benefits. We currently expect full year earnings for Group Benefits to be essentially flat with 2011. We expect pricing momentum in the P&C businesses will expand margins in the second half of 2012. Our earnings outlook for Individual Life and Retirement Plans businesses hasn't changed, although we expect sales to be down as a result of our recent announcements. ","Looking forward, the ongoing businesses are executing under 2012 initiatives to grow and increase margins. We look forward to sharing progress with you, and we will provide more information about the P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Fund operations in the quarters to come. In addition, we'll keep you updated on the other operational and strategic actions we may take within our Runoff division. The strength and momentum in our ongoing businesses, combined with the actions we are taking to be a more focused company, will improve the earnings and the ROE profile of The Hartford over time. ","At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Sabra to begin the Q&A session.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you, Chris. We'll now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] ","In addition, I just wanted to make one slight clarification of Chris' comments referring to the Individual Annuity business. Since our announcement to exit the Individual Annuity business, lapses have increased to approximately 20% in the U.S. and 4% in Japan on an annualized basis. Nicole, can you please give the instructions for asking a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Finkelstein with Evercore Partners.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Liam, in your opening remarks, you talked constructively about some alternatives on the VA side, whether it's reinsurance or what have you. Can you expand on those comments? And I guess what I'm interested in is, how would you weigh the probability of success and how meaningful could one of these structures be in terms of capital release?","Liam E. McGee","Well, Mark, it's early, and what I expressed was we have received interest from a variety of parties on different parts of the book and different parts of the block. Our team is working hard evaluating those options, and we do think some of them will materialize over time. But I think it's also important, as I said in my comments as well, Mark, that we'll balance the short-term economics with the ultimate goal of getting them off our books. So it's early in the process. I think we're constructively optimistic with the level of interest that's being presented, the kind of thinking that our teammates are doing on it, with the assistance of advisors in some cases, that some of these transactions will materialize over time.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. I guess my follow-up will just be on the Annuity business as well. I guess we've seen markets go higher, a little bit of interest rate volatility, but I guess what is the opportunity to kind of restrike some of the options and reduce that cost at this stage? Is that a -- do we need markets to go higher from here, or is there opportunity to kind of reduce that long-term cost at this stage?","Liam E. McGee","That's a great question. And I'll make a comment, and I know Chris would like to add something as well. As Chris said in his remarks, we are looking at the hedges. We refer to them as a dynamic hedging program, particularly in Japan. So with the markets having appreciated as they have, particularly equity markets, and although it's backed up a little bit, the yen weakening, offset by lower interest rates, I would tell you we evaluate our hedging levels on a daily basis, led by our HIMCO teammates and our Chief Risk Officer, Bob Rupp, now in conjunction with our Runoff group. So we look at it every single day. And there may be opportunities because of strengthening market levels to reduce it. And Chris, other things you might say?","Christopher John Swift","I think it's exactly right. Mark, we're very sensitive on the economic cost side. So particularly, as markets reach 1,400, 1,450 on the S&P and beyond, there are definitely opportunities to be much more cost-effective. So I think you should take away that we're working hard to appropriately balance risk and economics, like we have always said.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel with Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I have a question on the VA business as well. In the U.S., in particular, but in Japan as well, your net amount at risk and the in-the-moneyness, if I focus on the living benefit guarantees, came down very nicely quarter-over-quarter. My question is for the U.S., can you give us a guesstimate on about how much higher do you think markets need to move for that level of in-the-moneyness to essentially be wiped out or moved to 0?","Christopher John Swift","John, thanks for the question. In the U.S., if you look at sort of the cohorts of when we put a lot of business on the books '05, '06, '07, '08, we were approaching that level just by the nature of the disclosure that we made. So to me, when you get into the 1,400, 1,500 levels, 1,500, I think you'd be virtually at breakeven from the moneyness perspective.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the Japan side, I assume -- is that going to be -- should we be looking more at that being influenced more by the yen than necessarily market levels?","Christopher John Swift","Yes, I've always said about 50% of sort of just the risk comes from yen-dollar, yen-euro.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then just a separate question is -- I'm interested in the move up that you mentioned in the annualized surrender rate on the U.S. VA book. Obviously, one month doesn't necessarily make a trend. But I was wondering if you have any granularity on the composition of that higher surrender rate. Specifically, what proportion of those lapses reflected contracts where the living benefit guarantee was in the money? Has that changed? I think historically, you've mentioned around 40% of lapses were in the money.","David N. Levenson","So John, it's Dave Levenson. So for April, as you know, we've been --  we were running at 20% annualized lapse rate. As we look at the weekly numbers, that has been pretty consistent. So we've seen it maybe moderate slightly. I think over time, we'll have a much better read on that. As far as lapses in the money versus out of the money, your 40% to 50% number is right on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman with UBS.","Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First question, just around the group guidance had been for a benefits ratio of around 77%, 80%. Of course, you came in at about 83%, and I know the pricing takes time. So what should we be thinking about in terms of the guidance going forward? And then the second question would be around the -- with all the restructuring and changes going on, some people have suggested that maybe it might not be a bad idea to IPO part of the P&C business, maybe a minority interest, 15%, 20%. Is that something you've thought about? Would that make some sense?","Douglas G. Elliot","Andrew, let me -- this is Doug. Let me take the second part of the question on the Group Benefit. Number one, there are macroeconomic headwinds across that business. But we are encouraged, and I think there are some reasons for optimism across our Group Benefit business as we work our way through Q1 into Q2. Clearly, our incidence level look like they're flattening. We look like we, on the long-term side, have some flattening signals over the past 5 quarters. In the short-term area, it looks like we've got some improvement on our incident trends, so that's a positive. Clearly, as we've talked in the past, our terminations are down and running lower than our historical run rate. We are working all the levers available to us. We have additional disclosure for the quarter in there. We achieved 4 points of rate increase, which is why we were slightly down in retention, but I think that's a good trade. And our overall price improvement in the book for the first quarter was about 10%. So I feel like we're making significant strides toward improving our margin, and overall, I'm also encouraged by what I would say is an improving pricing climate in disability.","Christopher John Swift","Hey, Andrew, it's Chris. I think you...","Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","One quick second, Doug, though. So therefore, you think you could achieve guidance for the year or the original guidance?","Douglas G. Elliot","I think Chris gave you the adjusted guidance.","Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I'm sorry, I missed that.","Christopher John Swift","Yes, Andrew, what I was trying to be clear in my prepared remarks is that we really see group now just basically flat to prior year. When we were with you in December, we saw group hopefully improving earnings 15%, 16%, 17%, high teens. I would consider that business now just sort of flat with prior year.","Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it.","Liam E. McGee","Andrew, this is Liam. And as far as your question about possible other structures for the company, I'll just remind you what I've said consistently that management and the board, since the middle of last year, looked comprehensively at virtually every alternative. We've chosen a path, and that's the path we're going to execute against.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Liam, you had talked about the sales process going well. Can you just give a little bit of color on that? Because in my mind, the greatest risk here is while there may be buyers lined up, if the bid is 50% of book value or some very low amount, then it may be a decision of deciding not to sell some of the properties that you've put up for sale. But your comments certainly seem to indicate that you're comfortable with the way things are progressing. So maybe you can talk a little bit about just the process and whether you've gotten any price indications yet and whether you're comfortable with those.","Liam E. McGee","Well, Tom, we are confident that we will sell the businesses at an appropriate value. You can appreciate where we are in the process with just the process itself that -- I'm not going to get into too much detail. But I think based on the volume of parties that are interested in each of the 3 properties, both objective and subjective feedback that we're getting from the market, we feel pretty confident we're going to sell these businesses and have definitive agreements certainly in the latter part of this year.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just one follow-up. I guess it would be for Chris. When you guys talk about potentially freeing up capital from the closed block, should we think about it being a normal process, where you first need to sell these businesses and then the proceeds would give you more flexibility to consider solutions? So in other words, should we think about the freeing up of capital being a 2013 or 2014 event? Can you help a little bit about tying those 2 things together?","Liam E. McGee","Well, Tom, let me just make a high level comment first, and I know Chris is anxious to give his own perspective as well. When you look at the actions that we're taking, first of all, we will not be selling new life products, which, in general, have been capital-consumptive; secondly, selling the businesses, which will create proceeds and subsequently, some capital release as well from those businesses. The natural lapsing -- and if the elevated lapse rates continues, so the better. And then any actions that were effective in our runoff business -- this is a company that, over the next couple of years, should liberate capital. We're more confident in the strength of our balance sheet, and to be more specific than that, now would be premature obviously. There's timing, market levels, et cetera, but I think we position the company as we execute effectively, and we're focused on -- laser-focused on execution, on the things that we've described. And over time, we will liberate capital, and we'll have a variety of choices as what to do with it. And of course, our primary guiding principle will be to the benefit of the shareholder. Chris?","Christopher John Swift","I think that you're right on. There's nothing other to add, Tom, other than, again, if you look at sort of the sequence of events and timing in different constituencies that we want to bring along with our plans, whether it be regulators, agencies, and how we would use, I'll call it, the incremental value that we monetize and the capital that's backing those blocks, we know how to work with those constituencies to bring them along, to make sure everyone understands what they're trying to accomplish and what we're going to do with that deployable capital at the time. But as Liam said, we'd rather not just speculate right now on size, timing and amounts just given that there's a lot of variables outside of our control right now. But I think my view is we're going to have a good competitive option on these properties.","Liam E. McGee","Certainly, Tom, we have certainty and clarity about our direction. And along with creating superior financial performance, a big part of generating superior shareholder performance will be over the next periods of time, and we have very specific actions. We've articulated them, I think, very clearly. We need to execute on them. We understand very clearly that, over time, those activities will result in capital that we'll be able to deploy in, as Chris says, appropriately, in consultation with our normal constituents, which I think we've demonstrated our ability to effectively do in the steps we've taken in the past couple of years. I think this is a company that will definitely do that, and I think we've made the decisions to position us to do that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Hall with Wells Fargo Securities.","John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I have 2 questions around capital. And not to be repetitive here, on the VA book of business, I think initially, when you talked about it potentially being put into Runoff, you didn't see capital being freed up. Lapse rates are substantially higher now. Does that change the view there about the speed of capital return from that book?","Liam E. McGee","Chris will give you an answer on that, John.","Christopher John Swift","John, directionally, yes. I think we view net lapses as positive from a capital side. As long as they're balanced and steady, net-net, it's positive because we just have to hold less capital against the liabilities, particularly in stress scenarios.","John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Great. And then my second question has to do with the Mutual Fund operation and I guess where it's held within the enterprise. Being owned by a life insurance company, I guess, constrains your ability to use the cash that it generates. In everything that you're doing about moving things around and the like, are you considering trying to transfer the ownership out from the life company to a holding company that wouldn't be insurance regulatory-constrained?","Christopher John Swift","John, I think that one of our work streams that we have is just the, we called it, legal entity simplification process, and that's part of it. But I wouldn't view it necessarily as a constraint. It's more potentially simplifying sort of a holding company structure. But just because Mutual Funds is owned by a life group right now, I wouldn't have you necessarily think of any extraordinary restraints or conditions on that entity, its use of proceeds and cash flows that we would generate from it. But we are looking at just the overall simplification of the legal entity structure.","Liam E. McGee","Yes, I agree with, John, with everything Chris said, particularly as it relates to Mutual Fund business. But I'd reiterate we will simplify the legal structure of the company, and that body of work is underway. If it has such a benefit, so be it. But we're really trying to simplify the company and its legal structure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vincent DeAugustino with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Vincent M. DeAugustino - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just 2 quick questions. On commercial auto, it looked like there was some adverse development that ran a little bit higher than recent quarter's trends. I was just curious of your thoughts on, I guess, what you're seeing is driving that and then specifically, if there's any particular accident years that, that's flowing from?","Douglas G. Elliot","Vincent, this is Doug. I would characterize the $12 million as rather insignificant against the entire period. A little bit of pressure with the last couple accident years, '09, '10, '11, primarily '11, and primarily in Small Commercial. So there's nothing there that I think is systemic. I think we're all over the issues.","Vincent M. DeAugustino - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just a real quick follow-up. Since reporting your strategic restructuring plans, were there any segments that are maybe facing incremental headwinds as a result of the changes you're putting in place? Or is everything outside of the units potentially up for sale going as planned and no kind of cross headwinds there?","Liam E. McGee","No, not at all. I think as our results indicated, Vincent, our Property & Casualty businesses are really performing very well, top line growth in Small Commercial and in Consumer and after margin improvement in Consumer. I think Doug and his team,, as you saw in the pricing actions, are making the right trade-off between getting price and the persistency rate there. Obviously, like everyone else in the industry, there are some challenges in Group Benefits, but that has nothing to do with our announcements. And finally, I think Mutual Funds, we could not be more excited about the prospects of that. And the feedback we get from the distributors is they're pretty excited about it, too. The unique combination of The Hartford and the Wellington's sub-advisory, cross-equity and fixed income is really, really creating, I think, a very positive reception. So I'd say if anything, other than just the systemic and macroeconomic issues around Group Benefits, the go-forward businesses are firing at all cylinders.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Schuman with KBW.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","A kind of a mundane question but a necessary one, I guess. With all of the unusual levels of corporate activity, it seemed like corporate expenses were a little higher this quarter. Can you give us a sense of kind of where those expenses might go directionally from here?","Liam E. McGee","Down.","Christopher John Swift","Jeff, it's Chris. I would tend to think in terms of the corporate level of expenses, this quarter is maybe $15 million to $20 million higher than sort of the normalized run rate. We had some just accrual adjustments coming out of year end and a little bit of restructuring charges. I think going forward, we plan to break that out as clear as possible as far as restructuring expenses, whether it be severance benefits, whether it be stay bonuses, things along those lines. But I think from a model perspective, you ought to think this quarter is $15 million to $20 million higher than a normal run rate.","Liam E. McGee","Yes, and Jeff, my one-word answer was meant to convey this management team's determination to run this company in, I think, a financial services environment that requires it as efficiently as possible. As I said in my remarks, and I want our investors to understand it, about The Hartford management team, there was $150 million of efficiencies realized last year, $30 million in the first quarter. We're going to stay focused on the efficiency and process improvement actions through the balance of 2012. Obviously, we will get the expenses as we sell the businesses. All expenses, whether they're solid or dotted line, are going to come out. And then we think we have a very unique opportunity, truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, for the go-forward business to really reinvent how we do things at The Hartford and better and more efficient. So you'll hear more consistently more from us on our process improvement and efficiency. And I think we've demonstrated our ability to do that on the old construct of The Hartford. We'll continue that and even with greater urgency because we do believe we have a unique opportunity here.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you. Thank you all for joining us this morning.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] ","Sabra Purtill, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Sabra Purtill","Good morning and thank you for joining us today. We reported first quarter 2019 yesterday afternoon and posted all the earnings related materials including the 10-Q on our website. For those of you joining us live we appreciate your finding time for us on such a busy morning for earnings calls. Please note that we reported results a bit later than usual and expectation of having closed the Navigators acquisition by now. We also expect that post acquisition our earnings releases will be about a week later than on previous schedule as we complete all the financial reporting integration work which we will launch after closing.","As per our usual practice we will announce our second quarter earnings release date in early July. Before introducing the speakers I wanted to draw your attention to two recent 8K filings. First, yesterday morning, Navigators filed an 8K announcing that the outside date for the acquisition has been automatically extended from May 01, to July 01, in accordance with the terms of our merger agreement which permit an extension for the regulatory approval process.","The only approval we have yet to receive is from the New York Department of Financial Services and as noted in the 8-K they have been provided with all of the requested materials and information. There will be a public filing via 8-K when we receive that approval and the acquisition will close five business days after that. We would note that as a result of SEC filing requirements, even if we were to close the acquisition before May 10, Navigators will still be required to file a Form 10-Q for the first quarter financial results.","Second, this morning we announced that Stephen McGill has resigned from our Board effective today as a result of the announcement that he, along with other experienced executives have launched a new insurance brokerage firm, McGill and partners. Mr. McGill's resignation does not arise from any disagreement on any matter relating to the company's strategy, operations, policies or practices. We appreciate and thank him for his service on our board.","For the call today, our speakers are Chris Swift, Chairman and CEO of The Hartford; Doug Elliot, President; and Beth Bombara Costello, the Chief Financial Officer.

Replays of this webcast and an official transcript will be available on The Hartford's website for one year.","I'll now turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Swift","Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Yesterday we reported first quarter core earnings of $507 million up 10% over first quarter 2018. Core earnings were $1.39 per diluted share. First quarter results were strong and all the Hartford's businesses performed well making meaningful contributions to financial results and progress toward the achievement of our strategic goals. Our core earnings ROE which is calculated on a trailing 12-month basis was 11.5%, a very strong result considering the significant level of catastrophe losses in 2018.","Our annualized core earnings ROE was 13.9% for the quarter. Book value excluding AOCI rose 11% over last year to $40.79 per diluted share for total shareholder value creation of 14% including dividends. I am pleased by the growth momentum building in our segments. Commercial lines written premiums rose 5% over the prior year despite Workers' Compensation pricing headwinds. Personal lines and Group Benefits both had strong sales in the quarter and the Hartford Funds net flows were positive.","Doug and Beth will cover segment results in more detail, but I wanted to highlight a few data points that illustrate the earnings power and financial strength of our franchise. Commercial lines underlying combined ratio was 92.7 in the quarter, clearly among the best in the market, while up from the prior year, it was consistent with our expectations, although loss severity in property Marine was higher than average.","The expense ratio increased also consistent with our expectations due to planned investments to make us an easier company to do business with including our multiyear strategic initiatives focused on driving long-term efficiency and enhanced capabilities such as a rebuilt agency portal which enables more digital interfaces with our distribution partners.","With personal lines margins much improved after recent pricing and underwriting actions, our key objective is to return to topline growth through a combination of sales and enhanced retention focused on AARP members. Our AARP partnership now in its 35th year is the cornerstone of our personal lines business. I am very pleased with the sales this quarter which were up 57% resulting from expanded marketing efforts over the last year and a half.","Margins also improved. The accident year loss ratio before Cats dropped 3.3 points improving for both auto and home although substantially offset by the impact of planned marketing initiatives on the expense ratio. Group Benefits continues to deliver strong results in 18 months after closing the acquisition operational performance is proceeding extremely well. Core earnings were up 44% to $122 million which included the impact of favorable disability trends.","The acquisition related integration activities remain on track and we have exceeded expense and sales targets by a good margin with persistency in line with expectations. Hartford Funds had a solid quarter. Core earnings were down from prior year because of the impact of overall market performance in the fourth quarter but were in line with our expectations. Other operational metrics were quite favorable with positive net flows and continued excellent investment performance relative to peers.","Another area of significant focus this quarter was the pending acquisition of Navigators. The go to market leadership structure was announced earlier this year and the teams are well prepared to hit the ground running when the deal closes. We continue to hear very positive feedback from agents and brokers and look forward to introducing the combined teams and expanded product offerings to our top distribution partners at our annual summit meeting later this month. We are very excited about the potential of bringing the two organizations together. Near-term we are focused on achieving a timely and effective alignment of the underwriting teams which will strengthen the commercial lines' presence. In addition, we are confident that we will achieve our long-term financial objectives through a combination of improved underwriting margins, higher investment returns, higher revenue growth, and expense savings.","Hartford's overall strategy is straightforward and unchanged. First, we remain focused on achieving the full potential of our product abilities and underwriting expertise with a particular focus on the integration of the acquisitions. Second, we continue to invest for the future to become an easier company to do business with including in investments in technology, data, analytics and digital capabilities that improve the experience we deliver to distribution partners and customers.","Third, long-term success depends on the continued ability to attract, retain, and develop top talent. We have top decile employee engagement scores which recognize our commitment to providing attractive career opportunities in a diverse and inclusive workplace and we are proud to be recognized for our ethical culture that's recognized by [indiscernible] for the 11th time.","Our financial goals to drive long-term shareholder value creation are also unchanged. First, to profitably grow our businesses while generating strong returns well in excess of our cost of equity capital. Second, to deploy excess capital acreatively in our businesses or through capital management actions, and finally to grow book value and dividends per common share over time. How we achieve these goals is also important.","Every day we support our policyholders, agents, employees and communities by protecting their incomes, families and businesses in making sustainable and positive contributions to society including support of organizations like Junior Achievement, the Boys and Girls Club, the City of Hartford and our support of programs to address drug addiction.","To conclude, first quarter results were strong with all business segments performing well. Our balance sheet and capital generation remain robust. I am very pleased with the first quarter results, both financially and operationally and look forward to building on our achievements during the remainder of 2019 and beyond.","Now I'll turn the call over to Doug.","Doug Elliot","Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. This was a solid quarter for Property and Casualty and Group Benefits. Our financial results were led by outstanding earnings in Group Benefits primarily driven by favorable trends in disability. The combined core earnings of P&C and Group Benefits were above our expectations and in line with last year, as each of our business units continued to execute effectively.","Let me get right into our business results. Commercial Lines first quarter combined ratio was 96.1 increasing 2.8 points versus 2018. The underlying combined ratio which excludes catastrophes and prior-year development was 92.7 increasing 2.3 points from 2018. The deterioration was primarily due to compression in Workers' Compensation margins and higher expenses, both as expected. We also experienced higher non-catastrophe property losses which can fluctuate from quarter to quarter.","For the quarter where no written pricing in standard commercial lines was 1.7% consistent with fourth-quarter 2018; however, March pricing excluding Workers' Comp showed an encouraging improvement over January and February. Commercial auto pricing continues to lead the way with nearly double-digit gains. Property and General Liability are in the low to mid single-digit range.","Workers' Compensation remains competitive and margin pressure continues as the NCCI and other state bureaus submit negative loss costs filings. Our Workers' Compensation margins remain healthy and give us a strong foundation for competing in the marketplace. The uptick in frequency we observed early last year had begun to flatten by the fourth quarter with another 90 days of data trends continue to look favorable and we are confident in our 2018 and 2019 accident year loss ratio selections.","Let me sure a few more details on our commercial businesses beginning with small commercial which had another very strong quarter posting an underlying combined ratio of 89.1. Written premium grew 4% with $185 million of new business and strong retention. As we continue to successfully convert business from the foremost renewal rights deal.","Middle market had a difficult property quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 96.7 increasing 4.5 points from first quarter 2018. This is mainly due to adverse volatility and non-catastrophe property lines including inland marine which experienced several fires on large construction projects. We also had margin compression in Workers' Compensation as expected.","Expenses increased driven by commissions and increased investment in technology and operations partially offset by reductions in taxes licenses and fees. Written premium increased 7% based on solid retentions and new business production of $143 million, in addition to strong performance across all lines of business in our core book we continue to see favorable contributions from our teams in energy and marine.","In specialty commercial, the underlying combined ratio of 96.2 improved 1.3 points driven by reductions in taxes, licenses, and fees, partially offset by higher underwriting expenses. Strong written premium growth of 10% was primarily driven by bond and financial products.","Shifting over to personal lines, we're pleased with our performance producing an underlying combined ratio of 89.1 improving 7\/10 of a point from a year ago. In first lines auto the underlying combined ratio was 93.6, six times of employment better than 2018. Loss cost trends remain within our expectations with continued negative frequencies and severity in the low to mid single digit range.","New business for AARP direct to auto grew 57% for the quarter. Our higher marketing spend is delivering the expected increases in responses. Our conversion ratio has also improved driven by more competitive pricing and continuous enhancements to the sales experience. Given our improved rate adequacy, projected retentions and cost per conversion, we are pleased with the profit profile of this business. Our product, process, and pricing adjustments will continue throughout 2019 and I expect further progress in our conversion rate and new business growth.","Shifting over to Group Benefits, core earnings for the first quarter was $122 million with a margin of 8%, a terrific quarter. The increase versus prior year was driven by favorable disability results, lower amortization of intangibles and reductions in taxes, licenses, and fees, offset by slightly elevated mortality in our life book of business. The lower disability loss ratio reflects favorable incidence and recovery trends across recent accident years consistent with our experience over the last several quarters.","Persistency on our combined employer group block of business was steady at approximately 90%. Fully insured ongoing sales were $407 million. Overall it was another strong sales quarter across market segments and product lines with continued momentum in our voluntary product offerings. The acquisition of Aetna's Group life and disability businesses well entered the second year and we remain focused on completing all phases of the integration. Conversion of middle market and large case customers to our market-leading ability advantage claims platform has commenced and will continue into 2020.","In closing, this was another solid quarter with Group Benefits continuing to deliver excellent results in the property and casually in line with our expectations for the year. We are looking forward to closing on the Navigators deal and being able to put our integration plans into action. We have been preparing to hit the ground running on day one as a combined organization with broad capabilities and deep underwriting expertise.","Our combined commercial insurance solutions will be focused primarily in three areas. First, our world-class small commercial business will continue to deliver market leading products and services to the small business market and will benefit from the specialized capabilities of Navigators, particularly in the professional liability product area. Second, our middle and large commercial business will have expanded capabilities primarily adding liability products such as environmental life science and umbrella to our existing package and Workers' Compensation capabilities.","And third, our global specialty business will have the breadth, expertise and scale to compete in the wholesale surety financial products and marine markets. Also our reinsurance and international capabilities will add to this product array. I know that I speak for my teammates when I say we are very excited about our future. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the quarters ahead.","Let me now turn the call over to Beth.","Beth Bombara","Thank you, Doug.","I'm going to cover results for the investment portfolio, Hartford Funds and corporate, and provide an update on balance sheet items and holding company resources. The investment portfolio continues to perform very well with low impairments, strong LP returns, and generally stable investment yields. Net investment income was $470 million for the quarter up 4% from the prior year quarter and impairments were $2 million before tax. Limited partnerships generated a 13% annualized return for the quarter, about double our outlook assumption but down from 19% in first quarter 2018.","Real Estate Funds posted very strong performance up significantly from first quarter 2018, but relatively consistent with the fourth quarter. Private equity investment returns were also strong, but down from exceptionally high returns in the first quarter of last year. The annualized portfolio yield was 4.1% before tax and 3.4% after-tax down slightly from first quarter 2018 due to the lower returns on LPs.","Excluding LPs the first quarter 2019 annualized portfolio yield was 3.7% before tax, flat with the prior year and up slightly to 3.1% on an after-tax basis. Lower interest rates in the quarter impacted net unrealized gains on fixed maturities which rose significantly from year-end to $703 million after-tax. Strong equity market performance also generated unrealized gains of $126 million after-tax which are included in net income.","Turning to Hartford Funds, core earnings of $28 million were down from $34 million last year primarily due to lower investment fee revenue as a result of lower average AUM. Although AUM was up 2% from the prior year and first quarter market performance was very strong, daily average AUM was down 4% from the prior year first quarter due to the impact of the year-end market levels. Other quarterly performance metrics were favorable with net positive flows of $874 million and very good investment performance. As of March 31st, 70% of Hartford Funds have outperformed peers on a five-year basis.","Corporate core loss of $15 million improved by $51 million from first quarter 2018. Corporate has been more volatile the last few quarters, so we have provided a table in the slides that breaks down the key components of corporate results. The principal driver of the improvement this quarter was $22 million of net income from Hopmeadow Holdings, a holding company that purchased our former Talcott subsidiary, compared to $6 million in fourth quarter 2018 and zero in the first quarter 2018.","Due to fourth quarter capital markets decline, Talcott had fairly large unrealized gains on hedges resulting in significantly higher net income all of which is included in core earnings. A second impact in corporate is net investment income earned on cash and short-term investments which are at high level due to funds held at the holding company for the Navigators purchase. Upon closing of the acquisition, holding company resources will decrease about $2.2 billion which will reduce net investment income from the first quarter run rate.","Finally, interest in preferred dividends were $56 million after-tax down from $63 million in first quarter 2018 reflecting both the net reduction in debt and the issuance of preferred stock over the past 12 months. As a reminder, interest expense will increase slightly after closing due to Navigators senior notes which had $15 million of annual interest expense. In total first quarter core earnings were $1.39 per diluted share up 9% from first quarter 2018 due to higher core earnings from Group Benefits and better corporate results.","Turning to the balance sheet, book value per diluted share of $38.36 grew 9% from December 31 due to net income and increases in net unrealized gains on fixed maturities. Our net income ROE was 13.5% which is based on a 12-month trailing net income and therefore includes the impact of the high catastrophe losses in the second half of 2018. Book value per diluted share excluding AOCI was $40.79 up 4% and the core earnings ROE was 11.5% which also uses 12-month trailing earnings.","Our debt leverage ratios improved this quarter with a debt to capital ratio excluding AOCI of 21.9% at March 31, down about 6 points from a year ago due to net debt reduction and growth in stock-holders equity. Our rating agency debt to total capital ratio of 25.7% was at the high-end of our targeted range. After the Navigators acquisition these ratios will increase slightly due to the assumed debt, but we expect to be back in line with our targeted range by mid-2020 due to the combination of repayment of $500 million of senior notes in March 2020 and increases in stockholder equity from earnings over the period.","At March 31, holding company resources totaled $2.9 billion. At closing holding company resources will decreased by $2.2 billion for the purchase price and related expenses with the remaining balance of approximately $700 million roughly in line with our liquidity target of 12 months forward interest and dividends. Futures subsidiary dividends and tax receipts will provide the funds for our share repurchase plan which we expect to begin in the second quarter. We plan to use the $1 billion repurchase authorization with discretion and continue to expect that the majority of the program will be used in 2020.","Before closing I wanted to update you on the Navigators acquisition. The regulatory approval process is nearing completion and we are expecting final approval soon. As announced yesterday upon closing we will enter into an adverse development cover with National Indemnity which will provide greater certainty about the impact of the Hartford from any potential loss development on Navigators reserves. We will pay approximately $91 million for $300 million of coverage and an attachment point that is $100 million above Navigators' December 31, 2018 carried reserves subject to the cover.","The premium for the cover will be recognized upon closing in net income but not in core earnings. After closing we will update and complete our review of Navigators' reserves consistent with our indication in August that we would make adjustments to reflect our views. We intend to complete this in-depth review within 30 to 45 days of closing as we want to review the most current information on exposures and claims.","As a reminder, beginning in the second quarter, the lines of business in commercial lines will change, which primarily impacts middle market and specialty commercial. The three businesses in commercial lines will be small commercial, middle and large commercial and global specialty. We will provide historical restatements of our operating metrics for these businesses.","To summarize, with all of our businesses performing well, we have a strong start to the year. Our goals remain consistent to maintain and improve where possible strong margins and topline growth and to achieve a timely and effective combination of our commercial lines of business with Navigators.","I'll now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you, Beth. We have about 30 minutes for questions. Amy, can you please repeat the instructions for asking the question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse, your line is open.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the adverse development cover that you guys had announced last night with Navigators. Beth, in your remarks you said that you guys have been due to the in-depth review of the reserves which you've told us about before, after the transaction closes, so I'm just trying to get a sense of how you guys came up with $300 million as being the right level for the cover that you bought with Berkshire?","Chris Swift","Elyse, it's Chris. Let me just start and then I will ask Beth to add her additional color. So I think we've been pretty consistent since we announced the transaction that we always plan to apply our views and methodologies and practices to establishing a conclusion regarding ultimate losses that needed to be carried on Navigators balance sheet that was known and part of our transaction. So, ultimately as we got into it, we decided that we wanted greater certainty regarding the outcome on their loss development and obviously negotiated a deal with [indiscernible] that I think accomplishes that call. So, that philosophically was the approach and how we came up with it. But Beth, would you add anything additional?","Beth Bombara","No I think that summarizes it very nicely. As Chris indicated, this was an area that we have been focused on and thought it appropriate to look into the market to see what type of protection might be available and as we look at the terms that were provided in our discussions we found them to be attractive and put the protection in place which again we believe just provides greater certainty on what the impact could be to the Hartford.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, thanks. And then my second question on, within commercial is it possible you guys said in the prepared remarks that we got better outside of comp in March, do you have an outlook as we can think about and I know it's broad-based depending upon mine, just what price you might see within commercial for the balance of the year and what you are really seeing in loss trend kind of away from comp? And then also if you could just quantify the level of non-cash property and marine losses in the quarter, that would be great? Thank you.","Doug Elliot","Elyse, good morning. Let me take the individual pieces and do my best with them. Again I would remind you the segments we play in as a core here at the Hartford rights our book is largely middle and small commercial where we probably won't see all of the amplitude that I think some of the specialty markets are feeling, but we are encouraged by what we saw toward the end of the first quarter on a noncompliance moving up into the mid single digit range as I commented on it depends upon line we still see some firming in auto for sure, but we're encouraged by what we're seeing in property and GL [ph], particularly Cat exposed property, wind areas, and other parts of the country. So, I expect that momentum to continue.","Do I think it's going to be 15 or 20 someday? No I think that's outside the boundaries of where we compete, but I do think we'll see continued momentum because as you know particularly in the property side we've had rather disappointing initial results and we need to address that issue both with product and pricing. So that's how I think we're going to march quarter-by-quarter and we'll look at our book and we'll think about our risks and do a risk by risk pricing evaluation.","Relative to loss trend, I would say that 90 days and or 120 days and thereabout where we thought they would be for 2019, Workers' Comp has settled in nicely, so we're pleased about what we see in frequency, the severity around medical and wages about where we expected to be, property and liability similar and auto is something that we're still working hard at improving our book. We're not at all satisfied with our book performance. So, very few surprises on the exposure front from my perspective. Beth, do you want to add anything over the top?","Beth Bombara","Yes, I mean we did obviously call out in middle market that we did have some elevated non-Cat property losses and that definitely had more of an impact on the middle market combined ratios. When you kind of pull that through the total commercial lines it is probably about a point of what we saw sort of in the year-over-year compare. So I think that provides I think the question that you had on sort of what we were seeing in there.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner with B. Riley FBR. Randy, your line is open.","Ryan Aceto","Hi everyone, this is actually Ryan Aceto on for Randy this morning. I wanted to turn to Group Benefits last two quarters have had pretty strong margins. Is that something we could expect going forward or are we going to be coming back toward your guidance toward the end of the year?","Beth Bombara","Yes, so we're very pleased with the performance that we saw in Group Benefits this quarter and as you point out the previous quarter and it really continues to be driven by favorable incidence levels on inner disability block. And when we think about it from over the long term, we do see ourselves being in the range that we provided at the beginning of the year, but obviously with these trends we're probably trending a little bit higher from the core earnings margin in the range that we provided and we'll continue to watch incidence levels as you know they're very tied to economic activity and we'll continue to make adjustments as we go through the year. But overall we're very pleased with how that book is performing and we also saw improvements in our recovery rates as well.","Ryan Aceto","Great, and then I didn\u2019t see your \u2013 I'm sorry if I missed on the call, did you touch on the tax payment that was supposed to be coming through the door, I guess first quarter or may be pushed to second with timing of payments?","Beth Bombara","Yes. So I think you may be referring to refund on AMT, which will come through when our tax return is finalized, but with this review by the IRS, we did file our tax return already, so we'll await to receive those receipts and the timing is somewhat dependent on the IRS process, so we did not get a receipt in the first quarter.","Ryan Aceto","And you still expect 600 to 700?","Beth Bombara","So again, the $600 million to $700 million is not just AMT, that's our anticipation over the course of the year. I'll remind you that we also will have tax receipts coming to the holding company as we utilize our NOLs, so our operating subsidiaries will basically pay the holding company for use of those NOLs. And we do those tax settlements with our operating subsidiaries throughout the year, beginning in the second quarter. But yes, overall for the year, we're still anticipating net proceeds of the holding company of about $600 million to $700 million.","Ryan Aceto","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian, your line is open.","Brian Meredith","Yes, thanks. A couple of quick questions here for you. Just back on the Group Benefits discussion, I'm just curious, are you seeing any impact on pricing as a result of the favorable disability results you are coming through?","Doug Elliot","Brian, I would suggest that it's a fairly competitive marketplace. It's been competitive, but clearly the disability results across the industry, including our own are in very good shape. So I think there's a bit of enhanced competition, nothing outside the norm now.","Brian Meredith","Great. And then Doug, my second question is, I'm just curious, your thoughts on kind of what the market conditions are looking like right now for Navigators. You obviously know the businesses, it's there and what's going through, - do you expect you are seeing the same type of kind of pricing that we're hearing from other people out of Lloyd, et cetera and is Navigators today, maybe a little bit better than you would have thought when you actually made the acquisition or announced it?","Chris Swift","Yes, Brian, it's Chris. Obviously, we haven't closed yet, so we can't speak for Navigators and what they're going to report in the first quarter. But I would say generally between Doug and myself and in all the discussions with their team that we've had over the last three, four months numerous visits to London to see firsthand some of their Lloyd's operations, I'm pretty encouraged. I think and again the deal still makes a tremendous amount of strategic sense for us and the quality of team that I am seeing there the underwriters their knowledge of the market and quite honestly the tailwinds that are really beginning to develop in certain aspects of the market, particularly where they play and domestically and in Lloyd's - is very encouraging to me and probably long overdue. But Doug, what would you add?","Doug Elliot","I think the timing is terrific for us launching. Chris and I just got back from Boston. We spent a couple of days with some of our leading distributor partners and also some of our key risks and again relative to my comments, although we're seeing some upward movement in the core middle and small lines. I think the need in some of the specialty areas is a little more advanced and I expect that we're going to see that in the marketplace over the coming quarters. So I think a good time for us to come together, excited about the expertise that now will become part of The Hartford upon completion of the deal and Brian, I think you have a good start here.","Brian Meredith","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Josh, your line is open.","Josh Shanker","Yes, thank you. So in terms of Navigators, we know they took probably back to $50 million to $60 million of after-tax reserves after you close the deal and you're signing the ADC with Berkshire right now and if you need the ADC that's some material deterioration in the loss reserves. Can we talk about ROI when you did this deal what you think the return is, has the return materially deteriorated? So you've looked under the wheel here, you haven't closed it yet, but has your perspective changed a little bit, has anything deteriorated from your initial perspective when you did the deal?","Chris Swift","Josh, it's Chris. I would add just a couple points maybe to help you. Obviously the $70 per share price that we negotiated was negotiated price, obviously a willing buyer and a willing seller. As I said, just in the prior commentary, we still feel very good about the strategic and financial components of this transaction. So nothing fundamentally has changed. But clearly, we paid a full price for property that we're excited to own and integrate and keep its own special identity going forward as a global specialty operation, but we probably paid a price once we see their first quarter results in a book value range of 1.9, at the end of the day. But as I said in my prepared remarks, the metrics and the components of earnings that $200 million in that four to five-year period of time, remain very valid improvements in underwriting results, contributions of net investment income, cross-sell, revenue generation and expense savings.","So, I feel all those points and the $200 million run rate is very achievable in that four to five-year time period and actually I think there's more improvement opportunity beyond that. That said, yes, our IRRs on the deal given what we've learned since then have probably come down a little bit, maybe a half a point and a point range. So I'm not terribly concerned about what that means for the long term. But yes, it's probably a little at the low end of our expectations as far as an IRR.","Josh Shanker","Okay, I appreciate the answers. And then maybe a question for Beth on Talcott, obviously the hedges work in your favor in 4Q '18 which came through in as income in 1Q '19, I guess that's going to give back some in 2Q '19. Can you can you walk through the math we should be considering on that line item in the corporate and what we should consider as a run rate sort of income generation from the Talcott share?","Beth Bombara","Sure, yes and as I'm sure you can appreciate, that's a little difficult to answer, because obviously the share that we pick up is going to have an inherent in its some volatility because of the hedging gains and to your point hedging losses when markets recover. I would say as we think about for the impact of their first quarter and what that could be in our second quarter, I would expect it to be pretty flat 0 to $3 million kind of range, definitely not at a level that we saw this quarter. And unfortunately it is just going to kind of bounce around a bit, because of that.","So I think you should expect to see some noise in that line item. And I think the other line items within corporate are pretty straightforward, which is why we provided this slide that kind of summarize those, being interest income, which again will come down once we complete the purchase of Navigators and then obviously the interest in preferred dividend line.","Brian Meredith","Okay, thanks for the answers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. Paul, your line is open.","Paul Newsome","Good morning and thanks for the call everyone. The - yesterday Progressive put in their shareholder letter that they are seeing a more competitive personalized market. I was wondering if you could give us a few comments on what you're seeing from a market perspective in Personal Lines and if you're seeing kind of the same thing?","Doug Elliot","Paul, I would suggest that the last few years have been competitive in the Personal Line space. So I'm not sure I could contrast the last 90 days or last 180 with the prior 3 or 4, 5 years. I think the better companies are investing and are more competitive in the street or how they reach customers and so that's just the marketplace we face into every day. Obviously we are leaning into our capabilities and feeling good that we've made some progress across both the sales front and the product front, but more work to be done and understand this terrific competitors we see in the marketplace each and every day.","Paul Newsome","And my second question, I was wondering if you have you any updated thoughts on the expense ratio I guess ticked up a little bit with some investments that you've made in whether or not that is something that would eventually get kicked back down to that the 30 range, that it was at one point, kind of timeline, maybe, but nothing specific?","Chris Swift","Paul it's Chris. I guess, as I said in my prepared remarks, we've been very deliberate and conscious really over the last 6, 7 years since the team has been together to think about the needed investments in our internal infrastructure, technology, data analytics, claim systems and we've been on a multi-year journey that we're continuing. And I would say, yes, maybe they've spiked up a little bit here, but we've, we've been pretty disciplined and I'm really pleased with our approach of generating expense savings, over the years, expense cuts, rationalizing certain aspects of our infrastructure to invest in the new more modern technology and digital capabilities.","So in the long-term trend, we still believe in to invest, have greater efficiency, a better customer experience and from any one quarter and comp basis, it could bounce around a little bit, but Beth or Doug, I still very, very committed on the path that we're on, because it's the right one for the long term.","Beth Bombara","Yes, I agree with that and when we look at the expense ratio and primarily focusing on the commercial lines, we definitely saw an increase there is kind of what we see in this quarter, around that is probably where it will be for the remainder of the year and we feel very strongly and are committed to the agenda that we're on relative to the improvements that we're making in our core operations and our capabilities that we think are critical to continue to compete at the level that we compete at.","Doug Elliot","I would add maybe three thoughts. One is data science has become a fundamental key initiative here in terms of looking and working with external data, working more aggressively with our internal data and thinking about how that will help us compete and be thoughtful about markets we intend to move into. And so, yes, we have clearly extended our reach and are investing more dollars in data science. But I believe there will be a long-term pay that will be more than equal to what we're spending now. So there is a bit of short-term pain for what I think will be long-term gain.","Secondly, which ties into the earlier question around NAV, we have spent a lot of money and continue to invest in new products over the last 5 years, and that started with Group Benefits through the voluntary suite and now has extended into things like energy, our construction verticals, et cetera. That progress in some of those cases now gets accelerated with Navigators. So as Chris talks about expenses, the fact that we are standing up and environmental practice and standing up a life science practice now we put that on a much different speed dial. And I think they'll be cost saves there, but we have spent a lot, because we feel like that full product suite was absolutely necessary to be the player that we intend to be and needed to be in the middle market space, that's point two.","And then thirdly, there is some slight upward pressure on commissions, both to defend our space in the small commercial area and also to reach into specialized practices that now, we're building products for. So we're aware of it. I think we've been thoughtful about how we pick our spots to compete long term, but I share those 3 areas as complementary to what Chris and Beth shared relative to expenses.","Paul Newsome","Thank you for the questions and congrats on the quarter.","Doug Elliot","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Tom, your line is open.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning. Just a question on the ADC deal as it relates to the way we should be interpreting this, do you think it's fair to say that if I just look at little over $2 billion acquisition price and I add the premium you're paying for the ADC plus the $100 million, up to the attachment, add an extra couple of hundred million to the purchase price, is that a fair way to think about the IRR on the transaction? So maybe it's 10% worse than you originally thought and the question then becomes, did you have 10% conservatism in your assumptions, when you priced it, can you, is that a fair way to think about this or would you make any adjustments to that?","Chris Swift","Tom, it's Chris. I understand your path and your points, your math and your concepts. So I wouldn't add anything to it other than how fast the run rate to get to $200 million might change sort of the future earnings power I think is enhanced since we announced the deal. So, but as far as the basis, the investments in sort of the Navigators deal I would agree with your concepts.","Tom Gallagher","Okay, thanks. And then just a followup for Doug on Group Benefits, you said retention is about in line with your expectations, and I'm looking at a couple of things going on there, flattish year-over-year earned premium and sales team down about 10% year-over-year. So just curious how has the underlying persistence you've been trending on the block, is the sales success about in line with what you expected? And then also, one other thing I noticed there. The other sales were quite strong. I think, up over 30%. I'm assuming that maybe that's Voluntary Benefits. Can you comment on what's happening there? Thanks.","Doug Elliot","Yes. So just to nail that and then I'll come back around, certainly that's where our voluntary products are and we feel good about progress, not just last year and the prior, but certainly start of 2019. A couple of comments about sales, I would remind you that we had a new product, the New York Paid Family Leave Act that initiated 01\/01\/2018, so that was about a $50 plus million program. When you adjust for that our run rate is more reflective of my comments, which we feel pretty good about the start to 2019. So I think you need to make that adjustment. It was a one-time change with the law in New York.","When I think about retention, we did build in some shock to our anticipated one, two, three-year scenarios around the Aetna deal. And so, when I think about what is playing out Chris, and I view experienced to be basically largely in line with what we expected. So, not what I would say a normalized run rate, but with little bit of shock for the first couple of years. Through that we feel pretty good about the accounts we're retaining. I feel pretty good about the setup. As you know, we're already working on the backside of 2019, so I don't think there are any major surprises that fall out of line.","Chris Swift","Tom, it's Chris. As I said in my prepared remarks, from an operational side, whether it be retention, whether it be sales, whether it be expenses, all meeting or exceeding our expectations and something maybe we don't talk about too often Doug is, I think the Ability Advantage, the claims system that we inherited plus the modifications that we made and our claims expertise embedded in our organization is another key differentiator long term that we feel terrific about.","Doug Elliot","I mean, Tom, you know and you understand that book. So a good chunk of that book 70% plus the Aetna book was national accounts and therefore you can have lumpy progress as you move through time, you lose one account and you need to be accounted for that.","So I look back and I think our 2018 retention was really solid and I'm pretty pleased about the way we started '19 and looking forward to the rest of the year and then next year. Very excited about what we're building and how fast we brought to market a brand new claims platform and we will now compete with that going forward.","Tom Gallagher","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Ransom with Dowling & Partners. Gary, your line is open.","Gary Ransom","Yes, good morning. I have a question on the pressure you've been talking about in Workers' Comp and whether we could drill down a little bit. Are there places where you're seeing a lot more pressure, maybe in states or small versus middle and I just wanted to get a little more color on the differences you might be seeing in that line?","Chris Swift","Gary, good morning. Let me make a few comments and you can direct the path forward. First comment I'd make relative to the quarter is that -- as we move through 2018, we did adjust our middle market Workers' Compensation pick. So this quarter was a little bit of a difficult compare comparing first quarter '19 to a 2018 first quarter that did not have the recorded actions that happened through the rest of the year. So I'll just start with that when you think about the all-in numbers we posted.","Secondly, I've commented in the past that we have a bit more discretion in the middle market through the underwriting process where accounts have more experienced per account, they are larger size, et cetera, and therefore underwriters used to stay filings, but also have some ability to adjust based on underwriting views, engineering Workers' Compensation, safety habits, et cetera, et cetera.","So, I would say to you that in the small commercial world, there is a bit less flexibility and where we see pricing more driven by market conditions, there will be a little bit more pressure on margin and in the middle we are able to do a better job at looking at looking at accounts one by one and making appropriate judgments as we move forward on the margin.","Gary Ransom","Yes, just to get in on the small commercial side where you say you have less flexibility, I mean is there, if you look at the individual account level you had a new piece of business coming in and the pricing is maybe not quite where it needs to be to get the business, is can - is the facility there to quickly adjust price if you can to attract that customer?","Chris Swift","Well, you're really talking about a class by class process and now you're inside the wheels of I think what makes us so effective in the marketplace. So, yes, in certain areas territories and classes have we changed the referral process, absolutely. And even inside of classes there are micro classes that we spend more time with probably have a bit different appetite and this is all on a state and regional basis.","So you're now inside the granular nature of what we do day in day out inside small. I just gave you a little bit of a 50,000 feet view that says across small commercial it's a bit more of a spot rated product, given the fact that we're seeing prices go negative we're very focused on where and how that is happening and making sure that we're doing everything we can to preserve the margins we've got and to protect our future.","Gary Ransom","All right, thank you very much. I just had one other little question. The $90 million of premium you're paying for the ADC is that, how is that going to be treated in terms of core versus non-core earnings?","Beth Costello","Yes, so the premium that we'll pay will be in non-core, so it will not be in core earnings, but obviously will be in net income on an after-tax basis of course.","Gary Ransom","All right, thank you very much.","Chris Swift","Thanks Gary.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Meyer, your line is open.","Meyer Shields","Great, thanks. Two really quick questions, one, the ADC premium is that going to come out of P&C or is that a corporate expenditure? In other words is it going to reflect underwriting results?","Beth Costello","So it will not be reflected in underwriting results, again, similar to how we treated the ADC cover that we bought for A&E exposures a few years ago.","Meyer Shields","Okay, and then this is a little nitpicky, but you've had a few consecutive quarters of adverse development in General Liability and I was hoping you could talk through what's going on there?","Chris Swift","Yes, I think it's pretty picky and I think it's small. We've had a couple of older product liability cases that we've added to. It's nothing that has my attention in the way of concern. So I feel pretty good about our balance sheet. I think we finished 2018 strong, we feel good about our position and first quarter 2019 and I think we march ahead.","Meyer Shields","Okay, thank you very much.","Beth Costello","Amy, in the interest of time I think we can take one more question.","Operator","Certainly. Your last question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Buckingham Research. Amit, your line is open.","Amit Kumar","Thanks and thank you for fitting me in. Just very quickly, going back to Gary's question on Workers' Compensation, what exactly was that 2019 comp loss?","Chris Swift","Amit, just as Doug looks at is, no, I'm glad you asked the question because I just wanted to add a perspective that may or may not be helpful to you in that when we established our outlook\/guidance for '19, clearly we were fully aware of the environment, particularly pricing, but also loss cost trends composed of frequency and severity in that and when we established the range of our outlook, I thought we were pretty clear and I know I've said and subsequent FT-friendly environments that we did expect some margin compression in Workers' Comp.","So as we sit here today, there is nothing that surprised us in the first quarter and as we look at the next three quarters, there is nothing that we see that's going to surprise us or change our original views on guidance. The offset though, we said was that primarily Commercial, Auto, Property and GL we thought we could actually expand margins in this environment and as Doug just said, we're very encouraged and continue to be encouraged with the pricing environment to a lesser extent than the specialty world, but pricing and margins we feel knock wood for the rest of the year can expand and grow, so that in general we would be flattish to maybe slightly down on a year-over-year your margin comparison basis to 18. So that's the context, I think we judge the market very well, are managing appropriately in this environment. But Doug, I don't know if you have that number or if we really want to give it out at this point.","Doug Elliot","Well, I guess couple of parts, one is I think our total Workers' Compensation number does make a lot of sense. We are adding excess Workers' Comp from national accounts and with middle and small so, what's relevant to me is that on the quarter we had about a point of Workers' Comp margin pressure point in the quarter and as I commented before, part of that compare is the fact that in the first quarter of 2018 we didn\u2019t have the adjustments that we had made later in the year.","So, as the year progresses we're going to watch carefully the gap and Chris that is largely in line with our expectations, so there is nothing that I'm talking about that Beth and I or the teams are surprised about. And what I think about our view of trend and our view of pricing, I think 2019 has started about the way we thought it was. So slight compression, not major and we will watch it every 90 days and share with you what we see in our book.","Amit Kumar","Thanks and may be just one very quick followup on Navigators and Navigators have a substantial E&S book in its U.S. operations and I was curious, there has been a lot of discussion right now how it's a tale of two markets where E&S pricing is substantially better than commercial, any thoughts on that Chris or Doug in terms of are you thinking about that piece differently or are you sort of positively surprised by how quickly that piece is turning?","Chris Swift","Yes, as I said before we haven\u2019t closed, so it is unfair for us to comment on Navigators trends in the first quarter. We don't know them and obviously you will read about them once they publish their results or when we close first whatever happens. But general market conditions, as Doug said, he and I were at the RIMS Conference in Boston. We'd been to London numerous times and I would say, yes in that E&S wholesale specialty orientation it is a rapidly changing and dynamic environment, one where rates are rising very rapidly in certain lines. So that's the tailwind that we talked about that we feel good about and as we start our ownership of Navigators going forward.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to Sabra Purtill for closing remarks.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you. We appreciate you all joining us today particularly on such a busy day for earnings.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. Sabra Purtill, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you. Good morning. And welcome to The Hartford\u2019s webcast for third quarter 2015 financial results. Our third quarter financial results news release, investor financial supplement, presentation and 10-Q were all released yesterday afternoon and are posted on our website.","Our speakers today include Chris Swift, Chairman and CEO of The Hartford; Doug Elliot, President; and Beth Bombara, CFO. Following their prepared remarks, we will have about 30 minutes for Q&A.","Just a few notes before Chris begins, today\u2019s call includes forward-looking statements as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results could be materially different.","We do not assume any obligation to update forward looking statements and investors should consider the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from these statements. A detailed description of those risks and uncertainties can be found in our SEC filings, which are also available on our website.","Our presentation today also includes several non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations and reconciliations of these measures to the comparable GAAP measure are included in our SEC filings, as well as in the news release and financial supplement.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Swift","Thank you, Sabra. Good morning, everyone. Last night we announced our financial results for the third quarter. While we delivered strong underlying performance in our commercial lines and group benefit businesses, we did experienced some headwinds in several areas, resulting in a decrease in core earnings, lower net investment income, prior year development in commercial lines, and higher cats and loss costs in personal lines were the primary contributors to a 19% decline in core earnings per diluted share.","Net investment income was down 10% compared to the third quarter of last year. This decline is mainly due to hedge fund performance in the quarter. However, year-to-date results remain ahead of our outlook for alternative investments in aggregate. We also had some notable achievements, including increase in 12 months core earnings return on equity to 9.1% and growing book value per diluted share by 8%.","In mutual funds, net flows year-to-date were at the highest level we\u2019ve seen since 2010 and in Talcott, our execution remains steady, where we continue to successfully manage the risk of the book and return capital to the holding company for more creative uses. Doug and Beth will cover operating results in more detail. I wanted to share a few thoughts on our results.","In commercial lines, the underlying combined ratio, excluding cats and prior-year development improved 1 point over prior year. This result was driven by small commercial and specialty commercial, which delivered underlying combined ratios of 86.8 and 99.1, respectively, or better than prior year.","The underlying results in middle-market were steady versus last year. However, prior-year development in general liability and commercial auto contributed to the deterioration in the total combined ratio.","Personal lines cat losses were elevated versus prior year, although, below our expectations. We saw and reacted to recent signs of increased auto frequency, which impacted our combined ratio.","We also experienced elevated non-cat property losses compared to the prior year. This business is always required that we actively utilize data and analytics to monitor trends and make adjustments, and that is exactly what we're doing.","Group benefits delivered another strong quarter with core earnings margin of 5.5%, improving a full point from prior year. The year-to-date margin of 5.9 is the best we've seen since 2008.","In addition, the group benefits team recently signed a renewal rights agreement for AIG\u2019s under 100 lives employer segment, which aligns with our objective to grow in the small and middle-market areas.","Looking ahead, we are focused on executing on our strategy even as we face a more competitive and dynamic industry environment. We share some examples of these efforts. Relative to distribution in commercial P&C we are on track to meet our goal of adding sales and underwriting talent in targeted geographies like the West and Midwest regions, which will help us be more responsive to customer needs.","In group benefits, we increased the number of sales representatives in the under 500 lives employer segment to complement our national account segment. The goal is to have a more balanced portfolio of small to midsized accounts, while maintaining our strength in national accounts and early results of these efforts are encouraging.","In early October, Doug and I, went with a number of our senior leaders, attended the Annual CIB Conference, where we met with more than 80 of our industries top agents and brokers. These discussions confirm that the work we have been doing to expand our product offerings and risk appetite is beginning to pay off.","The feedback we received also affirms our view that The Hartford has strong and growing momentum with many of these organizations, which will serve as well on our strategic journey. Talented people are the engine behind The Hartford success. I am especially proud of a care and commitment our employees show towards customers in their time of need.","During the recent wildfires in California, our claims teams were able to quickly inspect 100% of claims, meet in person with all impacted customers and get them into temporary housing, no small feat considering the impact of these fires. This is exactly the kind of claims service that differentiates us and earns The Hartford a 4.8 out of 5 Star ratings with our customers.","Before turning the call over to Doug, I want to emphasize that while we had some challenges in the quarter I am pleased with the progress The Hartford has made during the year. Our year-to-date results reflect a 17% increase in core earnings per diluted share over the prior year and we are focused on finishing the year strong.","I am confident that we have the right people, capabilities and underwriting discipline to succeed even in an increasingly competitive marketplace as we remain focused on delivering shareholder value by increasing ROE and book value per share.","Now let me turn the call over to Doug. Doug?","Doug Elliot","Thank you, Chris, and good morning. I am going to provide additional details on the operating results of our Property and Casualty and Group Benefits business units, but, first, let me begin with the few observations about the market.","The competitive landscape in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits is slightly more pressured than we experienced over the last four quarters. Markets remain largely rational, but there are more clear signs of aggressive new business pricing with some loosening of terms and conditions, particularly in commercial property.","We continue to find opportunities to acquire adequately priced new business while remaining disciplined in our risk selection approach, mainly through more intense sales execution in our local markets with agents and brokers.","In Personal Lines, competition is generally consistent with prior quarters. We continue to see opportunity for growth in the direct channel and with our differentiated AARP agency offering. Price competition in the traditional agency channel remains the norm driven by competitive raters.","Third quarter core earnings in Commercial Lines was $216 million with the combined ratio of 94.5. This was an earnings decrease of $52 million versus third quarter 2014, primarily driven by adverse prior period development in commercial auto and lower net investment income.","The underlying combined ratio, excluding catastrophes and prior period development, was 91, improving 1 point from third quarter 2014, largely driven by continued margin expansion in workers' compensation. This improvement reflects the solid foundation we built in recent years across our commercial businesses through rigorous underwriting and pricing discipline.","Renewal written pricing in standard commercial lines was 2% for the quarter, down 1% from second quarter 2015 and 2 points from third quarter last year. Commercial auto continues to achieve high-single-digit price increases as we and the industry address weak returns in the line. Pricing in other lines is more competitive, particularly middle market.","In Small Commercial, written premium grew 4% in the quarter. Strong policy retention has continued providing a nice tailwind as new business was up more modestly at 2%. The underlying combined ratio was 86.8, improving seven-tenths of a point from a year ago due to better workers' compensation margins and favorable non-cat property losses.","We continue to work on distribution initiatives with our agency partners to drive new business growth. Although the market is competitive, our business model is performing well and we see the opportunity to deploy our capabilities to gain market share.","In middle market, we posted a somewhat mixed quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 93.8, three-tenths higher than third quarter 2014. However, the overall combined ratio was 102.5, 8.8 points higher than last year due to adverse prior period development, primarily in general liability and commercial auto. The development in general liability was driven by a large loss in older accident years.","In commercial auto, we continue to see increased severity on a relatively small number of losses, mainly from accident years 2010 to 2013. In several of these claims, there has been a pattern of significant build up in medical costs without ongoing notification to us. It\u2019s important to note that our reserving estimates assumed that these trends will processed into more accident years as well, but that certainly does not reflect the intensity of our actions to improve performance in the line.","We have been working throughout the year to improve claim, product, and underwriting execution and thereby better manage outcomes on the current accident year. This includes implementing new underwriting tools and guidelines that we expect to reduce our exposure to these high severity risk profiles for both new and renewal business. And we continue to increase rates and improve our pricing segmentation to better address loss cost trends. We believe that we have begun to mitigate these trends in the current accident year but will only make that call as the data develops.","Moving to the topline in middle market, our metrics continue to show that we are making effective decisions to retain well-priced business and acquiring new business when meeting our underwriting and rate adequacy thresholds. Written premium growth was 2% driven by strong renewals in marine, new business growth in large property and construction, and pricing increases in commercial auto. We remain committed to improving and expanding our non-workers' compensation lines recognizing that we must be thoughtful on our approach given recent market conditions.","In Specialty Commercial, the underlying combined ratio was 99.1 versus 105.1 in the prior year. The 6 point improvement was driven by better loss performance in Bond and Financial Products. Last year Bond\u2019s accident year losses included a large loss while this year has returned to our historical performance. Topline growth for Specialty was 7% driven mainly by strong account retention and renewal premium in national accounts and to a lesser extent auto premium adjustments.","In Personal Lines, core earning was $70 million for the quarter versus $71 million last year. Of the $54 million decrease, $23 million was due to higher catastrophe losses versus third quarter 2014. Our total catastrophe losses this quarter were below our expectation. However, third quarter of last year was even more favorable resulting in a challenging year-over-year comparison.","Our most significant events this quarter were the California wildfires which resulted in $56 million of pretax losses, the underlying combined ratio of 95.6 deteriorated 4.7 points from last year driven by increases in auto frequency, non-cat homeowner losses and marketing expenses.","Let me provide more detail on each of those items. First, auto frequency increased 3% in the quarter after several quarters of flat to negative indications. We had anticipated some increase in our frequency this quarter known that we had a very favorable frequency change in third quarter 2014. On a trailing 12 month basis, our frequency change is below 1%. There have been quite a few broad-based data observations such as lower gas prices, improving employment conditions and increased miles driven that point to roads being more congested.","It is very difficult to correlate this information with our specific book of business which we generally find to be less susceptible to these factors due to our weighting towards majeure drivers. However, we all travel the same roads and our customers are not completely insulated from these conditions. As a result, we have reflected a slight increase in frequency with our loss estimates and pricing assumptions. The months ahead will provide more data and we will continue to adapt our pricing and marketing strategy accordingly.","Second, this quarter we start increasing non-cat homeowner losses primarily from fires and water damage, although partially offset by favorable weather losses. These types of losses tend to be uneven from quarter-to-quarter. Recall that fire losses in the second quarter of 2015 were at their lowest level in seven years. We\u2019ve examined the loss profiles and at this point have not seen any particular patterns in our data.","And finally, direct marketing spend is up this quarter versus third quarter 2014. AARP Direct, auto has continued to perform well and we've been planning for increased acquisition efforts in the back half of this year to take advantage of our recent product improvements. We are especially focused on driving online activity through our contact centers where our sales teams provide outstanding counseling services, have demonstrated the ability to convert prospects to customers.","Total written premium for the quarter grew 1%, including 4% growth in AARP Direct and 8% growth in AARP Agency. In other agency, written premium was down 10% versus the third quarter of 2014. Our efforts engaged with highly partnered agents who value the differentiated products and services we offer are continuing.","Shifting over to Group Benefits, core earnings in the third quarter was $47 million, up 24% over the same period in 2014, achieving a core earnings margin of 5.5%. The increase is primarily attributable to topline growth and a lower disability loss ratio compared to prior year. Earned premiums excluding association, financial institutions was up 3% in the quarter, driven by growth in our employer, group life and disability lines.","For the quarter, fully insured ongoing sales, was up 7% to $61 million. In addition, our employer group business continues to maintain strong book persistency, around 90% on a year-to-date basis. We are having success in competitive markets. Our flow of new business opportunities is strong and we are working in a discipline yet aggressive manner to win new accounts.","Long-term disability continues to be the most competitive line, despite having underperformed across much of the industry in recent years. Our disability book of business is performing well, following several years of underwriting and pricing actions and we are maintaining our steady course.","Our Group Benefits value proposition has been significantly enhanced over the last several years, with improvements to our service and claims experience and the addition of a robust voluntary platform. We are well-positioned to expand this business and are confident that we have build momentum across our target markets.","With that, let me conclude my comments. This is a quarter where we experienced some volatility across our auto and property lines, and we are very focused on taking appropriate actions to strengthen performance in these areas.","We continued to invest in product expansion, deepen our distribution capabilities and deliver outstanding service to our customers. Markets are competitive and we're responding with discipline and focus to stay on track with both near-term actions and our long-term strategic objectives.","Let me now turn the call over to Beth.","Beth Bombara","Thank you, Doug. I'm going to briefly cover the other segments, the investment portfolio and our capital management actions before we turn the call over for questions. Mutual Funds core earnings were flat with the prior year quarter, as lower fee income due to the decrease in market levels from June 30th was largely offset by lower distribution and other operating expenses. ","Total AUM was down about 5% from September 30th last year, mostly due to Talcott related AUM runoff. Excluding Talcott, AUM declined 2% due to the market decline this quarter. Fund performance remains solid, with 58% of all Mutual Funds and 74% of the equity funds, outperforming peers over the last five years, helping to improve net flows to a positive $307 million for the quarter and almost $1.1 billion year-to-date.","Talcott posted stronger-than-expected core earnings of a $107 million, but down from a $122 million last year due to decreased fees and investment income, partially offset by lower expenses. The decrease in fees reflects the continued runoff in Talcott, with an 11% decrease in variable annuity contract count over the last year.","Investment income was impacted by several factors, the largest item being lower limited partnership income, which was partially offset by higher bond calls and make-whole premiums than last year. In addition, Talcott\u2019s operating expenses and costs for contractholder initiatives were lower than the prior year.","As I mentioned last quarter, Talcott paid a dividend of $500 million in July, in addition to the $500 million dividend paid in February. We expect to pay another $500 million dividend to the holding company in early 2016.","Corporate segment third quarter 2015 core losses of $63 million were up slightly from $58 million in 2014, which included a $7 million insurance recovery. Excluding this benefit, core losses continue to decline due to lower interest expense as a result of debt repayments over the last year.","Turning to investments, the credit performance of our portfolio remains strong although impairments rose slightly to $40 million before tax from $15 million in the third quarter of 2014. About half of the impairments resulted from the decision to sell some lower credit quality securities in the high-yield and emerging market portfolios.","Our annualized portfolio yield excluding limited partnership was 4.2% in the quarter, up slightly from 4.1% in both second quarter 2015 and third quarter 2014. Our consolidated portfolio yield held up well despite the headwind from low interest rates, as the impact of lower reinvestment rates was partially offset by the benefit of make-whole call premium and bonds, prepayment penalties and mortgages and other non-routine items.","These non-routine items, which are largely correlated to the continued low interest rate environment, increased the year-to-date investment yield by about 10 basis points. Excluding these items and limited partnership, our year-to-date annualized portfolio yield was 4%, down about 10 basis points from a year ago.","The P&C portfolio also is experiencing a similar pattern, declining this quarter to an annualized yield of 3.7% excluding limited partnerships. And it did not benefit from non-routine items to the same degree as the Talcott portfolio. Although P&C new money yields averaged 3.8% due to wider credit spreads, we continue to expect low reinvestment rates to pressure P&C in consolidated portfolio yield.","As Chris mentioned, lower limited partnership returns negatively impacted our results, particularly in Commercial Lines and Talcott. This portfolio had an annualized return of 3% this quarter. The year-to-date return is 10%, still well above our 6% outlook. This portfolio which totals about $3 billion is roughly 60% private equity and real estate partnerships, which have earned about 18% year-to-date and 40% hedge funds, which were negative in the quarter and year-to-date. Hedge fund performance was adversely affected by the global decline in equity markets and volatility in currencies","Looking at the fourth quarter, we can\u2019t accurately predict hedge fund performance because of their idiosyncratic nature. However, we do have some early visibility into real estate and private equity partnership returns, which are reported on a one-quarter lag. So far, we expect fourth quarter real estate and private equity income to decline from the strong recent performance as the valuations will be impacted by the third quarter decline in equity markets.","Considering this, we currently estimate that fourth quarter limited partnership and other alternative investment income will be lower than the third quarter 2015 actual results. We've always expected limited partnerships to have more volatile returns than the rest of the general account and we have sized them accordingly. We also expect returns in the portfolio to be higher overtime to compensate for this volatility, which we certainly have seen over the past several years.","Turning to our capital management program. As you know, we increased our equity repurchase authorization in July. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 6.5 million shares for $300 million. In addition, since the end of the quarter through October 23rd, we repurchased an additional 2 million shares for $94 million, leaving roughly $1.7 billion remaining under the equity repurchase authorization that expires at year-end 2016.","In addition, as a reminder, we intend to repay an outstanding $167 million debt maturity in November. I would note that our rating agency debt to total capital ratio was approximately 26.9% at the end of September, down from 28% at year-end. September 30, 2015, book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI rose to $42.99, up 6% from year-end 2014 and 8% from September 30, 2014, reflecting positive net income after dividend to shareholders and the accretive impact of the equity repurchase program.","To summarize, core earnings totaled $360 million for the quarter or $0.86 per diluted share. Even with some of the challenges we experienced in the quarter, we did improve core earnings ROE and grow book value per share. Over the last 12 months, we've achieved a core earnings ROE of 9.1% compared with 8.2% at third quarter 2014 in the range of 8.7% to 9.2% provided to you at the beginning of the year. In addition, our year-to-date core earnings of $2.81 per diluted share, up 17% from 2014.","I will now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you, Beth. First of all to those of you listening on the webcast, I will apologize for some of the sound interference that you are getting. I just want to remind you all that the replay of the call will be available. There is also a transcript, however, given the irritation of the skipping what I want to do is repeat the dial-in number. So that you can hear the Q&A session clearly. So for the dial-in, it\u2019s area code 877-685-7362. For those international, it\u2019s area code 937-999-2389 and the conference ID is 50576163. And I repeat it\u2019s 50576163. If you dial those numbers, you should be admitted automatically to the call and again the dial-in is 877-685-7362.","Just a reminder to those of you who are on the call right now that we request that you limit yourself to two questions after which you're welcome to re-queue for additional questions. We appreciate your hearing to this so that we can have as many people as possible ask their questions on the call. Ian, could you please repeat the instructions for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brian Meredith. Your line is open.","Brian Meredith","Yes. Thank you. A couple questions. First, can you just dive into whole frequency situation, just a little bit more here. Perhaps you can give us some more color on kind of maybe state that is coming from. Is more of it coming from AARP versus the other agency? Is it balanced? Anything that you're seeing?","Doug Elliot","Brian, this is Doug. Let me start out by saying clearly July and August were little heavier on the frequency side than September. So we think some of that is attributed to summer travel and we\u2019re very interested how October will play out. So very important transit there on the top. There is obviously a state dynamic. If you look at miles driven that DOT is shared. There clearly is a West Coast and across the South dynamic of more miles driven over the 2015. We\u2019re feeling some of that in our state-by-state analysis.","Next point, I would share is that as we look at the top 10 states from a Personal Lines liability perspective, essentially we were in line with market share. So we\u2019re not overlined in any of the bigger states that are driving some of this frequency change namely, California. We\u2019re aware of those states where we are and our work continues. So as I look at this dynamic, we had very favorable rolling 12 frequency changes over the past couple years.","We have seen a little bit activity certainly into the third quarter. We reacted to it in our financials. We\u2019ll stay on top of our trends into October, November. And we\u2019re going to make sure that our pricing analytics are correlated with the trend you're seeing in our loss analysis.","Chris Swift","Hey Brian, it\u2019s Chris. Let me just add a larger context that you guys jump into it right away. The AARP relationship has been a wonderful 30-year relationship for us and it\u2019s very strategically important. And we pride ourselves on working together with them, some of their members and have coordinated strategies and outlooks so that 80% of our Personal Lines book is AARP whether it be direct or agent.","And it\u2019s -- over longer period of time has performed very well. So that when Doug refers to increases in frequencies, you got to think in terms of a lower different base than sort of a larger mass market in your Personal Lines company. So as much as we reacted to it, there is a basis difference that our book is still relatively outperforming with lower frequencies from what we could tell at this point in time.","Brian Meredith","Got it. Thanks. And then my next question, one of you can just dive in little bit more into the commercial auto adverse development. What are you\u2019ll doing right now to make sure that that\u2019s going to continue here going forward. It\u2019s kind of been almost a quarterly event that we've seen recently?","Doug Elliot","Brian, again this is Doug. So what we've seen most recently is some pressure between months 24 and 42 in our triangles. And as I mentioned in my commentary, primarily in years 2010 to \u201813, so we\u2019re seeing late emergence of medical information as these claims are unfolding over the couple years.","Couple things are happening. One is that inside our claim operation, we\u2019re looking at diagnostics that will try to get our arms around those claims as quickly as possible. I gave an example on the call moments ago. Sometimes we don\u2019t get these till late into their life, but we are looking at our claim practices and wondering whether we can make adjustments there.","And more importantly inside our underwriting, we are buckling down and making sure we\u2019ve got all the disciplines around driver behavior, past driver behavior and we\u2019re looking at new class plan tweaks, et cetera. So were working both ends of this, kind of, like we have put our arms around the issue and something that although has been frustrating, I feel like we\u2019re on top of it.","Brian Meredith","So you\u2019re not seeing any increase in frequency in the commercial auto space necessarily?","Doug Elliot","No, this has not been a frequency issue. It\u2019s more in the severity side for sure.","Chris Swift","Brian?","Brian Meredith","Yeah.","Chris Swift","Again, just a context. This is primarily a middle-market phenomena. Our middle-market premium is little over $200 million on an annualized basis. So it's irritant as we feel and -- but we\u2019re trying to work through the best we can as Doug said. I think the other context too is just the larger balance sheet. And you know we\u2019re one of a few companies that has disclosed our carried reserves in excess of our actuarial point estimates and at year-end \u201814, it was about 3.5%. We continue to grow that here in \u201815. So it\u2019s just a little minor irritant in relation to the larger reserve positions that we have for adverse deviations in the future. We\u2019re very satisfied with particularly as continuing to grow those positions here in \u201815.","Doug Elliot","Brian, I guess, the last point I\u2019ll just add over the top is as you know we continue to drive rate into that book of business, right. So I\u2019ve given you underwriting claim access but we\u2019re not forgetting about the need for rate to deal with that increased severity.","Brian Meredith","Great. Thank you.","Sabra Purtill","Operator, we\u2019re ready for the next question.","Operator","You next question comes from Michael Nannizzi. I apologize from Gary -- Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Michael Nannizzi","Thank you. Can you hear me?","Chris Swift","Yes, we can Michael.","Michael Nannizzi","Hello. Great. Doug, can we dig a little bit more into the auto -- the auto underlying combined deterioration year-over-year? Can you quantify, it looks like the expense ratio was higher? We can\u2019t really see that breakdown at the product level. Can you just help us understand like what the breakout between the expense ratio and this frequency deterioration wise?","Doug Elliot","Sure, Mike. Let me see if I can maybe walk third quarter \u201915 to second quarter, I\u2019m sorry, third quarter \u201914 to third quarter \u201915 for just to take you through that. So if you look at an X to X basis, I\u2019m going to walk from 90.9 to 95.6. The frequency dynamic in our auto book, both PD and liability, roughly 2.5 points, so that 4.5 point change, so frequency driving more than half of that change.","There\u2019s another point coming from ex-cat property. I talked about the fact that we've seen a few more fires, water losses in the quarter, so there's a point of that change coming from property. And then the other point or so is coming from expenses. So that's how I think about the 4.5 point move.","Michael Nannizzi","Okay. So what about just in auto?","Doug Elliot","In auto, you\u2019d have to rewrite that without the property premium. Obviously, the auto news has nothing to do with the homeowner change, right. So the 2.5 points waits up to within auto probably 3.7-ish or so.","The other point I would make when you think about the roll-forward with auto. We had a very favorable frequency quarter in third quarter 2014. So we're comparing a little bit of a move, a 3% frequency move third quarter \u201815 to a very favorable quarter last year makes the compare more challenging. But, nonetheless, our pick is where it needs to be for third quarter \u201815.","Michael Nannizzi","Okay. So, okay. Just if I can -- so if I look at the underlying combined in auto deteriorated 460 basis points year-over-year? So can you tell us of that 460 how much of that was the higher expenses? It looks like your expenses about a point higher across personal lines? I\u2019m just trying to figure out how much of that increase is expenses and how much of it is due to frequency?","Doug Elliot","So 100 to 110 basis points of the 450 would be the expense move?","Michael Nannizzi","Okay.","Doug Elliot","The frequency, I think, you have it is 250.","Michael Nannizzi","Okay. And the rest, okay, the rest of frequency. Okay, and then, so can you talk about the rate action that you\u2019ve taken so far and when do you expect to see this trend normalize?","Doug Elliot","I guess the few things. As I commented, this did emerge on us over the course of the summer. September reasonably performed. So not near the patterns we saw in July and August. We are though thinking we\u2019re in a different frequency environment. In fact, we have planned for that, right. So some of our plans in 2015 suggested that we were not to see some of the favorability we had seen in \u201814 and prior.","As we move forward, we obviously are watching carefully, right, whether we have a new norm of the frequency trend or not. I think it's early to call. I would not suggest that we think we\u2019re in a 3% go-forward world, but we are contemplating whether we need to move and how aggressively state-by-state.","Lastly, our indications and maybe I didn't say this before, as we think about our book of business, our frequency change does not look to be because of the new business we\u2019ve written over the past year or 18 months, it looks to be across our book, and yes, there is state profile.","So we\u2019re spending time with all the large states and also the small states. We\u2019re looking across all of our profiles. We\u2019re spending a lot of time on our renewal book and we\u2019ll be dealing with and are dealing with rate actions necessary to counteract where we see pressure inside the frequency.","Michael Nannizzi","Okay. Okay. And then just on the middle-market book, you\u2019ve mentioned a large property loss, can you tell us as far as component of the commercial business, how many points of the combined ratio that represented?","Doug Elliot","A large property loss.","Michael Nannizzi","I think you mentioned in middle-market, right.","Doug Elliot","I think I said [GL] [ph].","Michael Nannizzi","Okay.","Doug Elliot","So we had an old claim case in our primary liability book many years back, where as we worked our way to the core settlement process with this customer. We just decided it was a time we had to change our estimates and so we did that and that was a prior development move.","Michael Nannizzi","Okay. Okay. I thought I'd seen in the conference, in the presentation that you mentioned that you had a middle-market property loss, but I\u2019ll go ahead and take a look at that. I\u2019ll follow-up offline. Thanks.","Doug Elliot","Okay. You got it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gary Ransom with Dowling & Partners. Your line is open.","Gary Ransom","Good morning. A while back you talked about a new Small Commercial initiative through the AARP channel. And I was wondering if you could give us an update on where that stands?","Doug Elliot","Sure. Gary, this is Doug. We did launch an AARP initiative last summer, summer of 2014 with AARP. It has been slow to develop, but we've learned a lot. We continue to work that effort. The aggregate some of the premiums is not over-the-top of $10 million so this is still small dollars to us. But working with AARP and leveraging some of things we've done in Personal Lines, I think we've learned a lot and we continue to adjust and shift as we go forward and expect to continue the right customers that are a big part of the AARP program.","Gary Ransom","Do you think this can be something quite a bit bigger over the coming years?","Doug Elliot","I think it's early to call that, Gary. I'd rather give it a little bit more time. I think we probably on both sides expected a little bit more traction in the first year or so, but I\u2019m not deterred by that. I still think there are terrific customers that will become Hartford customers over time. We just have not been able to generate the traction that we expected yet.","Gary Ransom","Okay. And on the higher AARP marketing cost, is there any early read on what that has generated in terms of new sales as we come after that?","Doug Elliot","So it's a bit seasonal, Gary. As you know, we ramp up those efforts second half of the year, particularly leading into the January 2016 quarter. So we do not have the success yet that those marketing efforts are geared at, but I think we will over the coming months and obviously they\u2019ll be geared to geographies and our customer segments as well.","Gary Ransom","Okay. Thank you very much.","Doug Elliot","Thank you, Gary.","Operator","Your next question comes from Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Randy Binner","Hey, thank you. Couple of follow-ups on the frequency and then the commercial auto. So on frequency and personal auto, I just want to kind of get a simple point right, is that -- I think the narrative here is that the older drivers in this AARP heavy book are still different, is that right that they\u2019re safer drivers, they\u2019re just getting kind of caught up in collateral damage out there out on the roads?","And the other piece, the AARP question is can you talk a little bit about your pricing power to push that rate against the frequency experience in that book versus what we might see in a more wholesale channel?","Chris Swift","I think your first point is well taken and clearly history kind of plays that out. So our driving experience in our AARP financial experience has been very solid over a longer period of time. So yes, we believe exactly what you shared. Secondly, on the pricing piece, we\u2019re just going to have to work at this, right. This is a state-by-state, month-by-month effort.","Obviously, the premiums don't all earn in day one. We\u2019re going to have to chip away over the coming quarters. It's not a three or six month process, but it's one that has already begun and one that will accelerate as we look at these patterns that are coming at us today.","Randy Binner","Yeah. I mean, I guess I\u2019m thinking is like, I mean you should have better pricing power with an affinity channel, right. So I mean, have you -- I mean can you share how past pricing increases have gone in this channel? I mean, how good the retention or reception is?","Chris Swift","We share retention with you in our sub, so you\u2019ve seen very steady performance in our retention area. I would expect that to continue. Consistency is a big part of that performance, right. So we\u2019re very aware of how consistent we need to perform both in a state and a product basis. And I would say that across not only Personal Lines but small commercial as well.","So we intend to address the signals we\u2019re seeing here. We are going to watch carefully. But I think that our customer base is very well informed and I expect that our retention will remain strong moving through time.","Chris Swift","Randy, it is Chris.","Randy Binner","Okay.","Chris Swift","I think the only other observation to is probably little bit of industry tailwind helping all of us given others reacting to even higher frequency, and moving rate action in various state. So, most of our policies are on a 12-month basis given the more preferred marketplace. So we don't have a six-month -- lot of six-month of policy phenomenon but the actions the others that have taken, I think will lay a path that we could draft off of.","But we also do this in conjunction with our partner, AARP, right. I mean, it\u2019s their members. We want to be thoughtful we want to be consistent. We don\u2019t necessarily want to shock the system here. So, as Doug said this is a three-month phenomenon for us and we are not sure exactly where it's going to top out it but we know how do you manage the AARP relationship. We know how to manage our 50 state new regulators and I think our past performance has indicated that fairly well.","Randy Binner","Okay. Great. And then just jumping over commercial auto, I think Doug had mentioned that you are getting high single-digit price increases there and maybe that was a comment for the industry as well. But, I guess a simple question is, I mean, how do we get a sense of that\u2019s enough, the commercial autos was a problem during the financial crisis years and now it is the recovery -- financial recovery problem, if you will, with the 10 to 13 accident years.","It seems like these are probably litigated claims. I'm guessing where the medical is building up as well, correct me if I'm wrong there. But I mean there, is high single-digit enough. I mean, should we be getting -- should we be going forward double-digit price increases here? I mean kind of interested in reflection on that?","Chris Swift","Randy, a few points for you, one is that our high single digit is approaching double. It has been approaching double over the last several quarters. So, yes we are pushing of the curve. Secondly, we are seeing the benefit inside the early looks of our 2014 and 15 accident years.","So, I feel better about progress inside those years. Again, there is a liability line that takes a while to playout. So, I want some maturity before we make those calls. But I'm encouraged by progress and also the underwriting efforts underneath that are tweaking and adjusting our book of business both new and renewal continue to have their impact.","Randy Binner","All right. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks a lot.","Chris Swift","Operator, can I just make a comment before we take our next question. I think, Mike from Goldman asked a question about a property loss. I just want to come back to it. In the financial package, we did share that there was a property lost. It impacted our middle market book of business. We did have a $10 million net fire in that book of business. I think it was a point in change inside the combined ratios. So we commented on it in our disclosures. In the Midwest, I think there was a one-off but that is the answer to the fire question.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Nadel with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","John Nadel","Hi. Good morning, everybody. Doug, maybe to beat the dead horse of Personal Lines for a moment. If I look at the year-to-date underlying combined ratio, so excluding prior year excluding cats, I think you're running through the first nine months about 91.5% if my math is right. Your guide for 2015 was a range of 89 to 91, it doesn't seem like you\u2019ll get back to that unless you get some favorable weather or something else coming through in 4Q. But I guess the question is, as we look out to \u201816, if you saw that trends that developed here in the third quarter continue. What kind of range relative to that 89 to 91 which you think would be reasonable looking out?","Beth Bombara","I\u2019ll take that. John, it\u2019s Beth. So, I think we really want to get into providing \u201816 guidance at this point. I mean you're right, when we look at \u201815 in the combined that we provided at the beginning of the year, the 89 to 91 that probably running a bit about that by a point. And so as we look into preparing our views into \u201816 taking into consideration some of the actions that Doug is talking about will firm that up. But sitting here today, I think we would expect to be, kind of on the higher-end of that.","John Nadel","Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess, I have a question about the level of earnings for Talcott this quarter and thoughts on statutory capital from Talcott as well. So, Talcott\u2019s core earnings in the quarter and if I have it right, $107 million. You had the negative impact of lower alternatives returns, but I guess that was offset or maybe partially offset by better bond prepayment income.","I just sort of want to get a sense, if you had a 6% limited partnership or alternatives return there and more normal prepayments, what that segment would've looked like? And then given, you took a $500 million dividend out of Talcott in July, is it simply a matter of hedge gains given the negative market performance that drove statutory capital to be relatively flat quarter-over-quarter?","Beth Bombara","So, couple of things. So, first on the NII piece, you\u2019re right in that. The underperformance that we saw on the limited partnerships was really made up by the outperformance that we saw on these non-routine items. Just to give you a sense for the quarter for Talcott, it is probably around $30 million pre-tax of these non-routine items. So, I kind of think of those a little bit as a wash.","John Nadel","Okay.","Beth Bombara","On the surplus side, yeah, we did see a pretty sizeable increase in statutory surplus for Talcott, once you take out the effect of the demand and a couple of things. One, you're right in that because of the market performance during the quarter, we did have hedge gains and because our targets are more economic instead, the reserves did not move to the same degree. So, we had a benefit there.","The other items that impacted the quarter as well, was just the recognition of deferred tax assets. That number does tend to bounce around a lot quarter-to-quarter, just because of the way the recognition rules work. So that was also a significant piece of that. So, when I think about Talcott for the year is again, if you back out the impact of dividends, we see statutory surplus up almost $450 million.","I still go back to that $200 million to $300 million range we\u2019ve talked about before. I think it\u2019s at the beginning of the year. I was feeling more likely be at the lower end of that range to maybe slightly below. Sitting here today, I kind of see us now at the higher-end and potentially maybe a little bit about that. But it really is going to depend on where market conditions end for the quarter.","John Nadel","And just a real quick follow-up on that. That $200 to $300 million, if we are at the upper end of the range given where things and that's a 2016 dividend out of Talcott, correct?","Beth Bombara","So potentially, I think what we\u2019ve said is that we want to look and see how the year ends and some of that also. When you think about dividends, you\u2019ve got to think about where is the statutory surplus generation is coming from. It\u2019s coming from recognition of deferred tax assets. Those are hard to dividend out. They are not cash yet.","John Nadel","Understood. Yeah.","Beth Bombara","But as we said, we\u2019ll end the year. We will asses where we are. We do still anticipate taking out the $500 million in early \u201816 and we will evaluate what other capacity there could be depending on how we end the year.","John Nadel","Thank you so much.","Beth Bombara","Ian, we are ready for the next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open.","Meyer Shields","Thanks. Two quick questions if I can. First, could you give us a sense of the five of the renewal rights books that you\u2019ve got from AIG?","Chris Swift","Meyer, it\u2019s relatively small, think in terms of around $30 million.","Meyer Shields","Okay. And second, I think, you mentioned that you were growing in specialty large commercial property. I was hoping you can talk about that, because I think it could be one of the areas where pricing is particularly weak?","Doug Elliot","Meyer, this is Doug. We have been building capability in the public entity area for last couple years that area has quite a bit of activity in third quarter, because July one tends to be a big renewal crossover for that book of business. So, couple of underwriters in that area. We have nice success. It's really had some traction. I am very pleased about how that\u2019s gotten off the ground over last of couple years.","Meyer Shields","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jay Cohen","Yeah. Sure. One more on the auto frequency issue and that is, there seems to be a variance among companies as far as how they're experiencing this. We are clearly opting, Geico we have seen pick up in frequency, now you have, whereas seemingly Travelers and Progressive don't seem to be bothered nearly as much by this. And I know you don\u2019t know these companies, like you know your own company? But I'm wondering if you can reflect on some of the potential explanations for the differences we are seeing, we are all little confused by ourselves?","Chris Swift","Well, let me share some thoughts and maybe some other thoughts I have just shared. I guess, as you look at miles driven, just at the core, Jay. We're seeing gas prices remain at fairly low levels and the miles driven are up.","So as you think about parts of the country, we saw that over the middle part of the year and I think we just have more drivers and we have generally a better business climates. So we have both commercial and the person line drivers on the roads. It's hard to avoid accidents as they continue to occur.","Again, we are -- our book has performed well overtime and we are very pleased with that. But the fact that they're on the roads today, there are just more accidents and they are part of those accidents.","As we think about kind of further dissecting, there is a statewide mix as I mentioned earlier and I think that will continue to play out. I don't want to make projections of \u201916 and \u201917, but I think the state does matter congestion, et cetera.","So, it's early, I don't want to take two months and make too much of it, but I also want to give you indication that we are taking a very seriously, disappointed in our quarter and we are going to work hard to make sure we are connecting the pricing and our frequency discussions.","Doug Elliot","Jay, the only other observation I would have is, we\u2019ve said it before, I mean, our mature book is different than other aspects of others. So we don't know others company's books, as well as they know it, but all we know is that, the majeure driver does exhibit different driving patterns and different levels of frequency.","My only other industry observation and others, I have talked about it, but I've been more attuned to just particularly with teenager and young adult the drivers is, there is too many devices in cars these days, that are potentially creating a unfocused driver situation and I think it's real.","And I think, we all need to take personal responsibility to continue to put these devices down and focus on the road, because there is just too many distractions. That\u2019s all I will say on that.","Jay Cohen","Okay. Thanks for the thoughts guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jay Gelb of Barclays. Your line is open.","Jay Gelb","Thanks. My first question is on property\/casualty investment income? In the third quarter was $267 million. That included only a $5 million contribution from the limited partnerships and other alternative investments. So, Beth, I am trying to square your comments in terms of what that means for 4Q? I mean, should we expect the total net investment income for P&C to be below that $267 million in 4Q, if I understand the message you are trying to deliver?","Beth Bombara","Yes. So when you look at the compare from third quarter to fourth quarter, and we think about again the limited partnership return, we are expecting to see those be below what we say in the third quarter, just base on what we see today, so that would be negative. And as I commented, P&C did not -- doesn't really seem to benefit as much as the Talcott portfolio from some of these non-routine items that also impacted the compare.","Jay Gelb","Okay. And then, more broadly, would Hartford generating around the 9% return on equity in -- for the trailing 12 months? I think there is some concern now whether the company has the ability to get that higher in over the next year or so, and what are your thoughts on that?","Chris Swift","Jay, I think, we feel about the improvements, obviously, we have made over the last, couple of years. So, I know, you know, this team has worked hard to deliver that 9.1 trailing where we are today and we are going to finish the year strong and we will talk about our guidance for \u201816 and beyond in February.","But I think what we've been trying to signal particularly with my comments, Doug\u2019s comment, Beth\u2019s comments particularly on low interest rate, I mean there are serious competitive pressures. There is serious low interest rate pressures that are affecting the industry\u2019s book of business. And we\u2019re not going to be immune to it.","So I would still say that we think we have levers to continue to manage and expand our ROEs going forward. But clearly it's not at the rate and pace that we've been able to deliver in the past.","Jay Gelb","Understanding the guidance won\u2019t come in totally next year, can you direct -- qualitatively can you give us some insight on those levers?","Chris Swift","Well, you know, Doug\u2019s talked about it here just in the Personal Lines book. I mean, it\u2019s underwriting actions, it\u2019s pricing action, it\u2019s a mix of business action. We\u2019re trying to be a more efficient organization, while we invest in some of our new capabilities, particularly technology.","As I mentioned, coming out of CIAB, I think we have the opportunity to expand our market share, not competing on price, but by delivering more products and services to our existing customer base and they would do more business with us. So those are just, some of those on top of my thought.","Jay Gelb","Excellent. Hopefully capital management as well?","Chris Swift","Not clearly. I\u2019m focused on the numerator as you know. So but we do -- we have our plan through \u201816, which I think you know is meaningful and will contribute to our performance.","Jay Gelb","Thanks for the answers.","Chris Swift","Thank you, Jay.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tom Gallagher, Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning. One follow-up on the prior-year development in commercial auto, so understanding the higher medical costs that you saw this quarter. Doug, is that what you\u2019ve been assuming from the standpoint of \u201814 and later loss -- initial loss picks or is that if medical costs remain at that level, you'd also have an issue there?","Doug Elliot","So Tom, we are expecting some of that pattern that we've now seen emerge in 2010 through 2013, to also emerge in 2014 and beyond. So, yes we\u2019ve become a bit more conservative in our development factors in those outer months in the most recent accident years.","Tom Gallagher","So, in other words, if those elevated medical costs remain -- continue as is, you shouldn't have adverse development on \u201814 and later?","Chris Swift","Correct. That was our goal. That's why we made the move.","Tom Gallagher","Okay. The other question I had is there was -- I guess for Beth, there was a $200 million capital contribution to a property casualty, U.K. runoff entity. Can you just provide a little color what's going on there? Is that a business you're planning on selling, anymore capital going to be needed there?","Beth Bombara","Sure. So, yeah, we've been in the process of consolidating our U.K. P&C runoff businesses into a single legal entity. And so what we were disclosing with some of the activity that happened in October is this process does require court approval. We received it on October 13th, and so the capital moved around within the entities.","This really is consolidating this business into one legal entity, has a couple of advantage. One actually is more efficient from a capital perspective when you take into consideration the capital standards in the U.K. And it also allows us to consolidate operations, which gives us a little bit of operational efficiency.","The second point is it does provide us greater flexibility to potentially act on more permanent solutions to dealing with these types of exposures. Think about this group of business is having reserve about $800 million and I\u2019d say little less than 60% of that is asbestos exposure. But I\u2019m not going to comment on the likelihood that we actually would be able to find such a solution.","Tom Gallagher","Okay. And then if I could just sneak in one last one, Beth. For the 4Q, actuarial review or balance sheet review that we should expect for Talcott, when I consider your long-term separate account return assumptions which are still north of 8%, is that a meaningful risk as we think about current interest rate level and potentially changing that as it would relate to a DAC impairment?","Beth Bombara","Yes. So, correct. And that we do look at the DAC assumptions and other reserve assumptions in Talcott in the fourth quarter. Sitting here today, I think couple of things to keep in mind. You are right that our long-term assumption is in that 8% range, but we\u2019ve benefitted from many, many quarters of outperformance to that, which actually when you think about how the DAC calculation works gives you a little bit of buffer on that. So sitting here today, I do not see any changes in long-term expectations that would impact our views of that balance as we head into the fourth quarter.","Tom Gallagher","Okay. Thanks.","Beth Bombara","Thanks. Ian, I think we have one more question in the queue, if we could take that?","Operator","Your next question comes from Bob Glasspiegel with Janney Capital. Your line is open.","Bob Glasspiegel","Good morning, Hartford. I was just wondering if we could just look a little bit more carefully at the homeowners\u2019 book where you\u2019ve been sort of pushing 8% rate increases and retentions being dropping a little bit. The margins aren\u2019t -- you're not making a lot of progress year-over-year, which you highlighted sort of the fluky fire losses this quarter. Have you ruled out sort of any adverse selection going on in that book and what is your overall pricing versus exposure growth doing today?","Chris Swift","Bob, you're right. We have had some up-and-down behavior of that book of business that has been disappointing to us. We're spending a lot of time at a granular level inside that book of business by state, et cetera. I think more progress to come but not satisfied at all about our results.","Leaning into the fourth quarter, the fourth quarter traditionally has been our best quarter of homeowners\u2019 performance. So, we hope to continue that in the fourth quarter but there are things, some of which you described that we are aggressively cutting apart as we speak right now to make sure there isn't an adverse element there. I don't believe that\u2019s the case today. But right now, leaving no stone unturned.","Bob Glasspiegel","Fair thoughtfully answer. Is there any difference between the agency and the AARP book versus the similar profile?","Doug Elliot","The AARP book has performed well across both our product lines. But I would say that home has underperformed in general in both areas. So, we are not accepting and feeling great about our homeowners\u2019 results across both channels and looking at all.","Chris Swift","Hey, Bob, it\u2019s Chris. I would add in addition to Doug\u2019s thoughtful comments, as you said, home is very strategically important to us, it\u2019s important to the AARP relationship, it\u2019s probably a product line that we\u2019ve underinvested. And we\u2019re catching up quite honestly, but we\u2019re committed to catching up and providing more homeowners insurance to more AARP members, whether it\u2019d be on a direct basis or through agents. So no, it\u2019s got our retention. And as Doug said, we\u2019re trying to fix it as quickly as possible.","Bob Glasspiegel","I think the industry is moving from that being an accommodation product to being the standalone P&L item and the professionalism of your competitors has certainly been enhanced. So I think the opportunity to achieve that is there for sure.","Doug Elliot","Bob, I would agree with that. And I just I think I referred this. But clearly our performance in the AARP states has been closer to our targets than our agency performance, right. So we\u2019ve got more work to be done in the agency area, but in total, as I look across the line still not pleased that we\u2019re not quite where we want to be.","Bob Glasspiegel","Thank you.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you. And Ian, I believe I misspoke there is one more question in the queue.","Operator","Your final question comes from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi, good morning. I had a couple of questions. First, on the Personal Lines business, one of the reasons of the weakness obviously was higher AARP Direct marketing spending so -- and obviously that\u2019s a controllable factor. So just wondering what\u2019s your expectation for spending over the next few quarters? And if your loss costs do remain elevated, do you intend to slow down spending a little bit to balance out profitability?","And then secondly, on buybacks, you spent about $300 million on buybacks in the third quarter, I realized you\u2019re on the10b-5 program, but to what extent do you have the capacity or the intent to be more proactive on buybacks given that you\u2019ve got the capital already? So if the stock price drops further, would you may be front end some of the buyback activity?","Chris Swift","Jimmy, let me address the first part of your question and then maybe Beth wants to work on the second.","Jimmy Bhullar","Sure.","Chris Swift","We\u2019re obviously being always through the fourth quarter we have the ability to kind of look at and address what we\u2019re going to spend in the next 60, 90 days and we\u2019re doing that as we speak given the trends we\u2019re seeing.","Second part of the answer I would share with you is that although I have characterized it as marketing spend, obviously part of that is the ability in our service centers to handle the demand that comes out of the marketing spend. So it is really a marketing spend in the aggregate and we\u2019re making sure that if for running ads on a weekend we are ready to handle those requests as they come in. So it\u2019s a combination of both generating frontline response and also being able to handle the flow as it comes to our centers.","Beth Bombara","And then on the question on share buyback, yeah we did $300 million this past quarter and you are right, our practice has been to put in trading plan. So for the fourth quarter, our trading plan is around $350 million. We can always be opportunistic.","As you know, our practice has been to really spread that out over the period. We\u2019ve seen that has worked very well for us, but it doesn\u2019t mean from time to time that we might take advantage of some opportunistic trades, but don\u2019t anticipate to deviate significantly from how we thought about this in the past.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. Thanks. And maybe if I could just ask one final question. On your annuity business, you fixed annuity surrenders run up, I think that because of the enhanced surrender value program that you initiated in June. So, maybe if you could just address the scope of that and has the benefit of that come through already or do you expect additional or continue elevated lapses and into the fourth quarter? And then on the VA business, your surrenders actually went down, so how much of that is just because of the drop in account values versus maybe that in the past they were elevated just given the surrender value programs that you had before?","Beth Bombara","Yeah. So just the VA piece first. So, yes, we have seen a little bit of a decline in the VA surrender rate. You\u2019re right, in a market where we would see equity levels go down, we would typically tend to see those surrender rates act accordingly. But we do believe that there\u2019s a little bit of the impact of the actions we\u2019ve taken had in the past and front ended some of the surrender.","So when we think about surrender rate absent any other programs that we might do in the variable annuity space, we do see then being a little bit lower than maybe what the run rate has been in the past.","And then on the ISB, the program that we have in the fixed annuity book, we did benefit in the quarter from that. There is still some activity that\u2019s happening in the fourth quarter, so we might see continuously a little bit of bump from that and then as we go into \u201916, it just remains to see what other type of initiatives we might do.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. Thank you.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you. And thank you all for joining us today and your interest in The Hartford. Please note for your calendars that The Hartford will be presenting at the Goldman Sachs Financial Services Conference on December 9th in New York City. And as always, if you have any follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to contact either Sean or myself by phone or e-mail.

My name is Keesha, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Hartford Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Miss Purtill, you may begin your conference.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome, everyone, to the Hartford's Fourth Quarter 2011 Financial Earnings Conference Call. The press release, financial supplement and slide presentation for today's call are posted in the investor information section of our website. Liam McGee, The Hartford's Chairman, President and CEO has some opening comments, after which, Chris Swift, our CFO, will provide a financial overview. We will then open the call for questions. Other members of our senior management team are also present for our call, including Doug Elliot, Alan Kreczko, Dave Levenson, Andy Napoli, Bob Rupp and Hugh Whelan.","Please note that as discussed on Page 2 of the presentation, any statements made today concerning The Hartford's future results or actions should be considered forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results may differ materially. We assume no obligation to update these statements. ","You should also consider the important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, which are listed in our press release, our third quarter 10-Q, 2010 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC. ","In our presentation, we use some financial measures that are not derived from Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP. Definitions and reconciliations of these measures to the comparable GAAP measures are provided in our financial filings. I'll now turn the call over to Liam.","Liam E. McGee","Thank you, Sabra. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Last evening, we announced fourth quarter results that were in line with what we discussed in December, with book value per diluted share up 17% over the last year. Results were improved from the third quarter, but 2011 was a challenging year with the weak macroeconomic environment and unusually bad weather.","We're encouraged by some of the recent economic developments. Domestic business activity, employment data and consumption trends all suggest a return to moderate GDP growth. And the European Central Bank's additional support measures have had a positive impact in the marketplace. But we remain cautious about the operating environment for 2012. Many of the factors -- low interest rates and market volatility -- are likely to continue to have some impact in 2012.","So given this environment, as we said in December, we are aggressively managing the levers within our control to increase profitability and generate shareholder value. Across the organization, as you'll hear, we are prioritizing profit over sales volume, driving greater expense efficiencies and growing where we are generating appropriate return.","In Commercial Markets, we achieved accelerated rate increase across most P&C Commercial lines. As we expected, pricing crossed the inflection point and exceeded loss costs for most of our lines in the fourth quarter. As these written pricing changes earn in over 2012, we expect to see margin expansion throughout the P&C Commercial portfolio, particularly in our Middle Market book.","Doug and his team have accomplished a great deal since his arrival. They're making material improvements across their business like building our property capabilities to move us to a more diversified P&C Commercial book. We now have dedicated property specialists in each of our Middle Market regions. And in addition, we've hired several senior underwriters to strengthen our core property team and have significantly enhanced our property risk tools. This focused effort has already turned several strong prospects into Hartford customers. ","We've also realigned the sales force against customer segments for both Commercial and Consumer Markets. This will increase our responsiveness to customers, brokers and agents, while heightening accountability for results.","In Consumer Markets, Andy and his team have focused the book on a more targeted, preferred customer segment. This strategy is paying off with notable margin improvement in the fourth quarter.","The AARP relationship continues to be a competitive advantage for us. Along with strong new business growth in the AARP Direct business, we are seeing good momentum with the AARP products sold through the agency channel. About 80% of new business is hitting our targeted, mature preferred demographic.","For Wealth Management, as you know, we separated several of the division's businesses into a Runoff segment in December. The financials are broken out for the first time this quarter, so you can better evaluate progress on our ongoing businesses as well as those in Runoff.","Earlier this week, we appointed a new, separate, dedicated leadership team for the group, with Dave Bedard, the former CFO for Wealth Management, heading the team. Dave is a 26-year finance veteran with expert knowledge of these and other complex financial products. Dave will be joined by Aidan Kidney, who was the CEO and President of our Japan business; and Peter Sannizzaro, who was most recently CFO of the Global Annuity business. I'm pleased that Dave, Aidan and Peter are taking on these important new roles.","This team is charged with more efficiently managing these blocks of business, reducing their size, risk, volatility and capital consumption, and we will run this business as its own segment with segregated financials.","In the ongoing Wealth Management businesses, Dave Levenson and his team are focused on increasing returns and managing risk in this low-rate environment. As an example, we've raised rates on Life Insurance several times in the last 18 months. We also believe that our targeted product and distribution initiatives are ensuring that we successfully compete in the marketplace and achieve adequate returns.","For example, we recently announced an agreement where Wellington Management will serve as the sole subadvisor, pending the mutual fund board approval for The Hartford's fixed income and equity mutual funds. Our largest distribution partners are excited about this relationship as it positions The Hartford as a more significant player in the fixed income space and the mutual fund industry overall.","In Life Insurance, we have significantly expanded our distribution efforts, opening up new sales channels. We're maintaining our leadership in wirehouses and banks, but the independent channel now makes up about 48% of our total sales.","As you know, we are also focused on driving greater efficiency at The Hartford and are making good progress toward our aggregate $450 million target by streamlining operations, rationalizing management layers and leveraging technology. This is a 3-year effort. We reduced run rate expenses by $150 million in 2011, and we'll continue to deliver on this objective in '12 and '13.","Fourth quarter results also demonstrated the effectiveness of our risk management capabilities. We discussed our Japan hedging program in detail back in October and the year-end surplus performed in line with what we told you in December. As a result of continued confidence in our capital position, in December, we began repurchasing shares. We have bought back just under $100 million of shares to date and expect to be active in the market again shortly. We intend to complete the full $500 million share buyback by early second quarter 2012.","With the company stabilized and strengthened, our entire team is working to increase shareholder value. We do not believe the current stock price reflects the true value of the company. And so as I said in December at our investor presentation, we are evaluating our strategy and our business portfolio for opportunities to deliver greater value for shareholders. We will be objective and pragmatic about the best ways to achieve this goal.","I'll now turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher John Swift","Thank you, Liam. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 5. As Liam mentioned, fourth quarter results were in line with the outlook we provided in December. We saw areas of good performance throughout the ongoing businesses that provide positive momentum for 2012. Fourth quarter core earnings were $339 million, including a $47 million DAC unlock benefit.","On Slide 5, you'll see several items that adversely impacted core earnings this quarter. These items totaled $69 million, including several items that I estimated at our Investor Day. The principal difference was that the original estimate was for catastrophe losses, which totaled $14 million pretax.","During the quarter, we had $39 million of new cat losses that were offset by $25 million of favorable development on second and third quarter cats. This compares to our fourth quarter estimate of about $50 million. In addition, we had favorable DAC unlock of $47 million. At Investor Day, we estimated fourth quarter core earnings would be between $0.80 and $0.85 per diluted share. Adjusted for the items that we just discussed, actual results were $0.83.","Returns on alternative investments, which are volatile, were essentially 0 in the quarter versus $67 million pretax in the third quarter. Fund valuations were negatively impacted by third quarter equity market performance. Given the typical one quarter lag, we'd expect alternative returns to rebound in the first quarter of 2012.","On Slide 6, we have broken out fourth quarter core earnings into our ongoing and Runoff divisions. These numbers exclude the Corporate division, which reflects holding company interest income and expenses. Going forward, we'll provide you with this breakout on a quarterly basis to clearly show the earnings performance of our ongoing businesses.","On Slide 7, book value per diluted share rose to $47.25, an increase of 17% over the last 12 months. Excluding AOCI, book value per diluted share rose by 6% to $44.86. These amounts do not reflect the implementation of the new DAC accounting standard, which is effective January 1 of this year. After adoption, all-in book value will decline about $1.5 billion or $3.09 per share. We will publish restated 2011 segment results that reflect the impact of the new accounting standard in March.","As Liam mentioned, we began our share repurchase program in December. Through early 2012, we have completed $94 million of the $500 million authorization. We will be active in the market very soon and intend to complete the authorization by early second quarter of 2012.","Let's turn to our business results by segment. Slide 8 shows the summary results for Commercial Markets. Core earnings were $40 million compared with $231 million in the prior year. This quarter results reflect adverse reserve development in P&C Commercial as well as challenges in Group Benefits. P&C Commercial reported core earnings of $25 million, reflecting the $109 million pretax of net prior year development and $87 million pretax of current year development.","These increases, which we discussed in early December, reflect higher claim frequency on the 2010 accident year in our Worker's Compensation book and the roll-forward impact on the 2011 accident year. The increase in frequency is an industry-wide trend. The current accident year reserve strengthening was 5.6 points on the fourth quarter combined ratio of 101.5 x cats and x prior year. Early indications of claim activity since this adjustment show our estimates for 2010 and 2011 are holding, but it's still early for these accident years.","As Liam mentioned, we saw accelerating rate increases across all lines in the fourth quarter. Overall, renewal pricing increased 5% with stronger results in our Middle Market business, where we achieved a 10% increase on workers' comp renewals. This grew from 7.5% in October to over 11% in December. We did see a decline in retention, but we are willing to shed some renewal business to improve margins.","Shifting to Group Benefits. Core earnings of $15 million were below our expectations. The loss ratio of 80.5 reflected elevated disability incidents. Our management actions have been focused on improving pricing to offset loss ratio pressure. We continue our highly selective pricing approach, targeting specific rate actions on a case-by-case basis. While we are making progress in putting more rate into the book, the market remains competitive for well-performing accounts.","Consumer Markets core earnings of $83 million are summarized on Slide 9. The combined ratio x cats x prior year was 93.0, 3.8 points better than prior year. This largely reflects 2011 price increases earning into our book of business, particularly in auto. New business written premium rebounded strongly in the second half of 2011. It's now back to acceptable levels after a decline in 2010 and the first half of 2011. These improvements are a direct result of targeted new business initiatives and the expansion of the AARP Agency platform. While new business and retention have increased significantly year-over-year, we have not yet reached the pivot point where new business outweighs non-renewals. Our retention level in auto has improved by 2 points to 83%, still a few points below our target. Improving retention remains a key goal for this segment.","Turning to Slide 10. Wealth Management core earnings x DAC unlock were $155 million, 11% lower than prior year. This decrease was largely due to 11% decline in assets under management, primarily from net outflows in Individual Annuities. As a reminder, results for International Annuity, Institutional Annuity and Private Placement Life Insurance are included in the Runoff division, not Wealth Management.","Individual core earnings -- Individual Annuity core earnings x the DAC unlock were $86 million, down 10% from prior year. Sales improved in the quarter, marking the first sequential sales increase since 2008. We also have began rolling out our new fixed indexed annuity. As we said in December, we are optimistic about growing the annuity business, but our timeframe is not unlimited.","In terms of risk return trade-off, we like our balanced product position. Our VA product is priced for competitive returns, and the product design prudently balances our risk management appetite with customer needs. This innovative design is working from a risk management perspective and offers features that appeal to consumers.","Individual Life core earnings x DAC unlock were $40 million, $4 million lower than prior year, reflecting modestly elevated mortality in the quarter. Fourth quarter Individual Life sales were strong. It's important to note that we did not win this business by being the low-cost provider. Our pricing is responsible, and we can achieve adequate returns on the business we're putting on the books.","With that said, the current interest rate environment is causing pricing pressure. In order to stay ahead of this, we have made periodic pricing adjustments, including the increase we made earlier this week. The catalyst behind the increase in fourth quarter Life Insurance sales were our innovative product riders and a focus on expanded distribution. Sales grew in every distribution channel, including a 58% increase in sales through P&C agents.","Retirement Plans core earnings x DAC unlock were $9 million, $2 million lower than prior year, reflecting spread compression on the general account products. Assets under management were flat, and deposits were down 2%, primarily reflecting weakness in the tax-exempt market. We are pleased with the progress we're making to grow the 401(k) business. Sales were up modestly in the quarter, and our efforts to expand distribution are beginning to pay off. Sales in the $5 million to $25 million Middle Market space were up 29% and sales in the P&C channel grew 33%.","Mutual Fund core earnings at $20 million were $4 million lower than last year, reflecting a 15% decline in retail assets under management. This quarter was challenging for the mutual fund industry, in particular for equity funds. Right now, about 2\/3 of our mutual fund AUM is in equity funds. As Liam mentioned, our expanded partnership with Wellington strengthens our product offering by providing competitive products for various economic environments. As a result, over time, we expect our concentration in equity funds to be reduced and to have a more balanced fund family.","The results for our Runoff division are on Slide 11. Core earnings x DAC unlock were $84 million. We have provided additional details on the Runoff division in the IFS. As Liam mentioned, we recently named a new management team for the Life portion of the division. We look forward to updating you on the progress they are making to more efficiently manage these blocks of business in the quarters ahead.","Slide 12 has the results of the hedging program. The program continues to work as designed. As you would expect, in a rising equity market, we generate realized losses, but these losses are offset by reductions in required reserves. On a GAAP basis, VA generated a net loss of $430 million. On a statutory basis, VA generated a gain of $107 million as the decline in the VA carbon liability was greater than the change in value of the hedges. The difference in results on a GAAP versus statutory basis reflects the inherent differences in the accounting for the liabilities.","The investment portfolio performed well this quarter. As you can see on Slide 13, impairments and changes to the mortgage loan loss reserve were $35 million. Our net unrealized gain position improved to $2.8 billion pretax, largely due to declining interest rates. Our portfolio yield was 4.1% excluding alternatives, down 10 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2010.","Given the Fed's recent announcement that it plans to keep short-term interest rates at historic lows through 2014, we updated our sensitivity analysis of lower rates on our investment portfolio on Slide 14. If interest rates stay flat through 2014, as opposed to following the forward curve, the impact to our outlook for after-tax core earnings is negligible in 2012, given the low level of rates. The impact on the current portfolio rises to $30 million to $40 million in 2013 and up to $100 million in 2014 under this scenario. Importantly, these impacts do not reflect any changes we would make in our investment strategy to offset extended period of low interest rates.","On Slide 15 is our statutory surplus roll forward. Surplus levels at the end of the quarter were essentially unchanged at both the P&C and Life companies. VA-related impacts to surplus were a positive $300 million. Increased reserves related to cash flow testing resulted in a negative non-VA statutory earnings for the Life company of $100 million.","During the quarter, we contributed $100 million to Champlain Life Reinsurance, our Life Insurance captive, to reflect the impact of lower interest rates on Life Insurance-related reserves. This contribution was primarily funded from Life company resources.","On Slide 16, you can see that we ended the year with a strong balance sheet. We have over $17.7 billion of resources in the U.S. insurance operations and Japan and at the holding company. We ended the year with $1.6 billion of holding company resources, down $500 million from September 30. $400 million of this decline relates to the October debt repayment. In addition, we completed $51 million of share repurchases before the end of the year.","For the first quarter of 2012, we expect results to be in the range of $0.85 to $0.90 per diluted share. The improvement reflects a rebound in alternative investment returns, as well as seasonality and catastrophe budgets and assumed weather-related losses. The budget for first quarter catastrophes is about $70 million pretax.","For the full year 2012, as we discussed in December, we see core earnings of $3.30 to $3.60 per diluted share x DAC unlock and prior-year development.","Before I wrap up, we have received a number of calls from investors recently looking for our perspectives on the idea of separating the P&C and Life companies. The company has reviewed this idea in the past, but this management team recently took a fresh look with assistance from advisers. We wanted to share with you some of the meaningful challenges to creating shareholder value via a split that may not be fully understood.","As you can see on Slide 17, these challenges fall into 3 categories: the interplay of ratings and debt allocation, the need for regulatory approval and other costs. Put briefly, due to the Life company's current limited capacity to generate statutory earnings and dividends, at least 2\/3 of our current holding company debt would need to be allocated to the P&C group. As a consequence, we would need to take potentially dilutive actions at the P&C company to de-lever its balance sheet. As a condition of approval, our regulators might require capital contributions or keep-well agreements between the standalone companies. In addition, we would have to deal with other challenges to creating shareholder value, including those listed on the slide.","So you can see that there are significant challenges to creating shareholder value from a separation of the companies. In closing, although we have accomplished much over the past 2 years, we know more is required in order to create ROE expansion and deliver more consistent operating performance. As we've said, we are evaluating our strategy and business portfolio for opportunities to deliver greater value for shareholders. We will be objective and pragmatic about the best way to achieve these goals.","As we start 2012, we are confident that our portfolio review, balance sheet strength, business momentum and efficiency plans will position us well to achieve these goals we have set for the organization.","At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Sabra to begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Sabra Purtill","Thank you, Chris. [Operator Instructions] Keesha, could you please poll the call for questions?","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I had 2 questions for you. Thanks for the update on the -- what you view as the challenges to separate the Life and the P&C companies. And you talked about the financial reasons why it may not make sense, but I'd like to hear your thoughts, strategically, whether you feel these 2 operations should still be together.","Liam E. McGee","Thanks for the question. As we said, and I think Chris's comments were pretty complete in addition to the slide, there are significant challenges to making a split possible. We're not unaware of some of the potential benefits if it was possible in terms of greater focus, but it's, in our view, the challenges are fairly significant at the present time.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then as a follow-up, Liam, in terms of the process, in terms of looking at which units are potentially underperforming or need to be reduced in presence, I mean, when will we get some more news on that?","Liam E. McGee","Well, Jay, let's go back to -- thanks again for the follow-up. Let's go back to our December investor conference, and as you recall, in my remarks, I did break the company down into a portfolio businesses, I think, at a fairly granular fashion, then I made comments on each of the businesses in terms of, first of all, where it stood relative to its current returns and our growth, or profit maximization, strategies. And as you recall, in the top right quadrant, there were a number of businesses that have actually very current attractive returns, and we're trying to grow those because we can do so profitably. And then some of them, in the middle to bottom left, that have below optimal returns today, and we're really working hard to maximize the profitability. Since we met with you in December, I would say this team is working on that very thoroughly, very rigorously, and we have a sense of urgency about doing that. Because first of all, we're not -- we don't believe the current stock price reflects the value of the company. We're evaluating these businesses individually by their ROE, their capital generation and their future capital requirements or capital consumption, their risk profile and their growth potential. And what I'll say is we're being objective, rigorous and thorough about the types of actions that might enable us to achieve the goal of increasing shareholder value, and I think we'll keep you informed as we make those decisions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Wanted to draw down a bit more just on the commentary regarding the strategy that you alluded to in December. Can you maybe just put some parameters around what this may or may not include? And then how are you thinking about sort of balancing your review, sort of, with kind of the voices you've been hearing from investors in terms of their patience and in terms of generating shareholder value?","Liam E. McGee","Thanks, Chris, for the question. I think I commented pretty extensively in the prior question about the process we're going through. I'd add a couple of other things. First of all, in this environment, this management team is very focused on managing the levers that we can control. I think the progress we've made on making the company more efficient in '11 and will continue to do so in '12 and '13 are appropriate and necessary in view of the current low interest rate environment and the market volatility. The balance sheet is much stronger today, starting with the investment portfolio. The progress that we've made there over the last 2 years, number one. Secondly, the transparency we gave you in October around our balance sheet. Japan, our overall VA book, our ability to withstand stress scenarios. I think our risk management, enterprise risk management, is much stronger and enables us to manage the company better. And we are seeing benefits as a result of our 3 customer-aligned businesses. Just to reiterate, the management team does not believe that the current share price reflects the value of the company. I think we've -- to your point Chris, we've heard that from shareholders, and we've heard it from some other observers, and I think that's why we're communicating very clearly that we are -- we will be objective and pragmatic about the types of actions that may best enable our goal -- to achieve our goal of realizing greater value for shareholders.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then, just wanted to follow-up on sort of Slide 17 here, I guess focusing more on the Life side of things. You point to kind of not having infinite patience on the VA business and potentially doing something. And you alluded in December that you wouldn't rule out putting that into Runoff. So I guess if you put that into runoff, you'd have a lot of the Wealth Management business in the Runoff block, so why would there be such an intense focus on preserving the single A rating if so much of the business was in Runoff? And could you look to then potentially sell some of the remaining attractive assets like the Group or Mutual Fund business?","Liam E. McGee","Well, Chris, I -- Chris Swift may have some comment on this as well. I'd just remind you that -- first of all, let's talk about the VA business for a moment. We're well aware of the questions about our strategy in the U.S. VA book. I think in short, we believe we have the components we need to succeed in the business. Distribution, new products that have been out relatively short period of time and, as Chris noted, some period-over-period momentum, and we're seeing signs of that continue early on in the year. In addition, the macro environment appears to be shifting in a way to it'd be more favorable to the types of products that we're offering. However, and just to reiterate what I said in December, I think I was very clear on this, to your question, we are managing the business very closely, watching the trends. David Levenson, I think, is watching them very closely. Our timeframe, as I said in December and as Chris reiterated, is not unlimited. And we do need and I need to see meaningful progress in profitable sales in the near future. So I think that's very consistent with the tone and the statements that we made in December, and I think an appropriate position. In terms of ratings, I'll just say at high level. First of all, I think the notion that if we were to decide to put U.S. VA into Runoff, that it would create immediate material amounts of capital liberated is not true in our view, number one. And number two, remember that we have other businesses -- the Mutual Fund business, the Life business and the Retirement business -- that are very ratings sensitive, and we would -- if we were able to do that scenario, we would not want to do anything that would destroy their value. Chris, anything you'd add to that?","Christopher John Swift","No, I think that's well said, particularly on the businesses. I think the only other point on allocating 1\/3 of the debt to the holding company. Chris, I think you remember that we believe statutory earnings and capital generation, particularly in the near-term '12, is limited. So allocating almost 2\/3 of the holding company debt is probably even aggressive on the surface. But Liam, I think your points are good as far as the impacts of other business if those decisions are taken.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel with Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Two quick ones. So just to follow-up real quick on Slide 17. I guess my question is, it seems like debt allocation or just debt levels might be an impediment here or might be one of the most meaningful impediments here. So I guess it begs the question, why not spend your excess capital, instead of on share repurchases, on debt paydown, at least to provide some optionality to you?","Christopher John Swift","Yes, John, it's Chris. Thanks for the question, and -- the debt restructuring is a priority for us. I think given how we've defined deployable capital in the past, roughly about $500 million, we've targeted the share buyback as a higher priority, the most accretive to shareholders. But the debt restructuring and its associated impact on earnings and leverage is high on the list, and it's something that we think about very aggressively.","Liam E. McGee","Well said, Chris and I think it's not only from a flexibility perspective, John, but also just a carrying cost perspective on some of the components of our debt that you're well aware of. So I think the management team is very focused. We're proud of the strengthening we've done on the balance sheet in the first couple of years, but your question is a very appropriate one that Chris and I and the management team are factoring in, things like share repurchase, potential warrant repurchases, etc.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And then just a quick one on the Life company capital. Certainly, given strong equity markets in the quarter, I was pleased to see the $300 million improvement in the statutory capital from the VA business. Obviously, interest rates remain a pressure point. Following the moves in the Life company statutory capital and the reserves, where would you estimate the risk-based capital would come in for year end?","Christopher John Swift","Yes, John, it's Chris again. I'd say thanks for noticing the decent recovery in VA. I would also just point out that as we closed out year end, particularly in the life insurance business, so we updated our cash flow testing analysis, and that created a little bit of a headwind for us. But when you put it all together, we wouldn't estimate that our main company is -- RBC is between $415 million and $420 million. Our capital at White River Re is well in excess of $125-basis-point target, and we have approximately $400 million of actual tangible surplus there. In Champlain, we did make a capital contribution to Champlain. $80 million of that was funded by the Life company. So we sent a dividend up to the holding company of $80 million contributed back to Champlain with another $20 million of holding company resources. So Champlain is above our targets and it actually has $265 million of stated surplus, and then you saw the $1.3 billion of surplus in Japan. If you put it all together, we actually feel pretty good about our statutory resources in the various entities.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Finkelstein with Evercore Partners.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Sort of a follow-up to John's question. Chris, you talked about statutory capital flattish sequentially, obviously, markets were up but that had a mark-to-market on the derivatives, which overwhelmed the reserve change. Not to get too technical, but -- I guess what I'm asking is, at what point in the market, if we continue to go up, would you actually see that reversal where you actually start increasing your statutory capital as the reserve changes are more meaningful than the mark-to-market on the derivatives?","Christopher John Swift","Mark, it's Chris, thanks. I would say to just this context, the U.S. equity markets were up nicely. I mean, but the other markets where we are participate in with our Japanese annuity blocks, I would say, were mixed to down. I mean, if you look at interest rates, if you look at Europe, if you look at Japan, the Nikkei was substantially down. So I think the positive impacts on VA carbon reserves in the Life book were offset by the net negatives around the world. That said, I think you're really trying to -- and we've talked about it before, is measured sort of the inflection point of where things start to turn positive from a capital generation side. And I'll just go back to our comments that we do see substantial capital generation in '13 and beyond, obviously, as market levels improve. I don't think there's a precise number I'd give you, but when you're north of 13,070 and approaching those types of levels, I mean, it really does take a lot of pressure off the VA CARVM reserves. As you know, we've talked about somewhat -- those being on a lag. But there's not a precise thing. It's just, I'll call it, continued healing, but there's also, I would say, a lot of continued pressure in the low interest rate environment also. So you could have a medium impact of just looking at one equity market index, and you really got to consider all our indices that go into liability calculation.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a question on the Variable Annuity business. You're launching some new products. It feels like the products are a little bit more consistent with some of the living benefit guarantees that are out there in the market, so you're kind of -- feels like you're jumping, kind of, into that, kind of, game little bit. And it's a little bit -- feels like a little bit of a different strategy than what it's been, which is kind of pick your spots, very focused on kind of lower risk but some -- obviously, value to the consumer. So I'm just curious about the product that you're selling, how you think it's positioned and, I guess ultimately, how you're making sure that the risk management around it is very robust?","David N. Levenson","So Mark, this is Dave Levenson. Thanks for the question. So as it relates to the new product filing, which is what you're referring to, we are always looking to make improvements in products as part of the normal course of business. So what you saw was clearly a filing for the Annuity business, but as we're in a quiet period with the SEC, I really don't want to comment too much as it relates to the details. Our absolute focus right now is really on growing the business with the product portfolio that we have today. As it relates to your question around profitability and risk, I would say we pay very close attention to this, as you heard Liam say in his comments, with a focus on profitability. The ROE and the product we have today is what I would say, on a fully hedged basis, very close to the cost of capital at scale. And from a risk perspective, we're -- we think the product that we sell today is more than acceptable. So 3 things to add to that. First, we hedged the product fully; second, the NAR of the business that we put on the books is less than 1% of our total sales; and third, the personal protection portfolios, which is a core part of the product, had a volatility last year that was about 1\/3 of the level of the S&P. So the issue for us is really a scale issue.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just one very quick follow up. How are you defining cost of capital in this business?","David N. Levenson","It's the weighted average cost of capital that we hold on a GAAP basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just a follow-up on the annuity area and kind of more on the sale side. I think back in the December day, you all had talked about a $3 billion to $5 billion all-in sales goal across annuities. And so I think you also said that the fourth quarter should be somewhat of a litmus test for the new VA product. The run rate's considerably low to achieve $3 billion. So just be interested if there was something that made the fourth quarter not a good litmus test for VA and if you still think that goal is attainable and if indexed annuities might play a big part in that?","David N. Levenson","Randy, it's Dave again. Thanks for the question. So we recognize that the $258 million that we did in the quarter does not get us to our guidance. I'd say that said, we really only had a competitive product in the marketplace for the last 6 months. So we've been essentially out of the market since 2009 and back in since June. The PDF fund, which again is the secret sauce underlying the product, it's very innovative and, frankly, it needed some proof of concept, which I think took a little bit longer than we expected. But with 6 months behind our belt, I feel very good about where that is right now. As it relates to the fourth quarter specifically, as was mentioned earlier in the remarks, 2008 was the first time that we saw our sequential increase in sales, and when you start looking inter-quarter, our story gets a little bit more interesting where December was the best month we had in the year and was up 45% over October. So let me address your question about 2012 and whether or not I still feel like we can achieve it. The answer is yes. Clearly, as Liam mentioned, the market is rationalizing, competitors are raising fees, they're reducing benefits, they're getting out of the business. We think this is all good for us. Our biggest distributor in Wealth Management, added the product just recently, it was the end of October. We are in very good discussions right now to add the product to shelves at 2 of the top 20 firms. The only top 2 -- the only 2 of the 20 firms in the industry that don't carry this product today. We changed our national sales manager in September, and we have much greater discipline, focus and accountability. And as importantly, we're attracting some of the top wholesalers from many of our competitors. But with that backdrop, I think the punchline is that we really know what we have to do with respect to showing sales and sales momentum, and the management team is confident and committed to getting there.","Liam E. McGee","So Randy, you can see that Dave is managing this business very closely, and I think that reflects the fact that we need to see meaningful, profitable sales progress in the near future, and I think he's doing all the right things to make that happen.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","That's great. Just a quick follow-up. Indexed annuities, I mean, could those become a material part of this in 2012? Or should we really think of this is as being kind of a VA phenomenon to get to that goal?","David N. Levenson","So Randy, the FIA product that we launched in '11 was really a table sticks product. It's really going to be the offering that we bring out in the summertime that we think is very innovative combined with WealthVest, which as you know, is our third-party focused distributor on this. So I would say it will contribute, but if it -- it will contribute, but it will be more in the second half of the year where it contributes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I want to applaud your candor with discussion -- with discussing the separation of Life and the P&C companies. And I don't want to contradict that with this question, but can you share your thoughts about how this disclosure is actually going to impact the unit's performance in the near term?","Liam E. McGee","I'm not sure I understand the question.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","We'll I'm -- putting it in probably overly blunt terms, if distributors look at the Life business as being somewhat on the block, is that going to make it harder for them to actually sell the product?","Liam E. McGee","I think you completely misinterpreted the nature of our discussion. So again, I don't think we said that. We did not say that. I think we commented very specifically and very precisely on questions that we've been asked by shareholders about a potential tax resplit of the P&C company. I think to your -- thank you for recognizing our candor. And I would just go back to what I've said a couple of times, which is as we -- and I, more specifically, went through and then the business leaders went in greater detail, we are managing our company as a portfolio of businesses. We intend to maximize the value of each of those businesses because we do not believe our share price accurately reflects the value of the company and of the enterprise and that we're evaluating strategy and business portfolio for opportunities as a result of that philosophy to deliver greater value for shareholders, and we'll be objective and pragmatic and thorough and rigorous about the best ways to achieve this goal. I just want to be sure that you heard me correctly.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes. No, I think I did. If I can shift gears just a little bit. The workers' compensation rate increases that you've talked about, is that impacting retention for other product lines?","Douglas G. Elliot","It is not. This is Doug Elliot. It is not impacting our retentions across other lines. It is impacting some of the workers' comp retentions. But at the moment, we are more than pleased with the trade-off we're seeing in that book of business and very encouraged as we finish the year with really strong pricing momentum across those workers' compensation line. Very pleased about the last 3 months. And as Chris noted, incremental progress between October to November to December as we head off into 2012.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lawrence Sarly [ph] with Paulson & Co.","John Alfred Paulson","This is John Paulson speaking. Liam, I want to go back to the Slide 17, talking about the potential separating the Life and P&C business. And the -- I know you're doing a strategic review, but there's no slide talking about what the potential would be, just that there's challenges. Goldman Sachs came out with, I think, a very good analysis a few months ago, where they showed this is -- that they estimate the upside to doing a tax-free spinoff of P&C can be over 70% of what the current stock price is trading at. Now I agree that there's going to be challenges, but isn't your job to really overcome those challenges to achieve the maximum value for shareholders? Now I would say that Hartford needs to do something drastic because the stock is the lowest valuation relative to book value of any major insurance company. Last year, Hartford stock was down 38% while the P&C stocks were up 14% and even declined much more than the Life index, which was down 21%. So what I'd like to see you do is not merely come back and say yes, we're looking at strategic options, but there's challenges to achieving them. But what -- first of all, do you agree that you could create as much as 70% value for your shareholders by spinning off -- separating P&C? And secondly, is [indiscernible] incentive to overcome the challenges that it's going to take to spin this off? And how long is -- how long do we have to wait to hear if there's going to be a positive recommendation to separate these 2 businesses?","Liam E. McGee","Thanks, John, for the question. First of all, the analysis and the intent of the comments was to acknowledge that the challenges are significant, not to say that they could not be overcome. Second of all, our analysis, including the frictional costs, if you will, that are in the third category, would suggest that a split would not create the kind of shareholder value that, that particular report suggested. And third, in addition, I think the -- your sense of urgency about realizing greater value for shareholders is shared by me and by this team. And so I hope I answered your questions succinctly and correctly.","John Alfred Paulson","Partially, Liam. But if it is -- if you share the interest all shareholders have at increasing shareholder value, I'm surprised that as part of the discussion, you don't talk about how much value could be created by separating the P&C business from the Life business and not the only slide you devote to it talking about that there's some obstacles to overcome. I'm talking about the upside and weighing the upside of the separation against what the obstacles are. And better yet, not just listing as obstacles, but what I'd like to see is how you will overcome those obstacles to result at a more -- a fair valuation for Hartford. Not that there's obstacles, but how are you going to overcome those obstacles? That's what I, as a shareholder, look from you as the management to do.","Liam E. McGee","Thank you, John. And I -- that is our mindset. Our purpose in the slide was to identify the hurdles. You can -- if you heard our language, we did not say they were not surmountable, number one. We said there were significant costs to surmount them in a number of areas, so we felt we owed shareholders that disclosure. Number two, we do not believe that splitting them in the current environment for the reasons that we cited will create shareholder value. And third, again I'll reiterate, we have an incredible sense of urgency on looking at all ideas to create a shareholder value.","John Alfred Paulson","Well, I think you need to do a much better job of explaining that because Goldman's report is a very good report on a path to separate the business and create what they estimate is a 70% increase in shareholder value. And then you merely say there's some obstacles and you don't equate what the costs are to the benefit and what value you think could be created. Because right now, with the stock performing as poorly as it has relative to both P&C and Life companies, I think you need a better explanation of what you're going to do to enhance shareholder value, merely that you're working hard and you're committed, but there's obstacles. What we need you to do is overcome the obstacles to enhance the valuation for your shareholders, not merely to point out that there's obstacles.","Liam E. McGee","Hey, John, thank you. I hear you loud and clear.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman with UBS.","Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Why don't I just start off with capital. It looked like you had some improvement in the Life co stat capital and that was a surprise to me. And for the Investor Day, you're going to generate about $800 million in capital a year out of the P&C company. So what I'd like to know is, when you finish up the $500 million buyback, which I think you're saying is early 2Q, it will have been about a year since your last authorization of  $500 million. Could you give a little color on the flexibility that you might have to authorize another buyback? And I don't know if you -- just flexibility, amount, timing. I know you can't be overly specific, but a little flexibility commentary would help.","Christopher John Swift","Andrew, it's Chris. Thanks for the comments. I think your comments are right. Again, we finished fourth quarter in decent shape, particularly at the Life company. I would say one point of clarification that we planned to take out $800 million of dividends out of the P&C company, but we do expect the P&C company to generate slightly more in statutory earnings and that the Life group, we're still calling, right now, for flat to slightly down. But a lot of that is path dependence on markets, hedging performance. But directionally, it's still -- I'd like you to take away, it's still a constrained model for 2012. So as we said and as Liam said and I said, we are going to complete the program in early second quarter. At that time, we will evaluate, call it, our deployable capital levels, our capital needs for different initiatives and then determine our future actions and communicate them at that point in time. But as we've said, we see capital and surplus increasing in 2013 at the Life company, so that gives us hope and optimism that we will continue to have flexibility in '13 and beyond, particularly.","Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And possibly in mid '12?","Christopher John Swift","Possibly. Again, Hard to predict. We'd like to finish what we started, do the evaluation, compare, obviously, a lot of different options for our deployable capital and then come up with the best solution at that time.","Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just following up on one of the business lines. One of your rationales for being a multi-line company was aligning the Commercial Markets businesses, the Group Benefits along with the Commercial P&C. And I'd like an update on -- well, first off, it looks like AIG actually copied what you did based on some of the things I've been reading about. And secondly, I'd like to get a sense of sales volumes and some of the impact that you're having there.","Douglas G. Elliot","Andrew, this is Doug. We talked about that at the December 8 day in quite some detail, and those discussions continue as we close 2011 and head into 2012. So we had quite a bit of success, greater than $125 million of sales working across our group and P&C space in 2011. We have challenging goals for '12. As I travel -- and 2 weeks ago, I was in Orlando. I spent several hours in the morning with our comp and group people together to talk about issues, to make sure that we're firing on all cylinders and we're looking for opportunities in the marketplace. So absolutely, on a day-to-day basis, those opportunities continue to be chased, and we're looking for more to leverage the breadth of product that we have here at The Hartford.","Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And you think that could result in a turnaround negative 3% sales year-over-year?","Douglas G. Elliot","The dynamics of the sales process themselves is much more related to our need for margin improvement in group than our margin improvement needs across Middle Market. So when I think about top line, given the scale of those businesses, we're clearly driving rate change at those 2 businesses. As you looked at the bubble chart that Liam took you through in December, we have several businesses that need significant rate, and we are doing everything we can on a day-to-day basis to get that done. And that's more driver relative to top line than this other dynamic.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you, Andrew. Keesha, we have time for one more question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel with Langen McAlenney.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","I wanted to zero in on AARP. Chris, you said that you're pleased with the -- where you are and in position to grow. Liam, you sort of said that's a franchise operation, which I totally concur. I'm just confused on where it is in the sort of fixed versus grow mode. With premiums down 4% and the overall auto underwriting at 96, it seems like AARP should be in a position to grow, not being one of the fixed candidates. If it is a franchise as I think and it's in a demographic that's favorable, why is it not growing more?","Andy Napoli","Bob, this is Andy. It's a great question. So I'd kind of take you back 18 months ago, we had profit issues in the division, probably more pronounced in agency than with AARP. But nonetheless, we were taking above market rate increases across all channels and products, so when you grow, it would be impacted. But quite frankly, given the competitive environment that we -- that confronted us in 2010 and '11, it was greater than anticipated, affecting both new business and retention. So since then, we've been working really hard to achieve rate adequacy and restore growth to divisions, especially AARP. It's very much still a work in progress, but as you commented, in AARP Direct we are converging on our combined ratio pricing targets. I actually expect that to happen sometime in 2012. New business has rebounded very nicely, and that will continue to play out as 2012 plays out. The big objective for us right now is to get retention where it needs to be, and until we do that, we expect that to happen in -- throughout '12 and into '13, we'll restore total premium growth to AARP. Still a valuable franchise, extremely important to us strategically, and we're well on our way to getting that back on track.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Where does auto have to be to get your ROE objective? You don't break out AARP, so -- if you could give me AARP's targeted combined ratio to get to the ROE, that would be great. But I don't think auto, in general, would be...","Andy Napoli","Yes, auto, around 95 or so.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Okay. We're -- I mean, you're at 96 overall, and AARP is, I assume, better than agency. So why couldn't AARP be growing right now?","Andy Napoli","I think it's just a timing thing. It's the way we -- the rate increase has played out in '09 and '10. Retention was impacted more than we thought it would be. Now we're recovering it.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you, Bob, and thank you, also, Keesha. We look forward to seeing and talking to you all soon.

Second quarter marked another strong performance for The Hartford. Core earnings were up 36%, core earnings per share rose 40% and book value per share excluding AOCI was up 8% since year end 2017. Our annualized core earnings ROE for the first half of 2018 was 13%. ","Earnings growth came from Commercial Line, Group Benefits and mutual funds including the lower effective tax rate. Personal Lines underlying margins continue to improve, but were outweighed on the bottom line by higher catastrophe losses.

During the quarter we achieved progress on several other important goals. First, we closed the sale of Talcott on May 31 just eight weeks ago. ","Net cash considerations of the holding company was about $1.5 billion. In addition, we retained a 9.7% equity stake in Talcott, which is carried on our books at $164 million at June 30. Second, the Aetna Group Benefits integration, about eight months underway is proceeding well. ","Given the complexity of the numerous activities involved, I am very pleased and impressed with the pace and overall progress. We are optimistic that we can reduce expenses by more than our original $100 million target. ","Beside from the integration, Group Benefits sales are off to a strong start in 2018. First half sales totaled $539 million, almost double from last year. This includes $7 million of life and disability product sales to Aetna Group Medical Customers. These sales are the result of our agreement with their major medical sales force to work with us and continue to market Group Life disability products to their customers. These results speak to the success of our cross sale partnership. ","We are also executing on a project across the company that are making The Hartford a customer centric and easier company to do business with. It's a long list with an emphasis on technology in digital tools, working in an agile environment. One example is in Small Commercial. On our ICON platform we have increased the percent of accounts that can be quoted on the glass. We have streamlined the underwriting process and reduced the time it takes to get a quote, which is an important competitive advantage in this market. ","Another example is the expansion of our underwriting capabilities in Specialty Product Orientation to achieve our goal of being a broader and deeper risk player. In middle market, we have grown in added industry verticals, responding to increasing demands from agents for deeper industry under writing expertise with a broader product suite. This aligns with our strategy to expand account rounding with our workers compensation policy holders, who value our claims and customer service capabilities. ","Examples of our focus on industry verticals include technology, a traditional strength at The Hartford, which grew premium 4.5% over the last two years. In addition, our construction practice has grown premiums 35% over the past four years. ","Lastly, we entered the energy market late 2016 and over the past four quarters wrote $24 million in gross written premium. These are just a few examples of our approach to organic business development. Taken all together, we sustain very good momentum this quarter in all our businesses. I am thrilled with our progress and our future potential. ","Last week we announced a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend. This decision was based on the strong performance of our businesses, the sale of Talcott and lower tax rates, consistent with our longstanding dividend philosophy. Last week's dividend declaration was the sixth consecutive annual increase and it will increase our dividend yield and payout ratio to be more in line with peers. ","With regard to other uses of excess capital, our philosophy has not changed. Investing in our company remains the cornerstone of our strategy. We want to achieve profitable organic growth, particularly where we have attractive returns and strong competitive advantages. ","Along those lines, acquisitions that are aligned with our long term strategic and financial goals are a compelling use of capital. Acquisitions can help build greater competitive advantages, add operational capabilities and accelerate earnings growth, compared with building a business from the ground up. ","For example, in 2016 we acquired Maxum, which allow Small Commercial to expand into the E&S market. In 2017 we purchased the Aetna's U. S. Group Life and Disability book, which was a unique opportunity to expand our market position while acquiring an industry leading claims and leave management platform. ","As I shared last quarter, when we assess areas of our business that could benefit from the accelerance of an acquisition, we have a focus on specialty lines and industry verticals in the Commercial Insurance segment that would expand our product sets in underwriting expertise. ","Since the recent sale of Talcott, there has been speculation and questions about future share repurchase plans. This is understandable as our prior capital management actions have included a large amount of debt reduction and share repurchases. ","While capital management remains a valid alternative, it is not our primary focus at this time. Therefore we have not authorized a new share repurchase plan. We will continue to evaluate options that will generate long term earnings growth at good returns. And if we conclude that there is not an alternative option to support growth, a share buyback plan could be put into place relatively quickly. ","But as I've stated previously, we will be thoughtful and patient regarding capital deployment with our focus on creating long term sustainable shareholder value, which is why we are maintaining the option of investing capital to expand the business. ","To wrap up my comments, The Hartford had very strong performance for the first half of the year, both financially and operationally. We are intently focused on continuing to execute on our goals and sustain our momentum through the second half of the year. ","I look forward to updating you on our progress over the balance of the year. ","Now I'll turn the call over the Doug. ","Doug Elliot","Thank you Chris and good morning everyone. This was another strong quarter in property and casualty and Group Benefits as we advance our key business initiatives and address evolving market conditions. ","Commercial Lines had a strong quarter as we continue to balance growth with competitive market conditions. In Personal Lines improved auto trends continues, although overall results were hampered by catastrophe losses, and in Group Benefits we had another excellent quarter with strong favorable trends in Group Disability. ","Before I touch on second quarter results for each business segment, let me cover current and prior year catastrophe losses for property and casually. In the quarter we had $188 million of current year cat losses, $33 million higher than a year ago, driven by significant wind and hail storms in various regions across the country. Included in prior year development is the reduction of our estimates for prior year catastrophes, largely attributable to hurricanes in the third quarter of 2017. ","As a result of lowering these estimates, we no longer expect to receive a recovery against our aggregate catastrophe reinsurance treaty for the 2017 accident year. The benefit from the aggregate treaty was allocated to each business unit based on our estimate of ultimate losses for the full year. This quarter as you can see on page 13 of the slides, 2017 gross loss estimates decreased in both Personal Lines and Commercial Lines, causing total P&C losses to fall below the attachment point for the treaty. However, the decrease in gross losses was greater in Commercial Lines than Personal Lines, and therefore unwinding the aggregate cover resulted in net adverse developments for Personal Lines. ","Let me now shift into the results for our business segments. In Commercial Lines the combined ratio improved 4.5 points from prior year to 90.1, driven by a favorable prior year development, partially offset by slightly higher current year catastrophe losses and expenses. ","The prior year development was primarily due to continued favorable trends in workers compensation and lower estimates on catastrophe reserves as I just covered, partially offset by an increase in reserves for higher hazard General Liability exposures. This portion of our General Liability book remains profitable, but we are responding to an increase in loss trends in accident years 2015 through 2017. ","Trends in the remainder of our General Liability book have been slightly better than our expectations. The underlying combined ratio of Commercial Lines which excludes catastrophes and prior year development was 90, improving nine tenths of a point from last year. ","The improvement was largely driven by favorable loss trends, particularly non cat property as well as General Liability. This is offset by higher expenses and slight margin compression in workers compensation. ","Let me provide a few additional thoughts on workers compensation, touching on three important factors; frequency, severity and rates. ","First on frequency: In both Small Commercial and middle market, our frequency has been trending slightly higher during 2018. We see this as a broad based economic driven trend across many states and industry classes. Keep in mind that absolute frequency is still at historical low levels and margins remain attractive. However expanding participation in the labor market often means less experienced workers are on the job but driver of frequency. ","Second on severity: We continue to closely watch inflation trends for upward pressure on both wages and medical cost drivers of severity. Although accident year 2018 data is immature at point in the year, severity remains within our expectations. ","And third on rates: Loss cost in workers compensation have been quite benign for several years and as a result the NCCI and other bureaus have been filing negative loss cost changes in many jurisdictions. Industry rate filings are based on these loss cost trends and have put downward pressure on rates in 2018 and will likely do so in 2019. ","Combining these three factors we continue to expect some margin compression in our small commercial and middle market books of business. Since each of these businesses has unique market dynamics for pricing and growth, our approach to successfully managing these rate changes is also dynamic. ","In middle market and national accounts greater weight is placed on individual risk characteristics when pricing the account. In small commercial, pricing is more heavily weighted to class factors making book management a critical tool. ","Over the last five years we have significantly advanced our actuarial analytics and data science capabilities to improve our ability to identify these trends and respond confidently with pricing, underwriting and claims management initiatives. Given our strong margins and organizational capabilities, we will continue to execute a disciplined pricing and book of business management strategy in the months ahead. ","Moving to pricing in the quarter, I'm very pleased that our renewal written pricing and standard Commercial Lines was 3.1%, up from 2.4% in the first quarter of the year. As I suggested in my comments last quarter, we saw a positive movement in middle market across Property, General Liability and Workers Compensation with strong increases continuing to come from Commercial Auto. Our pricing and standard Commercial Lines excluding Workers Compensation was 5.2 in the quarter. ","Looking at our Commercial Lines business units, small commercial had another strong quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 85.6. Written premium was off slightly, the result of downward pressure on workers compensation rates and competitive market conditions for both new business and renewals. The margin improvement versus last year was driven by non-cat property, General Liability and Auto, partially offset by higher expenses. ","In middle market the underlying combined ratio of 94.1 improved eight-tenths of a point from 2017, mainly due to non-cat property and General Liability. This was partially offset by a modest margin compression in workers compensation and higher expenses. ","Written premium was up 3% over last year with new business production of $138 million. And in Specialty Commercial, the underlying combined ratio of 98.5 deteriorated 2.6 points. This was driven mainly by higher expenses and margin compression in national accounts and financial products. Written premium was up 9% for the quarter reflecting strong growth in bond and financial products. ","Moving to Personal Lines, the underlying combined ratio of 90.4 improved 2.2 points from a year ago, driven primarily by improvement in Auto and to a lesser degree better home-owners performance. The underlying combined ratio in Personal Auto improved 2.6 points to 96.5. We continue to experience relatively stable loss cost trends and we are satisfied with our bottom line performance. ","Personal Lines premium was down 7%. Consistent with my comments in recent quarters, our marketing spend continues to accelerate and we are focused on driving new business growth. In AARP Direct auto, our bellwether line, new business was up 19% in the quarter. This is an encouraging result as we focus on growth through new business and improved retention. We're implementing additional product and process changes throughout the remainder of the year that I expect will continue to improve our top line trends. ","Turning the Group Benefits we had another excellent quarter, with core earnings of $104 million and a margin of 6.9%. Drivers were similar to last quarter, including favorable disability results, lower tax rates and the contribution from our 2017 acquisition, partially offset by slightly higher life mortality. ","Persistency on our employer group block of business remains strong at approximately 90% and fully insured ongoing sales of $85 million were up from prior year. This was a solid sales quarter and we're pleased with our traction in the market. ","Our integration of the Aetna Group Life and Disability business remains on track and is picking up momentum. We began converting small case business to our current platform this month and we will ramp up those efforts throughout the year. ","The new disability claim platform now branded The Hartford Ability Advantage is expected to come online for new cases effective in 2019. As Chris noted in his comments, our expense reduction efforts are on track and as our business conversion process continues in \u201819 and \u201920, we are confident that we will be able to exceed our original savings target. ","In summary, this was another strong quarter for our property and casually and Group Benefits businesses. At the halfway point for 2018, I'm please with our execution and our performance. We are responding to loss cost trends with appropriate pricing action and disciplined underwriting. ","We continue to innovate in all areas of our business to deliver a superior customer experience, and we're committed to becoming a more relevant partner for our agents and brokers, with an expanded product portfolio to better meet customer needs and deliver profitable growth to The Hartford. ","Let me now turn the call over to Beth. ","Beth Bombara","Thank you, Doug. My comments today will cover second quarter results for the investment portfolio, mutual funds and corporate, impacts on the quarter from the sale of Talcott and June 30 book value and debt leverage before taking your questions.","Starting with investments, net investment income performance and yields remain steady. Per-tax limited partnership investment income was flat with the prior year at $39 million or an annualized return of 9.5% in second quarter 2018.","Excluding LP's, the annualized portfolio yield before tax was 3.7%, down slightly from 3.8% in second quarter 2017 due to the impact of the Group Benefits acquisition. The P&C yield was flat year-over-year at 3.8%. ","Consistent with the first quarter, the yield on the consolidated Group Benefits investment portfolio is lower than last year, because acquisition accounting rules require that the acquired portfolio is mark-to-market. As a result, the annualized yield before tax, excluding LP's in Group Benefits was 4.3% in the third quarter 2017 before the acquisition, but dropped to 3.7% in the fourth quarter. ","This quarter the Group Benefits annualized portfolio yield was 3.9%, up slightly from first quarter 2018. This is the result of our reinvestment of the acquired portfolio towards our target sector allocation, with less municipal bond exposure resulting in a higher pre-tax yields. Investment credit performance remained excellent this quarter with no net impairments due to a generally benign credit environment and the credit strength and diversification of our portfolio. ","Turning to mutual funds, second quarter core earnings were $38 million, up 58% from last year, due to the combination of lower tax rate and higher AUM from positive net flows and higher market values. Income before taxes rose 21% as a result of the operating leverage in our operations, with a 6% increase in revenues, but only a 3% increase in expenses. ","AUM growth is due to net flows which totaled $1.9 billion over the last four quarters and changes in market value which totaled $8.2 billion. Our ETP business drove $500 million of net flows over the last four quarters. ","Hartford fund\u2019s strong performance is driving the positive net flows with 61% and 66% of funds beating their peers on a three year and five year basis respectfully. Corporate core losses totaled $76 million, higher than first quarter 2018, due principally to a tax chew up for the reallocation from the business segments to corporate for the impact of non-deductible executive compensation. ","Income from discontinued operations was $148 million, up from $112 million in the second quarter of 2017. In the second quarter 2017 this represented Talcott\u2019s net income for the quarter. In contrast, in this quarter about 90% of the income reflected an increase in our estimate of the retained tax benefits from Talcott, due to a change in our estimate of Talcott\u2019s tax basis. This change increases our estimate of the value of retained tax benefits to about $830 million. ","Going forward, other revenue will include the return on our investment in Talcott, which will be included in core earnings and in the corporate segment, along with other Talcott impacts. The other impacts include beginning this quarter, income from investment management and transition services, as well as the related operating expenses. The amounts recorded this quarter reflect one month of activity and do not have a significant impact on the corporate bottom line. We expect transition services and stranded costs to decrease over the next 12 to 18 months. ","In total, The Hartford second quarter core earnings were $412 million, up from $303 million in second quarter 2017 due to higher commercial lines of group benefits and mutual funds earnings before tax, as well as a lower federal income tax rate. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 19% in the quarter compared with 18% in the first quarter of 2018, due to a slightly higher proportion of income from underwriting results and taxable investment income, as all income other than municipal bonds interest is taxed at 21%. ","Book value per diluted share at June 30, 2018 was $34.44, a 7% decrease from December 31, 2017. The after tax unrealized gain on our fixed maturity portfolio at June 30, 2018 was $211 million, down from $1.8 billion at December 31. This decrease was due to the Talcott sale and the reduction in the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio due to higher rates and wider credit spreads. ","Book value per share excluding AOCI with $38.15, an increase of 8% from December 31, 2017, reflecting the increase in retained earnings as a result of net income in excess of dividends for the first six months of the year. The core earnings ROE was 8.4%, calculated using rolling four quarter earnings and average stockholders\u2019 equity since June 30, 2017. On an annualized year-to-date basis, core earnings ROE was 13%, which is above our outlook for the year. ","Turning to our debt leverage, in June we called at par $500 million in junior subordinated debt, reducing our total debt outstanding by $323 million since year end 2017. Despite the repayment of debt and strong earnings, our rating agency debt to total capital ratio of about 30% was flat with March 31 due to the inclusion of AOCI in this calculation. ","Over the long term our focus is to reduce the rating agency adjusted debt to total capital ratio to the low to mid 20\u2019s. However, since it includes the favorable or unfavorable impact of AOCI, this ratio can be volatile during periods of changing interest rate. So we also focus on the total leverage ratio, which is calculated by dividing total debt, including hybrid the then preferred at par, by total debt and capital excluding AOCI. ","At June 30 our total leverage ratio was 25%, which is still at the high end of our long term goal. We continue to focus on decreasing this ratio over time. ","To conclude, we remain a very good path and 2018 with strong underwriting and investment results and success in both closing the sale of Talcott and the continued integration of the group manifest acquisition. ","I will now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session. ","Sabra Purtill","Thank you, Beth. We have about 30 minutes for questions. Dan, could you please repeat the Q&A instructions? Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. (Operator Instructions) Your first question today will come from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. ","ElyseGreenspan","Hi, good morning. My first question, in terms of the commercial lines margin, pretty strong improvement this quarter. I was hoping we can get a little bit more color; if you can break down you know how much you saw coming from you know favorable non-cat property, also from liability and then also from the Auto, the three things you called out in the press release. If you can just give us a sense of the contribution from each. ","And then there\u2019s a 90 basis points of improvement just based off of how you see the rating environment and what's going on in comm. Is that the right level we should think about in commercial going forward? ","DougElliot","Elyse, good morning. This is Doug. Let me try to tackle both of them separately. When I look across our markets, as I mentioned both Small and Middle had excellent non-cat property quarters, and Small about a point better quarter-to-quarter and Middle a couple of points, 2.5 points better, so significant drivers of positive performance. ","Small on the workers comp side about our expectations and I mentioned that just slightly we made an adjustment to our workers comp in Middle, about a Small amount. So when I look across, I feel good about all the non-compliance in the middle. We made an adjustment in comp and all in, a very, very solid quarter for commercialized relative to combined ratios. ","Can you repeat the other question a little bit more? ","ElyseGreenspan","Yeah, well I guess I was just trying to think about you know going forward, is kind of the 90 basis points of underlying margin improvement you saw in commercial lines this quarter, is that the right level we should be thinking about or maybe adjust a little bit just for the favorable non-cat whether in the quarter? ","ChrisSwift","Well, first off I think the improvement of 90 basis points was a terrific quarter and so I love to think we could outperform like that going forward, but that is \u2013 that will take experience and the next couple of months for us to be able to determine that. I am suggesting that we're seeing a little bit of turn in our frequency in the worker's comp line. So we expect to see some compression there, because rates are moving in one direction and frequency is moving in the other. ","So we're watching carefully what that means for our book of business and we\u2019ll take appropriate actions going forward. But as you know there are headwinds on the pricing side in workers comp, because those loss cost trends over the last several years are so favorable that they are dropping in state by state to the pricing algorithms and so we're making adjustments as appropriate there. ","So I feel great about our improvement in the quarter. I love to think we could continue with that, but that\u2019s going to take some time for us to show that and through the P&L. ","ElyseGreenspan","Okay, great. And then on the capital side, I you know appreciate the disclosure about how you guys you know are now valuating you know M&A as well as capital return. I guess I also was wondering how you guys also think about managing down your leverage you know pro forma for the debt maturity that comes due early next year. Your leverage is probably still running you know in the high 20\u2019s. So how does you know managing down your leverage you know balance against if you end up with excess capital and how you're thinking about potential for buy backs?","BethBombara","Yeah, you know great question. So as we talked about before, we do you have maturing debt as you pointed out at the beginning of 2019, which our current intention would be to pay that down and we look at that combined with just the earnings power of our businesses. We believe that puts us on a very good track as we think about managing that ratio down. ","So I think we've done a good job you know in the past of using maturing debt, the opportunity for that without having to pay a large premium to reduce our debt outstanding and say just, we\u2019ll continue on that path. ","ElyseGreenspan","Okay, thank you very much. ","Operator","Your next question comes from a line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore. Please go ahead.","TomGallagher","Good morning. First question Chris; just on that capital management commentary you made, does the priority of M&A over buy backs suggest that you'll see current attractive opportunities in M&A or is that more of the medium term comment that you'll patiently look for opportunities and like to build a bigger capital position while you wait for those opportunities.","ChrisSwift","Yeah, thanks Tom. Again, we were just talking about things that we've talked about before. So I would say it again. From the building the business, investing in our business, looking at acquisition opportunities, I mean that's been our consistent philosophy for a number of years now. So I'm not signaling any change you know one way or other. It's just sort of our playbook of priorities that we would go down on exploring. ","So I said in my prepared remarks, if we can't find a good use for our excess capital, we are more than comfortable in returning it to shareholders. ","TomGallagher","Got you. So really no change is contestant with you know getting maybe to a bigger level of access before you consider using it for alternatives like buy backs? ","ChrisSwift","Yeah, I'm not going to try to sort of size the level of capital here. I mean we just closed Talcott. We've gotten excess capital. You've heard Beth just comment about what we want to do with debt. We\u2019re comfortable where we are right now in giving ourselves a little time. I mean it's not -- we're not looking for years and years and years here. We just want you know the option and the flexibility to explore, using our capital to invest in businesses and\/or new revenue streams. ","TomGallagher","Got it. And then just a question on Group Benefits. From the disclosure in your Q, it looks like you had another good quarter of very favorable prior year development. By our estimate it\u2019s more than half of the earnings for that segment. Now you've been having that favorable development for several years now, so it doesn't appear to be a one-timer; it seems pretty sustainable. ","So my question is, should we think about most of that development being recent in accident year releases or is a lot of that coming from recoveries of older accident years. Can you provide some perspective on how that -- where that's coming from and then maybe the sustainability of it? ","BethBombara","Yeah sure, I'll take that. So again on the group side and specifically on the disability side as we look at our trends, you know we have been seeing favorable trends, you know more so in the more recent years as those exposures develop. ","You know I think in the disability block it's important to remember that you know there\u2019s a lag sort of in the timing of when someone goes on disability and then when they actually end up on long term disability. So we peg those lines and then looked at how the development comes in overtime. And our incidence rates and our recoveries on all those fronts have been very favorable. It\u2019s hard to predict obviously going forward, but we're very happy with the trends that we've been seeing you know as we kind of go into the second half of this year. ","TomGallagher","Okay, thanks. ","Operator","Your next question comes from a line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. ","JoshShanker","Hi there. I don't know if I'm going to get a better answer than the prepared remarks, but you talked about being more confident about the cost savings associated with the other transaction. You were formerly at $100 million. I look at about $400 million of run rate expenses coming with Aetna. Can you sort of break out what\u2019s in that 400 and why we couldn't expect half of it to go down or how we should think about that? ","ChrisSwift","Josh, I\u2019ll just provide an opening commentary and then we could add additional color. As I said you know, in essence eight, nine months since the integration we feel very good about the integration, both from an operational side or go-to-market sales force side, customer retention side and all we\u2019re signaling right now is that our nine month indication is that we most likely will outperform our $100 million target over a longer period of time. ","If you remember why we say a longer period of time is you know we're timing the conversion of a lot of these policies and books of business from Aetna paper to our paper over a two year period of time, so that we don't disrupt that customer base that we just completed installing their claim system and our technology and our hardware here. ","So the real conversion process just begins. So it is a little longer term than maybe a typical integration activity, given we're dealing with three year rate policy, three year rate guarantees and you know moving the entire administration platform into our network and our capabilities right now. But I\u2019d love to \u2013 yeah Doug if you want to provide any additional commentary Doug.","DougElliot","I think Chris that's a really good baseline. You know Josh, the number I have in my head for the Aetna baseline on cost is roughly 3.30. So when I think about 100 or 100-plus pretty significant change. ","In addition to what Chris said relative to us moving accounts, we are being very careful, trying not to disturb relationships of account managers and account executives on key Aetna renewals. So this is a multiyear process that I think we are very pleased about the initial nine months, but it is a several year effort and as we move through that period of time, I know we are going to find opportunities to be more effective and efficient in operations and we\u2019ll capitalize on those.","JoshShanker","And you know look there is always the numbers. You gave a good detail on what's going on in workers comp. You took down reserves there, but you took up your axe and your pick and then on GL you added to reserve and took down your axe and your pick. I\u2019m just sort of wondering how past information is different from what you're doing on the current accident year?","ChrisSwift","Yes, really good questions. So let me attack both comp and GL separately. When we think about our comp book of business and our reserves that we currently carry, we feel very good about the adequacy of our reserves. And in fact this quarter we did release some of those prior year reserves, primarily accident years \u201914 and \u201915, but our position on the balance is very solid and we feel good about that.","When we are talking about accident year \u201818 we're starting to see some headwinds and we're looking at frequency which is a leading indicator and so we made an adjustment in middle market. But you know we're connecting the dots through the accident years and I just want to point out there's a difference in what we're caring and what we\u2019re seeing today. So that's really what's happening in the comp world.","In the General Liability world, are normal GL book is performing according to our expectations. What we did in the quarter, we have a specialized, high hazard, heavy products group in middle market and that is the book that we saw some increase in both frequency and severity in all of our accident years. So we took action to strengthen those years, those are high hazard books and I want to differentiate that from what we're seeing in our normal go forward GL book and there we continue to watch but feel pretty good about current conditions.","JoshShanker","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes in from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","JayCohen","Jay Cohen here. A couple of questions. First is the commercial issuance expense ratio that did tick-up. I understand on the Personal Lines side you are spending more from a marketing standpoint. What's driving the higher expense ratio in the commercial side?","ChrisSwift","Jay, I\u2019m looking at Doug, he\u2019ll add his commentary, but I would just say we continue to invest in our infrastructure technology and digital experience for the customer. So yeah, it is elevated from trends over the years, but again it's a conscious part of our strategy. I would say particularly from the Commercial Lines, capability side we are probably 60%, 70% through of some of the core systems that we want to replace and I would say there are always true-ups from quarter-to-quarter on commissions, whether in essence be profit sharing or anything else you know commission wise. So Doug, that\u2019s what I would say, but what would you add?","DougElliot","Yeah, that\u2019s a large piece and there is a little bit of compensation in there Chris as well. So as we look at plans and we look at performance through six months, just some true-ups that we normal do. But IT is a driver and our continued to invest inside our businesses.","JayCohen","Got it, makes sense. The other question on M&A, without issuing stock and given your leverage, can you give us a sense of how big a deal in dollars you could do at this point?","ChrisSwift","At this point and really Jay I\u2019m going to sort of probably disappoint you a little bit and refrain really for a lot of speculation here, because it\u2019s just don\u2019t do anyone any good. But I think the metrics that we talked about in the past, really are in the premium range, sort of a $2 billion premium company is still accurate as a target, as a bolt-on. So that\u2019s what we define. So that\u2019s why I would just say right now is that we are still in that bolt-on category and that\u2019s what I would leave you with.","JayCohen","And that\u2019s helpful Chris. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead.","BrianMeredith","Yeah thanks, so a couple of questions here. Chris just quickly back on the whole M&A thing, can you remind us how you think about kind of GAAP earnings accretion and when you kind of balance M&A versus share buyback.","ChrisSwift","Yeah, happy to Brian. And again we tried to address it in an early on question and its part of the equation. On the metrics on timeframes, payback periods, IRR\u2019s, returns on tangible, intangible capital. So we look at it all and I\u2019m not going to tell you there is a hard and fast rule, but we do want to earn acceptable returns as we always define it above our cost of equity capital in a relatively near term and we define that term somewhere in that three to four year period of time. So that\u2019s what I would say right now.","BrianMeredith","Great, thanks for that. And then Doug I\u2019m just curious, looking at your Small Commercial business, policy account retention has continued to kind of slip through the last call it year and a half, call it two years. What\u2019s going on there and what are you doing to maybe improve that policy account retention?","DougElliot","Brian we\u2019re certainly focused on both the retention and the new. You know there\u2019s a little bit of pressure in the micro space. I think we\u2019ve seen more entrance in the micro and the small, but there isn't anything material that I would point out that is worthy of spending a lot more time on this morning.","You know overall we've been very steady growers of this business organically over the past five years. I know in the quarter we are a little off. There's a worker\u2019s comp dynamic to it, there's competition to it, but we're being thoughtful about this business. We continue to innovate. Some of the innovations that we\u2019re dropping into our platform, I do expect will show progress and growth in future quarters. ","So I don't look at this as the full trend for the next couple of quarters, but I do remind you that workers comp is an important part of our Small Commercial platform and therefore we're going to be in a different pricing environment over the next couple of quarters than what we've seen in the prior, probably two or three years.","ChrisSwift","Hey Brian, I would also add to some of that trend that you are talking about policy counts and retentions influenced by the Commercial Auto environment broadly. So I mean there's been a little bit of -- my words would be pruning of mono line Commercial Auto. So that's affecting those trends a little bit and as you know that market is still not at adequate return, so we've been very thoughtful about putting additional premiums in that line of business.","BrianMeredith","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from a line of Gary Ransom with Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.","GaryRansom","Good morning, I was going to ask for a little more detail on underlying loss trends. You did give us a little bit of a picture on workers comp and high hazard liability lines. But I wonder if you could just give us a sense of the entire array of what you're seeing? I mean is workers\u2019 comp a good end of the lost trends still relatively benign and then what's at the worse end from your perspective? Is it Commercial Auto or is it some other liability line?","ChrisSwift","Good morning Gary. I would say that you know the reason I made mention of workers comp is we do have full attention on this frequency dynamic. As I think across the rest of the lines in commercial, yeah we had a little spike in our high hazard GL in our prior book, but generally all of our other lines are still in a relatively benign, low single digits, lost trend environment.","So, I don't think a lot has changed as we looked at the quarter and are loss performance relative to trends and I spoke about the line that we saw some degree of change in workers\u2019 comp.","GaryRansom","So there's a lot of talk about inflation, not just you, but other companies as well, and yet it doesn't really seem to be showing up in the numbers, everyone's concerned about it but it's not quite there yet. Is that something you're able to respond to realistically if you have the concern of inflation? Can you raise rates in Small Commercial or is that part of what\u2019s competitive activity is not allowing you to do that?","ChrisSwift","Well I shared our ex-comp pricing in the quarter at five plus and feel very good about that and I feel good about the Small Commercial component of that and the middle market. So we've been working at not only comp, but the other elements of our book-of-business from a pricing perspective over time and I think our performance demonstrates the progress of that pricing. ","Yes, it is a competitive marketplace, but the quarter we just punched, I feel really good about it. I think in terms of absolute performance, a very strong quarter Gary and I would say we've been able to price for what we've seen in the marketplace relative to the trend successfully over the last couple years.","GaryRansom","No doubt today was a great day, but I'm always thinking about tomorrow and what comes next.","ChrisSwift","I know, so are we.","GaryRansom","But I thank you very much.","ChrisSwift","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from a line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","RyanTunis","Hey thanks. Just a couple, I guess follow-ups on workers comp for Doug. I guess just what I was thinking about the commentary on accident year margin pressure on workers comp being a function of few things. It is safe to say though it\u2019s still mostly the fact that pricing decision is good, that\u2019s probably the biggest reason why you are talking about the margin headwinds there?","DougElliot","What I would say that in \u201918, the biggest reason is really two fold; one is, yes we are watching these lost cost drop in and we're dealing with the state by state dynamics of where our loss experiences and what to do about our multiplier in these various states, so that\u2019s point A. Point B is that we've got a bit of an inflection on frequency that we\u2019re watching very carefully.","So two quarters don't make a full trend, but we've had a couple of quarters now of positive frequency and that's the first time we've seen that in several years. So there is full attention on what our own book of business is telling us relative to signals and frequency. ","As I mentioned the severities, signals look well within our expectations, so we're watching severity both medical and indemnity, but I feel pretty good about that. Just looking at the combination of both pricing and frequency, we are very focused on choices and options in front of us relative to workers compensation.","RyanTunis","Got it, and so you have seen a couple of quarters of positive frequency, should I take that to mean that I guess you are assuming in your new loss picks that there is positive frequency in workers comp?","DougElliot","So I don't want to spend too much time talking about reserving process, but in general we're looking at earned patterns. We use historical and we bring in current year, both severity and frequency as appropriate.","So the reason we adjusted middleis that we're trying to make sure we're recognizing what we're seeing in our patterns in the first to accident quarters of 2018 and in the middle we're seeing a pickup greater than we expected, which is why we adjusted our reserves.","We\u2019ll have to continue to assess what third quarter and fourth quarter bring, but at the moment we made adjustments based on everything we could see in our book of business to make sure we closed up second quarter where we should have been from a loss ratio perspective.","RyanTunis","Got it. And then I guess a last one I had was just thinking about some of the favorable results and the other casualty lies this quarter like General Liability Commercial Auto.","I remember you guys adding the reserves in those areas and I think on \u201914, \u201915 at one point that was sort of a headwind. Is there reason those results are getting better because you are finding out now that similar things that you saw back then didn\u2019t end up being quite as negative or is there something else driving that?","DougElliot","Yeah, probably lots of things driving that. I think our behavior and our discipline in the marketplace starts that discussion. I think we've become a very solid thoughtful underwriter using you know both skill sets at desk level and also data analytics, so I started there. ","Secondly, I think with Beth and Chris over the last seven, eight years we worked hard to be discipline on a reserving to bring forward, to the more current as we're looking at data. So I think our entire reserving process is much stronger today than it was over the last 10 years.","Putting all that together, we're also trying to be very consistent in our approach quarter-to-quarter and the reflections of all those behaviors I think lead us to feel much better about our balance sheet today than we probably did seven years ago.","RyanTunis","Perfect, thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman with Balyasny. Please go ahead.","IanGutterman","Hi, thank you. Chris, can we start out, just if I recall from the Q we have $2.3 billion at the holdco now. Can we just walk through what's left to kind of source activities in the second half versus the first? I know it\u2019s up for the year, but I don\u2019t know what's been taken already versus what's left to come.","BethBombara","Sure. So again I'll remind you that with some of the actions that we did at the end of last year with the Aetna acquisition, that really decreased our dividend capacity for 2018. So we are not expecting dividend from P&C or Group Benefits in the second half of this year. We would expect to see a modest amount from mutual funds, but for the most part there is not additional dividend coming in from the subsidiaries in the second half of this year.","And for P&C, because some of the Talcott proceeds actually went through various legal entities to get to the holding company, our dividend capacity for ordinary dividends in P&C really probably for the most part won't be there until the second half of 2019.","IanGutterman","Got it, and then do we have any tax sharing payments coming in second half or those all come in the first half?","BethBombara","Yeah, so a little bit, I mean obviously that would be dependent upon actual taxable income forecast for the second half of the year, but based on our current estimates, I\u2019d anticipate probably another you know $150 million maybe will come in the second half of \u201818 to the holding company. Again, that can bounce around just based on actual results. ","And then we\u2019ve also in the past highlighted the fact that we will, we do anticipate a refund coming in \u201819 for our AMT credits and that will come in when we file our tax return which you know could be as late as September of 2019.","IanGutterman","I was going to as ask about that one too. So if I take the tax sharing minus the corporate dividends, would suggest you end the year somewhere around the 2.3 you're at right now at the holdco?","BethBombara","Yeah, maybe a little bit less than that depending on your other corporate actions \u2013 yeah, maybe a little bit less than that depending on you know other things that we might do relative to contributions to our pension plan that we make usually in the third quarter. But I'd expected it would be roughly around $2 billion.","IanGutterman","Got it, okay. And that\u2019s without the AMT, because that doesn't hit cash till \u201819.","BethBombara","Right, that would not be in the 2018 numbers.","IanGutterman","Perfect, okay. So Chris I guess, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more, I know you've already commented, but on the capital side, I guess I don't understand the harm in putting an authorization out there, even you don't have to necessarily commit to using it tomorrow. But let's just say that what happened with Facebook yesterday or the President or something or whatever and the market is down 20% in the next three months, wouldn\u2019t you want to have an authorization out there? Why don\u2019t you have it out there as an option? Just because you point out it doesn\u2019t say you have to use the whole thing.","ChrisSwift","You know thanks Ian. I understand your point of view, I do and you\u2019ve communicated clearly. I guess the simplest way I can explain it is given our real intention and I understand you know the different scenarios that you just pointed out, but I wanted to be as crystal clear as possible. If we\u2019re going to be buying shares and we wanted time to continue to deploy that capital into revenue streams if possible, we didn\u2019t want create any confusion.","So that's the simplest way as I could say it and I didn\u2019t really want to signal that we were going to be in the market and you did the math on that holdco. We are not sitting on a lot of excess capital today, it does build over time. So as we sit here, here and now and project in the near term, I just didn't want to confuse anyone.","IanGutterman","No, that's right. I guess the one thing I had to push back on a little bit is that you don\u2019t have a lot of excess capital today. I mean it's a significant part of your market cap, right and you could do another Aetna and still be fine and then have healthy dividends for \u201819 plus AMT, plus tax sharing, right. ","I mean it\u2019s generally when we project to the end of \u201919 you get to some pretty significant numbers. So I mean can you give us a sense of the timetable? Is there something every quarter we should expect another update on whether there will be a changer or we're going to have -- maybe you want to address it again until you give guidance for \u201819 or sort of when should we expect another update is maybe the best way to ask it?","ChrisSwift","Well Ian as you pointed out, I mean\u201919 is six quarters away. We\u2019ll have a lot of opportunities to communicate and interact and keep you posted. As you know I think we're very transparent. So all I would ask you to be is patient and we'll keep you posted.","IanGutterman","Alright. Sounds good. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from a line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please go ahead.","JayGelb","Thank you. I will not ask about buybacks, how about that. First on pace of reserve releases, its five consecutive quarters that Hartford\u2019s been able to put up overall reserve releases. Is this something you think we should start taking in on a go forward basis?","BethBombara","So Jay, its Beth. I mean we said this before. I mean we evaluate our reserve every quarter and we make adjustments accordingly. We don't predict whether or not there'll be future reserve releases. We've been very pleased with the underlying trend that we've seen and we'll just continue to evaluate it every quarter, you know line by line which is what we do and give you the transparency as to where we're seeing either improvement or areas that we need to add.","JayGelb","Let me see, okay. And then broadly on asbestos with the new Talcott-related exposure for J&J, just trying to think about how that might affect Hartford if there were some old occurrence liability policies out there from decades ago. I know the company typically does its annual review in the fourth quarter and it does have the adverse development cover in place with Berkshire, but just want get any broad thought you might have on Talcott related exposure. Thanks.","BethBombara","Sure, so a couple of things. I'm sure it won't surprise you to know that you know we have a team that is constantly looking at emerging towards issues. And the alleged connection between Talc and ovarian cancer has been on our radar for quite some time, and we take into consideration you know all the facts that we know as we evaluate our reserves and an overall feel very good about where our reserve stand. ","As it relates to our adverse coverage, its one thing that I will point, we do have an adverse cover with Berkshire, but specifically alleged connections between Talc and ovarian cancer and exposure there is specifically excluded from that cover and we obviously take that into consideration. (Cross Talk).","JayGelb","Sorry to cut you off, but why is that, why would it have been excluded?","BethBombara","That was part of the contact and what we negotiated. So that was specifically excluded.","JayGelb","Alright so, I guess I can apply it was known about at that time when the deal was done?","BethBombara","Known that we excluded it?","JayGelb","Known that it was a potential exposure.","ChrisSwift","Jay its best said, we\u2019ve been following this. I mean we have a world class claims team and particularly amass to our team, so a lot of these things aren\u2019t new to us and we've been on it for a while.","JayGelb","I appreciate that, thanks.","BethBombara","Thanks. I would note we're coming up on the hour and we've got a number of other people still in the queue. So Dan, we\u2019ll take one more question now and then I can follow up with everyone else in the queue after the call.","Operator","Certainly. Your final question today will come from the line of Randy Binner with B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.","RandyBinner","Thanks, I just had a couple follow-ups, real quick. Did you cover specifically on Commercial Auto, where you think price versus loss cost is now? And then the second one, the frequency in workers\u2019 comp. I'm not sure I actually heard what it is? Is it people getting car accidents while they're at the job or is there some kind of slip and fall thing happening out there. You alluded to you had less experienced workers, but if there is a thing that\u2019s actually happening that causes the frequency at work, I'd be interested in that?","ChrisSwift","Okay Randy, let me take them each separately. On the Commercial Auto front, we're still getting strong single digit pricing in auto and I expect that to be on top of trends. So good news there from Commercial Auto -- still more work to be done, but good news in terms of where we are in the current quarter.","Relative to frequency, you know I suggested that we believe there are some macro factors across the industry relative to employment and inexperienced workers that is driving the trend. It's going to take time for us to mature those observations and we are spending a lot of time looking at SAC class, geographies, size of risk, etcetera, etcetera, but know we are cost cutting the data very hard and at the moment it looks a little more broad based than just a couple of classes and we see this inexperienced worker dynamic where they tend to be injured in a more frequent basis than our more experienced workers. I don't think that's a surprise to anybody on the call. It\u2019s just a fact of something as underwriters we have to deal with every day in our risk business.","RandyBinner","Okay, but you can't point to it being you know \u2013 I mean so we've seen auto accidents creep into some other workers comp companies. So I'm just trying to just isolate that and I guess the answer is you don't know and then back on Commercial Auto, you said you are over trying to buy, like how many \u2013 roughly how many basis points do you think you're over pricing over loss cost in commercial auto?","DougElliot","Yeah, let me just go back to your first point. At this point I don't see the full connection. I don't think auto is driving our workers comp frequency increase. We\u2019ll continue to study as it changes and I\u2019ll share that going forward. And secondly, we don\u2019t share specifically, exactly those points, but it\u2019s a couple of points over the top of the loss trend at this point relative to pricing versus trend.","RandyBinner","That's great, thanks a lot.","ChrisSwift","But Doug I\u2019d make a point too that it's still not anywhere near where we want to be from a long term return point of view. So the current year and maybe the last eighteen months we were out earning loss trends, but there are still ways to go to get to an overall acceptable combined ratio.","DougElliot","I agree with that Chris.","RandyBinner","Thank you.","Beth Bombara","Thank you all for joining us today. I appreciate the attention to our earnings results and all the questions that you have. Sean and I will follow up with those of you who are still in the queue after the call.","Thank you very much and hope you have a great summer weekend.","Operator","Thank you to everyone for attending today. This will conclude today\u2019s call and you may now disconnect.

McGee","Thank you, Sabra. Good morning, everyone, and thanks again for joining us today.","We're pleased to report another quarter of strong execution at the Hartford. We continued to deliver on our objectives of generating profitable growth in the go-forward businesses and reducing the size and the risk of the legacy annuity blocks. In June, we also announced a significant expansion of our capital management program. As you saw last night, The Hartford delivered second quarter core earnings of $324 million, up 18% over the prior year. Driven by improving fundamentals, aggregate core earnings in Property & Casualty, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds were up 28%. This earnings growth reflects the continuation of positive pricing momentum in Property & Casualty and Group Benefits, as well as product and distribution initiatives that are generating profitable growth.","We continue to achieve meaningful price increases in Property & Casualty commercial. Renewal written pricing increased 8% on average in the Standard Commercial lines in the second quarter, consistent with the company's last 3 quarters and well ahead of loss cost trends.","Our philosophy and approach is unchanged, and we will continue to be aggressive and smart in our pricing actions. We are optimistic that this disciplined approach to pricing combined with loss costs that remained benign, would drive additional margin expansion going forward.","In Consumer Markets, Andy and his team have continued to leverage our relationship with AARP, expanding margins and delivering 2% written premium growth. This was the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year written premium growth. For AARP sold to agents, which as you know, is a key growth opportunity for this business, written premiums were up 63% in the second quarter.","In P&C Commercial, Doug and his team have complemented The Hartford's traditional expertise in workers' compensation with expanded product and underwriting capabilities in property and liability. This is particularly apparent in Middle Market, where we continue to diversify new business production. Through these actions, The Hartford is becoming a stronger and a more balanced commercial P&C player. In Group Benefits, profitability continued to improve in the second quarter as a result of our disciplined approach to pricing and our management of the book. We also benefited from improving disability incidence rates, a positive change from the company's experience over the past few years. Small Commercial just launched an expansion of its agency new business platform called ICON. This will improve the quoting and sales experience for agents and their CSRs, providing us the opportunity to quote and bind a higher percentage of available business. We're also rolling out a new top-of-the-line P&C claims handling system, which will improve the speed and efficiency of our claims process. We expect to begin implementation of the system in mid-2014.","The Hartford is investing significantly in initiatives like ICON and the claims system to strengthen our capabilities and competitive advantage. With improving execution and these investments, I am confident that we will achieve additional margin expansion and profitable top line growth in 2013 and beyond. In Mutual Funds, Jim Davey and his team continued to make progress with strong growth sales and solid investment performance against benchmarks in the second quarter. We remain optimistic about our ability to improve net flows and grow assets under management. The Talcott Resolution team made further progress reducing the size and risk of the legacy annuity blocks. In the U.S., the enhanced Surrender Value program has been more successful than we expected, with a 30% cumulative take rate to date. This contributed several points to the U.S. full surrender rate, which rose to 17.5% annualized for the second quarter. In Japan, the annualized full surrender rate jumped to almost 35% in the second quarter, driven by the significantly improved moneyness [ph] of the book. To put this number in perspective, until 2013, the annual surrender rate in Japan averaged less than 4%. While we cannot predict future lapse rates with certainty, at current market levels, we believe Japanese surrenders will remain much higher than our prior experience. The Talcott team also reached an agreement in June to sell the U.K. variable annuity business. The transaction which we expect to close by year-end eliminates the risk and expense associated with this VA block.","Finally, in June, we announced the $750 million expansion of our 2013, 2014 equity repurchase program to a total of $1.25 billion. In addition, the quarterly dividend was increased from $0.10 to $0.15 per share. This announcement resulted from our success over the past few years to focus The Hartford on capital-generating businesses, to reduce the size and risk of the annuity blocks and to achieve capital self-sufficiency in the Talcott operations. The Hartford is committed to delivering profitable growth in our businesses and further reducing risk. We are delivering on these objectives, which will continue to create shareholder value.","I'll now turn the call over to Doug for a discussion on Commercial Markets. Doug, welcome.","Douglas G. Elliot","Thank you, Liam, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to cover our P&C Commercial and Group Benefits results for the second quarter of 2013. I'll also provide some commentary on the marketplace and updates on several key business objectives. Margin improvement through effective underwriting and pricing actions remains at the top of our priorities, and we're pleased with our continued progress during the second quarter.","Let me begin on Slide 5. P&C Commercial had a combined ratio for the quarter of 98.4%. We continued to experience very solid pricing gains at 8%, generally consistent with our prior quarters.","Our results for the quarter include a charge of $80 million for the elimination of the New York Workers' Compensation, 25-A fund. Excluding this charge, our combined ratio was 93.2%, 7.3 points lower than the second quarter of 2012. Lower cat losses in the quarter accounted for 2 points of this improvement. Our prior year development, excluding the adjustment for New York 25-A was positive news of $43 million in the quarter. Underlining all of these factors, our second quarter combined ratio, x-cat and x-prior year development, was 93.1%, 1.4 points lower than the second quarter of 2012.","Our focus on underwriting and pricing continues to drive favorable accident year profitability trends. Our Group Benefit business had an outstanding quarter. Core earnings of $37 million were up $7 million from the first quarter of 2013. On a year-to-date basis, earnings are up 72%. Before I review the results of our business segments, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our pricing approach and our supporting analytics. We have a highly segmented approach for determining the rate need within our book of business. This sophistication has allowed us to successfully target increases within underperforming segments, while retaining those segments that are adequately priced.","As our pricing execution has become more sophisticated, so too have the analytical tools we use to capture the results of our actions. We have made refinements this quarter to the calculation we used to determine renewal written pricing, to better reflect rate changes on our renewed mix of business.","Let me now share some specific thoughts about each of our 4 business segments, starting on the Property Casualty side with Small Commercial on Slide 7. Written premiums of $787 million were up 2% in the quarter. Our current accident quarter combined ratio of 91.5% improved 2 points from second quarter of 2012, driven primarily by lower cats. Pricing in this business remains strong at 8%, well in front of our loss trends. And I'm very pleased with our ability to effectively manage profit margins.","We have consistently outperformed the market, achieving industry-leading combined ratios over many years. Our formula for managing profitability in this business has not changed, and we're well-positioned to maintain our performance in this business as we continue to refine our margins.","As Liam mentioned in his comments, we also continued to strengthen our Small Commercial market position with the rollout of ICON for our business owners' package policy. ICON is our new business quoting platform for Small Commercial, and we have completely redesigned this tool to improve the speed, responsiveness and accuracy process for our agents. We now have our Small Business worker's compensation and package products available on the new platform, and response from our agents has been very positive. Once commercial auto is released in 2014, we'll have our entire core small Commercial product suite available for new business production through this state-of-the-art automation platform. All in all, a very good quarter for our Small Commercial business.","Moving to Slide 8. Our Middle Market segment also had a very good quarter with a current accident quarter combine ratio of 97.6%. This result is 5.6 points lower than 2012, with 2.4 points of that improvement attributable to favorable catastrophes. This business has come a very long way from where we were 2 years ago. Written pricing for the quarter, although down approximately 1.5 points sequentially, registered a solid 8% increase year-over-year. Coupled with our underwriting actions, margins have continued to improve across all of our core lines, especially worker's compensation.","Over the last 8 quarters, we've been intensely focused on executing our pricing strategies in Middle Market and we've made substantial improvements in our book of business quality and performance. Our current accident quarter loss ratio, excluding cats, is down nearly 5 points from last year. We remain aggressive on our pricing approach, particularly for business that continues to underperform. This is especially important for our worker's compensation line, which has needed more rate action than any other portion of our book. This quarter, worker's comp renewal written pricing in the Middle Market achieved a 10% increase. Although down from the low teens a year ago, this rate level continues to drive margin expansion on an improved book profile.","In addition, rates and other lines such as commercial, auto and property are up versus same time 2012. Some segments of our business are now performing extremely well after several cycles of pricing and require more modest rate increases to remain ahead of loss cost trends. We still expect to achieve margin improvement on these accounts, but not at the pace of 2 years ago. These shifts are the result of our analytics, which allow us to manage pricing and retention for overall results.","Early in my tenure, we established a strategic goal to become a more balanced Middle Market underwriter, complementing our expertise in worker's compensation with equal skill in the property and general liability lines. This goal supports both our intent to profitably grow our franchise and the desire to mitigate the risks that follow from over concentrations in a single line of business. We have made substantial progress on this front, and our mix of business continued to improve in the second quarter.","Worker's compensation new business in the quarter accounted for 29% of total new business, compared with 46% during the same period 2 years ago. Retentions have remained steady and our new business opportunities in property and general liability are growing, as the marketplace recognizes our strength and competencies in these lines.","Total written premium in the quarter was slightly positive, which is the first time I can say that since our reunderwriting actions took hold in the third quarter of 2011. Overall, this was another good quarter of progress for Middle Market. Our approach to profit management remains steady as we look to reach our long-term target returns.","The performance of our Specialty business on Slide 9 remains largely consistent with the first quarter. Our success with national accounts, primarily in the $1 million to $5 million segment, continues. We wrote 24 new accounts in the quarter and our retention of existing accounts remains strong. Pricing in this market segment has been rational and we're achieving rate levels consistent with our long-term targets. Financial products had a good quarter with continued positive mid-single-digit pricing across the portfolio. As you may have already noted, we released $30 million of professional liability reserves as we continue to examine our results for all accident years.","Shifting over to our programs area. Reunderwriting actions continued during the quarter with particular focus on auto liability exposures. With almost all the transportation programs now nonrenewed, our book quality is improving. We did take a charge of $40 million to our auto liability line, of which $35 million related to our program business. Much of this reunderwriting is behind us and we feel better about the positioning of this segment moving forward.","As summarized on Slide 10, our Group Benefit business had an outstanding quarter, as I had earlier mentioned. We've been very disciplined in our management actions and the results are clearly paying off.","Core earnings for the quarter were up $3 million over prior year, achieving a margin of 3.9%.","Year-to-date, core earnings of $67 million increased $28 million, doubling our margin versus the same period 1 year ago.","Our disability loss ratio of 82.7% in the quarter was favorable to last year by over 10 points, driven by earned pricing and improvements in our claim trends.","Pricing in the quarter remains favorable with long-term disability rate increases of 6%.","Year-to-date, our long-term disability rate increases nearly 13% due to a much larger first quarter renewal premium base versus the second quarter. And new sales in the quarter were $103 million, up 56% from 2012, as pricing in certain sectors of the new business marketplace improved.","In previous quarters, we've commented that our claim recoveries were improving. That improvement continued this quarter across our long-term and short-term disability books. We're also encouraged by the early signs of declining incidence rates in our 2012 book. As you recall, incidence rates have been stable for several quarters, but at historically elevated levels.","As our 2012 data has matured, we have observed a modest but consistent decrease in incidence rates, approaching levels we've not seen in several years. We'll be watching our data very closely in the quarters ahead to determine the sustainability of this improvement. We have nearly completed a full cycle of pricing and underwriting actions on our multiyear contracts. Our January 2014 renewal block will complete much of that effort and this disciplined execution is delivering results. We're committed to staying in front of loss trends with deeper claim and pricing analytics.","These positive signs in our Group Benefits performance are a direct result of the aggressive actions we've taken over the last few years. Stepping back from the details, this a very good quarter for Commercial Markets. Our performance and trends were consistent with the strong start in the first quarter, and we continue to see the positive results of underwriting and pricing decisions made over the last few years. Overall, pricing is still outpacing our loss cost trends and driving margin improvement. There's still much work ahead, but I'm excited about our progress.","Let me now turn the call over to Andy Napoli.","Andr\u00e9 A. Napoli","Thanks, Doug. In Consumer Markets, our continued focus is to improve margins while steadily improving our growth trajectory, and we're pleased with the progress we've made. Our combined ratio for AARP direct auto continues to perform at\/or better than our target. We're making good strides in non-AARP agency auto as our x-cat, x-prior year combined ratio was 8 points better than second quarter 2012.","In Homeowners, favorable weather experience is contributing to improving profitability. Core earnings for the quarter were $15 million versus a loss of $47 million last year. The improvement in core earnings was generated from 3 primary sources. First, our x-cat and x-prior year combined ratio improved 2.4 points to 88.9%; second, cat losses were lower this year; and third, we had higher favorable prior year development, primarily related to prior year cats.","Current accident year cat losses for the quarter were $142 million, primarily related to wind and hail events across the Midwest and Plains states, including the tornado that hit Moore, Oklahoma. We had the same number of events in the quarter, as we did last year, but with lower severity.","We also released $31 million of reserves related to Storm Sandy and other prior year cats. Claims severity for this sort of event is always challenging to estimate. And as it turns out, property and auto loss severities have emerged favorably, and auto salvage returns are coming in better than expected.","Focusing on auto profitability. Our combined ratio, x-cat and x-prior year, improved to 93.8%, just over 2 points better than last year.","From a loss trend perspective, we're seeing favorability and auto liability frequency, in particular, lower-cost fender benders and personal injury protection or PIP claims. Auto physical damage severity trends have moderated slightly, and we'll continue to watch this closely.","In homeowners, our combined ratio, x-cat and prior year, dropped just over 2 points to 77.9%, reflecting continued favorable non-cat weather frequency and strong earned pricing in excess of expected loss cost.","Now let's transition to growth. Written premiums grew 2% and we're positioned to maintain that level throughout the remainder of the year. Written premiums were up 1% in auto and 3% in homeowners. Contributing to the growth were renewal written pricing increases of 5% and 7%, respectively, and improved policy retention in both product lines. New business increased 9% to $93 million in auto and 13% to $34 million in homeowners.","New business production was driven in part by a 28% increase in the number of authorized AARP agency locations, now at over 6,600, and a 32% increase in Internet responses for our AARP direct business.","I'd like to focus for a moment on this online component of our direct operating model. As many of you know, the foundation of our 28-year partnership with AARP is an effective multimedia direct model that aligns well with current personal lines channel trends. Historically, the vast majority of our direct responses end up in our phone centers as new business acquisition opportunities, and we've enjoyed a great deal of success with this phone-centric model.","Recently, we've made a concerted effort to increase our digital throughput. In other words, to have more direct responses finish online. Given industry consumer buying trends, we believe our ability to generate and close business online will be a significant component of our growth and profitability story in the future. Most notably, we recently started providing customers the ability to bundle auto and home in one integrated online quote. Our efforts are beginning to yield positive results.","We like this channel as it is more efficient and online business has tended to have higher retention and therefore could contribute higher lifetime value than other channels in our operating model.","In closing, we're pleased with our results for the second quarter and the first half of this year, and the remainder of 2013 continues to look positive. We'll continue to take rate increases in both auto and home to either maintain or achieve our combined ratio targets, and we'll closely monitor the impact on new business and retention while continuing to execute our strategy to deliver profitable growth.","I'll now turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher John Swift","Thank you, Andy. Good morning, everyone. This morning, I will cover 3 topics: first, I will review key items from the quarter; second, I will update statutory capital and holding company resources, including VA impacts in the Group Benefits' legal-entity separation project; and third, I will provide a third quarter outlook.","Let's begin on Slide 16. Second quarter 2013 core earnings were up 18% to $324 million or $0.66 per diluted share. We produced strong results this quarter, even before adjusting last year's results worth $39 million of earnings from the Individual Life and Retirement Plans businesses, which were sold in January of this year.","This quarter's core earnings growth was driven by improved margins in the Commercial and Consumer Markets, which Doug and Andy just covered, and Mutual Funds growth.","Excluding prior year development, core earnings per diluted share were about $0.85, which is above the outlook we provided in April of $0.65 to $0.70 due to better underwriting results, higher Talcott earnings and higher limited partnership returns. Annualized limited partnership returns were 13% this quarter, well over our 6% outlook, resulting in excess returns of about $0.05 in core earnings per diluted share.","Mutual funds core earnings were up 5% relative to the second quarter of 2012. Jim Davey and his team continue to build momentum in key areas, including sales, distribution initiatives and fund performance.","Sales were up 32% over the prior year. Net flows were negative, including $2.5 billion in 2 large redemptions, one of which was a $1.4 billion institutional account that was expected to redeem. In P&C other operations, core losses increased this quarter due to a $141 million pretax charge for additional reserves related to our annual asbestos and environmental study. $130 million of this charge or $85 million after tax, was for legacy asbestos exposures. The majority of the development was from increased severity in frequency on a small number of our direct accounts, about 50 out of 1,100 policyholders. These policyholders are not -- are peripheral defendants, meaning that they did not produce asbestos but may have used another company's asbestos in their business.","Talcott's core earnings were down 2%, which I'll cover in a few minutes. In the Corporate segment, core losses improved $11 million over the prior year quarter, principally due to lower interest expense from debt repayments.","Turning to Slide 17. Second quarter core earnings included prior year development of $95 million after tax or $0.19 per share, including the asbestos charge. Aside from asbestos, this quarter's prior year development included $80 million before tax for increased worker's compensation loss reserves in New York State as a result of the legislative closing of the fund for reopened cases in that state. This is a onetime charge for estimated future claims that could occur if currently closed worker's compensation claims reopen in the future.","Aside from the New York charge, we had favorable development in P&C Commercial of $43 million, principally on professional and general liability, catastrophes and uncollectible reinsurance. We had some unfavorable development on commercial auto, almost entirely in the Specialty line. Beyond the New York charge, worker's compensation had almost no net prior year development.","Consumer Markets had favorable development of $32 million, largely due to favorable prior year catastrophe development, Storm Sandy in particular. You'll notice that second quarter cat losses were right on our forecast and cats were a lot lower than last year. Finally, our trailing 12-month core earnings ROE was 7.6%, a significant improvement from a year ago. We expect to achieve a 2013 core earnings ROE of approximately 8% for the full year, which is at the high end of our outlook of 7.5% to 8% that we communicated earlier this year.","Turning to Slide 18. There are 2 principal items which reduced our strong core earnings and generated a second quarter net loss of $190 million. First, net realized capital losses not included in core earnings were $413 million after tax, mostly due to the Japan VA hedging losses; and second, losses from discontinued operations were $126 million, due to the sale of Hartford Life International Ltd.","Turning to Slide 19. The Hartford's book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, was $38.44, down 4% from the $40 at year-end, principally due to the items that I just covered, as well as the first quarter Japan DAC write-off, and loss and extinguishment of debt.","Book value including AOCI was $38.59 per share at June 30, down 16% from $45.80 at year-end. The change in book value includes a $900 million reduction in net unrealized gains in AOCI during the first quarter due to the business sales. Since March, AOCI has reduced principally due to the impact of higher interest rates and credit spreads on the market value of our $82 billion general account portfolio.","As you can see on the chart on the bottom of this slide, after tax unrealized gains on our investment portfolio declined from $2.8 billion in March to $1.3 billion at the end of June, as the 10-year treasury yield rose from 1.87% to 2.49%.","Since year end, we have repurchased about 60 -- excuse me, $166 million of equity, including $118 million during the second quarter. In June, as Liam mentioned, we expanded our repurchase program to $1.25 billion. Going forward, our repurchase activity will be about $200 million a quarter through year-end 2014, subject to legal restrictions and market conditions.","Now let's turn to Talcott results on Slide 20. As I mentioned, Talcott core earnings were $196 million, down 2% over prior year, which included $39 million of Life and Retirement Plans businesses that were sold in January of 2013. The quarter included $23 million of after tax costs related to the ESV program. This quarter also had lower DAC amortization, most of which was due to the first quarter write-off of the Japan DAC asset, which eliminated future DAC amortization.","Talcott's second quarter earnings also benefited from $39 million of pretax limited partnership income, up slightly from $32 million in the second quarter of 2012 and up from $24 million in the first quarter of 2013. Our focus for Talcott is reducing its size and risk, and we are pleased with the progress this quarter.","On Slide 21, full surrenders on the Japan block more than tripled for the first quarter. This reflects higher market levels, which significantly improved policyholder account values.","At the end of June, 57% of Japan GMIB contracts were in the money for policyholders compared with 99% a year ago. And the average in the moneyness was 7%, down from 20% for June 2012.","Surrender activity was at an annualized rate of 34.8% for the quarter. Surrender activity to date has been highly correlated to market levels. Once policyholders are out of the money, meaning that their account value is higher than their guarantee, we have seen surrenders sharply increase. July surrender activity has been approximately 30% on an annualized basis.","Slide 22 covers our U.S. VA block. Full VA surrenders in the U.S. increased to 17.5% for the quarter, primarily due to the ESV program and higher market levels. The ESV program has performed much better than our original expectations with an overall take up rate of 30% to date. As a result of market levels and surrenders, NAR has decreased on both the Japan and the U.S. VA block since March 31.","Japan GMIB NAR was $851 million, down 34% from first quarter and down 87% from the $6.5 billion at June 30, 2012. U.S. GMWB NAR was 300 -- excuse me, $282 million at the end of June, down the slightly from March, but down 72% since June, 2012.","Keep in mind, our NAR calculation is not discounted or adjusted for policyholder behavior assumptions. It also does not include the benefits of hedging.","Let's now turn to our capital position, which is summarized on Slide 23. As you can see, The Hartford's capital resources totaled $18.1 billion at June 30, compared with $18.7 billion at the end of March, principally due to lower U.S. life statutory surplus, which I'll cover in a minute.","U.S. P&C surplus was down slightly due to the normal quarterly dividend paid to the holding company. Holding company resources were $2.2 billion before the $320 million July debt repayment and third quarter share repurchases.","Slide 24 shows the components of the change in U.S. statutory surplus. As you can see, the largest impact on U.S. life statutory surplus was the negative VA impact of approximately $600 million. This decline was principally due to the Japan VA hedging losses, as the majority of the Japan VA hedges are in U.S. life legal entities, but only a portion of the policyholder liability is in our U.S. life legal entities.","Our hedge programs performed this quarter as designed. As a reminder, our hedging programs target the economic value of the VA block, not statutory or GAAP accounting. However, our hedge results closely match the change in the economics of the book, which we call market consistent value or MCV. The MCV has improved over the past quarter with the weakening of the yen, higher global equity markets and higher interest rates.","Aside from the VA impacts, statutory capital impacts were relatively modest this quarter, and I would draw your attention to the positive life statutory earnings reflecting better group benefits and fixed annuity results.","Although statutory capital declined during the quarter, our overall capital margins remained strong and has improved since year end, reflecting the reduction in risk of our business, including the impact of business sales. Overall, current capital resources were $18.1 billion compared with the $16.6 billion at December 31, 2012, before the closing of the Life and Retirement Plans sales.","I also wanted to update you on our Group Benefits legal entity separation project. Slide 25 shows our current legal structure on the left side, and on the right, what it will look like once we complete the legal entity separation project. Part of our Group Benefits business is included in Talcott Resolution legal entities, which we want to restructure, so that management and legal entities are aligned.","The legal entity separation process requires regulatory licensing approval from New York for Hartford Life and Accident, which we call HLA, to write Group Benefits business in New York. We intend to move some capital within the life group in order to capitalize HLA to higher standalone RBC levels, which will require approval from the Connecticut Department of Insurance to move the funds within the life group. We do not expect to use holding company or P&C capital resources for this legal entity separation. We are also working on operational initiatives needed to achieve this separation, and are on track to complete by early 2014.","Now I'd like to cover our third quarter outlook on Slide 26. Our third quarter outlook projects core earnings of approximately $345 million to $370 million or $0.70 to $0.75 per diluted share, assuming a weighted average share count of approximately $490 million. Included in this outlook are the following: first, catastrophe losses of $86 million after tax; second, Talcott core earnings of $160 million to $175 million, including approximately $7 million in after tax costs for the ESV program; third, prior year development for the accretion of discount on worker's compensation reserves of $6 million after tax, no other prior year development is included in this outlook; fourth, our outlook for a limited partnership investment income is about $5 million before tax, lower than our annual 6% assumption due to the expected fund performance in the third quarter; finally, around $200 million of share and warrant repurchases in the third quarter.","As a reminder, core earnings do not include restructuring charges or DAC unlocks, including any impacts from our annual policyholder behavior study in the third quarter.","To wrap up the second quarter, let me summarize a few themes. Our go-forward businesses are producing strong results, reflecting disciplined pricing actions. We are confident in our ability to profitably grow and improve margins, which will offset the decline in Talcott earnings going forward. We are focused on continuing our transformation of The Hartford by improving our overall cost competitiveness, with a continuous process improvement mindset. We are pleased by the trends we see at Talcott, which contributes to the goals of reducing the risk and size of the VA blocks.","Capital resources and margin remain robust with Talcott remaining capital self-sufficient. Lastly, we have a positive outlook for the remainder of the year with expanding margins, assuming cats are in line with expectations.","Now I'll turn the call over to Sabra, so we could begin the Q&A answer session. Sabra?","Sabra Purtill","Thank you, Chris. We know our prepared comments went a little long this morning, but we've reserved about 30 minutes for Q&A. Please be considerate of others and limit yourself to 1 question and a follow-up. And you're, of course, welcome to requeue for additional question. Laurel, could you please give the Q&A instructions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Erik Bass with Citigroup.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just the first question, just given the increase in the pace of runoff for the VA blocks, can you talk about the potential timing for taking a dividend from Talcott? And is there any possibility of taking out money in 2014?","Liam E. McGee","I'll turn that over to Chris.","Christopher John Swift","Well, thank you. I think just the context on that is, yes, we are pleased with what we're seeing in Talcott, both in Japan and the U.S. as far as increased lapses. I think what we said in our Investor April Day, it remains true today, is that we do expect to take dividends out of Talcott in early 2015 or possibly late 2014. But do -- surrenders do help? No doubt about it. But I think we'd like to see where they sort of normalize out on a basis going forward, and we'll revise our thinking probably in early '14. And once we do, we'll let you know if we have any changes to our dividend plans.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And just one follow-up. Any -- given the success of the ESV program, any interests or opportunities for further Enhance Surrender programs going forward?","Liam E. McGee","Erik, Beth will take that.","Beth A. Bombara","Sure, thank you. So as both Liam and Chris said, we've been very pleased with the success of the ESV program. And we plan to continue to evaluate the potential for other types of programs, and we'd expect that we would continue to be very targeted in how we would look at those. I'd also point out, there are other things that we're doing, as it relates to just managing the book and looking at ways to reduce the risk. So we are in the process right now of utilizing certain provisions at our contracts to increase writer fees, to turn off some investment options for subsequent payments or transfer of funds, as well as enforcing, in some limited situations, investment allocation restrictions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","On the Japan surrenders, can you give us a sense of -- I know that the annualized surrender level came off a bit in July, but would you anticipate that we should approach a more normalized level at some point? Or can we still keep running at these double-digit levels?","Liam E. McGee","Beth will take that, Jake.","Beth A. Bombara","Okay. Yes, so let me give you a little bit of color on the surrender rate. If we look back over the last several months, so as we said, 34.8% for the quarter. But if you look at it by month, in April we were running at about 23%. May, we spiked up to 50%. June was at 29.5%. And as Chris said, for July, we're running at about 30%. So it's hard for us to predict at to what levels things will level off at. But we are seeing that as markets continue to improve and as markets stay at these levels, the activity rates continue to be high.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then separately in Commercial P&C, premium growth turned positive for the first time in a few quarters. I'm trying to get a sense of whether you feel that's sustainable. And I think there was also a bit of confusion about the pace of rate increases in Standard Commercial having flattened, whereas based on some of the prior disclosure, it looks like it dipped a bit.","Douglas G. Elliot","Jay, this is Doug. So a few comments. One is the overall Standard Commercial is generally flat, so we were 8% in the quarter, and I think that's about where we were in first quarter. I did give you some commentary about Middle Market versus Small. And in the Middle Market, we were off sequentially a point or so from first quarter, but still very strong at 8%. So I think you've got to get inside the markets to understand that. And we feel good about that progress, and given the amount of positive change we've had the last couple of years, feel good about sustained margin improvement. The question about new business, we had a good new business quarter and our overall Middle Market growth up a touch. It's -- my comment was, it's the first quarter we've seen growth in the Middle Market in quite some time. We have done a lot of work, particularly in our worker's comp book, but we feel like a lot of that work is behind us and we're looking good about moving forward.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I appreciate that. Just to clarify on that Standard Commercial renewal pricing, the disclosure looks a bit different in 2Q than 1Q in terms of the pace of rate increases. What changed there in terms of how that's being calculated?","Douglas G. Elliot","So we refined our approach to calculations just slightly. And first, I would say that the overall trends are very consistent throughout the periods but have moved to more an effective policy-month basis, which means that we continue to follow policies and we'll adjust accordingly on mid-term cancels, and cancels flat out an extended period and push the results back into prior periods. So with those changes, from time-to-time, you'll have some slight deviations from prior periods, and I think it's a much more effective, more accurate way for us to watch the book of business performing.","Operator","You're next question comes from the line of Mark Finkelstein with Evercore.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Maybe stick with Doug for the first question. I guess just on Specialty, I'm trying to understand kind of the story a little bit on the program business. I think I heard you say that much of the actions have been completed and that the pricing levels are hitting targets, I may have mis-, kind of, characterized that a little bit. But then you look at the combined ratio for the quarter x-cat x-development 105.7%. So I guess I'm just trying to kind of put those -- put everything together and think about where -- like, where is Specialty in terms of the culling of the unprofitable programs and kind of repricing those? And the combined ratio outlook on that?","Douglas G. Elliot","Good question, Mark, this is Doug. So keep in mind, inside Specialty, there really are 3 very different books of business. Our national casualty book, which essentially is an excess casualty book, well performing at our targets. We had a good quarter of new business. And again, those targets, the target combined ratios for 10% to 15% return are much higher than our normal Standard or Small Commercial targets. They're in excess of 105% and they move based on yield levels. So that's why the overall segment will never perform at a combined ratio equal to Middle, because they've got different targets. Secondly, our financial product book. Over the last couple of years, we've done a lot of work, and that book has really shaped nicely over the last couple of years, as we've moved away from some of the larger financial institution business. And as you saw, we had a release in quarter, so we feel good about that book of business. And then in the programs area, there are about 50 programs and we've worked our way through all those 50 programs. And in some cases, we're taking very aggressive corrective strategies, in some cases, exit. I'll share with you that in the specialty auto programs, where we've had some degree of pain over the last couple of years, essentially are exiting those programs, have largely nonrenewed those blocks. So we've taken some balance sheet work in the quarter, where we strengthen reserves, and I think underwriting lies. We're in a much better spot moving forward.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just to follow up on that. So it's essentially the actions that you need to take, whether it's on the culling or the pricing side, largely complete at the end of the second quarter, is that the message on the kind of the third book of business that you're referring to?","Douglas G. Elliot","Yes, I think that's very accurate -- definitely accurate on the auto liability programs. And obviously, as we shift our way through the rest, we'll spend more time. But much better shape of that overall book of business than a year ago.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. I guess maybe just going back to the life side. I'd seem to recall, Chris, you mentioning at the Investor Day or maybe it was somebody else, but that you go through a third quarter assumption review on the life side. I'm trying to think about how the surrenders are going to factor into that, and is there any early read on how we should think about that?","Christopher John Swift","Mark, it's Chris. I'm not sure who talked about it. But I think the context maybe just for this year's study, is if you particularly look at some of the items that we've taken already, meaning like the Japan DAC write-off in the first quarter due to expanded hedging, when I look at the assumption update, I see very minor GAAP and stat impacts, just given some of the things we've already dealt with. I think as we look out net-net, higher surrenders will most likely -- I'm hedging a little bit, but most likely be positive on a GAAP and stat basis. But we're in the midst of that study, but I generally don't expect any material surprises, charges as we complete that study, Mark.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just final one, one quick question on the quality of the Japan surrenders. I mean, I know that you're going to always be distorted towards -- the more out of the moneyness, but is it a cross-section across the book? Or is it really kind of mainly the stuff that's out of the money?","Beth A. Bombara","So when we look at the -- where the lapses are coming from, it really is once we see the account value exceed the guarantee. And I would say, it's very sensitive right at that -- right when we get to that 100% level. So that is where we see the increase a little bit, maybe, when they're in that 95% to 100%, but it really is when they cross that line. So as markets continue to improve, and we just see more and more of the book, and it's hitting that point, that's where we're seeing the surrenders come from.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm with BofA Merrill Lynch. A couple of questions. For the third quarter guidance, Chris, you had mentioned a somewhat lower run rate for the performance of some of the alternative investment funds. Is that because these are reported on a lag, you have a sense of the performance already?","Christopher John Swift","Yes, I would say a combination of that, and then just the early read into July's performance. So I would say July was pretty volatile and some of our alternative allocations actually went negative for July. So as we look really at the remaining 2 months, August and September, Jay, we just are heavily influenced by what we're seeing through June and July.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it, got it. Second question, on asbestos. You've been at this a long time, still taking material charges. Do you feel as if you are getting down to the short strokes? Do you have any more confidence that next year will be a much lower number than what we've seen this year?","Christopher John Swift","Jay, it's Chris. I understand the question, and all I could tell you is when we study our process -- I mean, you know it's a comprehensive ground up process where we'd look at detailed coverage charge on our individual insurers and see the entire picture. We react to, I'll call it, the new data that we're seeing. And as I -- we wrote about in the queue, we're seeing just a little uptick in frequency compared to prior year, and again, modest severity. So there's no fundamental trends that are different this year. It's still a peripheral issue for us. I would say that plaintiff counsel has continued to be expansive in some of their theories. So as I really sit here, honestly, and look at, I'll call it, our reserves, look at our survival ratios, I mean, I feel good about what we'd reacted to this year and what we're seeing and we've made our best estimate. But as you know, it's awful hard to predict where this is going to go 2, 3 years out. And all I could tell you is, well, we do our best job every year and make the appropriate adjustments that we see are needed.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel with Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Two quick questions. I realize there's so much that goes into the calculation of a market consistent approach. But recognizing that the statutory accounting gets in the way, the reserves in Japan, the hedges in the U.S., that sort of thing, can you give us some sense given the significant surrender activity, as well as the reduction in the moneyness? Can you give us some sense for percentage-wise, maybe how much you think the market consistent value of the VA blocks increased?","Christopher John Swift","John, it's Chris. I understand your point. Again, I think the context is, as we explained in Investor Day, particularly in Japan, that we are really sort of market-neutral at that point for Japan. So as our hedging losses -- as we hedge, I mean, the hedging losses are virtually offset entirely by gains in our MCV. And as we looked at results this quarter, that pattern, all the -- exactly the same. So that our hedging programs, as I said, are working as designed. We're hedging the economics. We took risk off the table completely in Japan. And that's a change from the first quarter where we were still under our tail hedge program. So the losses might seem large, but I can tell you that it was virtually offset by an increase in our MCV.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then the second question I have for you is just thinking about the third quarter guidance maybe relative to second quarter results, and most specifically just thinking about non-cat weather. It seems to me that you're either building in, maybe it's just some seasonality, maybe it's some normalization of non-cat weather, but it seems like it's material. You mentioned a favorable or somewhat favorable non-cat weather in 2Q. I was just hoping you could maybe quantify for us or give us some sense for how much non-cat weather is playing into the guidance in 3Q versus 2Q?","Christopher John Swift","John, as I just roll forward, I'll call it, second quarter to the third quarter, I think the 2 big items are lower partnership alternative returns and lower Talcott earnings. I think if I look at Doug's book of business in Commercial, I don't see that much seasonality. I think Andy probably has a little bit more with driving patterns, weather patterns. So I would say that there's some, but I wouldn't describe it as ordinarily immaterial. The more seasonalities in the second quarter with obviously a higher cats, and you saw our cat load for the quarter. So it's me, it's Talcott and it's just lower partnership returns which, again, we're reacting to data that we've seen through July here.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions here. First, I'm just curious, the impact of the ESV program here going forward on Talcott results, should we see that largely go away in the third quarter? Or when is that going to start going away, that $23 million?","Christopher John Swift","Brian, I think in my guidance and hopefully on the slide, I know it is. We described the ESV expenses for the third quarter estimated to be lower at $7 million after tax.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And will that continue to kind of run down at that trend? Do you think in the fourth quarter is that better?","Christopher John Swift","Yes. Again, it's -- I think Beth expects. And she could describe it, the take rate at 30%. Yes, we see the sort of -- a dissipation of that take rate, so we don't think it's going to increase material -- materially going forward. So $5 million, $3 million a quarter probably -- is probably a better number going forward.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then Andy hasn't talked -- a quick question for Andy. On the questions, Andy, at looking at the underwriting expense, they've been dropping at about 5% a quarter for the last couple of quarters in your area, is that something we should continue to see going forward? Or is there something unusual happening in the first half?","Andr\u00e9 A. Napoli","Brian, it's Andy. Thanks. Yes, so you saw a 1 point improvement on a year-over-year basis in the quarter. I would say about 1\/3 of that is sustainable going forward. The rest of it was sort of one-timers around timing and some other things. But it's an area that we pay really strict attention to, but I would say 1\/3 of that is sustainable.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess first question for you, just following up on the ESV program, the higher lapses in Japan and all. Certainly, I think, the pace is above what many of us have thought. I'm wondering if it at all changes kind of the leverage you would be considering in terms of accelerating the runoff of the block.","Liam E. McGee","Well, certainly, Chris, it's an important variable. As Chris Swift said, just a few moments ago, as we look at the business, we're going to monitor both the U.S. and Japan lapse rates very closely. And we are positioned -- I would describe as, largely unchanged. We're going to do what's in the best interest of shareholders, whether -- and watching lapse rates will be a part of that, and exploring potential permanent transfer of the Japan book, in particular, is something we'll explore as well. So having said that as a high-level comment, I'll -- if Beth has anything to add, I encourage her to do so.","Beth A. Bombara","No, Liam, I think you said it very well. Our view of the ways that we look to manage this block have not changed, and we'll continue to look at solutions that are in the best interest of shareholders.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I just wanted to see if you guys had any comments on any potential impacts from a regulatory standpoint on some of the recent topics that have been out there around maybe your captive implications from new derivative rules. And then lastly, any backlash from the ESV programs that seem to be coming on more frequently from other carriers as well?","Christopher John Swift","Chris, I'll cover the first 2. Beth can maybe comment upon the ESV. So the simple answer is there's really no backlash. There really isn't anything going on with our captives. We got rid of one related to the life business. We have White River, which is our Vermont onshore captive that follows USVA accounting rules, so I think it's pretty straightforward. I think all the derivative actions, as far as Dodd-Frank, we're adopting. There's really no material impact on liquidity or any issues with those related to derivatives. Beth?","Beth A. Bombara","Yes, on your last comment, no, we do not -- have not seen any issues that relate to regulators with the activities that we have underway. Our process, I think, is very transparent. And we continue to be very clear with our policyholders as to what their options are, and we will continue to do that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Some of my questions were answered. But on the Group Benefits business, can you talk about how far along you are in your repricing of the disability block? And what the environment is like in terms of what competitors are doing? And then secondly, on commercial auto, you've had several quarters of adverse development. Maybe if you could just give us some insight on what's going on there?","Douglas G. Elliot","Sure, Jimmy, this is Doug. Let's start on disability and just give you a sense on where that cycle is. We started repricing the disability book in the early part of 2011. But I would say probably more the second quarter into the third quarter did it pick up quite a bit of steam, which is why I made the comment today that the January 2014 block really does largely complete that cycle. So we're working, as you know, in the midst of that as we speak. And hopeful that we'll see a continued rational environment, which is how I described kind of the marketplace we're competing in today with Group. In the commercial auto space, we have seen some dynamics of severity and weakness in performance across really our middle and small books, and have been working aggressively on those strategies, if you will. Obviously, I've talked a lot about the program space, and those reiterating actions are well underway. But it's an area that has caught our attention, and I would say for the last year or so, we've really spent a lot of time focused there. And I feel like our behavior is clearly in line with improving trends that we're starting to see. And also the fact that we are, state-by-state, looking at our rate adequacy in certain places taking rate, we're moving our rate to the extent we need to move.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Has the development been more concentrated in a certain region or certain customer group?","Douglas G. Elliot","No. Certainly, the development has been concentrated in our program group. I think it's more of a go-forward look at the trends coming at us and making sure that we're out in front of those trends from a pricing perspective, that are margins are improving in auto the same way they are across other lines of business.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I just had a quick question. I think this is best for Doug, and it has to do with worker's compensation. I know that's been an area that you've been working on from a pricing and kind of a risk-reduction perspective and it's worked very well, but the top line growth is still low, as some of the other questioners kind of pointed out. And so I'm wondering now that you're expanding margins in workers' comp and the economy is getting better, which is kind of a driver of the risk in workers' comp, but you might think about increasing your appetite again there, especially in a state like California.","Douglas G. Elliot","So Randy, the workers' comp question is a complicated one, and I would just ask you to think about the different dynamics across our markets. In the case of Small Commercial, where we're clearly a leader, our rate adequacies and our performance has been excellent. We look forward and still see tremendous opportunity. And so as we grew in the quarter, I feel good about the quarter and good about our returns. In the middle, we've made material changes, and our performance has improved greatly. And I would describe the overall adequacy of the product and the opportunities as much enhanced today versus where they would have been a year ago and certainly 2 years ago. And one of the reasons that we grew in the quarter is that we're feeling slightly better about the rate adequacies across that overall book, including comp. So yes, we'll be looking at opportunities moving forward. We're clearly looking at those opportunities on an all lines basis, where comp is a part of it, but not the only product we'll be offering. And I feel good about our opportunities as we get those competencies really lined up and well in good shape to compete in the marketplace effectively.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And is there any commentary you can give us on the states? I know that you've gotten smaller in California, in particular. Is that a place where you might look to be more competitive again on package?","Douglas G. Elliot","So there's several key states. Obviously, the big 4 or 5 are states that we spend a lot of time on, California, New York, Texas, et cetera. But all those states have their own nuances. And I would just point out, in the case of New York State, with what looks like an improved workers' comp pricing filing coming through. We're feeling better about the opportunity for us to do a little bit more in New York. So all those states have very state-specific strategies. Their class strategies are overlaid across the states, and I think it would be a little bit unfair for me to characterize across the top in terms of exactly California. But we're feeling much better about the adequacy and the performance of our book and feel like we're clearly a little bit more in an offensive zone than we have been over the last couple of years.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just one follow-up on comp. With the New York charge, is that -- I mean, should we think of that as being a kind of a nonrecurring item?","Douglas G. Elliot","That's certainly the way we think about it. Yes, we looked at our histories. I think you know the law changed, and we put up the $80 million to deal with what we think will be the impact for our understanding of essentially the fact that 25-A goes away.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you, everyone, for joining us today.

Ms. Sabra Purtill, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you, Ginger, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us for The Hartford's 2013 financial results and 2014 outlook conference call. I would just note that our prepared comments this morning run a little bit longer than normal, so we have allowed for some extra time on the back of the call beyond 10:00 for the Q&A session.","Our speakers today include Liam McGee, Chairman, President and CEO; Doug Elliot, President of Commercial Markets; Andy Napoli, President of Consumer Markets; and Chris Swift, Chief Financial Officer. Other members of our executive management team are also available for the Q&A section of this call, including Beth Bombara, President of Talcott Resolution.","As described on Page 2 of the slides, today's presentation includes forward-looking statements as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Explanations and reconciliations of these measures to the comparable GAAP measure are included in our SEC filings as well and also in the earnings release and financial supplement.","I'll now turn the call over to Liam.","Liam E. McGee","Thank you, Sabra. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining our earnings call. 2013 was an outstanding year for The Hartford. We executed our strategy and delivered superior results for shareholders. Heading into 2014, we have positive momentum with expanding margins in P&C and Group Benefits and improving performance in Mutual Funds. With the company's strong financial position and improved capital generation outlook, we are pleased to announce a new 2-year capital management plan, which includes $2 billion of equity repurchases and $656 million of debt repayments.","As you know already, last night, we reported excellent fourth quarter and full year 2013 results. Full year core earnings increased 26% to $1.7 billion or $3.55 per diluted share. Core earnings in the P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Fund businesses increased 41% year-over-year. The increases in P&C and Group Benefits were driven by disciplined underwriting, expanding margins and lower CATs, which was a welcome reprieve after several years of elevated CAT losses.","As Doug will discuss, this was the sixth consecutive quarter of 8% renewal written price increases in P&C Standard Commercial. Our pricing philosophy is unchanged, and written pricing continues to outpace loss cost trends.","In Talcott Resolution, the size and risk of the annuity blocks have been significantly reduced. The number of VA contracts in Japan declined 26% in 2013, as surrenders increased due to market performance in the moneyness and aging of the block.","In the U.S., the number of VA contracts declined 14%, driven by improving markets, as well as the successful ESV program. We've achieved over 90% of our $850 million expense reduction target, including cost related to the divested businesses. Plans are in place to take out the rest this year. We are instilling a culture of continuous improvement that will ensure we operate more effectively and efficiently going forward.","We also prudently managed The Hartford's capital resources in 2013, reducing holding company debt by $820 million and returning a total of $856 million to shareholders, including common and preferred dividends and $633 million in equity repurchases.","For 2014, The Hartford's strategy is unchanged. We are focused on driving profitable growth, further reducing risk in Talcott and increasing operational effectiveness, with the goal of continuing to deliver shareholder value.","Our core earnings outlook is $1.65 billion to $1.75 billion. Adjusting for light CATs, favorable limited partnership returns and prior year development in 2013, we expect growth in earnings from P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds will offset the anticipated decline in Talcott earnings as the legacy business runs off.","The Hartford is well positioned to achieve additional margin improvement in 2014. Markets are competitive, but our emphasis is on small and mid-sized businesses and individual consumers, markets where we have competitive advantages and positive momentum. We are a leader in the Small Commercial space, where our core strengths and customer value, ease of doing business and a contemporary distribution platform place us at the top of the industry. We have also added new talent to the existing Middle Market team, enabling us to diversify product offerings to complement our historic workers' compensation strength, all of which makes us a more attractive partner for agents and brokers.","In Consumer Markets, our AARP Agency channel initiative further leverages our exclusive relationship with AARP and gives us a unique value proposition in the marketplace. And to build on these competitive advantages, we are investing over $1 billion through 2016 to improve our execution capabilities, including P&C underwriting and claims management.","In Group Benefits, we expect the rebound in profitability to continue, driven by disciplined pricing and book management, as well as improving disability loss ratios. In addition, we are continuing to develop new products to increase The Hartford's penetration in the voluntary market.","In Mutual Funds, our strong partnership with Wellington is delivering solid, long-term fund performance. Sales and assets grew in 2013, and we expect this momentum to continue.","In Talcott, we will continue to focus on reducing the size and risk of the annuity blocks. Surrenders in Japan and the U.S. are expected to remain elevated, given the moneyness of the annuity contracts.","Also, while global markets in 2014 have been volatile, we are well protected with the combination of our hedge program and strong balance sheet.","Capital generation from the businesses will continue to supplement our financial flexibility. Our P&C businesses have consistently been dividend sources for the holding company. In addition, we expect both the Group Benefits and Mutual Fund companies to pay dividends directly to the holding company in 2014. With the significant reduction in VA risk, particularly in Japan, we also expect Talcott to begin paying dividends in 2014.","Having narrowed the focus of the company, we see many opportunities to run the organization more effectively and efficiently. As Chris will detail, we will reduce the run rate of the controllable expense base by eliminating $200 million over the next 3 years from the year-end level of about $3.6 billion.","So The Hartford is executing on its strategic plan and is on a clear path forward. I am very proud of how much the team has accomplished to get the company to this point, but we still have a lot of work to do. I am very optimistic and excited about The Hartford's further potential. Our goal is to achieve top-quartile financial performance, driven by growth in book value per share and ROE. And we have the strategy and execution capabilities in place to achieve this goal.","Thanks again for your interest in The Hartford, and thanks for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our progress with you in 2014 and beyond.","And I'll now turn the call over to Doug. Doug?","Douglas G. Elliot","Thank you, Liam, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the 2013 highlights for P&C commercial and Group Benefits, and then share some thoughts for 2014.","We finished 2013 in very strong fashion, and our overall theme remains unchanged. Significant core margin improvement across the business. For P&C commercial, 2013 was a very solid year, with $827 million of core earnings and a combined ratio of 96.1. This was an increase of $316 million from 2012, largely driven by 6.8 points of improvement in the combined ratio.","The underlying combined ratio, which excludes catastrophes and prior development, was 93 for the year, representing 3.6 points of fundamental margin improvement. As always, there are many moving pieces inside our business that contribute to our aggregate result, but the final analysis demonstrates a simple fact: We made substantial progress this year in expanding underlying margins across our P&C commercial business units. While catastrophes were much lighter in 2013, we achieved real success on the front lines, where pricing and underwriting decisions are executed.","Turning to the top line, our written premium of $6.2 billion was consistent with 2012. Two significant factors contributed to this outcome. First was our relentless focus on achieving pricing gains. We made difficult choices to walk away from certain accounts where we could not meaningfully improve pricing adequacy, causing our retention to suffer a bit. Second, we continued to reduce our Programs and Captives book of business, generating over $80 million of written premium year-over-year. We believe these decisions were appropriate for the loss trends and interest rate environment that have characterized the last 2 years, and our margin improvement in 2013 supports that conclusion.","These actions offset top line growth in other areas. We've been encouraged by our overall new business momentum over the back half of 2013 and specifically, with 3 consecutive quarters of Middle Market written premium growth, continued success in our National Accounts business and exciting traction developing with the rollout of our new automation platform in Small Commercial. On balance, we're extremely pleased with our overall progress in the market.","Let me share a few additional details with specific comments across our 4 business units, starting with Small Commercial. Small Commercial continues to be a centerpiece for our franchise. 2013 was another year of organic growth, while achieving a combined ratio of 90.6. Renewal written pricing gains of 7% for the full year more than addressed loss trends, and new business for the year was almost $0.5 billion. Many competitors in this market sector don't have an in-force block that size.","Moving to Middle Market. I'm excited with our progress. We delivered dramatic improvement in margins and made deliberate incremental steps in the last 3 quarters to increase the pace of our top line. The all-in combined ratio was 98.3 for the year, and our underlying combined ratio of 95.4 has improved 7.5 points since 2011. Our renewal written pricing for the full year remains strong at 8%, achieving more on lesser performing accounts and focusing on higher retention for better performing accounts.","No question, we experienced a more competitive pricing environment at the end of the year, but we continue to execute account-by-account with our deep segmentation approach. The top line in Middle Market showed positive progress during the year, benefiting from solid retention and new business production of $422 million, up 26% from 2012.","Our push toward property and general liability continues, and the new business growth rate in these 2 lines outpaced workers' compensation. Of our total new business writings, workers' compensation represented 31%, a much more balanced outcome and reflection of our growing multi-line capabilities.","Within Specialty Casualty, our business units experienced very divergent results. National Accounts posted a terrific year, with strong performance in both the top and bottom line. Premium retention was in excess of 90%, and strong new business success drove written premium growth of 8%. In fact, for every account loss during the year, we wrote nearly 4 new accounts; just an excellent year. Our Financial Products group also had a strong year with an all-in combined ratio in the mid-80s. The underlying combined ratio was 96, down more than 6 points from 2012.","As we have discussed on previous calls, our Programs and Captives business has been under stress during 2013. Much of this pressure has centered on commercial auto and in particular, 5 programs that we have now discontinued. We will continue to refine our Programs and Captives area, but I believe we have completed the actions necessary to deal directly with the key profitability issues in the book.","Now let me pivot to Group Benefits, where we had an outstanding year. Core earnings for 2013 were up over 50%. Even after adjusting for some favorable items, our earnings were well ahead of 2012 and our targets for 2013. Sales for the year hit $393 million, nearly the same as 2012. However, the fourth quarter was the third quarter in a row of increasing year-over-year sales, supporting our growing optimism as we look ahead. It's also a testament to our outstanding sales force, who have remained focus and committed to our success throughout our journey. All in, this has been a very gratifying outcome for a business that is not only a market leader, but one historically, has been a top performer here at The Hartford.","So as we close the chapter on 2013, we're very encouraged, not only by our strong financial progress, but also by the strength of our underlying execution across the entire Commercial Markets franchise. Importantly, the key brokers and agents who distribute our products are sharing with me that they can sense our expanded product breadth and our disciplined yet proactive attitude in the marketplace.","Let me conclude my comments with a few thoughts on 2014. First, as Liam mentioned, we're investing heavily in our capabilities as an enterprise, much of that geared to the business units of Commercial Markets. We're addressing important product development opportunities, building more efficient business platforms and creating easy-to-use technology applications for distributors, customers and employees. As an example, this year, we will begin rolling out a new claims management platform that crosses most of our P&C businesses. This investment in our future gives us greater tools to improve customer experience, manage indemnity costs and lower internal operating expenses.","Second, I'm excited about our go-to-market strategy in each business unit. Our Small Commercial business is uniquely positioned with market-leading products, services and technology that enable us to deliver superior results. This year, we will roll out a new product for our commercial auto, along with the completion of our new business quoting and issuance platform, ICON. We will advance our online service capabilities, expand our distribution and deliver new value to agency partners.","Our Middle Market business is well positioned to compete effectively on a multiproduct basis, announcing our historical strengths in workers' compensation with growing skills in property and general liability. During 2013, we were able to attract a number of product and underwriting professionals across all lines of business to our ranks. Now partnered with our outstanding field team, we are making our presence felt in the marketplace, feeding more effectively on accounts that might have passed us by in previous years.","Specialty Commercial will build off the successful position in National Accounts. In our niche of a $1 million to $5 million accounts size, we have demonstrated a unique package of products, service and claim expertise that resonates with our customers. Few companies bring our suite of tools and the financial strength to this sector of the marketplace.","Within Program and Captives, we expect to further reduce our active accounts as we move away from those that do not meet our financial or strategic goals and focus on the profitable relationships that align well with our core underwriting and claims management capabilities.","And in Group Benefits, we're excited about the accelerated pace of our profit improvement, while we are investing aggressively in the products and services that are important for our future.","Based on our early analysis, persistency on National and Middle Market accounts renewing in January 2014 is expected to be between 75% and 80%, a significant improvement from January 2013. This bodes well for overall book persistency throughout the year.","From a marketplace perspective, we will continue our drive into voluntary capabilities and position this business to adapt to the rapidly changing benefits marketplace.","Third, we're prepared for a more competitive market in 2014, particularly in the large guaranteed cost sector. Our rate adequacy has improved substantially over the past 2 years, and clearly, we have fewer accounts that need significant pricing actions. Given the level of written price increases we achieved in 2013 and our focus on maintaining pricing ahead of loss cost in '14, we believe that margins will continue to improve but to a lesser degree than the prior 2 years. We will aggressively monitor our loss trends, particularly as they may be affected by changes in the medical industry for both workers' compensation and disability. The Affordable Care Act is in its infancy, and it's nearly impossible to fully anticipate its ultimate impact on our business. Nonetheless, we're studying multiple scenarios very closely for how this legislation may change consumer, broker and medical provider behavior. We believe that both risks and opportunities will emerge, and we will be prepared to adapt accordingly.","And finally, across all of Commercial Markets, we will continue to enhance our execution skills and leverage our much strengthened talent base. Over the past year, we've attracted a number of top-notch executives across all of our business units, deep experts in distribution, product management and operation. These colleagues are blending well with our strong team to build market momentum with our customer and distributor-focused go-to-market strategies.","In summary, we're very pleased with our progress in 2013 and more excited than ever about our future.","Let me now turn the call over to Andy Napoli.","Andr\u00e9 A. Napoli","Thanks, Doug, and good morning. Today, I'd like to cover Consumer Markets results for 2013 and then discuss our plans for 2014. The bottom line is we're very pleased with our 2013 results that reflect our focus on profitable growth. During the year, we expanded margins and generated higher-than-expected written premium growth. Growth was fueled by strong new business production, coupled with improved retention. Margin expansion of 2.2 points for the year was primarily driven by 5 points of favorable catastrophe results and a slight increase in underlying margins, offset by a decline in favorable prior year development.","In homeowners, coming off of very favorable 2012, strong earned pricing, coupled with continued favorable frequency for both weather and non-weather claims, were more than offset by increases in severity.","In auto, we're pleased with our margin expansion as our combined ratio, excluding CATs and prior year development, declined nearly 1 point, driven by expense reductions.","Full year auto liability frequency for 2013 came in as expected. However, frequency for the second half of the year, impacted by higher miles-driven as the economy continued to improve, developed a bit higher than the favorable results we saw in the first half of the year. In the fourth quarter, we increased our current accident year reserves to reflect this development.","Written premium growth was driven primarily by strong new business in our AARP Direct and AARP Agency channels. In other agency, new business premiums decreased 2% for the year. However, both the third and fourth quarter recorded positive growth over the comparable 2012 period. The combination of new business growth and a 1-point improvement in policy retention led to a year-over-year increase in auto policies in-force for the first time since March 2009.","As we look ahead to 2014, we are pleased that AARP Direct auto ended 2013 near its combined ratio target. Going forward, our focus in this channel is to balance profit achievement and growth by pricing ahead of expected loss trends while not compromising retention. Our new auto class plan is designed to more accurately match price to risk, while simultaneously increasing our competitiveness among the 50- to 59-year-old AARP age segments. The continued implementation of our telematics program, called TrueLane, will also help attract and retain better auto risk.","Going into 2014, we expect slightly negative frequency, combined with low single-digit severity to produce a mildly positive overall auto loss trends for the year and for this loss trend to be exceeded by pricing, yielding auto margin expansion.","Shifting to homeowners, the primary focus here is margin expansion. While we've made good progress over the past several years, work remains to achieve profit targets in this line. In addition to high single-digit rate increases, we'll continue to evolve terms and conditions by increasing withheld deductibles in targeted states, promoting account-rounded business and tempering roof claims severity through reduced coverage product offerings. Understanding that there will be significant year-to-year variation in homeowners loss cost due to weather patterns, we expect rate increases to exceed loss trends and yield underlying margin expansion.","2014 will also include strategic investments in digital capabilities across all channels and tactical steps to enhance our other agency channel offering. Our investment in digital will greatly enhance our customer and agent self-service capabilities, with a growing focus on mobile technology. In the other agency channel, our strategy is to carefully expand our auto class plan to more accurately and competitively price an incrementally broader market, with the intent of generating additional profitable growth for consumer going forward.","In closing, we're proud of the progress we made in 2013 to improve margins, expand top line growth and grow policies in-force. Our strategic objective remains unchanged: To achieve above average industry growth, while also recording an all-in combined ratio of 92.","I'll now turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher John Swift","Thank you, Andy. This morning, I'll cover several topics. First, I'll quickly review 2013 results and discuss our '14 outlook, including our capital management plan for 2014 and '15. Second, I'll provide a year-end update on several important metrics for Talcott and the company, including capital margins, and finally, I'll cover our first quarter 2014 outlook.","Let's begin on Slide 19. Doug and Andy have covered the results for our Commercial and Consumer Markets. Let me now briefly touch upon the other segments. Mutual Funds core earnings rose 5% in 2013, in line with our original outlook as we continue to strengthen and position this business for future growth opportunities. Retail mutual funds net flow performance improved in 2013, driven by higher sales and better distribution effectiveness, supported by solid fund performance throughout the year. Assuming normal market conditions, we expect 2014 core earnings growth of roughly 10%, driven by improved earnings in retail mutual funds, partially offset by the runoff of VA mutual funds.","Turning to Talcott on Slide 20. Core earnings declined 9% in 2013, which was less than expected, attributable to higher partnership returns, lower DAC amortization and higher market levels. As Liam mentioned, we have made significant strides to reducing the size and risk of Talcott, which will enable us to begin returning capital from Talcott in the second half of 2014, initially from HLIKK, our Japan subsidiary. Talcott 2014 core earnings is expected to decline approximately $165 million or 20% from 2013 core earnings, reflecting lower fees due to higher surrenders. This outlook projects an additional 31% decline in policy counts in Japan and 12% in the U.S., which will permanently reduce risk, but will also continue to reduce earnings in 2014 and 2015.","Slide 21 summarizes the Corporate segment, which includes interest, expense and other items not allocated to the businesses. In 2013, Corporate had core loses of $250 million compared with core losses of $313 million in 2012. The difference was principally due to the reduction in interest expense, as well as a net $41 million benefit from insurance recoveries, settlements and tax-related items, offset by higher incentive compensation cost in 2013. We expect corporate core losses in '14 to be approximately $270 million.","Looking at full year 2013 on Slide 22. Core earnings were $1.74 billion, up 26%, reflecting improved margins, lower catastrophes and higher limited partnership returns from the prior year. For the full year, core earnings ROE was 9%, up 7% from 2012. Full year 2013 core earnings included catastrophe and other items that totaled the favorable $19 million or $0.04 per diluted share as highlighted on the slide. Excluding these items, as well as limited partnership returns in excess of 6% target, core earnings were approximately $1.65 billion, with an adjusted ROE of 8.6%.","At year end, The Hartford's book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, was down slightly to $39.30 per diluted share, principally due to Japan DAC and debt tender charges we incurred in the first quarter of 2013. Book value per diluted share includes the impact of $633 million of share and warrant repurchases throughout the year. Our average common share repurchase price in 2013 was $31.20 per diluted share, about 21% below book value at the end of 2013. As Liam mentioned, 2013 was an outstanding year, with many accomplishments and strong financial performance. We are now focused on 2014 and beyond.","Slide 23 summarizes our outlook announced yesterday afternoon. Our 2014 core earnings outlook is $1.65 billion to $1.75 billion. At the midpoint of this outlook, core earnings would be up approximately 4% over 2013 after reflecting the adjustments to 2013 results. Now CATs core earnings are expected to decline by approximately $165 million, which we expect will be offset by core earnings growth from the rest of the businesses. Our 2014 outlook translates into a core ROE in the range of 8.7% to 9.2%.","During 2013, we achieved significant progress on our expense reduction targets, including expenses associated with the businesses sold, eliminating about 90% of the $850 million goal with the rest to be taken out this year. We are now focused on the next phase of our expense initiatives aimed towards reducing controllable insurance and other operating expenses.","Adjusted for the Catalyst 360 sale, we ended 2013 with an annual run rate expenses of $3.62 billion. We plan to reduce this base by approximately $200 million by the end of 2016, which is about a 5% reduction. To achieve this increased efficiency, we are simplifying and improving processes, enabled by the approximate $1 billion investment in new systems and capabilities over the next 3 years.","Our 2014 outlook includes a catastrophe load of about 4.7 points on the P&C combined ratio compared to 3.2 points actual in 2013. Our outlook does not include prior year P&C loss reserve development, with the exception of the accretion of discount on workers' compensation reserves.","With respect to investments, the pretax portfolio yield is expected to decline from 4.3% to 4.1% in 2014. This is largely due to lower assumed returns on limited partnerships and alternative investments, which are 6% compared to the 10% realized in 2013.","Finally, our forecast assumes equity repurchases totaling approximately $1 billion. The actual impact of these share repurchases on weighted average diluted shares will depend on the purchase price over the course of the year. For modeling purposes, we are estimating a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 468 million shares.","The company's capital resources and financial flexibility have remained strong over the last year even after our significant capital management actions in 2013. Last night, we announced a new $2.656 billion capital management plan for 2014 and '15, which is summarized on Slide 24.","We intend to repurchase $2 billion of equity over this 2-year period and plan to repay $656 million of maturing debt in 2014 and '15. This plan allows us to continue our balanced capital management programs, targeted at equity repurchases and paying down debt.","Funding for this share repurchase and debt repayment program will come from increased dividends from our operating subsidiaries, including P&C, Group Benefits, Mutual Funds and Talcott.","Our current outlook is for total dividends to the holding company of approximately $1.2 billion in 2014. Included in this outlook is about $150 million from HLIKK, Talcott\u2019s Japan subsidiary, which is expected to occur in the second half of 2014. Looking ahead, we expect additional dividends from both Talcott's U.S. and Japan operations in 2015.","We'd now like to update some key data on Talcott end capital similar to the metrics from our April Investor Day. Slide 25 provides an update of the market consistent value or economic value of our 2 VA blocks. We use this metric to measure the risk and the economic value of the VA blocks. It does not represent the market value of the blocks a willing buyer and seller would agree upon. Details on the methodology for MCV can be found in the appendix.","Let me summarize a few key points about the change in MCV over the period. First, as of December 31, 2013, the MCV for the 2 blocks is an asset of $1.7 billion compared to a liability of $500 million at the end of March 2013. Second, the MCV improvement was largely driven by market factors, adding $2.9 billion to the MCV, offset by approximately $800 million in fees that we collected and recorded as revenue during the year. Third, the MCV calculation does not include hedge results.","During the last 3 quarters of 2013, hedge losses offset approximately 80% of the MCV improvement, consistent with our hedging approach and targets.","This slide also shows the comparison of MCV results to statutory reserves. The reserves and surplus backing these blocks provide substantial resources as these risks run-off. Of note, the Japan VA retained business in HLIKK is lapsing more quickly than expected, which lowers risk levels, resulting in the HLIKK balance sheet being much stronger today. This has allowed us to adjust downward our hedging targets for the exposure retained in the Japan legal entity.","Although MCV is the principal methodology we use to value and hedge the VA blocks, we understand that many investors like to see cash flows specific to each of our deterministic scenarios. Slide 26 summarizes the base case scenario. In this scenario, the net present value of cash flows is $3.0 billion.","Beginning on Slide 34 in the appendix, we show cash flows for updated favorable and stress scenarios that reflect 2013 experience in market levels. The net cash flows improved in each scenario from those we presented in April, although not to the same extent in each case. As a reminder, a high level of 2013 surrenders reduced future fees in each scenario and have a similar impact on future claims and hedging costs. The key point for both the MCV and cash flow scenarios is the positive embedded value in the VA blocks, which can be harvested over time, along with the associated capital and return to the holding company as the blocks run off.","Turning to Slide 27. As of December 31, our capital resources totaled $17.7 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion from the prior period. Life surplus, including HLIKK surplus, was about $7.8 billion and the capital margins remained strong with an estimated RBC ratio of 450% in the Hartford Life and Accident group.","We have received formal approval from the Connecticut Department of Insurance to complete the Group Benefits' legal entity separation project, including the movement of cash and subsidiaries, which will be completed in March of this year. No holding company resources are needed for this separation.","Slide 28 provides an update on our capital margins using the same scenarios from the cash flow projections. Capital margins in the base, favorable and stress scenarios all remained strong, with the base case margin estimated at $7.6 billion at the end of 2015. These margins assume the full execution of the 2014 and '15 capital management plans in all the scenarios. Capital margin represents the excess of AA capital for the P&C company, and 400% RBC for the Group Benefits company. The target for U.S. Talcott entities is 325% RBC. The holding company liquidity is targeted at approximately 1.5x annual interest in dividends. As you can see, our capital margins remained strong in all these scenarios. In the stress scenario, we have $2 billion of capital margin even after full execution of the capital plan, with Talcott remaining capital self-sufficient.","Before turning to your questions, let me provide a brief summary of our first quarter outlook, which is on Slide 29. Our core earnings outlook for the first quarter of 2014 is $450 million to $475 million, or $0.94 to $0.99 per diluted share. This outlook assumes catastrophe losses of $57 million, after tax, and prior-year development only for the accretion of discount on workers' compensation reserves. I would note that our CAT experience through the end of January was still within our outlook, and we feel good about our CAT budget for the first quarter, but there are 2 months to go.","Finally, core earnings outlook for Talcott is in the range of $160 million to $170 million.","To wrap up, let me summarize some of the key comments Liam, Doug and Andy made in their remarks. 2013 was an outstanding year for The Hartford, with strong financial results and significant progress made in the company's strategy to grow profitably, P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds. Talcott made exceptional progress during 2013, with a significant reduction in VA risk exposure. And finally, based on our progress in 2013 and momentum headed into 2014, our capital resources and financial flexibility continue to strengthen, enabling us to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders in 2014 and 2015.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Sabra to begin the Q&A session. Sabra?","Sabra Purtill","Thank you, Chris. We have about 30 minutes for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Ginger, could you please give the Q&A instructions again?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Brian Meredith from UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of questions for you. First, with your first quarter outlook, I noticed there really was no mention of higher CAT losses, and given all the weather and some of the warnings by some other companies,. I wonder if you could comment on that. and what the potential impact on the Hartford could be.","Christopher John Swift","Brian, it's Chris. As I said in my comments, we've looked at January results, we still feel good about our CAT assumptions for the full first quarter. January's CATs were maybe a little elevated from normal, but still, we feel good about the overall budget for the first quarter. As it relates to the non-CAT weather, Doug might be able to comment a little bit. But there was really nothing unusual in our book of business, whether it be commercial or personal lines that we're seeing in the first month of January. But, Doug, any additional color?","Douglas G. Elliot","Well, Chris, I think you hit it. As I look at the balance in January, we know it's a colder month, but I think we're within our general norms, and we'll continue to work our way through the rest of the quarters. So I don't see anything really that is so significant we should comment on.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then second question for Doug. I'm just curious, you talked about preparing for some increased competition here going into 2014. However, if I look at your renewal rate activity, you seem to be holding in there better than most of the other competitors. I wonder if you could kind of comment on that and why you think that is.","Douglas G. Elliot","I guess, a few thoughts for you, Brian. One is, I would remind you, we have a big Small Commercial book of business, and that has performed well. It's been a steady component of our business that's here for a long time, and that rate performance is very solid for an extended period. Secondly, in prior calls, we worked hard at our auto line of business and the auto line is still achieving and taking rate, and given some of our profit dynamics, we think that is exactly the direction we need to head. And through it all, we were pleased with the fourth quarter. I did point to the fact that my view is at the end of the fourth quarter, things got a bit more competitive. But I look at 2013 across-the-board, I looked at overall performance in the fourth quarter, I'm very pleased with the progress we made.","Operator","Okay, your next question is from Vincent DeAugustino from KBW.","Vincent M. DeAugustino - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Switch gears a little bit on Personal Auto. So just noticed the prior quarter or current accident year frequency adjustments stemming from the higher second quarter '13 estimates. And I'm just wondering if that's all 3Q '13-related, or perhaps if there's sort of late reported claim that are popping up that might be causing the adjustment?","Andr\u00e9 A. Napoli","Vince, this is Andy. So first, I'll say that is a normal part of our process to make current accident year reserve adjustments throughout the course of the year, as we see emerging trends in frequency or severity for auto liability. So occasionally, liability frequency can exhibit some volatility from quarter-to-quarter. And so ultimately for 2013, auto liability frequency ended right about where we expected at the beginning of the year. Just sort of the way it played out was that the first of the year, we saw some favorability and then in the second half, we saw some unfavorability and we booked that in the fourth quarter. So you're seeing a full year impact all getting booked in the fourth quarter.","Vincent M. DeAugustino - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just switching over to the Mutual Funds business. So it seems like you have really strong fund performance and we had good market performance for the ICI fund flows were positive. But you guys' retail fund flows were still a little troublesome. So I'm just curious of your thoughts on improving that and whether if you feel this is a distribution hurdle or if there's anything else that's holding back the business because all is equal it seems, like the performance there is pretty solid.","Christopher John Swift","Vincent, it's Chris. Jim Davey, if he were here today, he had a prior commitment with his Mutual Fund Board. He would answer it along the lines of -- He really is positive about 2014. We do think we could have net positive flows for all of '14. We would look back in '13. We had good, decent performance from our partner, Wellington. We also did have maybe 2 major accounts, 401(k)-type money that rolled off. We did shut down now since our money market fund and roll those assets to another new provider. So was it a couple of a one-time items, but overall, we do think we could begin to grow net fund flows in 2014.","Operator","The next question is from our Erik Bass from Citigroup.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just hoping if you could talk a little bit more within your capital plan, what you're assuming for dividends from Talcott in 2014 and 2015? I know you mentioned specifically the Japan target, but given the ability to request a special dividend from the U.S. block in 2014? And I guess, if not, what's preventing you from taking capital out, given the significant lapsation you're seeing.","Liam E. McGee","Erik, in a high level, and I'm sure Chris may want to give you more perspective. As Chris noted, we'll take out from HLIKK this year and next year, and we do intend to have an extraordinary dividend out of the U.S. in 2015. Obviously, that will require regulatory approvals. I think it's premature for us to comment in more than it is our intent to do so. And as we work through that process, we'll give you more details. Chris?","Christopher John Swift","I would say, Erik, in addition to Liam's points, just the context of Talcott's capital return, as I said in my prepared remarks, we are taking out, I'll call it, to the holding company $1.2 billion of cash flow. And really, some of those cash flow resources are from old Talcott operations, whether it be Mutual Fund or Group Benefits. So we plan to take out roughly $70 million of dividends from Mutual Funds next year, $100 million from Group Benefits. So in a way, we think Talcott's already contributing. As we said, Japan is coming online with dividend distributions. We expect, I would say $150 million to $200 million over the next 4 or 5 years on average to come out of Japan. As Liam said, we have some things that to still do in the U.S. And really what I mean is, I want to get completed that legal entity separation. We are beginning work on collapsing White River REIT, our Vermont captive into the ILA, and then we'll approach the regulators in the second half of the year and have that discussion, that multi-year discussion, on what we think is an appropriate funding source coming out of the remaining 2 U.S. life legal entities for Talcott. So I think we have a plan, and I think we've been executing it pretty well and we're very confident that, particularly in '15, increased cash flows will come out of Talcott.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's helpful color. And just -- could you provide an update on the stack capital levels to the different blocks within Talcott similar to what you gave in April?","Christopher John Swift","I think what our plan is, we'll do that at the first quarter once we complete the legal entity separation and just have, I'll call it, the new structure lock down and just present it to you there. So I would say that there is nothing dramatically changed from the April presentation, but we'll update you first quarter.","Operator","The next question is from Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A question on the current year reserve adjustment in the auto side. Can you quantify that just so we can get a good sense of what the underlying numbers look like there?","Andr\u00e9 A. Napoli","Sure. It was 2.6 points on the quarter. And then for the year for auto, it was about just over a half point.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","With ownership on the auto...","Andr\u00e9 A. Napoli","On the auto, right.","Operator","The next question is from John Nadel from Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I'm curious on the outlook for the runoff of the Japanese variable annuity block. It looks like you're expecting the surrender rate will remain somewhere around that 30% level in 2014. Obviously, we've had some very early 2014 market weakness and yen movement. I'm just wondering if that 30% outlook takes into account the more recent market activity or is there some risk that, that surrender rate comes lower.","Liam E. McGee","John, I'll have Beth comment in more detail. But I'll remind you that even at a yen of 101 and the topics where it is now, we're really back where we were just a few months ago when the redemption rate, what it is, right -- the lapse rate, I should say, is similar to what it is right now. So with that context, Beth, do you want to give more details?","Beth A. Bombara","Yes. I would agree. So where we are right now, what we saw in January, our surrender rates were pretty much in line with what we would have expected. January is typically a little bit slower just because of a lot of holidays and so forth. And the other thing, 2 other points just to keep in mind is, one, the funds backing the account value in Japan, about 40% of that is allocated to equities and of that, half of it is to Japan equities. So it's not all linked to what we\u2019re seeing in the Japan equity movements. And then secondly, we do have a very significant amount of account value that starts to come up to the annuitization, the annuity commencement date in 2014, about $2 billion worth of account value. And most of that account value at the end of the year was above 110% of the guarantee amount. So very significant amount out of the money, and our experience has been that, for contracts that come to the annuity commencement date, if they're out of the money, we see a very high number of those choosing to take the lump sum. So if you put all of those factors together, we still feel good about our surrender rates assumption for the year.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","That's excellent color. And then, Chris, maybe just a clarification on your Slide #28 that talks about the capital margins. So, at the end of 2015, if the base scenario comes to 4, that $7.6 billion is effectivity your excess capital at The Hartford above those requirements for P&C Group and Talcott?","Christopher John Swift","I think, John, it's our definition of capital margin, we've never, call it, quantified it per se as excess, because excess then would take into account which is really deployable. And, as you know, I mean, particularly for the Life group, we're still in the U.S. Life group in an extraordinary dividend land. It can't be readily turned into cash. So that's the only nuance. But, yes, I think you should think about capital margins as a buffer above our AA targets, our 400% RBC, particularly in Group Benefits as a healthy margin. And we would manage that over time.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I assume this really goes to supporting the dialogue that you guys expect to have with some of the insurance regulators around this sort of multi-year dividend planning?","Christopher John Swift","Yes, I mean, obviously, we share all our data with all our constituencies, whether it be regulators, agencies, as the like. I think the only other thought, John, just on that base number, I mean, that's the margin at the ATCOS, plus the holding company liquidity. And we do have targets that are roughly 2x annual the interest in dividend, so that would be, in essence, the subtraction from a deployable capital number also.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just to -- just one last point on this. Given how much that capital margin moves, especially under the stress scenario, I guess it's fair to assume that most of that capital margin is -- resides in Talcott, given Talcott would probably be the piece that requires more capital under that stress scenario?","Liam E. McGee","Remember, we've always said, that we're managing Talcott to remain capital self-sufficient, and Talcott is in this scenario. The actual breakdown of that $2 billion is, there's $1 billion at the holding company, because we're always solving for a minimum liquidity at the holding company, and P&C's got $600 million and Life group has $400 million. So those are the components of the $2 billion capital margin in the stress.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Finkelstein from Evercore.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Maybe start with Chris. Chris, for 2014, what is the economic cost of hedging that you are assuming? And what I mean is that, kind of a number that falls below the line, if markets operate the way you expect them to.","Christopher John Swift","I would say on the hedging, in general, we have a context right. Markets moved dramatically in 2013 and maybe we could talk about the cost of the hedging program in general over the life of the block as it runs off. But the answer to your specific question, I mean, Talcott, you would assume roughly $225 million of after-tax hedge losses recorded in realized losses. I translate that into -- from our core ROE to a net income ROE, that's about a 1 point cost of that hedge program. I think on the overall cost, we may able to provide some updates, and I'll compare and contrast. So I always start with Japan. In prior years, we talked about 200 basis points of cost. You see sort of a run rate cost going forward, primarily because the market moves so dramatically where they are today with about 70 basis points. U.S., that 40 basis points on average now is around 30 basis points. And then from a macro program, I would have you think of our spend going forward of roughly $75 million.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And that's all after -- or pretax, right?","Christopher John Swift","The basis points was after-tax and then the spend $75 million was a pretax number.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. So after-tax on the 70 and 30. Okay. Just on the dividend out of P&C group in Mutual Funds, did you back off the $1.50 billion at Talcott, it's $1.50 billion. Is there any reason to think that, that number shouldn't kind of trend with earnings? Is there anything that would drive it up above the earnings or perhaps below in terms of that kind of capital release?","Christopher John Swift","I think that's a pretty decent trend. The way we think about it more importantly is what is -- what is distributable earnings, sort of the statutory income or GAAP income on our Mutual Fund operation. What do we need from a holding company side, considering the growth in the investments, that Doug and Andy in the go-forward businesses need it to make. But that's how we think about sort of the growth sources of flows and then what we would take up to the holding company, and what I described for 2014 is what we're taking up the holding company in '14.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one final quick one if I may. Doug, what is your expectation around lost trend in Standard Commercial for '14 if maybe a directly comparable number to the 8% rate increase that you showed in the fourth quarter?","Douglas G. Elliot","Mark, I would say that in our planning for '14, we're expecting loss trend to be about where it was in '13. So, from a loss trend perspective, single digits generally across all lines, we've had some good news on the frequency side and workers' compensation, and auto, the auto line has been a little warmer than the overall rest of the book. But generally, '14 in line with '13.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And just remind me, what, like, 4% range, 3%?","Douglas G. Elliot","Yes. Yes. 3.5% to 4% is a good point to be at.","Operator","Your next question is from Jay Gelb from Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to touch base on the Talcott outlook initially. In the slide, it says continued VA surrenders will lead to further core earnings reduction in 2015 for Talcott. I was trying to get a sense of magnitude on that.","Christopher John Swift","Jay, it's Chris. I mean, I think the way to think about it is in relation to AUM. Contracts will decline, but then, your market factors in forces can increase that, but on your earnings fees kind of called higher asset base, per policy basis. So that's sort of the calculus. I think in terms of just roughly numbers, I would expect in '15, Talcott decline another $125 million to $150 million after-tax.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","$125 million to $150 million?","Christopher John Swift","Correct.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Second point is on the overall or, let's say, core return on equity. Around 9% in 2014. Tell us how you plan to get that into double digits.","Christopher John Swift","A lot of hard work. To me, it starts with, and I'm looking at Doug and Andy and the business leaders. I mean, we're going to, as Liam said, the strategy is to profitably grow the go-forward businesses as Talcott shrinks. And you can see what we think is a prudent capital management plan, focused on equity and debt. That philosophy will continue. You add in sort of the expense efficiency targets. And we think 10% is on the horizon. It will take a lot of work, but we still feel comfortable in growing ROE in the 40 basis points plus or minus annually going forward, through earnings growth, through accretive capital management plans and driving more efficiency into the organization.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And the debt retirement, Chris, by our estimates, you should get to that 23% range, debt to capital ex-AOCI by the end of 2015. Does that mean that debt retirement should pretty much be complete by the end of '15?","Christopher John Swift","Jay, I'd like to execute our '14 and '15 plans and we'll talk a lot about '16 and beyond. But I've always said we would like to get into low 20s. I always defined low 20s as 22%. And obviously, improving our coverage ratios and when we get our targets, we could then start to think about a different approach, or will it be '15 or '16, I mean, know that we're trying to get to our targets.","Operator","Your next question is from Tom Gallagher from Credit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Chris, I wanted to come back to question on Talcott. And if I heard you correctly in response to Mark's question, your hedging costs are going to be going down. So can you talk about whether you expect Talcott to generate meaningful capital, assuming your base plan for market expectations? And if so, how much? And also, I know you're focused on core earnings, but I know net income has been very weak on that block. Is that getting better or worse, factoring in the cost of hedging?","Christopher John Swift","I think, 2 points. On your first one on the surplus, I do expect both Life and P&C to generate a couple of $100 million of surplus after dividends next year. So, we think Talcott specifically can begin to generate surplus based from the net income side. That's why we try to frame it at that $225 million after-tax, that's assuming markets grow 4% and rates follow our trend. And basically, FX remains stable. So I would say, if that's the market condition, we're printing less hedging losses so that there is less of a difference between core and net income. And I tried to frame it as that 1 point ROE difference right now based on our hedging cost going forward.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then also, I just want to get a better handle on the way you guys are thinking about valuing this business, because I was just a little confused thinking about the $2.2 billion increase in market consistent value and then the $3 billion of NPV of cash flow positives. And then contrasting that with the 80% offset from hedge losses. So I understand there's capital, that we can put a value on capital depending on how quickly it gets returned. But then there's the valuing the cash flows and the business itself. How do you think about it, taking those 3 other data points that I just mentioned if you can help reconcile those?","Christopher John Swift","No. I mean, you're describing a classic actuarial valuation, right? Value of the block of business, assets and liabilities and the value of the surplus, but we think about it is the same way. I think my comments in my script was trying to lead you to conclude that MCV would not be a transaction value because a willing buyer and seller would have to negotiate, but it is sort of a risk-neutral value that helps build the foundation for your thinking in any potential transaction.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So Chris, sorry, just to follow-up on that. So I would start with 100% of surplus size, I assume, and add, on top of that, market consistent value of 2.2 and then adjust that based, to your point, based on the bid-ask spread from a buyer and seller, if you want to think about it along those terms. But then would I then adjust that downward by 80% considering hedge losses or am I hitting that too hard considering the impact to the hedge losses?","Christopher John Swift","I think you're going to think in terms of the hedge losses, those printed hedge losses are reading results, right? I mean, we booked them as realized losses, so it's in surplus already. So I would say you're already have accounted for it in your reconciliations. And Tom, I'd love doing this with you, but why don't you and Sabra visit, and if you want a little help on any thoughts on the model, we could talk to you off line.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Giovanni from Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, question on the U.S. VA book. Obviously, lapse has slowed. I know you touched there. I think recently you talked about the possibility of exploring another ESV program. So can you talk maybe where we stand with that? And maybe why or is that still a focus given where NAR stands today?","Liam E. McGee","Well, Beth will give you her views on that, Chris. I think the ESV performance played out as we said it would. And so now, Beth can give her perspectives on what if anything else things that she's thinking about.","Beth A. Bombara","Yes, thanks, Liam. So currently, in the plan we have right now, we have built in an expectation of doing an offer related to our fixed annuity book. And our plan includes about $30 million of cost associated with that, so it's sort of the next evolution of offerings that we're looking at. Beyond that, the team continues to look if there are other, again as we talked about in the past, sort of nearly focused parts of the business that we would look to. So you should expect that we'll continue to look for that. And as our plans in that area firm up, we will share them with you.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, you obviously give us a look in terms of buybacks through January. But wondering how we should think about kind of the cadence of buybacks here over the next couple of years. Will you be optimistic around price or would it be fairly balanced on a quarterly basis?","Christopher John Swift","Chris, I think the way we think about it is $1 billion $1 billion first order, and then we do want to be stable and consistent and prudent, but we'll look at buying opportunities. And in fact, I can just give you an update through yesterday, we had purchased $151 million of shares back in through January, and then first business day of February. So we're been opportunistic when we see it, but we also want to be stable and steady, too.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one last quick one. Liam, you talked about in terms of one of the approaches for long term value, top quartile growth in book value, and how should we think about that just in terms of if you were to be executing on transactions within Talcott that could potentially reduce GAAP book value? I mean, is that a focus or is that just studying economics in terms of thinking about what that would do versus your translation of GAAP book value?","Liam E. McGee","I want to clarify my statement, was that we want to be a top quartile company as measured by total shareholder return over trend. We think that will be driven, we have conviction that, that will be driven by growing book value. And as Chris discussed earlier, increasing our ROE. Obviously, if we were to seriously consider a transaction, we would do what was economic. And as I've always said, we take a look at the purchase price, the amount of capital that could be released versus what our view is of the underlying economics. And that will really inform our decision as opposed to, if you will, solving to a book value answer per se. I will certainly be part of the equation, we're well aware of that. But I think the longer-term view that I'm trying to impart is we are focused on being a top quartile CSR company. We know that will be driven by prudent growth to book value, as well as an increase in ROE, and I think I've given you a consistent frame of reference for how we might view a potential transaction.","Operator","And, Ginger, I think we have time for one more question. I think Chris, had a quick follow-up to Tom Gallagher's question on hedge cost first.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Tom, it's Chris. Actually, I think it was Mark that I probably misspoke just a little bit. The 70 and 30 basis points we're hedging for Japan and the U.S. are pretax numbers, consistent with the $75 million spend, which is also a pretax number. So sorry if I confused.","Sabra Purtill","Ginger, can we have just the next question or the last question, please?","Operator","Yes, ma'am. Your final question comes from Bob Glasspiegel from Janney.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Question on whether I'm thinking about Talcott correctly. It seems like 2013 was a nirvana environment with the U.S. stock market up, Japan up, weakening yen, higher interest rates, good for sort of operating results, good for our balance sheet, bad for hedging. We certain reverse those dynamics in the first quarter, yet you have Talcott's sort of earning more than a quarter of the full year earnings. So I just want to make sure that the guidance sort of fully reflects the 255 10-year and the other impacts of the yen, and the Nikkei, et cetera.","Liam E. McGee","Thanks, Bob. For the question again, Beth and Chris may have their own context. I remind you that yen\/dollar on TOPIX\/Nikkei are really back where they were just a few months ago. So, well above what we started last year wasn't even at the end of the first quarter. So let's be sure we have that context. So I'd turn over to Chris and Beth for any additional comments you might want to make to Bob's question.","Beth A. Bombara","No. Again, I think that we've taken all those into consideration, and the guidance that we've provided and reflecting the surrender activity that we saw during 2013, kind of our starting point for 2014, and the expectation that we have goes for surrender activity, as well as the impact of the annuitizations that begin in Japan.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. So it's just when I saw the year end 10-year at 220 -- 320, which has a pretty big grade up from where we are today. I didn't know if that reflected a feeling that this is just a blip in the 10-year, something that you're managing.","Christopher John Swift","Bob, it's Chris. I think the way we thought about our overall plan is that those were our point estimates. I think the ranges that we have around a lot of -- our data provides enough sensitivity for different market conditions. Interest rates, U.S. interest rates and sort of the returns on the assets that back those Japan liabilities aren't directly correlated. So, as we said, at the point estimate, I think at $570 million of core earnings for Talcott, where we sit here today, we still think that's our best estimate, knowing some of the market noise that even happened during the last few weeks.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you, and thank you all for joining us for the call today. We appreciate your taking the extra time that we took today for the call. And if you have any follow-up questions, Sean and I are available after the call. Thank you, and have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Susan Spivak. Ma\u2019am you may begin the conference.","Susan Spivak","Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for our call and webcast to discuss second quarter 2019 earnings. We reported our results yesterday afternoon and posted all the earnings-related materials, including the 10-Q on our website. Please note that we reported results a bit later than usual due to the financial reporting integration related to the closing of the Navigators acquisition in May.","Before we begin today\u2019s presentation, I want to highlight a couple of upcoming days. First, Beth Costello will be participating in a fireside chat on September 9, at the Barclays Conference in New York City. Second, the tentative date for our third quarter earnings release is November 4. For today\u2019s call, our speakers are Chris Swift, Chairman and CEO of The Hartford; Doug Elliot, President; and Beth Costello, Chief Financial Officer. Following their prepared remarks, we\u2019ll have a Q&A period.","Just a few final comments before Chris begins.

Replays of this webcast and an official transcript will be available on The Hartford's website for one year.","I'll now turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Swift","Good morning and thank you for joining the call this morning. The Hartford second quarter financial results were strong with excellent Group Benefits margins and solid P&C margins, including lower catastrophe losses than last year. We closed the acquisition of navigators in May, which brings expanded market and growth opportunities in commercials lines. We remained highly confident of the strategic and financial benefits this acquisition will produce.","Second quarter core earnings rose 18% over prior year to $485 million or $1.33 per diluted share. Our businesses are performing well. The P&C underlying combined ratio was 92.6 in the quarter and the group benefits core earnings margin was 7.5%. The consolidated 12-month core earnings ROE was at 11.7%, well in excess of our cost of equity and among the best in the industry.","During the quarter, we began share repurchases under the $1 billion authorization and expect to continue to return excess capital to shareholders in 2019 and 2020 from share repurchases and quarterly dividends helping drive long-term shareholder value creation. Doug and Beth will cover segment results in more detail, but I wanted to touch briefly on a few high-level items.","Commercial lines underwriting results, which included navigators for just five weeks remained solid. I'm going to investments and technology, digital in product are driving enhanced capabilities and growth. The cost of these investments put slight pressure on the expense ratio, which is expected to continue for the near-term. Year-to-date, the underlying combined ratio for commercial lines is 92.9, a result in a competitive market.","Personal lines results were much better than last year with a lower current accident year loss ratio, including reduced catastrophe losses. Planned marketing and other initiatives continued increasing the expense ratio, but also driving a 49% increase in new business. Group Benefits earnings continue to be simply outstanding with a year-to-date loss ratio of 74.7%, almost 2 points better than last year, along with a slightly lower expense ratio.","Persistency and new business levels are solid and include continued growth in voluntary product sales. We recently appointed Jonathan Bennett, a talented and versatile Hartford leader, head of group benefits, following the announced retirement of Mike Concannon.","Mike has been with The Hartford for more than two decades with a long list of accomplishments and contributions, and we wish him well. Jonathan and I will be working closely to ensure a smooth transition in a continued track record of success in group benefits. Finally, higher equity capital markets helped Hartford's funds recover from the earnings impact of the fourth quarter decrease in assets under management.","Turning to navigators, this quarter results include charges related to the acquisition for: One, the purchase of the previously announced adverse loss development cover; and second, increase in loss reserves from the completion of our review for the 2018 in prior accident years and the 2019 loss picks. With the reserve review completed, we are fully focused on achieving the strategic and financial benefits of this acquisition.","Only two-and-a-half months after closing, a significant amount of progress has been made on multiple initiatives, and I am pleased with the continued positive feedback from agents and brokers about the combined potential of our business. We expect a smooth integration and remain confident of the future benefits we will realize from expanded product in underwriting capabilities.","In addition, we expect to generate good returns on this investment reaching approximately $200 million in core earnings, excluding the amortization of intangibles within the next 4 years to 5 years. We\u2019re also encouraged by the recent firming in Commercial Lines pricing, particularly in Global Specialty, which is better than anticipated when we first announced the acquisition.","Doug will discuss the market in more detail, but I would note that loss trends in certain lines needed increased pricings to achieve acceptable returns and in-part informed our judgments on the acquired reserves, and the 2019 accident year loss picks. The team is focused on capturing the benefit of improving pricing, terms and conditions, particularly in international where results in recent years have been poor.","In addition to the trends in Global Specialty, we are also seeing stronger pricing in growth opportunities in middle and large commercial. I am pleased to see that previous investments in expanded industry verticals are generating strong new business growth.","To conclude on the quarter and year-to-date, our performance is strong, commercial lines has momentum, and the navigator\u2019s integration is going well. The outlook for commercial lines in the second half of 2019, which includes navigators remains largely consistent with our view provided earlier this year.","We expect an underlined combined ratio of 92 to 94. This outlook is essentially flat with last year, including the impact of navigators, which has a slightly higher combined ratio than The Hartford Commercial Lines book. In total, we are well positioned to achieve or exceed the business metric outlook we provided in February and to sustain a strong consolidated ROE. ","Before turning the call over to Doug, I wanted to note that we recently published our 2018 sustainability report, which provides the summary of our commitment to environmental stewardship, communities and giving, diversity and inclusion, and ethics and governance. As a company in business for more than 200 years, we understand what it takes to be sustainable and how the company\u2019s actions align with our mission to underwrite human achievement.","We are proud of The Hartford\u2019s track record and are committed to achieving the specific goals summarized in our report. You could find that report along with other information on our sustainability programs on our website.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Doug.","Doug Elliot","Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. This was a strong quarter for our business units and as Chris noted, strategically significant as we closed our acquisition of Navigators. Our Hartford Property and Casualty business units performed very well with strong execution on the top and bottom line, and group benefits posted another quarter of outstanding earnings. ","Underlying performance in the former Navigators business units, which excludes prior period development and catastrophe losses was in-line with our expectations as we\u2019ve positioned these lines for profitable growth and a rapidly improving specialty marketplace were underwriting is tightening and pricing is firming.","In the second quarter, we booked prior accident year reserve adjustments for Navigators in several lines of business and also reset the 2019 accident year loss selections. Beth will be discussing these actions in greater detail. Our integration is off to a strong start. We\u2019ve hit the ground running with teams working together in the market, and across all parts of our enterprise to align strategy, resources, and outcomes.","Over the summer months, we\u2019re conducting nearly 400 agent and broker meetings to rollout our combined product capabilities. Talent and expertise were primary drivers of the deal and we\u2019re very excited to have over 800 new teammates join our ranks. The market leadership and underwriting skill these experienced professionals bring to the combined organization is already evident.","Efforts began immediately to jointly market our expanded product portfolio as we\u2019re now able to effectively deliver a broader range of coverage solutions to agents, brokers, and customers. I\u2019m very encouraged by several recent wins and the positive reaction of the agents and brokers to writing more lines of business per account with us. Our teamwork is evident to the marketplace and I\u2019m confident we will continue to find more opportunities for growth.","I\u2019ll provide more commentary on Navigators performance and current marketplace transit in a moment, but let me begin the review of our business results with Group Benefits, which delivered another outstanding quarter posting core earnings of 115 million with a margin of 7.5%. The increase versus prior year was driven by favorable disability results, higher net investment income and lower amortization of intangibles. This was partially offset by a slightly higher life loss ratio, increased investments in technology and customer experience, and higher commissions.","The lower disability loss ratio reflects favorable incident trends across recent accident years. Shifting over to personal lines, we had a solid quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 91. In first lines auto, the underlying combined ratio of 96.7 was two-tenths of a point higher than 2018 with favorable frequency trends and a severity in the low-to-mid single-digit range. ","Collision severity remains elevated, due to higher repair costs associated with newer vehicles and a larger mix of total losses. Overall, loss cost trends are developing within our expectations. We remain focused on returning to growth in AARP Direct to auto, our lead product for marketing and new customer acquisition. New business in this line grew 44% for the quarter.","Direct marketing response rates continue to be strong and our conversion ratio was up versus prior year. Over the last few years, AARP auto retention has improved several percentage points. We remain focused on further increases to retention as a key factor in achieving total written premium growth.","Turning over to Commercial Lines, the second quarter underlying combined ratio was 93.2, up 3.2 points versus 2018. The increase was primarily due to elevated inland marine loss experience in Middle Market, higher expenses and the addition of navigator results for five weeks post-closing.","For the quarter, renewal written pricing in standard commercial lines was 2.2%, up slightly from first quarter of the year. Pricing excluding worker\u2019s compensation was 5.5%, up several tenths of a point versus first quarter, driven primarily by increases in middle market. Pricing in auto was nearly double digits, and we saw solid increases in property and general liability. ","Margins in worker\u2019s compensation were strong across our business units and consistent with our expectations. Results to date indicate they were managing market forces effectively and I remain pleased with our worker\u2019s compensation pricing and underwriting strategy as we seek to balance margins and growth.","Let me touch on a few additional details for our commercial businesses. Small commercial had another excellent quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 87.8. Written premium grew 6%, with a 183 million of new business and excellent retention in the high-80s. New business was led by the foremost renewal rights deal.","In addition, we also experienced excellent growth from our core book, with new business up 10% versus prior year. New business flow from the foremost deal is essentially complete at this point. This is a great opportunity for us to scale our market leading platform and to extend our partnership with many of our existing agents. We also developed a number of new agency relationships that have been growing steadily over the last year. Our team executed flawlessly on this transaction and we\u2019re well prepared for similar opportunities in the future.","In Middle & Large Commercial, the underlying combined ratio was 100.9, increasing 3.8 points versus last year. We experienced another quarter with a number of large losses in the Hartford inland marine book, specifically builder\u2019s risk. Approximately 3 points of this increase is attributable to large water intrusion claims that occurred near project completion. Several of these losses resulted from less experienced workers on the job in this tight labor market. We\u2019ve taken actions to address this part of our business and expect performance to improve. ","The expense ratio was also slightly higher driven primarily commissions. Written premium in Middle & Large Commercial increased 15%. Retentions were solid and new business production was outstanding at $177 million for middle market, up 31% versus prior year. New business growth continues to be fueled by our industry practice groups in areas such as construction, programs, and energy. We\u2019re also seeing strong growth in our other core industries, including manufacturing, technology, and professional services.","Our strategy of underwriting specialization is helping to drive this growth and increase our focus on pricing and margin improvement. In Global Specialty, comprised of U.S. international and reinsurance business units, the underlying combined ratio was 90.7. Given the navigator results are only included for five weeks of the second quarter, I\u2019ll focus my commentary on current business performance and marketplace trends.","Overall the specialty markets are in positive transition. Industry financial results support the need for pricing and underwriting actions as prior years have been developing unfavorably in several lines. Our Global Specialty team has experienced progressively firming market conditions each month during the quarter. Real pricing for Navigators business block was in the high-single digits for the quarter, up more than 5 points from the first quarter and also from prior year.","Lines of business with particularly strong pricing include marine cargo, excess casualty, D&O and property. This is an important time for our teams to be focused on business fundamentals and now that the deal is closed, our number one priority is improving margin performance.","Let me now turn to the individual business units of Global Specialty. In the U.S., we recorded prior year development largely in the ocean marine, primary casualty and D&O books, with only a modest adjustment to the current year loss ratios and casualty. Underlying performance year-to-date has been solid with strong returns in management and professional liability lines and bond.","Given the market momentum I just described, our trends is for \u2013 our outlook is for favorable renewed pricing trends, exceeding expected loss trends. The international business, primarily comprised of Lloyds syndicate and London market portfolio has been under financial stress due to its historical growth focus.","We\u2019ve increased our prior and current action year loss ratio picks in financial and casualty lines and are fundamentally repositioning portions of this book through underwriting and nonrenewable actions. The rapidly firming market will provide a tailwind as we execute our business plans for needed margin improvement.","In Global Reinsurance, our business is mainly comprised of accident health, property, global credit, Latin American surety, and other casualty lines. During 2019, underwriting results have been challenged in the accident and health resulting in prior year reserve development and an increase to the current year loss ratio. This is largely a medical stoploss business, and we're aggressively tightening our underwriting and increasing pricing, while non-renewing accounts that do not meet our financial thresholds.","As we look ahead with Global Specialty, I\u2019m more convinced than ever that our expanded talent and product capabilities are powerful addition to our Commercial Lines platform. Vince Tizzio, our Global Specialty leader along with a very experienced team comprised of both Navigators and Hartford teammates are driving business plans with great acumen and energy.","As we work together every day, and now with the full engagement of our agents and brokers, I see our strategy unfolding in the market, positioning us for further success as a Commercial Lines leader.","Based on our year-to-date results, our outlook for Commercial Lines in the second half of 2019 is for a combined ratio between 95 and 97 with an underlying combined ratio between 92 and 94. Total commercial lines earned premium for the six months is expected to be approximately 4.4 billion.","In closing, this quarter represents an exciting milestone in our journey. Our integration with Navigators is in full swing. We\u2019re operating as a combined organization bringing broad capabilities and deep underwriting expertise to the market and we continue to see new opportunities to leverage these skills in all parts of our commercial lines business. This important step forward along with the strength of our group benefits and Personal Line businesses positions the Hartford for continued success. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the quarters ahead.","Let me now turn the call over to Beth.","Beth Costello","Thank you, Doug. Today, I'm going to cover second quarter results for the investment portfolio, Hartford Funds and Corporate, including capital management activities, as well as the impact of the Navigators acquisition. The investment portfolio continues to perform very well with no impairments, strong LP returns, and generally stable investment yields. Net investments income was 488 million for the quarter, up 60 million or 14% from the prior year quarter. Excluding Navigators, net investment income was 476 million or 11% higher than the prior year quarter.","Limited partnership returns were strong in all asset classes with an annualized return of 14% for both the quarter and year-to-date. This compares to an annualized yield of 9.5% in the second quarter 2018. The annualized portfolio yield was 4.2% before tax and 3.4% after-tax, slightly above second quarter 2018. Excluding LP, the second quarter 2019 annualized portfolio yield was 3.1% after-tax, flat with second quarter 2018.","Lower market interest rates and tighter credit spreads increased net unrealized gains on fixed maturities after tax to a total of 1.4 billion at June 30 from about 700 million at March 31 and almost no net unrealized gain at year-end 2018. As a reminder, unrealized gains on equity securities are classified and realized capital gains in the income statement and are not included in AOCI. Total realized and unrealized gains on equity securities were 30 million before tax in the quarter and 162 million before tax year-to-date.","Turning to Hartford Funds, core earnings of 38 million were flat with last year and up 10 million sequentially. Daily average AUM rose 5% from first quarter 2019, reflecting strong market performance, partially offset by modest net outflows and was up about 1% over second quarter 2018. Investment performance remains very strong.","As of June 30, 2019, about 70% of Hartford Funds outperformed peers on a one, three, and five-year basis. Corporate core losses of 35 million were 54% lower than second quarter 2018, principally due to higher investment income and lower interest expense, due to net debt reduction over the last year. As a reminder, the three main drivers of corporate results are investment income on cash and short-term investments, interest expense and preferred dividends, and net income from our investment in Talcott.","Taking into consideration the reduction in average cash and short-term investments, due to the 2.1 billion purchase price for Navigators, as well as interest expense and timing of preferred dividends, I would expect the quarterly run rate in corporate to be a loss of 55 million to 65 million after-tax before consideration of net income from the Talcott investment. The impact of our proportionate share of Talcott's net income is harder to predict and was 22 million after-tax in the first-quarter and 2 million after-tax this quarter.","During the quarter, we began share repurchases under the $1 billion authorization. Since its inception and through the end of July, we have repurchased about 800,000 shares for $43 million. As previously discussed, we expect to use this program with discretion, based on current and projected holding company cash position and liquidity needs, and expect to utilize the majority of the program in 2020.","In total, second quarter core earnings of 485 million and core earnings per diluted share of $1.33 were both up 18% over second quarter 2018. Excluding AOCI, book value per diluted share was $41.55, up 5% year-to-date and 9% since June 30, 2018. Core earnings ROE over the last 12 months, which includes fourth quarter 2018\u2019s wildfire catastrophe losses was 11.7%. Our year-to-date annualized core earnings ROE is 13.4%.","The closing of The Navigators acquisition on May 23 impacted our results in several areas. I will briefly review these and additional details are included on Pages 6 and 7 of the slides. Core earnings had a modest net contribution from Navigators as their closing occurred more than halfway through the quarter. Net income included several acquisition-related charges. ","First, in the quarter, we recorded transaction and integration-related costs of 31 million before tax of which 21 million was related to Navigators. We expect to incur additional charges through 2021 for a total of 90 million to 100 million before tax of which 15 million relates to integration activity. Second, upon closing, we entered into the previously announced adverse development cover and reported a charge of 72 million after-tax. Finally, we made two adjustments to Navigators reserves after closing.","We increased the pre-acquisition 2019 accident year reserve by 29 million before tax. We also increased our estimate of prior year loss reserve by 159 million of which 91 million was ceded to the ADC, resulting in a net charge net charge of 68 million before tax. After these actions, there remains 209 million of coverage under the ADC for development for 2018 and prior accident year reserves. ","Overall, the reserve actions we have taken incorporate our methodologies and judgement. Going forward, Navigators reserves will be part of our normal quarterly reserve review process.","To summarize, second quarter results were very strong. We are hard at work on the integration of Navigators and focused on maximizing the potential of all of our businesses with our combined teams and enhanced product and underwriting capabilities. With strong capital generation and financial flexibility, we are pleased to be able to both invest in our businesses and return capital to shareholders. We look forward to updating you on our progress.","I'll now turn the call over to Susan, so we can begin the Q&A session.","Susan Spivak","Thank you, Beth. We have about 30 minutes for questions. Carmen, could you please repeat the instructions for asking a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And you first question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith","Hello, can you hear me?","Operator","Yes. We can hear you.","Brian Meredith","Okay, great. So, first question for you all. Chris, just curious, could you kind of walk through from The Navigators perspective, now that you\u2019ve got it integrated \u2013 or integrated \u2013 on your books, how does your kind of accretion forecast look \u2013 low end, high end, kind of what are your expectations for it?","Chris Swift","Sure. Thanks for joining us Brian. As we said, both Doug and I invest in our prepared comments. I mean, we\u2019re confident about both the financial and strategic aspects here. I think on the longer-term basis, we\u2019ll still see the ability to generate 200 million of core earnings ex-amortization of intangibles over the next 4 to 5 years. I think there is support levers that remain the same that we\u2019ve talked about. What\u2019s going to contribute to that? One would be expenses, two would be NII, three would be \u2013 and you heard from Doug that actions that were beginning to take on the in-force management to improve the margins on the existing book, and then fourth, a contributor but not a large one, you know the cross-sell revenue.","So, I would say those are the components. The waiting might be a little different Brian then we first thought 6 months to 9 months ago, particularly with lower interest rates, but I would say that we didn\u2019t expect this level of pricing firming as rapidly as it has been. So, we\u2019ve taken the adjustments, so we think we needed to particularly on the 19, accident year loss picks, which is generally in-line with our pricing models and our deal models, maybe slightly little higher, but equally I think there is more rate environment, more rate to capture.","So, we see all those pieces fitting together to generate that $200 million of core earnings and you remain really, really confident and pleased with how the teams have been interacting and behaving particularly in the marketplace.","Brian Meredith","Excellent. And then another question, just curious, could you talk a little bit about your thoughts and exposure to the reviver statutes and kind of what we're seeing with what\u2019s going on all these states?","Chris Swift","Sure. I guess there is one other point I would just mention as it relates to the integration activities. I mean, we did guide on our prior call to 110 million to 145 million of core earnings in 2020 Brian. I would say that\u2019s still a valid range, but I would anchor a little bit more on the lower-end, particularly given the interest rate environments, we thought we were going to get a little quicker left with interest rates, even after marking the balance sheet to market.","So, we still see [110-ish million] in 2020 as far as an accretion potential. As it relates to reviver statutes and activities, I would say, first, we\u2019ve got a long history of managing and dealing with I\u2019ll call it complex claims in area, particularly bodily injury, mass tort \u2013 and Jan Kinney, who heads our team and his lawyers and claims professionals, I think do an outstanding job. Whether it\u2019s on a primary basis or excess basis, remember we have a lot of excess claims experienced, particularly coming through our first interstate state operations in Boston.","So, I would then say on a social side, I understand the desire to make people, allow people to talk about their injuries and present claims, but on the other, and it\u2019s a slippery slope to sort of open up years of case law and litigation and how contracts are resolved, but I know that\u2019s occurring, but I would also say that for us you would primarily focus in on three major areas. The liability associated with injuries, particularly in commercial auto, obviously the sexual abuse and reviver claims, and then head injury.","I'm not going into specifics on any particular aspect other than we\u2019re well aware, we\u2019ve been on top of these trends for a long, long time and as I\u2019ve always said Brian, we\u2019re in the business of paying claims, and we want to pay claims that are legitimate and where people are injured, but equally in some of these areas we're going to be sensitive and that\u2019s a plight word of saying, if there was a contributory actions or inactions that have consequences on our terms and conditions and our policies, we\u2019ll be equally vigilant in asserting our rights because the rest of our policyholders would expect that.","And that\u2019s where the social inflation comes into effect that everyone is talking about. It affects everyone and we\u2019ll be thoughtful, we want to be fair, but also make sure that people are living up to the terms and conditions in our contract. So, that\u2019s what I would say at this point-in-time.","Brian Meredith","Okay. It makes it, but if you re-evaluated your reserve positions given what\u2019s been going on?","Chris Swift","As I tried to say, I mean, we\u2019ve been managing these types of activities for a long, long time. I would say that we have case reserves and IBNR established for known losses and obviously incurred, but not reported losses. We\u2019re going to have to really see sort of the volume of the new activities that really comment. So, as we sit here today, we feel really good about the balance sheet, but not knowing what\u2019s going to come out as in the future from new claims, new activities, new theories, you can never be absolute, but just know we do have provisions that we feel comfortable at right now.","Q \u2013 Brian Meredith","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse, your line is open.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, good morning. Can you hear me?","Susan Spivak","Yes, we can hear you.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, thanks. My first question on the disclosure within commercial lines on the standard commercial earned premium rate, so that was 2.2% in the quarter, it trended down sequentially and then when you look back last year, I know you guys are getting more written price right now, but I'm just trying to think about the earned premium that you're seeing and expectations for a rate that you are earning to the balance of this year, and also into 2020, as I think about the underlying margin profile for small commercial and mid-to-large account segments, and just thinking of the rate versus trend and kind of the underlying margin expansion you might see or contraction there?","Doug Elliot","Elyse good morning. It\u2019s Doug. I would suggest that the earned trend is going to follow some of this momentum on the revenue side. So, obviously it\u2019s a calculation and as we see slightly upward signals in those pricing indicators, the earned premium will follow at that, number one. Number two, we gave you a comp, ex-comp split, right? ","So, you know that we\u2019ve got a little bit of negative pressure on pricing, particularly in small commercial that will pay out and the mechanics of that are lost trend at the moment might be slightly ahead of, where the small commercial pricing is, but in middle we\u2019ve done a nice job of achieving flat to just slightly down pricing in comp and so very pleased with what we're seeing in metal.","In the non-comp lines, you know, we\u2019re feeling better than we were 90 days ago about signals in the marketplace, and our ability to get a little bit of rate. I know that the changes are not up materially, but they matter to us in several key lines. They\u2019re moving in the right direction. So, we\u2019re on the rate push hard, we\u2019re working harder account by account and I\u2019m encouraged by what I see as we close up the second quarter.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thank you. And my second question, on the Navigators book, so you guys took a true-up on prior year and then also on the current year, so on the current year adjusted, I\u2019m assuming the adjustments were really saturated kind of in the same lines where you took the prior year development and then, can you also just give us a sense of where the underlying margin you\u2019re starting with for that business given that you now trued it up versus your expectations when you announced the deal?","Beth Costello","Sure. I\u2019ll start with that and Doug please feel free to add in. So, the lines that we adjusted for the current year, you know, some were consistent, again in the U.S. wholesale casualty area and a little bit in the D&O and E&O of book and as Doug mentioned, kind of in the international casualty area, and when we looked at the \u2013 our projections back at the time of the acquisition, we had anticipated needing to increase those accident year picks a bit. I would say, the final adjustments that we made were probably a point or point-and-half higher than that, but relatively speaking, we\u2019re in-line with what we were thinking.","So, a lot of the things that Doug talked about as it relates to the book and actions that we\u2019re taking and pricing will obviously help improve those margins going forward. And our views on their underlying margins were included in the overall guidance that we gave for the second half of 2019, and again their book we would expect to run at our higher combined ratio then our historical Hartford book.","Doug Elliot","The only thing I would ask Beth is that, some of that Navigator combined ratio dynamic is playing into the fact that our new outlook is just slightly up a point or so on the underlying. So, the mixing end of that Navigators book and actually your encounter \u2013 your 2019 is causing a little bit of that bump.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker","Yes, thank you very much for taking my question. Obviously, there\u2019s a reserve strengthening on the, I guess, I don't know, is it the 1Q Navigators or is the first five months just as a better understanding?","Beth Costello","So, Josh are you talking about the current accident year?","Josh Shanker","Yes. 2019.","Beth Costello","Yes. So, it would be for the first five months.","Josh Shanker","First five months. Okay.","Beth Costello","Yes. Through the date of acquisition.","Josh Shanker","This then implies an increase to The Navigators combined ratio about 500 basis points in addition to what\u2019s going on in the rate market right now. When you think about modelling or the next year, how much attritional policy and premium decline do you expect as you put through the necessary rates to get to a Hartford level of conservatism in the book?","Doug Elliot","Josh, this is Doug. I would say, it\u2019s a little premature for us to take you all the way down through that path. We are building those plans. We had original plans, obviously, we\u2019ve been updating over the course of the last two quarters, but there are so many moving pieces and as you know, as Chris commented on, several of their core lines are going through an aggressive degree of firming at the moment. So, we are making decisions and plans around what we see in the current marketplace, around retentions, required retentions, pricing and also new business levels that we think are appropriate for not only the combined ratio as it sits here today, but also what we think the opportunity is in that book moving ahead. So, we\u2019ll provide more of that as we go forward in the next several quarters.","Josh Shanker","Okay. And I guess it\u2019s another easy one. Was there any prior year reserve development on The Navigators loss reserves not applicable to the NICO cover, and how should we consider the risks associated with that non-NICO covered part of the portfolio?","Beth Costello","Good question. So, as it relates to the actions that we took in the second quarter for prior years, all of it was applicable to the cover. I\u2019ll remind you that it was probably about $100 million of reserves that we excluded from the cover versus primarily covering things like unallocated loss adjustment expenses. We are obviously taking the exposure on reinsurance collectability and then a handful of specific claims that were not covered. So, as it related to the actions we took, we saw no need to make any increases to those of reserves that were not covered by the reinsurance agreement.","Chris Swift","Josh, it\u2019s Chris. Welcome. Thanks for joining the call after your Rolling Stones concert last night. Second, I would just add a little color again. The allocated \u2013 on allocated loss adjustment expense in the reinsurance, it\u2019s similar to other transactions we\u2019ve done with Nico and the handful of claims that I\u2019ve described, I would say relates to pollution exposures that we judged favorably. So, I don't think there is going to be any big surprises that are going to materially change any view on reserve positions and\/or the reinsurance transaction in total.","Josh Shanker","Okay, thank you. I appreciate the answers, I\u2019ll re-queue, maybe will get lucky. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse.","Mike Zaremski","Hi, good morning, thanks for taking my question. First question, thanks for the color on the expense ratio increase, curious about, I believe you said some of it is due to upwards pressure and brokerage commissions. I think you also mentioned that on last quarter\u2019s call, maybe you can help us understand as like how big of a component that is and what\u2019s kind of driving that? Is that being driven by some of the private equity backed brokers or is it all of them kind of doing the same thing?","Doug Elliot","Mike, this is Doug. It\u2019s more run rate commission. And so, when I think about quarter-to-quarter point, one point, two points have changed in the expense area, but half of that is coming from commission, much of that is coming from small commercial where we either have special deals happening. We\u2019ve got terrific profitability indicators. So, our contingencies around loss are up a little bit year-to-year and I would just characterize what we see in small as normal, competitive commission adjustments.","What we see in the middle, more related to reinsurance, I don\u2019t even think of that in the case of normal brokerage, it\u2019s just we have some seated commissions and reinsurance a little bit different than they were last year. So, that\u2019s why I described the commission piece as really normal operating circumstances.","Mike Zaremski","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And lastly, switching to group benefits, clearly excellent results continue, doesn\u2019t look like you guys changed your guidance there, maybe you can kind of update us on the competitive environments in group?","Chris Swift","Mike, let me just speak to guidance and Doug can give you some of his color on the competitive environment. The six to seven guidance on margin, we still believe is a long-term guidance that is reflective of long-term condition. Obviously, in the near term here, we\u2019ve been outperforming, which we would honestly expect to continue at least through the second half of 2019. So, we\u2019re not changing, not updating, but we\u2019re acknowledged that we\u2019re performing better primarily from incidences, but I would remind you that it is still a competitive environment Doug and the top ten group benefit players control large portion of the market, but competition is still fierce as ever and we\u2019re remaining disciplined. I don\u2019t know, if you would add any color Doug?","Doug Elliot","No, I agree with that. I think we\u2019re competing well in this space. The numbers are pretty good shape across the industry. Our numbers are obviously outstanding. Second quarter is not as larger quarter as the first quarter, but our sales were up a bit in the first quarter. We feel good about that, continue to grow our Specialty products, our voluntary products, so you see that in our supplement. Just we\u2019re encouraged. And Chris, our disability trends are in good shape, so a strong quarter for our group business.","Mike Zaremski","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill.","Paul Newsome","Good morning. Just one question. You did mention many changes to reinsurance related to The Navigators acquisition, I was wondering if that might change significantly over time given the Navigators was a pretty heavy user of reinsurance over time?","Doug Elliot","Paul in the short-term, I would suggest that reinsurance programs are largely going to stay in place. Our teams are working diligently on a combined basis evaluating what programs need to come together over time, what programs will be left stand on it, etc. So, as I think about the rest of 2019 and the early part 2020, largely think of their programs intact and then we\u2019ll adjust over time and share some of that information as it comes.","Paul Newsome","As you now re-examined the book, are there any pieces of Navigators that you want to shrink or readdress significantly?","Chris Swift ","Paul, again we just closed, what, 75 days ago, really excited, we\u2019ve been focused on, obviously our go to market activities in the U.S. and in London taking the corrective actions that Doug has talked about. We like all the pieces that we see, but we just are going to, let\u2019s continue to learn, that\u2019s why we're keeping the reinsurance programs the same and to learn from The Navigator\u2019s team and adjust accordingly, and I would say the same thing with any major pieces of the business. It all fits together. It works, we like it, but we\u2019ve only owned it for 75 days.","Paul Newsome","Thanks. And best of luck for the rest of the year.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs.","Yaron Kinar","Thank you very much. Good morning everybody. My first question, I guess this is a multi-part question now, with regards to the large property losses that you're seeing in commercial, so one, are those related to the large losses you saw in the first quarter that were part of the same trend? Two, could you maybe elaborate a little bit on the actions you\u2019ve taken? And three when do you expect these actions to actually result in lower margins?","Doug Elliot","Thank you, Yaron. This is Doug. So, a few comments about our rain book. We did see some adverse experience in the first quarter, which I did comment on first quarter call, a bit more in the second quarter. Again, second quarter leaned a little bit heavier into builders\u2019 risk, you know it\u2019s a policy we offer associated with construction sites were essentially we replace the damaged property on the site. I think there\u2019s quite a bit of volatility in the second quarter. We have pulled the covers back across all those losses. I mentioned water intrusion in my commentary, seen a number of pipes couplings, connections, damaged material values in some of our construction sites.","So, we\u2019re on it. We changed the leadership in the underwriting profile that business about 15 months ago. That process is well underway. These projects run several years. We know exactly where inventory is today. Yes, I don't think this is over at the end of June, but I do think this is well managed, well contained, both claim engineering, and also our underwriting teams are working together. ","And this little volatility and a pretty small line first in the middle. We\u2019ll have little volatility, but it isn\u2019t something right now that\u2019s keeping me up. I think, the line is not just putting pressure here at the Hartford. I think there are others in the business that are feeling that pressure, but as I think about the rest of 2019 and 2020, we\u2019ll get this issue behind us. I don't think it\u2019s a huge deal and we\u2019ll share a little bit about that journey as we go forward.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then my second question relates to the personal auto book. I think you\u2019re seeing that you\u2019re seeing severity in the low to mid-single digits, which just seems a little lower than what we\u2019ve been hearing or seeing among other carriers. Can we maybe talk about what would drive severity to be a bit lower at The Hartford book? Is it a different mix of cars, is it different policy type, different negotiated arrangements with auto shops or what\u2019s driving that?","Doug Elliot","I think it\u2019s really hard for me to compare ourselves to others. There\u2019s so many different nuances of various books. When I talked about severity, I am combining all elements of severity, right. Our collision is up a little bit, our liability, severity is in very good shape, and obviously our frequency numbers are in a very strong shape for the first six months of the year. So, I don't know how to contrast our book with others, you know it is heavily ERP dominated that plus 50 crowd, that matters relative to drive miles, driven, parts of the year et cetera, but I don't think there\u2019s something that sticks out to me right now that\u2019s saying, our severity is causing something that others might not be seeing.","Yaron Kinar","Doug, you were cut out. I think, I only heard the last sentence of your response.","Doug Elliot","I don't think there is one reason. Can you hear me Yaron?","Yaron Kinar","Yes.","Doug Elliot","I don't think there is any one reason that suggest our book will perform differently than others. We manage aggressively, all of the comp liability and physical damage collision matters for our customers and I think we do a very adequate job. We work with terrific partner on the outside and have dedicated confident team inside. So, I think, we're thoughtful about our work claim process, and I don't have a reason to suggest our numbers or understand why they\u2019re different than others.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Randy Binnner with B. Riley FBR.","Randy Binnner","Hi, good morning, thanks. I actually had \u2013 I think a couple related to commercial auto. The first is a question on the in-land marine losses that are disclosed as being elevated, could you describe what those are and I\u2019m just curious if they are related to wheels-based loss or something else?","Doug Elliot","The builders risk essentially would be equipment materials on the job side. So, I don't think auto there. I think water intrusion causing damage to all kinds of equipment in sheetrock on the walls et cetera. There were earlier in the year a couple of marine losses in transit. When you think in-transit marine that would have involved vehicles, so yes, it was a little commercial auto pressure there, but primarily second quarter, I\u2019m talking about intrusion of water in a four-wall structure.","Randy Binnner","Okay, got you. And then, just on the commercial auto, overall, it has not been a topic that\u2019s come up on this call, but it is still a major issue for the group, and so, I\u2019m curious kind of where you think pricing versus loss cost is there and kind of where The Hartford sits in the process of the industry getting on top of those liabilities?","Doug Elliot","I guess, I\u2019d start by suggesting the make-up of our book is largely small commercial where the middle market fleet as well, and now Navigators brings especially auto component to us. In terms of our core book, we\u2019ve been managing aggressively auto for six, seven years now. Our exposures are down materially over the last five years, you know plus 30% [indiscernible] change in auto. Still not satisfied with our great adequacies today, our combined ratios are still not acceptable across both small and middle, and so there\u2019s still more work to be done.","Given where we see pricing today, yes, I think that pricing from our view and our middle and small books is on top of the loss trend, which means we\u2019re now delivering better margins, but we're very careful \u2013 with a very careful eye watching 2016, 2017, 2018, some of those years that are closing up and this line has our full attention and will over the next several quarters for sure.","Randy Binnner","Is it a growth opportunity then, if you have your pricing right relative to loss trend are you seeing a lot more opportunity to rate business?","Doug Elliot","Well there is a lot of business in the marketplace. It is on the top of our growth priority. We\u2019re certainly not a major mono line provider and I'm talking about historical Hartford at the moment. We certainly look at it when we're rounding of accounts and we want to protect our accounts. So, no it\u2019s not on the top of our queue list to be facing mono line auto.","With our specialty auto deviation now with Navigators, I think a good opportunity they\u2019ve got terrific instincts, they\u2019ve got great data and they\u2019ll be thoughtful about their opportunities, but I would ask you to think about the different pieces of our book, and all told, we\u2019re not an enormous auto player relative to the industry in general.","Chris Swift","I think that\u2019s the big distinction Doug, right. We're not big fleet players. I mean, we tend to ensure trucks, vehicles on the small-to-medium size business. We\u2019re not national programs. It\u2019s not, just given the environment, Randy it\u2019s not a growth area as Doug said.","Randy Binnner","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.","Ryan Tunis","Hi, thanks, good morning. This might have already been pretty clearly confirmed, but just I guess for my own head, so the new 92 to 94 guide wouldn't be any different if it weren\u2019t just the addition of The Navigators mix, and you feel just as good about Navigators as you get at the time of the deal, is that right?","Doug Elliot","That\u2019s right. With the exception, we have built in a little bit of this pressure on builder risk, both what we experienced first half has set our view. So, we\u2019ve treated our loss ratios in the marine area in the second half of the year. Largely, all the other lines remain on track.","Beth Costello","Yes. And I will just add to that Ryan, just to be clear. So, absent navigators, we probably would be a point down relative to what our original thought was for, first for second half of the year.","Ryan Tunis","Understood.","Beth Costello","So, obviously, Navigators coming in at a higher loss ratio, combined ratio is kind of in the mix, but we put it altogether. We feel very good about being able to be in that range.","Ryan Tunis","Got you.","Doug Elliot","Ryan, I would remind you, you know the compare on that, you have to almost go back to 2018 and think about what happened in Q\u2019s 3 and 4. We were doing some adjusting to the workers comp line still in Q3 of last year. I think that\u2019s something that just has to factor in here.","Ryan Tunis","Got you. And I think I wanted to go back to Elyse\u2019s question, Beth did a good job talking about the accident year actions, and how would those compare to the original expectations at the time of the deal, but I\u2019m still having a little bit of a hard time with, I think there\u2019s like a $150 million of growth charges that Hartford took and there have also been some charges that Navigators had taken in the quarter since the deal. The acquisition was announced. So, yes, I mean on the reserving side, we just said all the activity that we have seen has also been around the level that you would have expected the time you announced the deal or could you just highlight some areas where things ended up being a little bit more elevated?","Beth Costello","Yes, so, if you go all the way back to the time, we announced the deal, I would say that the \u2013 our views relative to reserve increases have increased from there. We obviously took that into consideration when we started to look at purchasing an adverse development cover. I would say that the actions that we took are relatively consistent with what we would have thought at the time that we entered int to the ADC, so we sort of incorporated those views when we look to purchase protection.","And as I said in my remarks feel very good about the fact that there remained $209 million under that cover, and I would say the areas that we\u2019re seeing the increases are relatively consistent, and just, again some of the size of those increases has changed, and we incorporated all of that as we thought about our 2019 accident picks, both what we felt needed to be adjusted from what Navigators had recorded pre-acquisition, as well as incorporating those views into our updated guidance for the second half of this year.","Ryan Tunis","Thank you.","Susan Spivak","Operator, we\u2019ll take one more question please.","Operator","Yes ma\u2019am. Your final question will come from the line of Mike Phillips with Morgan Stanley.","Mike Phillips","Hi, great. Thanks for [indiscernible]. Appreciate it. I guess, Doug made some comments on the reserve issues in some of the smaller lines for Personal liability and the [indiscernible] liability, I guess, I was looking to see maybe a little more detail in kind of what exactly you are seeing there, you know how confident you are, that you got things fixed and maybe some pressures going forward in those specific lines in Professional liability?","Doug Elliot","Mike, I would say that, if you go back and think about some of the pressure spots and Navigators towards the end of last year and early this year, obviously there has been some pressure in the international book. Some of that marine book internationally and also the D&O book, and they were addressing some of their own and essentially as we looked at the tail factors and we looked at those cases, we just decided that we needed to makes some adjustments.","So, that\u2019s how I think about several of those lines. In the U.S., our view of tail and torque came together with their actuaries and we spent a lot of time debating and looking at things. So, I don\u2019t look at what we did over the last quarter. These changes as anything very, very different than our discussions last summer, but they were updated back based on facts and debates as we came together and close to second quarter. ","Mike Phillips","Okay, thanks. I guess one more on Personal [indiscernible] turned back to that. You commented that the premium drop in Personal Lines was kind of part of it was your non-renewal business and I guess maybe when do you expect kind of an inflection on that piece of the personal lines?","Doug Elliot","Well, our goal is to be turning into growth as we close out 2019 and move into 2020. We\u2019re encouraged because as you can see, our new business numbers look much more positive than they were this point last year. Again, we\u2019re working on retention. The rate change, you know the book has had a pretty solid profit perspective. So, I think the rate change probably won\u2019t move a lot over the next 6 to 9 months. But we think the new business will grow and if we get a lift in retentions, we\u2019ll see those positive numbers move approaching end of year 2019.","Mike Phillips","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","And that does conclude our question and answer portion of today\u2019s call. I will now turn the call back over to Susan Spivak for any closing remarks.","Susan Spivak","Thank you, operator. In conclusion, we just appreciate all of you joining us this morning and we apologize for the technical difficulties and the sound interference during Beth\u2019s note. Please note that there will be a transcript available and we\u2019re happy to talk after this call to clarify anything that wasn\u2019t clear during our prepared remarks. Thank you, and look forward to next quarter.","Operator","Thank you again for joining today\u2019s conference.

My name is Laurel, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Hartford Second Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to Sabra Purtill, head of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead.","Sabra R. Purtill","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to The Hartford Second Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. We released these results and also filed the investor financial supplement 10-Q and financial results presentation, which includes our third quarter 2014 outlook, yesterday afternoon. All of these documents are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Our speakers for today's call include Liam McGee, Chairman of The Hartford; Chris Swift, CFO; Doug Elliott, President; and Beth Bombara, CFO. Following their prepared remarks, we will have about 30 minutes for Q&A. I would note that other members of our executive leadership team are also available for questions during that section of the call.","As described on Page 2 of the financial results presentation, today's call includes forward-looking statements as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results could be materially different. We do not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements, and investors should consider the risks and uncertainties that cause actual results to differ from these statements. A detailed description of those risks and uncertainties can be found in our SEC filings, which are also available on our website.","Our presentation today includes several non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations and reconciliations of these measures to the comparable GAAP measure are included in our SEC filings, as well as in the earnings release and financial supplement. I'll now turn the call over to Liam.","Liam E. McGee","Thank you, Sabra. Good morning, everyone. It's really good to be with you. You know in my life, I don't have much experience working less than full time. So the last few weeks have been welcome as I've been able to focus on my health. And I do appreciate the many expressions that I received from so many of you. And I'm very pleased to report that I'm feeling much better and stronger. I have also had time to reflect on The Hartford's remarkable turnaround and transformation. The Hartford faced severe challenges when I arrived in 2009, and its future was unclear. Today, with a focus on growing profitable businesses, the company's prospects are bright.","Now as you know, while we made many changes over the last 5 years, I believe 3 were critical to our success. And we'll continue to deliver shareholder value.","We brought clarity to the company's strategic direction, focusing on businesses where we could compete and win. We have invested and we'll continue to invest in new capabilities for those businesses. The result has been sustained margin expansion, with more expected. We significantly lowered the risk profile of the company to a more reasonable level, most importantly recently, with the sale of Japan. This will reduce the volatility of The Hartford's results and will lower our cost of capital going forward.","Finally, we focused on generating and freeing up capital. We retained businesses that could create capital and sold other businesses that were capital-consumptive. We also reduced the size and risk of the Talcott Resolution liability, freeing more capital in the process. As a result, The Hartford now has a very strong balance sheet, with the capital flexibility to take accretive actions to create shareholder value. These 3 steps: reducing risk, narrowing the strategic focus and generating capital, were key to the transformation and position us well for the future.","The CEO transition from me to Chris has gone smoothly. Over the last few years, I spent a great deal of time on talent development and succession planning with the Board of Directors, and this thoughtful preparation enabled the board to act quickly and decisively when I decided to step aside as CEO. And I must emphasize that I couldn't be more confident in The Hartford's future with Chris Swift as CEO, Doug Elliot as President, and Beth Bombara as Chief Financial Officer, as well as the entire executive leadership team. Personally, I have fully transitioned to my new role as Executive Chairman and I look forward to supporting this team.","Finally, I want to thank you, our investors and analysts. I have valued your support and insight, but if I could be candid, some days more than others, and in the early days of my tenure, your patience with this banker, who as I was reminded was relatively new in the industry. I appreciate your support.","I particularly want to thank The Hartford's employees of whom this management team has asked a lot, and they have consistently delivered with great pride and integrity. Without a doubt, the nearly 18,000 teammates are The Hartford's greatest strength. With that, I'm proud to turn the call over to the Chief Executive Officer of The Hartford, Chris Swift. Chris?","Christopher John Swift","Thank you, Liam, for your comments. On behalf of the board, the management team and 18,000 Hartford teammates, I want to thank you for all that you've done for our company. Your willingness to make tough decisions, along with your guidance, leadership and passion, drove the successful transformation of The Hartford. You have positioned the company for great success and the leadership team and I are committed to achieving our vision of an exceptional Hartford. Personally, I am deeply appreciative of our partnership over the last 5 years. Thank you, Liam. I'm honored to serve as CEO of this great company, and I am excited about the path we are on. We continue to execute the company strategy, profitably growing the P&C, Group Benefits, the Mutual Fund businesses, reducing the size and risk of the legacy annuity blocks, and transforming The Hartford into a more effective and efficient organization. We have made tremendous progress. Profit margins are expanding in P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds. All the businesses are growing the top line, with the exception of Group Benefits, where margins have recovered strongly and the top line has stabilized.","Although prior year A&E development and elevated storm activity impacted The Hartford's second quarter results, the underlying trends in this quarter reflect a positive momentum in the businesses. In the P&C lines, written premiums grew 3%, and the ex-CAT ex-prior year combined ratio improved 0.9 points from the second quarter of 2013. Written premiums in Small Commercial were up 6%, and the underlying combined ratio was 85.4%, an improvement of 2.2 points compared to the second quarter of 2013. Core earnings in Group Benefits and Mutual Funds increased over the prior year quarters. I am confident we will continue to expand margins. Our pricing levels are higher than our loss cost trends in the P&C and benefits businesses.","In Middle Market, new property and general liability capabilities are driving profitable growth in selected markets, a dramatic improvement over the past 2 years. In Group Benefits, earnings have sharply rebounded, and we expect the business to produce a sustainable after-tax core margin of around 5.5%. We are rolling out new voluntary offerings, and I expect to see top line growth beginning next year.","The Talcott Resolution team has meaningfully reduced the size and risk of the annuity liabilities in the U.S., and of course, in Japan. For the U.S. blocks, we will continue to use targeted initiatives to accelerate the annuity runoff. As we said before, we will consider transactions as a potential tool, but I expect that we will create the most value for shareholders if we manage the runoff of the U.S. block ourselves.","With a more focused company, we must operate more effectively and efficiently, while investing in new capabilities. We have done well in our cost neutrality efforts, having eliminated the stranded cost from the Life and Retirement Plans businesses, and we will continue to manage expenses as Talcott shrinks. We also will continue to invest to increase our competitiveness in key markets and improve the quality of our customer experiences. I am confident in The Hartford strategy. I'm also very confident in this management team. With the changes announced Tuesday, the team possesses an outstanding mix of experience and skills, perfectly suited to The Hartford. Doug Elliot has demonstrated he is one of the best P&C operators in the business. As president, his new responsibilities now include all of P&C and Group Benefits, including claims, providing greater accountability and alignment across these businesses. Beth Bombara has been an outstanding leader in both finance and operating roles at The Hartford, most recently in Talcott Resolution. Beth's financial skills and business expertise will be critical factors in this team's success. Bill Bloom is a great addition for The Hartford. He has deep technology and customer service operations experience, but equally important, he knows the insurance business. I'm also excited to have Ray Sprague join my leadership team as leader of Strategy and Business Development. Ray is a seasoned P&C industry veteran, who has done a terrific job in building our industry-leading Small Commercial business. Ray will work closely with me and other senior leaders to accelerate the pace of growth across the enterprise. In addition, Ray will serve as acting head of Consumer Markets to replace Andy Napoli. We appreciate Andy's contributions to the company over the past few years and we wish him great success in his next opportunity.","Finally, I'm pleased that Brion Johnson will lead Talcott Resolution in addition to continuing as the Chief Investment Officer. Brion has annuity experience in his background and he's the ideal leader for Talcott, as it continues to reduce the size and risk of the U.S. annuity liabilities.","Every member of the team understands the insurance business model, a trust-based business where confidence is earned one day at a time with customers and partners. When that confidence and trust accumulates over time, it develops into a powerful brand and a market leader. This team is determined to win and build an exceptional company.","On July 1, we announced the closing of the sale of the Japan annuity business. We went from signing to closing in 60 days, an outstanding accomplishment. Both parties worked diligently to get this done, and I appreciate everyone's effort. The Japan sale is an important milestone. It accelerates the strategic transformation of The Hartford and significantly improves the company's risk profile. The sale also enables us to increase the company's capital management plan for 2014 and 2015 by $1.275 billion. Consistent with our prior programs, the expansion will be balanced between equity and debt repurchase, in this case, about 60% equity and 40% debt. We plan to put most of that additional capital to work by the end of this year.","In addition, we have increased the common stock dividend by 20% to $0.18 per quarter, based on the improving earnings power of the P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Fund businesses. With the expansion of the capital plan, the total share repurchase and debt repayment for 2014 and 2015 is nearly $4 billion. Over time, the generation of excess capital from profitable growth in the businesses and the runoff of U.S. annuity block and the use of that capital in accretive ways, will be critical to driving ROE improvement and increasing book value per share.","In closing, I am thrilled to take on this new role. I am very confident in the future of this company. The ingredients for success are here. And I am proud of all that this team has accomplished, and we are relentlessly executing on The Hartford's strategic plan with a focus on creating shareholder value.","Now I will turn the call over to The Hartford's President, Doug Elliot. Doug?","Douglas G. Elliot","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Before I review the financial results for Commercial and Consumer markets, a few comments on our new team. I'm excited about working more closely with our Consumer Markets group. We have an excellent team and a terrific brand in the consumer space and I'm looking forward to being their partner. I'm also excited about Bill Bloom joining our team. Bill and I have worked together in the past. The leadership and expertise he brings to our organization will be invaluable for our journey ahead, and an excellent fit with the strong technology and operations team that we already have in place. Likewise, I'm very pleased about Ray Sprague's broadened responsibilities across the enterprise. He's a proven leader with deep insurance experience that we will leverage to further expand our franchise. And lastly, we are very fortunate to have Stephanie Bush ready to step into the role as head of Small Commercial. Stephanie has a long and successful track record in P&C Commercial here at The Hartford, and has ideally prepared to take this business to new levels of growth and performance.","Now let me get into our results. I'll cover P&C Commercial first, move on to consumer, and conclude with Group Benefit. We had a very solid second quarter in P&C Commercial. Across our business units, we posted quality earnings and delivered strong top line results, even as the market shows signs of growing competitive pressure. Overall, I remained pleased with our execution and confident in our ability to navigate changing market conditions. For the quarter, we delivered core earnings of $213 million on an all-in combined ratio of 94.2. Compared to the second quarter of 2013, this is an increase of $15 million in core earnings, and an improvement of 4.2 points on the combined ratio. Underwriting gains were up $66 million in the quarter versus last year, offset by a decrease in net investment income. Current accident year CATs were relatively modest for the second quarter of 2014 and $9 million less than the quarter 1 year ago. The underlying combined ratio, excluding catastrophes and prior development was 91.1 for the second quarter of 2014, an improvement of 2 points versus prior year, reflecting our strong execution across all business units.","Turning to the top line, our total written premium was up 2%. Excluding the decline in our programs business of $28 million, which is a result of our re-underwriting actions, P&C Commercial grew 5% for the second quarter. We also continued to drive written pricing gains, achieving a 6% increase for Standard Commercial. We are watching our pricing trends very closely, given growing competitive pressure and diligently executing our pricing segmentation methodologies. Importantly, pricing continued to outpace loss cost trends.","Let me now drill down in each of our P&C Commercial businesses. We had another excellent quarter in Small Commercial, with an all-in combined ratio of 89.3. Last quarter, I noted that our top line momentum was building. Those trends continued this quarter, with policy retention improving to 84% and new business of $140 million for the quarter, up 12% over prior year. Equally impressive, our underlying combined ratio of 85.4 improved 2.2 points versus second quarter 2013. Our Small Commercial team is driving top line, written pricing gains and superior underwriting results. We could not be more pleased with our path forward.","Moving to Middle Market. I continue to be encouraged by our steady progress here, posting an underlying combined ratio of 95.1. Although this is essentially flat versus prior year, we are executing well in critical priorities. Renewal written pricing at 6% remained ahead of loss cost trends, and our underlying combined ratio in Middle Market worker's compensation is down nearly 5 points for the quarter versus last year. Offsetting these results was an increase in our property losses. We see nothing specific beyond these losses other than the normal volatility associated with the property line. Over the last several years, our team has done a great job of balancing our worker's compensation book with more writings in property and general liability. In fact, we're very excited to have just locked in a new property per risk reinsurance treaty that provides CAT capacity up to $500 million. This is a very important line of business in our strategy, and we expect to thoughtfully continue our property expansion. Commercial auto has been a more challenging line across the industry, including us as well. Our Middle Market written pricing in this line is in the high single-digits, as we continue to address loss cost trends. Our retentions have remained quite strong, despite the rate increases, indicating to us that the overall market is also raising rates.","Middle Market premium was up 3% in the quarter, primarily driven by improved retention. New business of $112 million was down slightly from last year, with a well-balanced product mix. Pricing and underwriting actions remained disciplined and the rate adequacy of our Middle Market book is significantly improved from prior years.","Turning to Specialty Commercial. National accounts delivered another strong quarter of written premium growth, up 7% versus last year. We continue to believe that available new business in the market is down slightly from 2013, but we're still seeing opportunities to write new accounts. Our retention rates continue to exceed 90%. The repositioning of our programs business remains on track as is progress in our Financial Products business as well.","Shifting over to consumer. We experienced elevated property losses in the second quarter, posting an all-in combined ratio of 106.3. Excluding CATs in prior year development, the underlying combined ratio was 89.6, up 0.7 points from a year ago. Like others in the industry, weather adversely affected both auto and homeowners results on a CAT and ex-CAT basis. The largest CAT event in the quarter was a string of May hailstorms that crossed 11 states from Montana to South Carolina, accounting for nearly 1\/3 of our CAT losses.","Outside of CATs and weather, we experienced higher fire losses in the quarter versus last year, contributing 4 points to the underlying homeowners combined ratio. At this point, we don't see an unusual pattern developing with respect to fire losses, other than the usual volatility associated with this peril. Top line momentum continued with 4% written premium growth, driven in part by auto new business production, particularly strong in both agency channels. Premium retention was flat for auto and homeowners and a solid result given continued written pricing gains of 5 and 8 points, respectively. Perhaps most noteworthy was our auto PIF growth of 1% in the quarter, a direct result of more precise pricing segmentation and service delivery improvements.","Our expense ratio decreased this quarter to 23.2. This is due to the timing of technology and marketing spend, which is weighted more to the back half of the year. We expect our full year expense ratio to be comparable to the 23.8 we reported in the first quarter.","Now let's move to Group Benefits. This was another strong quarter for Group Benefits with core earnings of $52 million, up 41% from last year. Profit improvement this quarter is driven largely by the life and AD&D lines, where we benefited from favorable life mortality. Disability trends were slightly elevated in the quarter yet remain favorable year-to-date through June.","For the quarter, long-term disability incident trends continue to be favorable, offset by lower recoveries versus a year ago, resulting in a slightly higher disability loss ratio. We continue to see favorable effects of our underwriting, pricing and claims management initiatives reflected in the achieved margin improvement across our employer group life and disability block. The rate of improvement has been significant in recent years, and we will remain disciplined with these operating leverage.","Looking at the top line. Fully insured ongoing premium declined 7% compared to prior year. As we've noted previously, the decrease is primarily attributed to our exit of an agreement with a third-party targeting sales through financial institutions. Excluding the premium from this arrangement, our top line is down about 1% to prior year. Overall book persistency on our group life and disability business exceeded 90% through June, which is up over 10 points from 2013. We are very pleased with our renewal block and the overall persistency rebound versus 2012 and 2013.","Industry data indicates that new sales are trending down slightly. Our sense is that in early 2014, large case customers have taken a tempered approach to moving their business, particularly as they sort through the dynamics of the Affordable Care Act and the trend to our more employee-direct benefit options. We believe this may have been a factor in our own strong book persistency, and contributed to our lower quarter-over-quarter fully insured ongoing sales of $45 million. We continue to actively quote business and we believe that we're competing effectively for new accounts, leveraging our expanding service and claim capabilities.","In closing, this is a solid quarter for us across P&C and Group Benefits. While P&C Commercial competition continues to grow, I would still characterize the environment as rational. Our aggressive and disciplined actions in Standard Commercial over the last 3 years have us in strong position to compete moving forward. And we continue to make the people and technology investments that will be necessary to succeed in the years ahead.","Now let me turn the call over to Beth Bombara.","Beth A. Bombara","Thank you, Doug. Last evening, we reported second quarter core earnings of $144 million or $0.31 per diluted share. Second quarter results included $178 million after tax or $0.38 per diluted share of unfavorable items. The largest item was $164 million after tax of A&E unfavorable prior year development, consisting of $146 million for the annual asbestos reserve study and $18 million for environmental. Aside from these 2 annual studies, unfavorable prior year development was not material, totaling $10 million before tax, of which $7 million was for accretion of discount on worker's compensation reserves.","During the quarter, current year catastrophes totaled $127 million after tax, slightly above our outlook. There were 13 named catastrophes with winds and hail being the highest cost perils this quarter. The net loss for the quarter was $467 million or $1 per diluted share compared with the net loss of $190 million or $0.39 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2013. The largest contributor to the net loss for the quarter was the loss in discontinued operations due to the Japan annuity sale, which totaled $617 million after tax.","P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds generated core earnings of $113 million, down from $197 million in second quarter 2013, primarily due to the A&E prior year development.","As you know, we complete the annual asbestos and environmental studies in the second quarter. Environmental reserve development totaled $27 million before tax in part due to increased cleanup cost on a few water waste sites. The $212 million before tax increase in the asbestos reserve primarily arises from a small number of insured. For those insured, a higher-than-expected frequency and severity of mesothelioma claims drove the reserve increase. We continue to proactively pursue legislative and legal remedies to manage these claim cost, including transparency around the various asbestos bankruptcy trusts. Mutual Funds core earnings rose 5% over the prior year, due to higher fees resulting from increased assets under management. Performance remains solid with 76% of funds outperforming their peers over the last 5 years.","We continued to see sales momentum, up 5% in total, and up 38% of our equity funds, while redemptions also declined. However, net flows were slightly negative due to our previously announced decision to liquidate target date funds, which had $709 million in assets under management. Excluding that liquidation, net flows were positive by about $300 million. Talcott's core earnings for the quarter were $101 million, which was above our outlook, principally due to higher investment income, including limited partnerships. The risk of our U.S. VA book continued to decline. With U.S. equity markets up 5% in the quarter, 95% of the GMWB contracts are out of the money.","We continue to pursue various policyholder programs to reduce the size and risk of the Talcott books of business. In addition to the ISV program for U.S. retail fixed annuities that was launched in the first quarter, during the second quarter, we rolled out a second Enhanced Surrender Value program for certain of our lifetime benefit contracts. With the impact of these programs and surrender activity, fixed annuity accounts decreased by 7% and variable annuity contracts decreased by 3% during the quarter.","Turning to investment income. The general account is producing solid investment returns with modest impairment. We have a highly diversified portfolio with investments in a broad array of asset classes. Our overall credit risk profile is not materially different from a year ago. Yields have held up relatively well despite the low interest rate environment, without increasing credit risk or portfolio duration. The decline in total investment income from the prior year quarter was principally due to lower assets as a result of the runoff of Talcott and lower limited partnership income. Excluding limited partnership return, the annualized portfolio yield in the quarter was 4.1%, down approximately 10 basis points from a year ago. Low interest rates and tight credit spreads remain a challenge. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance returns by leveraging our investment capabilities without compromising portfolio quality. For instance, in the second quarter, we achieved a reinvestment rate of 3.8%, aided by attractive opportunities in private placement securities and commercial mortgage loans, where we could maintain credit quality in yield by capturing liquidity premium. The Hartford's book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI at June 30, 2014, was $39.21, down slightly from year end, but up 2% from June 30, 2013. The growth in book value per share over the last year was due to the positive impact of net income and share repurchases over the last 12 months, which were partially offset by shareholder dividends. During the second quarter, we repurchased 10.2 million common shares for $351 million at an average price of $34.53 per share.","For the 12 months ended June 30, 2014, our core earnings ROE was 7.8% compared with 6.1% at June 30, 2013. I would like to point out that core earnings ROEs for all periods presented have been recast to reflect Japan earnings as a discontinued operation, which has the effect of reducing our core earnings ROEs.","Looking forward, we would expect our full year 2015 core ROE to improve to the low 9% level, after giving effect to the full execution of our capital management plans, as well as continued profitable growth in P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds.","On July 1, we announced the closing of the sale of the Japan annuity business for cash proceeds of $963 million. As a result of the additional financial flexibility and risk reduction provided by this sale, our capital management plan for 2014 and 2015 has been increased by $1.275 billion to a total of almost $4 billion. And in addition, we increased our common dividend by 20%. The combination of the capital benefit from the sale, improved cash flow generation from Talcott, and strong earnings power from P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds, enables us to execute this plan and will contribute to future ROE improvement. The $1.275 billion increase is comprised of 2 pieces. First, a $775 million increase in equity repurchases, including a $525 million accelerated share repurchase plan or ASR, that was executed yesterday and will be completed by year end. Second, we allocated $500 million for additional debt reduction, including associated premiums and transaction expenses, which also will be completed this year.","With the expansion of the share repurchase plan, beyond the portion being used for the ASR, we expect that equity repurchases will be about $300 million a quarter. Actual repurchases will, of course, depend on market conditions and other factors that may impact market access and timing. In the third quarter through July 29, we have purchased approximately 3.9 million shares for $140 million. Yesterday, we also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.18 per common share, up 20% from the $0.15 that we began paying in mid-2013, and the third increase in 3 years.","Before turning to your questions, let me provide a brief summary of our third quarter outlook. Our core earnings outlook for the third quarter of 2014 is $335 million to $355 million or $0.74 to $0.79 per diluted share, assuming $452 million shares outstanding. Talcott earnings are projected at $75 million to $85 million. This outlook assumes catastrophe losses of $87 million after tax, which is equivalent to about 5.2 points on a combined ratio. This outlook is about a 15% increase in core earnings per share after adjusting third quarter 2013 for items that included a favorable $55 million corporate settlement, cash below budget and prior year development. To wrap up, the second quarter was another quarter of significant progress. Despite challenging catastrophe and non-CAT weather conditions, underlying performance in P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds continued to improve, and Talcott made a significant leap forward in reducing the size and risk of its portfolio with the sale of Japan. We remain focused on achieving greater operating efficiency and effectiveness. And the combination with these accomplishments and our expanded capital management plans, we are on the right path to achieving book value growth and higher core earnings ROEs, which will continue to create shareholder value. And we'll now turn the call over to Sabra to begin the Q&A session.","Sabra R. Purtill","Thank you, Beth. Laurel, could you please repeat the Q&A instructions? [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of questions, maybe first, a big picture question for Chris. As you look out a couple of years, Chris, is there some ROE range that you think the company can achieve if you're looking out to '16 or '17?","Christopher John Swift","Jay, I think Beth tried to describe what we see in the near term through '15 with our announced capital management plans and where we see the momentum of the go-forward business is. When you get in the '16, '17, we previously -- continue to believe we can expand ROE in those years as we continue to grow and manage capital accretively, but probably not at the rate of pace that we see through -- now through the end of '15. So we still believe we're in that 30 to 40, 50-basis-point continual improvement through those years at this point in time. But as you know, when you get further out, Jay, a lot of dynamics in the economics of the P&C cycle and the businesses, but we're still confident that we're going to be able to expand beyond where we see 2015 currently.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. That's helpful, Chris. And second question, maybe for Doug. In the Consumer Markets business, you highlight a certain elevated level of non-CAT weather and fire losses. I'm wondering if you can discuss those losses relative to a normal quarter? How much above typical were those losses?","Douglas G. Elliot","Jay, it's Doug. Couple of thoughts, you have our detail inside the supplementals. You know that our core accident year, essentially quarter-over-quarter was up 2 points. And that was due to non-CAT, both weather and fire. I would also describe that 2-point change as roughly above normal as well. So I think I would use a couple of points as the answer on both accounts.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess I was talking just about the Consumer business. Did I say Commercial? I meant Consumer, if I...","Douglas G. Elliot","Did I say Commercial? I was talking Consumer.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent DeAugustino with KBW.","Vincent M. DeAugustino - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","To start, asbestos is something that we generally can sometimes look through, and so I don't want to get too hung up on it. But we've seen a number of asbestos retro deals, particularly with births [ph] around industry. And I'm just curious if this is something that you'd consider doing and then along with that, how dilutive something like that might actually be relative to the downside on policy limits, sort of as a worst case scenario?","Christopher John Swift","Vincent, I think we're very aware of the third-party solutions that are out there and available in the marketplace. And with that said, where we are today is we haven't found anything that we think is economical for us at this point, and believe really managing these liabilities off ourselves is the optimum strategy. I think also you need to consider that these are really complex claim matters and again, we feel best suited with the expertise that we've built longer -- in a long period of time with John Kinney and his outstanding claims team. And it's really in our best interest to manage our own claims also during this period of time. So you put the economics, you put our claim handling and expertise available, and that's where our current thinking is.","Vincent M. DeAugustino - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, good. And then just for a quick follow-up. On the product development side, and with a lot of the defensive work here being a complete to many of Liam's earlier points. I get the sense that there's been an incremental step-up, sort of if we can call it your offense strategy here in 2014. I was hoping to maybe get a preview of any of the new products or distribution opportunities that you might have here on the radar with the new leadership structure.","Christopher John Swift","Vincent, I'll just give you a perspective and I know Doug will want to share his view. So I think you're specifically referring to Ray Sprague joining my leadership team as the head of Strategy and Business Development. And he's got a broad mandate, and the broad mandate is obviously to accelerate our growth and our capabilities and Doug and I, when we talk, and we talk in terms of product, we talk in terms of distribution, we talk in terms of geographic presence. So Ray's got a great track record in being very innovative, creative in the Small Commercial area. So Doug and I want to leverage that capabilities across a broader platform. Doug, what color would you...","Douglas G. Elliot","Maybe a few more ideas Vincent on top of Chris that I will share with you. In the second quarter, we did announce a new partnership with AARP in the Small Commercial space, so that will be a growing opportunity we look after and work at. Secondly, as we've commented previously, we have a number of initiatives in our Group Benefits space. We rolled out a critical illness product in the second quarter and still working on other products as we move through '14 and to '15. And lastly, and I know we've shared quite a bit of this with you, our journey to round out our Middle Market workers comp book continues. We feel very good about progress in the property and general liability area. But as noted now, new upside structure relative to reinsurance capacity and property, I think allows us to continue to expand. So a lot of work in the product development area across all these businesses.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass with Citigroup.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's a question for Doug. In commercial lines, as you highlighted, you continue to get rate above your loss cost trends. Just based on what you're seeing in both the industry pricing trend, as well as Hartford's specific dynamics, how much longer do you think that this can continue? Maybe what are you doing that's enabling you to outperform the industry?","Douglas G. Elliot","Erik, maybe few thoughts for you. First thing I would say is, as we look out 90-plus days. We don't see something dramatic occurring that will have a dramatic shift or impact on the trend line. So I could be wrong, but as I think out and I look at what we're trying to accomplish third quarter beyond, our behavior's going to be very consistent. That's our attempt. Secondly, I'll remind you and others that as we think about margin improvement, and we're constantly thinking about that, there are other levers that we're constantly working. So we're working underwriting, nonrenewal renewal strategies, we have a number of initiatives in our claims area. And so we're working on a number of areas, not just pricing against loss trend, and we feel good about what we've accomplished to date. I know that I've referenced our work in the auto area, it's not a line where we're pleased with the overall performance today. It is getting additional attention. I talked to you about our rate gains in the second quarter. Those gains will continue. That's our intent into quarters 3 and 4 and beyond. So a lot of work going on, and I'm bullish that what we've accomplished so far will be the beginning of a really good path forward.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","If I can ask quickly on Group Benefits, where do you think the margins can get to over time? And is it achievable to get back to kind of the 7% range where you were in 2007, 2008?","Christopher John Swift","Erik, it's Chris. In my prepared remarks, we talked in terms of 5.5 on a sustainable basis. So I would temper your expectations a little bit on 7%.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And what does that translate into an ROE?","Christopher John Swift","I would say again, with the statutory capital and the GAAP capital that we hold against that businesses, we think we could operate in the low double-digits and try to grow it from there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Chris, with regard to the -- or Beth, with regard to the ROE outlook, I'm thinking that since the life business has the greater portion of the common equity of The Hartford ex AOCI than P&C, but P&C delivers the lion's share of the earnings that it might make sense to explore every avenue to continue to shrink that, the runoff life business, including the U.S. variable annuity. I know you mentioned, you prefer to keep that in-house, but perhaps you could expand your thoughts on that.","Christopher John Swift","Jay, it's Chris. Let me just take the strategy point and then Beth will talk about the ROE implications and the allocation of capital. I think if you think about it, where we're at right now, now that we've sold Japan, we're really left just with a U.S. platform. You've always heard us talk about that we think that risk is -- we understand it very well. It's been managed historically very well. We know how to hedge it. We make about $300 million a year on that VA line of business. Our hedge costs are low, obviously, at these new market levels, including our macro program. So that we really are positioning Talcott as a steady capital provider to the holding company in years to come. And then we'd like to use that capital again to redeploy into higher accretive purposes. So that's sort of a simple model. But I always did say we're always aware of, I'll call it, options out there as a potential tool. But what we see right now for the next -- a couple of years at least, is what we'd like. So Beth, would you share your comment?","Beth A. Bombara","Thank you, Chris. And I'll echo a lot of Chris's comments on that, as we sit here day and look at not only just the GAAP earnings generation that comes from the Talcott businesses, but with the elimination of Japan and the reduced volatility from our statutory results, we really do see ourselves on a path of being able to rely more consistently on taking dividends out of the life entities. And all of that obviously, over time, will play into the ROE equation. And it is a balancing act between increasing that ROE, maybe initially and long term, what we think the economics are of this business and provides us with greater, I think, capital flexibility for the long term. But at Chris said, we're always mindful that there are other opportunities to accelerate that, but that's kind of the equation that we go back and forth in our minds with.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's helpful. And then for the low-9% return equity outlook for 2015, does that assume continued underlying margin expansion in the Property & Casualty business?","Beth A. Bombara","Yes, that includes our thoughts going into '15 of the margin expansion that we see in our businesses, as well as the full execution of the current capital management plan that we have.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I want to go back to asbestos, I'm afraid. I know that there's been issues across the industry, but it's still -- it's a lot of money to lose there opposed to -- for what's supposed to be a decaying liability. And I guess, I want to get a better sense you can provide us with what's going on? I get that it's peripheral defendants by mostly mesothelioma claims, but are you losing at trial? Are you settling more? Are you just spending more on claims and defense costs? I'd like to kind of understand better what's going on. And with a hope to kind of get a sense, objectively, at least, of when we think this might trail off.","Christopher John Swift","Randy, it's Chris. Beth's prepared to give you more insights. But just from my chair and observing this over a little bit of time, you're not going to like this, but there's really nothing new here. I mean, this is still a handful of our accounts. There's nothing new that's sort of bubbling up. When you have, I'll call it, sort of elevated frequency in our accounts and you extend that out over a longer period of time when our model predicts, you can have a relatively large movement in our loss reserves. But Beth will give you a little bit more of the details on what's going on. But the key point here is there's nothing new that we're managing or that we're getting exposed to. It's more of the same.","Beth A. Bombara","Yes, Chris, I would agree with that. And again as we said, if you think about the charge that we took, the $212 million pretax, think about roughly 2\/3 of that coming from the experience that we're seeing with a small number and you said all the right words, peripheral insureds, where we're seeing an increase in meso claims. And we would have expected to see a decrease. And given the severity that comes with meso claims, and we extrapolate that out through our models, we get the increase that you saw -- that we recorded this quarter. The medical science continues to point to the fact that we should start to see a decrease in these claims. And depending on what activity affects our insureds and the type of coverage that we provided to those specific insureds that see these increases, this is the result that we see. But as Chris said, it's not really anything new. It's just how that activity is affecting our insureds and how it runs through our models where we extrapolate over many, many years.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","No, that's helpful. So I mean these are legitimate meso claims. These is not the -- the expansion of liability is more to the peripheral of the defendants but the actual claim is legit, and so you're just having to post more to settle more, basically.","Beth A. Bombara","Yes, exactly. This is not like what we saw years and years ago, whereas people who were claiming that they were affected but they had no manifestation of an actual disease.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel with Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","A couple of quick questions on the quarter. Doug, you mentioned, I believe in your prepared remarks an expectation for the Consumer Markets expense ratio for the remainder of this year. I was wondering if you could give us any help on your expectations on the Commercial side for the expense ratio as well.","Douglas G. Elliot","John, let me frame that. There aren't any variations that I think affect your model. And Chris, I can't think of anything relative to run rate that are either front loaded, back loaded, or has some seasonality to it. So John, I think what you've seen is a good indication of where we are, and I think you can move forward from there.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, very helpful. Then on the new Enhanced Surrender program, can you just give us a little bit of color on what you're expecting there? How much account value or number of contracts you're targeting? Should we think about the cost benefit analysis there as being pretty similar to the most recent surrender program on the VA side?","Beth A. Bombara","Yes, sure, this is Beth, I'll take that. So again, there's 2 programs. There is, we refer to as the ISV, which is focused on a fixed annuity block, and it's about 4 billion to 5 billion of account value that we are making this offer to. And our expectations on that is that we would see about a 15% take rate. On the ESV program, it's similar to the program that we did last year with some modifications. And again, it is targeted at our variable annuity book and a specific tranche of about $6 billion of account value. And we're assuming there that we'll probably see about a 15% take rate as well. That's down from what we saw with our first program. But we think given the fact that this program -- the offers are a little bit less than before, and we've also been out to this group of policyholders with our first offer so we expect the rate to be a little bit less. And when we put the combination of both programs together and at those take rates, we'd expect to see about $150 million-ish of capital benefit when we look at sort of our stress scenario capital.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And that $150 million is both of them put together?","Beth A. Bombara","Both of them put together, yes.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Got it, okay. And then just one final quick question. So I think you ended the quarter with about $1.3 billion of cash and short-term securities at the parent. Can you just sort of roll us forward, because here in a few days, or maybe in the month of July, a lot of things happened, right? You brought in the cash proceeds from the Japan annuity sale, you've done a decent amount of buybacks, including the ASR. So on a pro forma basis at the end of July, would it be correct to just sort of take those couple of things into account and roll it forward, or is there anything else more significant?","Beth A. Bombara","That would be the most significant item. The only other item that we did, and it's really a timing item more than anything else, is we did accelerate some of the dividends that we'd normally take out of the P&C legal entities. So if you read our Q, you'll see that in there. And that was about $500 million or so. And that really was just an acceleration of what we normally would have done over the third, fourth and first quarter on the remaining of this year and into next year. It's not an indication that overall, we plan to be taking more of the P&C company going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just wanted to focus on what you've announced for the capital, planned the update in the capital plan. Now that Japan is behind you, should we expect that there's going to be another phase of capital return for 2015 related to risk buffer and U.S. Talcott? And if so, when do you think we'd get an update on that? Or finally, is that more -- it's something that we should be thinking about more for 2016 and not 2015?","Christopher John Swift","It's Chris. Beth will provide some commentary too. So I think you might know this, right? We just announced what we want to do for the rest of '15. So we're going to start getting after that. I think the accelerated plan demonstrates our commitment to really deploy our excess capital in what we think is the most accretive ways. And we'll look -- we're always going to continue to look at the balance sheet, all the combinations of factors in our operating companies, our holding companies, and always challenge ourselves to being as efficient as possible with our capital. So Beth, would you provide any additional color?","Beth A. Bombara","Yes, and I think Chris, that summarizes it very well. Again, when you look at the plan that we have announced, a significant amount of both equity repurchases and debt repayments that we'll be dealing for the remainder of '14 and going into '15. And I think we've demonstrated that as we look at our overall capital position and look to manage our Talcott entities at appropriate levels, that to the extent that we were to make any changes of that in the future, we obviously would share that with you. But I would not be expecting some sort of big change coming in the short term as it relates to our capital management plan. But I think more importantly, if I just could add, what we really are focused on is looking at what the statutory capital generation is in the Talcott entities and getting ourselves in a place where we can rely on a predictable stream of cash flows coming out of those entities over time.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And just -- Beth, just a follow-up on that. Does the plan that you just announced contemplate utilizing U.S. Talcott dividends?","Beth A. Bombara","So our current plan does anticipate, kind of consistent with where we've talked about before, $250 million, $300 million of dividend, so that is contemplated in the current plan and to some extent, a portion of that was contemplated in the previous plans.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","You said $250 million to $300 million?","Beth A. Bombara","Yes.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And just the last question. The $500 million additional debt reduction, can you just bring us up to speed in terms of how far out does that get you? And how should we be thinking about what maturities that takes care of? I believe that actually gets you through more than 2016 maturities, if I'm doing the math correctly, and it would get you out until 2017. Or am I not thinking about that correctly? Is there -- are you more thinking about doing early retirement of some of these maturities?","Beth A. Bombara","Yes, so a couple of things. So first of all, with the plan that we had announced earlier this year, as you may recall, we had indicated that we were targeting 2 of the maturities that we have in 2015, which is about $456 million. And so those will come to the normal course. The $500 million that we've allocated for debt repayment for the remainder of this year, we don't have another maturity that would happen in the third or fourth quarter of '14. So we will be looking at either calling a tranche of debt or a tender. But that would be an acceleration. We don't have a maturity that lines up with that.","Sabra R. Purtill","Laurel, we have time for one more question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Two quick questions here. First one, Doug, you mentioned elevated property losses in the Middle Market commercial lines space. What would that add to the underlying combined ratio in the quarter, kind of relative with what's normalized?","Douglas G. Elliot","So we share the underlying and the Middle Market overall combined ratio side. I'd point you there in our supplement. I would characterize the losses as primarily fire, a couple of larger losses in our property book and we also have one in our inland marine book. So somewhat outsized but not -- we don't take enormous retentions. Our retentions are normally under $10 million and so they did cause a little bit of blip in our Middle category.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can you quantify what the kind of -- was it 1 point, 2 points in the underlying?","Douglas G. Elliot","There's so much seasonality. I will give you a sense. Our core, as I think about second quarter, non-weather losses over the last 3 or 4 years were higher than the norm by a couple of points overall. So it's not -- certainly not 10 points in the book, right? It's 2 to 3 points. They're having quarters that have had that kind of activity. But relative to 2013, we're a little outsized.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Next question for you Doug. Just curious, now that you're going be running the Consumer business, any changes that you anticipate making and specifically focused on your other agency business that continues to kind of contract here?","Douglas G. Elliot","So this is 2 days in. No changes planned. We have a terrific franchise with AARP and obviously, you know that I've been deep in the agency space on the Commercial side for the last 25 years. So excited about what we will be doing there, what we're doing there currently today. Just a lot of work in front of me and looking forward with Ray to working with his team. So more to come as we talk forward.","Sabra R. Purtill","Thank you, Brian. We'd like to thank all of you for joining us today and for your interest in The Hartford.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Sabra Purtill, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you, Heidi. Good morning and welcome to The Hartford\u2019s second quarter 2017 webcast. Our speakers today include Chris Swift, Chairman and CEO of The Hartford; Doug Elliot, President; and Beth Bombara, CFO. Following their prepared remarks, we will have about 30 minutes for Q&A.","Just a few comments before Chris begins.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The Hartford\u2019s second quarter core earnings increased significantly over the prior year. Each business segment contributed to the results with clear progress in personal auto and solid investment returns, including favorable limited partnership results.","Capital generation remains strong and we returned over $800 million to shareholders in the first-half of the year, including share repurchases and dividends, while repaying$416 million of debt. Performance over the past year increased core earnings ROE to 9.3%, or a 11.3%, excluding Talcott Resolution.","One of the most important accomplishments in the quarter was the improvement in personal auto results. I\u2019m encouraged by the frequency and severity trends we\u2019re seeing in the loss experience. Adjusting second quarter 2016 results for the unfavorable development during the year, we delivered a 2.4 point improvement in the underlying combined ratio this quarter.","While we have more work to do, the quality of the auto book is much better today due to the success of the profitability initiatives we launched over the past 18 months, and we are on track to meet the combined ratio goal we set for the year. With improved profitability, we will increase marketing spend in the second-half of 2017 in selected areas to begin growing new business again.","Our 30-year-plus relationship with AARP remain strong and we are working in close partnership as we transition to growth. Commercial lines achieved an excellent 90.9 underlying combined ratio, reflecting disciplined underwriting in markets that remain competitive. Small commercial again delivered outstanding results with 6% written premium growth and a superb underlying combined ratio of 87.2, despite some pressure in auto.","We will continue to focus on growing in this important segment of the market and are investing significantly in data and digital capabilities that are enhancing underwriting and improving agent and customer experience. I\u2019m confident we are well-positioned to continue to lead this small commercial insurance market into the future.","The Middle Market underlying combined ratio was 94.9, a 3 point deterioration, mainly due to several large property losses occurring late in the second quarter. The competitive environment in Middle Market remains challenging for both new and renewal business, which is likely to persist in the second-half of the year. We will continue to prioritize disciplined risk selection in retention of our best accounts while competing in areas where it makes sense.","Group benefits continue to deliver excellent results. Core earnings increased 33% to $61 million, resulting in core earnings margin of 6.7%. The increase in earnings reflected improved group life mortality and better disability experience with strong persistency supporting top line growth.","The voluntary business while still small is building momentum with our new hospital indemnity product now approved and quoting in 44 states. We\u2019re focused on growing this business and are investing in new and enhanced capabilities to increase penetration with agents and brokers who specialize in this market.","Mutual funds had another great quarter, with total assets under management reaching $108 billion. In the first-half of 2017, the segment achieved positive net flows in excess of $2.6 billion, with strong investment performance across the fund lineup. I\u2019m optimistic about the continued growth of this business with our two outstanding subadvisers, Wellington and Schroders, and our recent entry into the smart beta asset class.","Before turning the call over to Doug, I\u2019d like to make a few comments about the city of Hartford. Currently, the city is in the midst of a significant financial crisis with its future very much tied to the actions of the state of Connecticut. As the company founded and headquartered in Hartford for over 200 years, we remain vested in the city\u2019s future and believe its success is vital to the state\u2019s economy and overall strength.","While the city faces immense challenges, we believe it also holds enormous potential. Connecticut in the Greater Hartford area offer tremendous quality of life and enjoy one of the most educated and talented workforces in the country. In many ways, the seeds of the city\u2019s future success have already been sown in the form of recent investments in new housing, education and transportation.","These green shoots of progress are why The Hartfordm along with other large insurance employers recently offered financial support to help supplement the city\u2019s finances, contingent on the development of a comprehensive and sustainable solution for the capital city. We strongly encourage elected leaders and other key stakeholders to come together to implement the long-term solutions necessary to address the financial challenges facing the city and state and continue to cultivate Hartford as a vibrant urban center, capable of attracting critical talent of the future.","In closing, I\u2019m proud of the strong financial results we delivered this quarter and the progress we\u2019ve made in the first-half of 2017, which put us on track to meet the outlook we provided earlier this year.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Doug.","Doug Elliot","Good morning, everyone. As Chris said, we\u2019re very pleased with our second quarter across Property & Casualty and Group Benefits. Commercial Lines delivered strong results against the backdrop of a competitive market. In Personal Lines, auto improvement improved consistent with our expectations, and Group Benefits had an excellent quarter with strong earnings driven by favorable trends in both group life and disability.","Let me get right into the second quarter details on each of our business units. In Commercial Lines, the combined ratio was 94.6, improving 0.4 point from 2016, primarily due to lower catastrophe losses and prior year development, partially offset by slightly higher current accident year loss before catastrophes.","The underlying combined ratio for Commercial Lines was 90.9, deteriorating 1.1 points. This is largely driven by commercial auto consistent with trends in first quarter 2017, and large loss volatility in Middle Market property. Market conditions continue to be competitive, particularly in Middle Market and national accounts, and we\u2019re executing effectively the balance retention, margins and new business opportunities.","Renewal written pricing in Standard Commercial Lines was 3.5%, up slightly from the first quarter of 2017, with the highest increases continuing to come from commercial auto. Small Commercial had another strong quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 87.2. Written premium was up 6%, resulting from strong retention and $147 million of new business, including $14 million from Maxum.","In Middle Market, the underlying combined ratio was 94.9, deteriorating 3 points from 2016, mainly due to several large losses in our property and marine books of business. These losses can be volatile and our results for the first six months are within our longer-term run rate.","Written premium decreased 2% versus prior year. New business production of $107 million was up 14%. Although, recent loss cost trends in line, such as workers\u2019 comp and general liability have been favorable, our view is that, we must consider historical trends in our decision-making, given the long-term nature of these liabilities.","Overall, I believe, we struck an appropriate balance between new business, pricing and underwriting quality in this competitive marketplace. On the in-force book, we took targeted non-renewal actions on a program for service and maintenance contractors. Excluding these actions, our retention remain solid and consistent with prior quarters. Middle Market operating expenses were also higher in the quarter, as we continue to invest in the talent and technology necessary to compete in this business long-term.","Moving to Specialty Commercial, the underlying combined ratio of 95.9 deteriorated half a point. This was driven by a slightly higher loss ratio in auto liability again consistent with our results in first quarter 2017. Written premium and Specialty Commercial was down 3% for the quarter, largely the result of slower of slightly lower new and renewal premium in national accounts, partially offset by continued growth in bond.","Moving to Personal Lines, the second quarter combined ratio was 101.4, improving 11.2 points from a year ago. 8.9 points of the improvement was driven by a change from unfavorable prior year development in second quarter of 2016 to slightly favorable development this year. The expenses and catastrophe losses were also lower versus 2016.","The underlying combined ratio of 92.6 improved 1.6 points. This was primarily driven by improving auto trends, partially offset by homeowner results with the homeowner\u2019s underlying combined ratio for the second quarter of 77.6, deteriorating 3.4 points versus last year due to higher non-catastrophe weather losses.","In Personal Lines auto, the underlying combined ratio improved to 99.1. After adjusting second quarter 2016 for net development affecting the quarter, the 2017 auto loss ratio has improved approximately 1.3 points. The expense ratio was also down this year by 1.1 points, due primarily to reduce new business acquisition expenses.","As a result, on an adjusted basis, the underlying combined ratio for the second quarter of 2017 improved 2.4 points. This progress is right in line with our expectations, as our pricing, underwriting, and agency management actions begin to earn their way into our book of business. Auto loss cost trends have been relatively stable and moderate in recent quarters more in line with historical levels.","Frequency trend is essentially flat and severity trend is in the low single digits, both improving from our experience in 2016 and 2015. The year-to-date auto combined ratio was 99.1. We expect the second-half of the year to run higher due to normal seasonality.","Importantly, we remain on track to achieve our full-year auto combined ratio outlook of 101 to 103, which included approximately 1 point for catastrophes. This represents 2 to 3 points of expected improvement in the underlying auto loss ratio for the full-year.","Personal Lines written premium for second quarter 2017 was down 7%. Consistent with recent quarters, our marketing spend was down versus a year ago, resulting in lower new business as we address our rate needs with added filings and improved underwriting segmentation.","We have made substantial progress to-date. And as we noted last quarter, we are increasing our AARP new business marketing efforts over the second-half of the year. Due to the lead times between marketing and customer conversion, we expect to see positive growth in AARP direct new business premium late in the fourth quarter.","Turning to Group Benefits, we had an excellent second quarter with core earnings of $61 million and a margin of 6.7%. The total loss ratio improved this quarter by 2.4 points versus prior year, with favorable results in both group life and disability.","In second quarter 2016, we experienced some volatility in our group life results, with higher than normal severity. Results in 2017 have been better than expected, with improved group life results and favorable incidence and recovery trends in group disability.","The improvement in both lines can be attributed to our ongoing execution in underwriting, pricing and claims management, as well as favorable trends relative to historical experience. We continue to expect the long-term core earnings margin of this business to be in the 6% range.","On the top line, second quarter fully insured ongoing premiums increased 2%. Overall, book persistency on our employer group block of business remains strong at approximately 90% and fully insured ongoing sales were $67 million. Although, down from prior year, it was a solid sales quarter and we\u2019re well-positioned for a strong second-half of the year.","In summary, our Property & Casualty and Group Benefit businesses delivered excellent second quarter results. Now halfway through the year, I\u2019m extremely pleased with the consistent execution of our team and the performance of our businesses. We\u2019re maintaining our disciplined and balanced approach to deliver profitable growth.","Let me now turn the call over to Beth.","Beth Bombara","Thank you, Doug. I\u2019m going to cover our other segments, investment performance and capital management activities before taking your questions. Our P&C other segments had core earnings of $18 million compared with a loss of $154 million last year, which included $174 million of adverse development on asbestos and environmental reserves.","As a reminder in the past, our annual A&E study was completed in the second quarter. After the purchase of the A&E reinsurance cover from National Indemnity last year, we moved this annual study to the fourth quarter, so there is no impact from A&E in this quarter\u2019s results.","Turning to mutual funds. Strong net flows and market appreciation as well as the addition of the Schroders funds drove total segment AUM up 18% to $107.7 billion and core earnings up 20% to $24 million.","We continue to benefit from strong investment performance with 77% of our funds beating their peers on a five-year basis. Sales of $6.2 billion generated positive net flows of $1.3 billion in the quarter. Through the first-half of 2017, net inflows of $2.6 billion are up significantly, compared with net outflows of $600 million in the first-half of 2016.","Talcott\u2019s core earnings were $80 million, down from $91 million in the second quarter of 2016. Over the past four quarters, VA contract counts decreased 10% and fixed annuity contracts decreased 6%. Talcott\u2019s statutory surplus was $4.3 billion at quarter-end. We expect Talcott to pay $300 million dividend to the holding company in the third quarter for a total of $600 million in 2017.","In the Corporate segment, we had core losses of $52 million compared with core losses of $50 million in the prior year. Operating expenses in the second quarter of last year benefited from the reversal of a legal accrual, which masked the benefit over the past year of the decline in interest expense, resulting from the reduction in debt.","On an all in basis, the Corporate segment had a net loss of $540 million, reflecting a pension settlement charge of $488 million after-tax, or $1.31 per diluted share, due to transfer of approximately $1.6 billion, or 29% of our U.S. defined benefit pension obligation to Prudential.","As a reminder, the pension charge includes $344 million loss that was previously included in AOCI. So while the charge to net income was $1.31 per diluted share, the impact of book value per share was lower at $0.39 The investment portfolio continues to perform well with generally stable portfolio yields, strong LP returns and modest impairments.","Total LP investment income was $48 million before tax for annualized yield of 8% compared with $40 million, or 6.1% in the second quarter of 2016. Excluding LPs, the total before tax annualized yield was 4.05% this quarter compared to 4.14% in second quarter 2016.","To conclude on earnings, second quarter core earnings per diluted share were $1.04, up significantly from $0.31 in second quarter 2016, which included a $0.44 per share charge for A&E. Excluding that charge, core earnings per share were up almost 40%, which includes the effect of the 7% reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding. The improvement in core earnings was primarily driven by better personal lines results, along with higher core earnings from each of the other segments with the exception of Talcott.","Our core earnings ROE for the past 12 months was 9.3%, up 1.9 points from a year ago and our core earnings ROE excluding Talcott was 11.3%. P&C core earnings ROE was 13.1%, a very strong result despite personal lines results being below our long-term target, while group benefits was 11.2%.","Turning to shareholders equity, book value per diluted share was $46.84, down slightly from a year ago. Excluding AOCI, book value per diluted share was up 2% since June 30th, 2016.","Before taking questions I wanted to provide a quick update on capital management. During the quarter we repurchased $325 million of stock and through July 25th we purchased about 1.6 million shares for $85 million for third quarter to-date. This leaves approximately $565 million available under the $1.3 billion equity repurchase authorization for 2017.","To conclude, this quarter\u2019s results demonstrate continued strong and steady operating results with consistent and disciplined execution in competitive markets. We are pleased with the continued progress in personal auto where our results are clearly improving and commercial lines, group benefits, and mutual fund results remained strong, supported by top line growth.","I will now turn the call over to Sabra, so we can begin the Q&A session.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you Beth. Just a reminder that we have about 30 minutes for Q&A, if you have to drop off or if we run out of time before we get your question, please email or call the investor relations team and we will follow up with you as soon as possible today. Heidi, could you please repeat the Q&A instructions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Kai Pan","Thank you and good morning. First question is on the personal auto, it looks like you are making a big progress in the turnaround. I just wonder if you\u2019re looking already further, what\u2019s your profitability long-term target and how quickly can you get there?","Doug Elliot","Thanks Kai, this is Doug. As we\u2019ve described in prior calls, our goal in the auto line is to achieve a 96.5 ex-ex auto target, so that is our goal. It isn\u2019t quite at our longer-term profitability targets, but it is certainly our near-term focus and we intend to do everything we can to get there by the end of 2018.","Kai Pan","Okay and then the \u2013 sort of like the second half higher, so in order to achieve this year\u2019s target, second half must be higher than the first half in terms of personal auto, the whole combined ratio. I just wonder, you mentioned about a higher seasonality, how much that\u2019s contributing to it or how much \u2013 do you have any plan to increase the expense ratio as you try to grow your business again?","Doug Elliot","Kai, let me try to take each of the piece little bit separate, so traditionally seasonality has impacted our auto and homeowners loss ratios, but certainly we\u2019re talking about auto now. Fourth quarter has been our most challenging weather auto quarter and we expect the second half of 2017 to be in line with prior years. So that\u2019s why the numbers are working as they do and as you see our full year guidance, you know and you can back into what the second half of the year will look like.","On \u2013 I think I\u2019ll leave it at that. Beth, is there anything you want to add to that?","Beth Bombara","No, I\u2019ll just follow up with the comment on the expense ratio. I mean, yes if we do increase as our plan is, our marketing spend in the second half, we would expect to see some uptick in that expense ratio, but again that was contemplated overall when we provided our guidance at the beginning of the year. So as Doug said, overall we see things performing very consistently with our expectations.","Doug Elliot","And Kai, just in closing, we expect this year on a loss ratio basis in personal auto. We\u2019re expecting two to three points of improvement, so we\u2019re having back to offset, first half of the year was right in line with that and as we play out the second half, we expect to achieve those targets.","Kai Pan","That\u2019s great. Last one if I may, there is a lot of talk in the marketplace about digital small business insurance, you guys are market leader there, I just wonder how do you position yourself both your internal initiatives, as well if you are looking out if there is other opportunity through acquisitions?","Christopher Swift","Kai, it\u2019s Chris. What I would say is, there is a lot of activity in the fintech space in general. If I understood your question with money and activity and obviously we\u2019re very proud of our leadership in the small commercial space in general. We participate in those activities through our venture group whether it be finding partnerships, doing experiments, allocating capital, the startups, so we have all types of activities in that space.","And I said in my prepared comments, we are going to continue to be a leader in this space as things continue to change. So, a lot of our investment dollars are targeted towards a more of a digital business model. And if you think of some of the M&A activity that\u2019s occurring in the space and particular that what we did a little over a year ago acquiring Maxim, Maxim was specifically targeted to a small commercial end of the market, so with our technology, with E&S capabilities with enhancing digital experiences, I feel good about the path that we are on.","Doug Elliot","Kai, I guess the only thing I would add is that, there has been a awful lot of discussion about not only disruption, but clearly the frontend sales quoting and changes that may occur there. I\u2019d also remind you that in addition to those skills required, you know there is still an awful lot behind that is important to the equation, so having world-class server centers, having a terrific claim operation, having dynamic sales professionals, right; having the data and analytics and the science behind the engines, so we\u2019re working on all facets of our small commercial operations. We do see change coming, we see it probably quicker today than we did a year ago, we\u2019re being responsive to that change and we are working hard to take advantage of it as it comes.","Kai Pan","Thank you so much for all of the answers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Joshua Shanker","Good morning everyone. Two questions, hopefully quick ones, can we talk about the cash tax rate as opposed to the GAAP tax rate for this quarter and what the outlook is for that?","Beth Bombara","Sure. So from a cash tax rate, when you are thinking about our earnings, keep in mind that we obviously do benefit from the utilization of net operating losses, but given the amount of preference items that we have, both from a dividends received deduction and the tax exempt interest on municipal bonds, we do find ourselves in a position of paying AMT tax, so actually from a cash tax perspective, if you are looking at our GAAP earnings, we\u2019re probably paying a rate in cash that\u2019s a little bit higher than the statutory rate.","Joshua Shanker","And do you expect that to persist for the next 12 months or so?","Beth Bombara","Yes, as we look at our forecast going forward and again continuing to utilize net operating losses, but continuing to see ourselves in an AMT position, yes that situation would continue.","Joshua Shanker","And looking over the statistical supplement on Page 18, you gave some disclosures about rate increases both for auto and home, obviously the problems have been in auto, but it looks like you are very much seeking rate increases in home as well? And also seems that the GAAP between the written price increases and the earned price increases isn\u2019t very different. I\u2019m trying to think about going out into the coming year, shouldn\u2019t there be a earned lag on all of the work that you\u2019ve done that should accelerate through the year or we\u2019re already kind of at the full earn through of the amount of work you\u2019ve doing.","Doug Elliot","Let me work each side of the question, so the first piece is that, we\u2019re working equally as hard on homeowners and actually if you extend that over the past three to four we\u2019ve been working diligently at homeowners for a multi-years dealing with cat zones and deductibles etcetera, so that\u2019s the reason why you see the homeowners pricing as is.","On the automobile side, on a written basis, I would suggest that as we look out we expect to continue see at least over the next couple of quarters more quarters in the pricing realm written like you\u2019re seeing in June that\u2019s second quarter. The earned pricing is starting to catch up, so as I think about the last four quarters, we\u2019ve moved on an earned auto basis from 6 to 7 to 8 to 9 and that will approach 10 as we move into the third quarter. So, yes, it\u2019s catching up, and at some point if there is a deceleration in our auto written, because our rate adequacy improves. There will be a point where an earned is greater than written, but that\u2019s all math, right, and we\u2019ll see that as it comes.","Joshua Shanker","Okay. Well, thank you and good luck.","Christopher Swift","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Thomas Gallagher","Good morning. First question, Chris, just with all the recent news articles on Talcott, just a quick question on that. How should we think about you holding out for the best possible value in a potential sale versus the strategic flexibility that a sale will give you if you sell sooner versus later even if it\u2019s at a bit of a discount, what you view is intrinsic? So just wanted to get an update on just overall view on that?","Christopher Swift","Thank you. You\u2019re going to be disappointed. I really just feel at this point just speculation on a transaction that the whole theory behind holding, selling just is not helpful at this point in time. I think, we\u2019ve been pretty consistent on saying that, we\u2019ve run Talcott off over the last five years. We\u2019re pretty comfortable continuing to do that. But at some point in time, we\u2019re not the natural owner of it going forward.","So why don\u2019t we just leave it as that that Talcott is contributing the way it is. And if anything is done, it will always be based on an economic, conclusion for shareholders. And I think we\u2019ve been pretty consistent in our approach over the last five years as we\u2019ve restructured the operation. But beyond that, Tom, it\u2019s just \u2013 now is not the appropriate time to comment.","Thomas Gallagher","I had to give it a shot. The \u2013 just a question for Doug. Just curious how you\u2019re feeling about workers\u2019 comp results, and any signs of claims inflation coming through yet, or still pretty favorable performance there?","Doug Elliot","Tom, we\u2019re feeling very good about our workers\u2019 comp book of business, both Small Commercial, which workers\u2019 comps are a big part of our profile and also Middle Market and National Accounts Casualty. So our trends very consistent frequency severity, medical severity, et cetera. So in general, all the signs inside the book are in very good shape. It\u2019s also causing a bit of competition in the marketplace. I think people are seeing good numbers on the worker\u2019s comp side.","So competing effectively like where we are if we have a strong value prop in the comp marketplace continue to do so, but also drawing some lines, particularly in Middle Market where we see at times some very aggressive behavior. We\u2019re trying to make good economic choices and I like where we are with our comp decisions.","Thomas Gallagher","Okay. Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Please go ahead.","Brian Meredith","Yes, thanks. Two questions. First, Beth, I\u2019m just curious, I think, originally in your plans, you\u2019re planning on taking $500 million to $600, million of dividends out of Talcott this year. I know you did the \u2013 I believe 250 in the first quarter. Have you applied for the dividends, or taken the dividend yet for the second-half of the year?","Beth Bombara","Yes, Brian, so we planned for $600 million of dividends from Talcott this year, we took $300 million in January. And then, as I said, we anticipate taking $300 million this quarter, so sometime in August or September.","Brian Meredith","August\/September. So have you applied for it? I\u2019m just curious.","Beth Bombara","Yes. So typically, when we apply for a dividend, it comes out very shortly thereafter. So now we have not put an application in yet. But again, we anticipate doing that sometime in August or September.","Brian Meredith","Great. Thanks. And then, Doug, I\u2019m just curious looking at your Commercial Lines, what\u2019s going on with the renewal written pricing, it kind of picking up a little bit here. How far away are we from that kind of matching loss trend and maybe seeing some stabilization in the underlying combined ratios \u2013 loss ratios there?","Doug Elliot","Good question, Brian. Number one, I\u2019d say, we\u2019re pleased with our overall pricing in second quarter, just up slightly from first quarter. So in aggregate sense, pleased with the stability there. I think everybody knows though that auto is a driver. So we\u2019re pleased our progress in auto.","My focus is in the casualty lines and what\u2019s happening in property. And there we\u2019re \u2013 I\u2019d like to see a little more rate. I think over time, as carriers look at their actual results, we will see adjustments. But over the next couple of quarters, I\u2019m not sure, I see anything in the near-term that says the quarters are going to behave differently.","Our Small Commercial results, as we share with you in our supplement, good pricing in Small Commercial, it\u2019s middle, where there\u2019s an awful lot of competition. And so our new business is down and I think there\u2019s a direct correlation between us deciding to walk away and just not seeing enough economic activity that makes sense for us. We\u2019ll gauge that and share with you as we go through the next couple of quarters what the results look like.","Brian Meredith","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Jay Cohen","Yes, couple of questions. First, on the personal auto side, you talked about frequency and severity seemingly reverting back to a more normalized trend. I\u2019m wondering how much of that is due to the actions you\u2019ve taken? How much of it is due to just the normal variability in overall trends?","Doug Elliot","Jay, very difficult to understand and be able to determine. But I would say this. We watch the fast track signals carefully. They are a quarter in arrears and you can get the data. So we always match our statistics against fast track, and so we\u2019ve looked at first quarter. I do believe, though, that the actions we\u2019ve taken over the past 18 months are clearly driving some of the positive change we see in our book of business.","So \u2013 and as you look at the overall signals in the marketplace through fast track, you still see some bodily injury pressure that hasn\u2019t totally gone away, it\u2019s still there. We feel it in Commercial and we still see a bit of it in Personal Lines. But in general, I feel like the work we\u2019re doing across our class plans and through our agency plans are having a very positive impact on our Personal Line results and we continue to play this story out.","Jay Cohen","Thanks, Doug. The other question on Talcott. If there were going to be a disposition, let\u2019s say for a minute, that it\u2019s below gap book value. What are the tax implications for the company for disposing of it at that price?","Beth Bombara","So, jay, it\u2019s Beth. I mean, so first of all, it gets a little complicated talking about tax impacts on hypothetical transactions. The one thing that I will point out when you think about that is that, the tax basis of Talcott is lower than the GAAP basis. So the tax basis is probably more in line with the statutory book values. I don\u2019t know if that helps you in your thinking, but again, tax and tax impacts are always really based on actual terms and \u2013 of a transaction, so it\u2019s kind of hard to comment hypothetically.","Jay Cohen","Yes, and I appreciate the complexity, but that that comment is definitely helpful. Thanks, Beth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Please go ahead.","Meyer Shields","Thanks. Good morning. Doug, couple of questions on auto, if we can dig into that. So you talked about increasing marketing spend in the back-half of the year and the timing for subsequent growth. Can you give us a sense based on your intention of how much of a loss ratio impact there is as new business starts to pick up?","Doug Elliot","Meyer, that\u2019s a good question. I\u2019m trying to figure out how I want to answer that. I don\u2019t think I want to give you a number. I mean, in general, we\u2019ve got indicators across all our lines of business and in terms of what we expect, given levels of new business. Given our class plan, I would say this. Our signals offer our new business in 2017 are showing that it might be the best new business year from a quality and a loss ratio performance we\u2019ve had in many years.","And so as I look at the frequencies and our new what we\u2019re putting on the books today, I look at our class plan work, et cetera. I\u2019m very encouraged by the early signs of this year. So, our new business penalty and what we\u2019re putting on the books could be rather minor. I want to go out on a limb, it\u2019s early. The year hasn\u2019t played out and we obviously want to pick up our pace with growth and we\u2019re targeted around our AARP Direct customer segment.","But at the moment, I\u2019m not worried about that. I\u2019m feeling very comfortable with the progress we\u2019ve made, I think, we\u2019re going to have good pricing at adequate terms to be competitive in the marketplace long-term.","Meyer Shields","Okay, that\u2019s actually helpful. And on the Commercial side, I guess, I\u2019m a little surprised that we\u2019re still seeing year-over-year deterioration, because I thought that commercial auto rate increases were already earning their way in. Was that a weather-related issue, or it was my timing loss?","Doug Elliot","It was a little bit more, particularly to Small Commercial. So our Middle Market book has really been written under \u2013 underwritten over the past three to four years and pretty good shape. It\u2019s just been a matter of trying to keep up with loss trend, which we\u2019ve been trying to do with pricing in Middle Market. In the Small end, we had a little bit of pressure over the past three quarters. And so we have leaned into not only pricing, but also some underwriting actions. We\u2019ve triggered a bit more referral activity to our underwriters to look at a series of actions in our small commercial book.","The business is down slightly. It\u2019s causing a little bit of a overhang on our overall growth, probably a point on our overall Small Commercial growth. But I think it\u2019s necessary that line is now starting to behave better or combines or improving. And over the next several quarters, we\u2019ll be in better shape in Small Commercial auto.","Meyer Shields","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jay Gelb","Thanks very much. First question I had was on the Prudential or the pension risk transfer deal that Hartford have with Prudential. Is there a benefit to ongoing earnings there?","Beth Bombara","Thanks, Jay. So first of all, we were very pleased to enter into that transaction, reduced our pension liability. From a GAAP earnings perspective, I would say, in the short-term, it\u2019s probably a little bit of a negative just given the nuances of pension accounting. Again, over the long-term in a volatility that comes from changes in assumption and so forth. We see this as a very favorable transaction for us.","Jay Gelb","Okay. And then on the rating agency debt-to-capital, it was 25.6% in the second quarter, but that includes the pension liability. So if we adjust for the pension risk transfer deal, what would the rating agency debt-to-capital be?","Beth Bombara","So again, the transactions settled as of June 30. So it does take that into consideration what we\u2019ve disclosed in the financial supplement. I will remind you that we are right now we did issue the Glen Meadow hybrid in February and that was from about \u2013 that was $500 million, which is there to prefund June 2018 security that we intend to repay. So again, adjusting for that, we would expect that our debt-to-cap ratio would come down.","Jay Gelb","Okay. Thank you. And then, Chris, on Small Commercial, we\u2019ve seen a lot of clear interest from generally new competitors in terms of getting in the space, both on agency and direct basis. Hartford is obviously a major player in Small Commercial. Can you tell us about what Hartford is doing to make sure it defends its competitive position?","Christopher Swift","Sure, Jay. I mean, I would say that again the amount of new business we write the volume of our book already speak to the results of investing in this business significantly over really the last 30 years. So you don\u2019t have 1.1 million customers. You don\u2019t have $3.5 billion, $4 billion of premium by accident.","And as Doug said, whether it be service centers, whether it be digital experiences, whether it be self-service capabilities. I mean, we\u2019re in the midst of, I\u2019ll call it, the next wave of digital tools that we\u2019re rolling out. I would also say, as Doug mentioned, I mean, there will be always the need for advice in, I think, risk products. No matter what size of a Small Commercial you want to define from the smallest to the largest and it\u2019s incumbent upon carriers and our distribution partners to figure out the best way to get those customers advice.","So \u2013 but the whole \u2013 all aspects of the business model are important from a customer experience side. It\u2019s not just acquiring customers. It\u2019s servicing, its billing, ease of audit. And more importantly, in the moment of truth, when there is a claim, I mean, you have to have a an experience that engenders customers that want to renew with you into the next period. So we\u2019re focused on all parts of the value chain and keep it at a high level, Jay, you would not expect us to give any secret sauce out on the call here today.","Jay Gelb","Of course. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Ryan Tunis","Hey, thanks. I had a couple for Doug and I think at least one for Beth. But I guess for Doug, just thinking about what\u2019s going on a commercial auto. How we\u2019re feeling about the peaks from the prior years, because we had a comment again this quarter that it was laying on the accident year results. But there was no additional strengthening. So I\u2019m just curious how \u2013 what you\u2019re seeing is informing, I guess, the past accident years, because that was a positive surprise, I thought that there was no additional unfavorable?","Doug Elliot","Ryan, we do feel very good about our balance sheet. And we felt, as we closed 2016, we took the actions that were appropriate, given everything we saw on all of our lines, including commercial auto. Again, one of the biggest challenges in every year as you start out is to anticipate loss trend, and I understand what you think your pricing will be. And so I think about our 2017 accident year.","We just tweaked auto a little bit in our national casualty excess book and also in Small Commercial. But I think not far from where we were. And as you know, in our Small Commercial space, auto was our smallest line. It\u2019s essentially 10% of the book, so I just want to get that back closer to where it should be on profitability. But it\u2019s not causing major moments to step back and think otherwise.","Ryan Tunis","Got it. And I didn\u2019t want to read too much into this, but I did see that policy count retention in Small Commercial dipped a little bit this quarter. And I was just curious what was driving that?","Doug Elliot","Ryan, what market did you?","Ryan Tunis","Small Commercial, the policy count number?","Doug Elliot","Yes, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything major there. We\u2019re competing well. We had a good new business quarter. Again, we\u2019re working price in our small segment not only in auto, but other lines. Competitive worker\u2019s comp space, but nothing that is out of the ordinary.","Ryan Tunis","Okay.","Christopher Swift","Yes, Ryan, I would just say, again statistically, Doug is right, but the inference is, we\u2019ve been aggressive with commercial auto rate in middle and small and there might be a knock-on effect for other lines, as it relates to commercial auto. But Doug\u2019s larger point and maybe it was nuance. I mean, the marketplace in general, particularly in Middle is still highly competitive. So as Doug said, we try to anticipate and provided obviously some indicators of where we saw margins going.","So halfway through the year, I feel like we made the right call six months ago as far as price pressure. If you think about long-term loss cost trends that you have to price for and reserve for or we are where we are. But equally, it\u2019s also in a pretty good shape too. You continue to grind out all the activities that you have available to you to manage margins. But the simple pressure of price in lost cost trends in Middle is not a surprising results, where margins are going to be under pressure for the coming quarters.","Ryan Tunis","Yes, that makes sense. And then I guess, just for Beth, from a capital return standpoint kind of looking forward. So I guess, statutory net income has been pretty good so far this year. But on top of that, I think, the pension deal, I think you has said that is going to be $300 million of year-end contributions. I mean, how should we think about, I guess, kind of the outlook for capital return as that sort of starts to take shape for 2018? Thanks.","Beth Bombara","Yes. So, obviously, we\u2019re going to continue on our current path for this year as it relates to the capital actions that we have underway. The \u2013 I would not guide you to think that the pension contribution that we have would significantly alter sort of our plans as we think about capital actions in the future. And as we think about capital return from the operating subsidiaries, to the extent that operating income and it continues to perform well.","We\u2019ll evaluate all that as we think about what capital we can take out of the subsidiaries next year. But very pleased that we\u2019re seeing improvement there. So if I look at P&C last year, we anticipated taking $800 million out in dividend this year. We\u2019re on track to take out $850 million and we\u2019ll evaluate next year based on our projections of what we think the capital return can be from there.","Ryan Tunis","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for the answers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, good morning. A few questions. First on auto. Just trying to tie together some of the comments. At the start of the Q&A, you mentioned that the goal there is 96.5 on an underlying basis. I know you guys said that you would get to around 100 to 102 this year. So I\u2019m just trying to think together how you see and I know that the year-end 2018 target. But how you see that level of improvement in 2018. I know there\u2019s still some level of rate, but it seems like you guys are also going to push on advertising side and potentially go after some new business, we\u2019re just trying to tie together those comments?","Doug Elliot","Good question Elyse, no question that there are a series of compounding positive features that roll into the 2018 year and beyond. So the rate discussion that we\u2019ve had previously and also the underwriting initiatives will continue to earn their way through the second half of this year and then into 2018. So the 96.5 is the XX underlying, I still think it\u2019s achievable, we\u2019re working at it and I don\u2019t, at the moment, think that we\u2019re going to be putting on so much new business that will get in the way of achieving that target, so we\u2019re mindful of the target, our lean back into new business will be geographic driven, it will be territory where we have better rate adequacies and we feel better about our approach, so I would suggest you we\u2019re going to do it in a laser focused way that will not disrupt our path back to 96.5.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay great, and then what are you guys seeing as loss cost in commercial lines kind of broadly?","Doug Elliot","Generally speaking, they are low-to-mid single digits in the aggregate right, we look across our lines, worker\u2019s comp I described before, frequencies are flat to slightly down a little bit, severities depending upon medical or wage are single digits. There is a debate to be had about general liability because it takes a while to really understand what the accident year loss trends will be, but our view is that they are mid single digit-ish, properties got lower single digits attached, so in general we see a pretty stable loss cost environment, but also one that isn\u2019t stacked on zeros right and we think about the non-worker\u2019s comp. lines. We expect the other lines to have some degree of small loss cost inflation that we\u2019re trying to deal with in our pricing.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay great, and then Beth, I know in the outlook for the year, you guys were looking for a little bit of a decline in your P&T investment income excluding limited partnerships, it\u2019s about flat through the six months, was there something inflating that number or maybe you guys coming in a little bit above your target for the year?","Beth Bombara","Yes, so a couple of things. So, as we pointed out this quarter and the same with last quarter, we did have favorable partnership returns and in this situation both first quarter and second quarter, that was skewed a little bit more to property causality than to some of the other segments, so that\u2019s part of what was driving that. And then, we do continue to see some non routine income, we talked about this in the past, we don\u2019t budget for that, but as companies tend or debt and so forth sometime we get a little bit of a pickup there, but overall I would say the rate that we\u2019re \u2013 the yield that we are earnings is consistent with our outlook.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Dwelle from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mark Dwelle","Good morning, just a small quick numbers kind of question. You commented that you do in your A&E reserve in the fourth quarter this year, how many dollars of reserves are still left that are sort of subject to that review, I would assume it\u2019s mostly E not A that\u2019s left to be reviewed?","Beth Bombara","No, actually and we have extensive disclosure in our 10-Qs on the various balances related to A&E, but actually more of our reserves are A then E. And again as said, we will be looking to do that evaluation in the fourth quarter, but I\u2019ll just give you the page number, if you go to Page 100 \u2013 Page 84 in our 10-Q, you can see the breakout of both Asbestos and Environmental Reserves and at the end of June on a net basis asbestos was $1.288 million and environmental was $259 million.","Mark Dwelle","Okay, thank you, that\u2019s all.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman from Balyasny. Please go ahead.","Ian Gutterman","Great thank you. Doug, I first wanted to follow-up on Lisa\u2019s question there on the auto target for next year. Is it reasonable to assume that on a written basis that based on what you\u2019ve put through so far and assuming no change in the loss trends you see in the first half of the year that you shouldn\u2019t have much trouble getting to that 96.5 on our earned or is this still pricing you need to get from here or something else you need to execute from here to get there?","Doug Elliot","You act like it\u2019s so easy to get there, Ian, right? It\u2019s still.","Ian Gutterman","I said, if \u2013 actually, if loss trends are stable, I\u2019m taking that one out of the equation for you.","Doug Elliot","All right. So that\u2019s a good one to take out, right? So we are obviously assuming a baseline of loss trends. Secondly, much of the activity, the hard work has already happened, right? So we\u2019ve got to earn in the written activity that we now are sharing with you, you can see it through the second quarter. And obviously, there\u2019s still a lot of work state by state to make happen. We\u2019ve got rate change activity in the third quarter and fourth quarter.","But when we see through the plan, we\u2019re executing as we expected to, this goes back nine months ago when we built that plan. And if things continue to execute like we think they will, that chart \u2013 that target is very achievable. But I wouldn\u2019t say without sweat, right? We\u2019re working our tails off to get 96.5, I feel good about that, but if this were a baseball game, we\u2019re not bringing the relievers in yet, right? This is still in the middle of the game.","Ian Gutterman","I understand \u2013 understood. And again just given the impact of written versus earned, I assume that would suggest there should be some further improvement into 2019 even if I won\u2019t ask for a number?","Doug Elliot","Yes. Let\u2019s not ask for a number in 2019, yet.","Ian Gutterman","Okay.","Doug Elliot","We will\u2026","Ian Gutterman","Directionally, yes, okay.","Doug Elliot","Yes, it all depends on how quickly we get there and when we do arrive. I mean, our rate adequacies in our business plans are all built dynamically as the next 12 and 18 months kind of play out. So pleased with progress, another six months of progress would close up a very nice turn year for us in 2017, which we expect to happen, and then 2018 is a big year to move closer to the target.","Ian Gutterman","Got it. And then, Beth, I saw in the slides on Talcott, there was mention of the surplus growing from favorable changes in admitted DTA, can you explain what that means and how much it was?","Beth Bombara","Yes. So in the quarter, we benefited a little bit less than $50 million from being able to admit more DTA than we could in the previous quarter. It\u2019s really just based on math of just what the rules are relative to what year admitted tax asset can be.","We do see that bounce around often and we like to point that out just, because as we\u2019ve talked about before. When we think about surplus generation in Talcott, movement of DTAs from admitted \u2013 from non-admitted to admitted, we don\u2019t really think of that as generating potential for future dividends.","Ian Gutterman","Got it, got it. And then sort of semi-related on DTA Talcott. Obviously, the legislation that allows you to change the entities. Can you talk a little bit about how much impact that could have on DTA going forward? I assume that allows you to manage that better?","Beth Bombara","So that\u2019s a pretty complicated question on me. And so it kind of would depend on, again, how one might use division. So I don\u2019t think I can really give you an easy answer that that would or wouldn\u2019t impact how we utilize DTAs. It\u2019s really going to be based on anything on taxes, it\u2019s going to be based on facts and circumstances.","Ian Gutterman","Make sense. All right. Thank you.","Christopher Swift","Thank you, Ian.","Operator","And there are no further questions in the queue. I turn the call back over to the presenters.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you, Heidi, and thank you all for joining us today and your interest in the Hartford. If you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to follow-up with Investor Relations team. Thank you for your interest, and we wish you all a good weekend. Goodbye.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."],"11037":["Hartford Financial Services Group Inc.

Replays of this webcast and an official transcript will be available on The Hartford's Web site for at least one year.","I'll now turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Swift","Good morning. And thank you for joining us today. Our results this quarter were excellent with solid underwriting and investment performance. Higher pretax results were the primary driver of earnings growth with the added benefit of lower tax rates. Core earnings per diluted share of $1.27 were up 67% over first quarter 2017 and up in each of our four major businesses.","In P&C, underlying combined ratio was improved for both commercial lines and personal lines with better auto results in each segment. In addition, lower catastrophe losses and favorable prior year development contributed to higher underwriting results. All of our markets remain competitive. But that said, we are confident in our ability to execute and grow in this environment. In commercial lines, the pricing trend is mostly positive and we achieved higher rates in property and liability lines. However, Workers\u2019 compensation renewal premium rates are generally flat to slightly down, reflecting the favorable loss experienced of the last several years. Doug will provide more insights into pricing trends.","Group Benefits core earnings more than doubled to $85 million this quarter, driven by improved disability results, earnings on the acquired business and lower taxes, offset by higher mortality on the life business. In addition, first quarter of 2017 had a guarantee fund assessment for Penn Treaty. Disability trends continues to improve but were offset somewhat by elevated mortality. We think this variation was within a normal range of mortality experienced, especially in the first quarter, which is historically more volatile.","Mutual Funds posted excellent growth in earnings and AUM with positive net flows and healthy market appreciation from a year ago. Net investment income was up 10%, mostly due to higher invested assets with virtually no net credit impairments. Limited Partnership returns were very strong this quarter. Lastly, we are hard at work on the integration of the Group Benefits acquisition and the separation of Talcott Resolution. Both of these major projects are proceeding as planned with dedicated multidisciplinary teams working collaboratively and on schedule. We expect Talcott sale to close by June 30th.","As a leading insurer of U.S. businesses and their employees, we benefited from increased employment in small business formations, particularly in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits over the last few years. We may see additional growth if the lower more competitive U.S. corporate tax structure increases GDP growth and employment.","With regard to the quarter, I am pleased with our top line growth in Commercial Lines. Small commercial new business grew 8% with momentum in both our Standard Commercial book and Maxum our E&S specialist. The top line was just shy of $1 billion of net written premium, putting $4 billion annual level within range, and up from $3.2 billion in 2014. We expect Small Commercial\u2019s growth to continue this year, including the impact of the recent renewal rights agreement with Foremost, which will take effect in July.","This book is comprised of small commercial business segments that we know well and underwrite profitably. Combined with our best in class technology, customer service and claims capabilities, this deal will generate an attractive return for us. Group Benefits\u2019 earned premium grew 66% this quarter from both the acquisition and strong new sales along with solid persistency. Our market presence across all customer segments has improved, particularly in national accounts, which we expect will help drive additional growth from expanded market opportunities.","Looking forward, investing in our company remains the cornerstone of our strategy. We want to achieve profitable organic growth, particularly where we have attractive margins and strong competitive advantages. This requires developing better data and analytical tools and expertise, including leveraging our new claim system which some of you have seen in action.","We also want to become an easier company to do business with. This requires investments, especially in technology. The technology initiatives currently underway include a new Commercial Lines policy administration system, which is a multiyear project. Another initiative is the integration of Aetna's disability claim system across the combined group benefits book. This integration, which is on schedule for completion by year-end, will give our customers market differentiating capabilities for absence management.","With customers expecting us to provide digital service and capabilities similar to what they experienced at other companies, like Amazon, we must continue to build better digital interfaces for agents and policyholders. These investments will create faster turnaround times, reduce costs, improve ease-of-use and increase efficiency and customer service satisfaction. For instance, our automated certificate of insurance capability available 24x7 has dramatically decreased response times at a fraction of the cost from our prior process.","Finally, before turning the call over to Doug, I wanted to spend a few minutes on our capital management strategy and objectives. With our business is achieving returns well above our cost of capital, I want to be clear that we prefer to invest for profitable organic growth. However, we will not compromise our underwriting or pricing standards just to grow the top line. We will remain disciplined.","From a strategic perspective, we believe acquisitions can help build greater competitive advantages and accelerate earnings growth. The Aetna acquisition is an example of that, and we\u2019re really pleased with its performance. However, acquisitions are often expensive, especially in today's markets, and they have execution risks that need to be clearly understood. Currently, our primary focus is in the Commercial Lines space where we are building broader risk and underwriting expertise organically. We will consider financially accretive acquisitions that accelerate these goals. And to-date the deals that we have done in commercial lines have been smaller bolt-on transactions.","As the specific areas of interest, we are particularly focused on specialty lines and industry verticals. There are, however, certain product lines or businesses, such as reinsurance, that we do not currently view a strategic. That should not imply we would never buy a company that has a minor or small reinsurance portfolio, but it does mean that the majority of the business would need to align with or complement our Commercial Lines strategies. And it has to meet our financial objectives, meaning that we expect an acquisition to deliver returns above our cost of equity capital in a reasonable period of time. We measure that return by future earnings power and capital efficiency, including expense savings, improved underwriting results, growth synergies, other benefits produced by the acquisition.","In addition to organic growth and acquisitions, capital management is an important tool for creating shareholder value. We have been and continue to evaluate the best use of deployable capital, including the anticipated proceeds from the Talcott sale. And we continue to weigh business opportunities against share repurchases and other capital management actions. Our goal, consistent with our track record of a balanced approach to capital management, is to optimize deployable capital for shareholder value creation while maintaining a strong balance sheet.","And as a fellow shareholder, I assure you that we will continue to be thoughtful and disciplined in our approach. We will not make hasty decisions and we do not feel rushed to make long-term impactful choices. Rather, we will be patient and thoughtful regarding these matters. To wrap up my comments, 2018 is off to a great start with solid financial results and opportunity to grow in each of our businesses. I am excited about the many initiatives underway, and I look forward to updating you on our progress.","Now, I will turn the call over to Doug.","Doug Elliot","Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. First quarter results for property and casualty and Group Benefits were excellent, with each of our business units executing effectively against their priorities. Commercial Lines posted a very strong quarter as markets remain competitive. In Personal Lines, auto margins continued to improve. And Group Benefits had an outstanding quarter of strong core earnings growth even after adjusting for the Penn Treaty guaranty fund assessment in first quarter 2017. All our businesses benefited this quarter from favorable net investment income results, and in P&C lower catastrophe losses versus prior year.","Let me provide some detail on our business unit performance. The Commercial Lines\u2019 first quarter combined ratio was 93.3, improving 2.7 points from 2017. The decrease was primarily due to underlying margin improvement in auto, the result of pricing and underwriting actions taken in recent years and a swing to favorable prior year development versus adverse development last year. The prior year development was primarily driven by Workers\u2019 Compensation where our loss trends have been favorable. Property and commercial auto also were slightly favorable.","The underlying combined ratio for commercial lines, which excludes catastrophes and prior year development, remains very solid at 90.4, improving 0.5 point from 2017. Market conditions showed some signs of price swing in the quarter, yet continue to remain competitive. I remain pleased with our execution on the front-line. Renewal written pricing in Standard Commercial Lines was 2.5% for the first quarter, down 30 basis points from last quarter, primarily driven by small commercial workers\u2019 compensation. Our margins on this book of business remain very healthy and renewal written pricing remains positive, giving us a strong foundation for competing in the marketplace.","In middle market, renewal pricing was very competitive in January, but February and March showed more positive signs with prices increasing in all major lines in the back half for the quarter. I expect further positive rate movement in the quarters ahead for property and GL and continued strong pricing for auto, the lines most in need of margin improvement. Our middle market business still needs more rate and I suspect that we are not unique in that regard. We believe the appropriate path is to continue pushing for rate increases, consistent with long-term loss cost trends and to maintain underwriting discipline even though retention has come under pressure.","Small commercial had an excellent first quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 87.5. Written premium grew 1% with $166 million of new business. This is our largest new business quarter in history, up 8% from last year. New business from the recently announced foremost renewal rights deal will begin in early third quarter and our team has been active in recent months working with agents to prepare for successful transition.","We're excited about expanding our relationship with many of our current agents, while adding new partners through this transaction. This opportunity leverages the power of our small commercial platform to grow top and bottom line through inorganic consolidation, complementing the organic growth success we've achieved in recent years.","Middle market delivered an underlying combined ratio of 92.2 for the first quarter, improving 1.6 points from 2017, mainly due to lower commission expense this quarter and slightly better margins in several lines. Written premium increased 4% based on solid retentions and strong new business production of the $141 million. The increase in written premium versus last year is coming primarily from our specialized practice teams, including our expanding construction and energy verticals.","Written premium in our traditional block of business was essentially flat to 2017, impacted by continued soft pricing and excess market capacity. In Specialty Commercial, the underlying commodity ratio of 97.5 was flat to 2017 as slight margin deterioration in financial products and national accounts was offset by lower commissions, driven by the mix of business. Written premium was down 2% for the quarter, largely due to a decrease in bond, which had a very strong first quarter of 2017.","Personal Lines continues to show progress with an underlying commodity ratio of 89.8 for the first quarter, improving 1.4 points from a year ago. In Personal Lines auto, the underlying combined ratio was 94.2, 2.4 points better than 2017. Loss cost trends remain within our expectations in the low single-digit range. I\u2019m increasingly positive about our improving financial performance in recent quarters.","Returning to written premium growth for Personal Lines remains a priority for us. Our higher expense ratio in the quarter reflects our increased marketing efforts and ARP direct auto. Early response rates have been strong, but our conversion ratios are not where they need to be for us to grow. We have a number of initiatives underway to lift our close rate, and I expect new business to increase over the course of 2018 as our price increases continue to moderate as well.","In Group Benefits, core earnings for the quarter were $85 million with a margin of 5.6%, driven by favorable disability results, the recently acquired book of business from Aetna and lower tax rates, offset by higher mortality in our life book of business. The lower disability loss ratio reflects better than expected incidents and recovery trends across multiple action years. This favorability was offset by higher life loss ratio.","There are two drivers here. The most significant factor accounting for approximately two thirds of the increase is the mix of the Group Life book toward larger accounts, resulting from the Aetna book of business. We expected these large accounts have a lower expense ratio and run a higher loss ratio consistent with our own historical national accounts experience. The second factor is slightly higher mortality this quarter across the entire life book. At the moment, we see this as normal volatility and we will monitor it carefully to ensure that we react appropriately if necessary.","Persistency on the combined employer group block of business was approximately 90%. Fully insured ongoing sales were very strong at $454 million. It was an excellent sales quarter across all market segments and product lines, with an especially strong start to the year in voluntary. As Chris shared, we\u2019re very pleased with the pace of our integration on the Aetna Group Life and disability business. Our go forward leadership team is in place. We are currently installing Aetna\u2019s disability claim platform on our infrastructure, and plans to begin converting business in early 2019 are on track.","On an annualized run rate basis, we\u2019ve achieved $60 million of the $100 million target for expense reductions consistent with our goals. A large portion of this comes from the corporate cost and IT finance and marketing. We have also solidified our line of sight to the balance of our target reductions in claim, product, underwriting and other business functions. All-in the integration has been very successful thus far. The teams have become one and we are executing effectively, both internally and in the marketplace.","In summary, we were off to a very solid start in first quarter 2018 across all our businesses. We remain focused, disciplined and balanced in our execution to deliver profitable growth. Let me now turn the call over to Beth.","Beth Bombara","Thank you, Doug, I am going to briefly cover first quarter results for the investment portfolio, mutual funds and corporate, and provide an update on the Talcott sale before taking your questions.","Core earnings for our P&C and Group Benefits businesses included continued excellent investment results both from an income and credit perspective. For the quarter, net investment income totaled $451 million, up 10% over the prior year quarter, primarily due to the fourth quarter 2017 Group Benefits acquisition, which added about $3.4 billion in invested asset to the portfolio. In addition, LP investment income was up $15 million with annualized returns of about 19% compared with 16% in first quarter 2017. As you may recall, our outlook for LP return is about 6%, reflecting a longer term view and the expectation that returns may moderate as the cycle progresses.","Excluding LPs, investment income was up 7% and the portfolio yield was 3.7%, down slightly from first quarter 2017 due to the impact of the Group Benefits acquisitions. As a reminder, the acquired investment portfolio was mark-to-mark on the date of the acquisition, reducing the portfolio yield and group benefits, excluding LPs, from 4.3% in third quarter 2017 to 3.8% in first quarter 2018. P&C investment yields, excluding LPs, were essentially flat over the last year averaging 3.7% in first quarter 2018, which is also consistent with reinvestment rates in the quarter. Looking forward, we expect to forecast yields over the balance of 2018 to be relatively consistent with 2017.","My final note on the investment portfolio is that credit performance remains strong with no net impairments in the quarter and only $8 million before tax over the last four quarters. The low level of impairments reflects an overall benign credit environment and the careful underwriting of our portfolio.","Turning to mutual funds, first quarter core earnings was $34 million, up almost 50% from last year due to combination of lower tax rate and higher investment management fees. Income before taxes was up 23%, reflecting 17% increase in investment management fees, driven by higher average assets under management. Investment performance remained strong with 68% of Hartford Fund beating their peers on a five year basis. Net flows totaled $678 million in the quarter, including particularly strong flows in exchange traded products, which totaled about $194 million this quarter compared with $22 million in the first quarter 2017.","Core losses for the corporate category totaled $66 million, up from $52 million in first quarter 2017 due to the impact of lower tax rates. The loss from continuing operations before income taxes in corporate was actually $10 million lower than last year, but the offsetting tax benefit was $21 million lower due to the reduction in tax rates.","During March, we completed two debt transactions, repaying $320 million of 6.3% senior notes and issuing $500 million of 30 year senior notes at a coupon of 4.4%. Looking forward, this June we will call at par $500 million of hybrids with a coupon of 8% and 18%. As a result of these transactions, interest expense will decrease by $2 million before tax sequentially in the second quarter and then decrease by an additional $8 million before tax per quarter beginning in the third quarter.","Taken together, these actions will reduce outstanding debt by about $320 million by the end of the second quarter and reduce our average coupon rate and total annual fixed charges. At March 31, 2018, our rating agency adjusted debt to capital ratio, which takes into the account pension liabilities, equity credit for hybrids and AOCI, was 29.9%, up from 28.8% at year end. The increase is primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates reducing AOCI. Total debt to capitalization, excluding AOCI, was essentially flat at 27.9% compared with 28% at year end. Through earnings and debt repayment overtime, we expect to reduce our rating agency debt to total capital to our target in the low to mid 20s.","In total, first quarter core earnings were $461 million, up $173 million from first quarter 2017. Core earnings benefits from higher P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds\u2019 pretax earnings, as well as the lower corporate tax rate. On a pretax basis, core earnings rose about 48% or $183 million, while income taxes only increased $10 million as the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations decreased from 24% in first quarter 2017 to about 18% in first quarter 2018. The core earnings ROE was 7.8% this quarter compared with 5.1% a year ago. Keep in mind that this is a trailing 12 month calculation not an annualized return for the quarter, so it includes the impact of high catastrophe losses in the last three quarters of 2017, as well as the higher corporate tax rates last year.","As we have stated previously, we expect the 2018 core earnings ROE to be in the 11% to 12% range. Book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, was $36.71, up 4% from December 31 2017 due to the impact of earnings less dividends. Book value per diluted share was $36.06, down 3% from December 31, 2017 as higher interest rates reduced AOCI. I know many will look at all in book value for P&C companies, so as a reminder, our March 31, 2018 shareholders equity includes $892 million of AOCI for assets that are part of Talcott. Therefore, we would expect June 30, 2018 book value per diluted share to be reduced by about $2.45 from March 31, 2018 upon the closing of the sale. As an update, the Talcott sales process remains on schedule to close by June 30th.","As part of the regulatory approval process, the Connecticut insurance commissioner has scheduled a hearing for May 17th after which the state has up to 30 days to issue a ruling. Aside from the regulatory approval, the work to separate Talcott is well underway. Under the terms of the sale, we will continue to provide certain transition services to Talcott for up to two years, and we have a five year contract to manage their investment portfolio. The fees and expenses for those services will be included in our corporate segment going forward. After expenses, we expect that the Talcott sale will generate net cash proceeds to the holding company of approximately $1.7 billion, including $300 million of pre-closing dividends. In addition, the holding company will retain total tax benefits of about $700 million, including NOLs and AMC credits.","To conclude, the first quarter was a good start to the year with underwriting and investment results remaining quite strong despite catastrophe losses higher than our outlook. While the capital markets have been more volatile recently, like most insurance companies, our investment income will benefit from a higher rate environment overtime so long as inflation trends are modest. In addition, equity market values remain high helping generate strong returns on our private equity limited partnership portfolio.","I will now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you, Beth. Before the operator Amy gives the Q&A instructions, I wanted to remind everyone of our upcoming Annual Shareholder Meeting on May 16th. Please remember to vote your proxies. Amy, could you please repeat the Q&A instructions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jay, your line is open.","Jay Cohen","As you think about M&A in the commercial business, I\u2019d love to get a sense of past deals, well, specifically Maxum. I guess that\u2019s around the larger ones you\u2019ve done, in the commercial business. Can you -- and it disappears within your organization. Can you give us a sense of the returns you\u2019ve been able to generate since you\u2019ve acquired that? And then secondly the smaller question, with Foremost, I think that premiums there were roughly $200 million. Any sense of how much you expect to keep on renewal?","Chris Swift","On both these, we will tack in between Doug and myself. On Foremost, it is about $200 million block of premiums, and a lot of it depends on the persistency and the rollover. I think we feel very good about signing up the agents and in their authorization, and more importantly data to easily quote this. So it\u2019s hard to predict. But I suspect we\u2019ll keep 75% of the overall book long-term. On Maxum, I would say that was relatively a small deal. And if you remember, it was approximately $200 million-ish we spent. We went through some level of restructuring and shutting down certain aspects of their business model, really to build the new small commercial E&S model, which we\u2019re very pleased with.","I think on earnings basis to think about it, we\u2019re making about $10 million to $15 million after tax in core earnings. We\u2019ve avoided some businesses that were unprofitable and we\u2019re really excited about the opportunity to integrate E&S into our quoting platform. Doug, what would you add?","Doug Elliot","So on the Foremost piece, Jay, mid-17s would include some shock loss from our normal run rate retention in small. So we\u2019re anticipating that. We won\u2019t -- we\u2019ll not run as strong as we run our normal retention, very excited about that. And as we talk about early third quarter just so you're all aware, we're quoting 90 days out in advance. So we're actually right now in market quoting July actively, but the premium won\u2019t hit the books for a couple months.","On the Maxum side, very strategic opportunity for us. We didn't have E&S talent in this organization, we didn't have relationships on the distribution side. And we clearly wanted to challenge ourselves with a product breadth opportunity in the small commercial and middle market arena. So just getting started many of you know that we now have expanded our product capability in small, including an E&S opportunity on our ICON quoting platform very excited about the early days but we\u2019ll be talking more about it over time. I think it bodes well and it has a bigger opportunity for us to be a broader deeper player in small commercial over time.","Operator","You next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian, your line is open.","Brian Meredith","I guess first quick one for Beth. Can you remind us what is the stranded cost from Talcott, how much that was in the quarter and how that is going to be running off here over the course of next 12 months to 18 months?","Beth Bombara","So when we think about cost and again stranded cost, we think about as costs that were allocated to Talcott overhead cost and obviously would not go with the transaction. And on an annualized basis, we see that in the $35 million to $40 million range, and that\u2019s pretty even across the quarters. And our expectation is over the next 12 months to 18 months, we\u2019ll see those costs reduce. Again, we will be providing some transition services to Talcott over that period as well and being reimbursed for some of those costs as they continue to use some of our infrastructure. So we\u2019ll have a slight offset to that but it\u2019s in that range.","Brian Meredith","And those are sitting in your corporate line item right now?","Beth Bombara","Yes, we have that [technical difficulty] and they\u2019re included in core earnings.","Brian Meredith","And then Chris, Doug, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more about just the competitive environment out there. What's happening with workers' comp insurance? Clearly, an areas that you're seeing some pressure on pricing. Is it worse than you\u2019d anticipated, is that at all questioning maybe where your underlying combined ratio guidance is for the year for the commercial space?","Chris Swift","Brian, I just quickly then get out of the way and let Doug share with you his thoughts. But as we sit here today, as I said in my comments, we got off to a terrific start and we feel really good about our ability to execute and in a competitive complex environment. So all the guidance that we\u2019ve provided or drivers, we still feel very good about. And in fact, if you saw in certain drivers, whether it\u2019d be combined ratio and personal lines or commercial lines, we\u2019re outperforming. But there will be a little bit of a reversion to the mean over the next nine months. But I\u2019m really pleased with the team, how we\u2019re standing up and new capabilities, new product sets and being disciplined while we\u2019re pushing for more business with our distribution partners. But Doug what would you add technically?","Doug Elliot","A few things start with very pleased with the way the first quarter pricing trends ended. So Brian, a bit disappointed in our January performance on pricing, made some adjustments, looked at our book harder and feel really good about progress we made in February and March. And I expect that progress to continue into the second quarter. Secondly, I would always ask you to continue to think about small commercial versus middle over our other markets, so different dynamics, different pricing issues across those and different mixes for us in those areas. And then obviously there is a workers\u2019 comp versus the non-workers\u2019 comp.","So we\u2019re pleased with our February-March pricing and see some lift in property, GL, continued in auto and I expect that to continue. I expect that to continue over the next three quarters, particularly as I shared in my script, in middle market we need right net book. Our non-specialty middle book needs more rate and we intend to go after and chase it and do the right things.","Relative to comp, our numbers across our markets but especially in small commercial and workers comp, are very good, very good. And they are also very good across industry in general. So this is leading to the pressure on your rates. It\u2019s leading to experience factors for insurers that are looking more favorable. And because of that, I think we have a more competitive marketplace. The other thing just in closing we are watching loss trends very carefully, and they have been consistently in a very good spot for an extended period with workers comp. Little bit of frequency uptick back to more zero range in last couple quarters.","And clearly, there are inflationary pressures around that we are watching medical carefully. So when I put them together, yes, I think there are some things that probably will cause some compression in workers\u2019 comp line. But relative to where we are, I feel like we are working our leverage being thoughtful about our territories and doing everything we can to understand the dynamics of the line and make good choices going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Kai, your line is open.","Kai Pan","My first question is on personal auto. You have made great improvements in the margin side. Is that increased spending to show your confidence you fill your margin at the targeted levels, you want to grow top line a little bit faster? And will that spending, not just you but also some of your peers, as well as the potential say mandate lead to reductions post the tax reform, actually your growth on the margin improvement you have made?","Chris Swift","We are feeling good about the progress we\u2019re making in personal lines auto. And yes, you see the impact of some of our leaning and on the marketing side, because our expense ratios are up in the quarter. So our loss improvement is greater than the aggregate, the sum total of the change in the line of auto. So feeling very good about that, still more work to be done, and we think we will improve our close ratios over the latter half of the year as our pricing moderates, because our rate adequacies are getting better and better by the month.","So we finished 2017 with roughly two-thirds of our book in a very solid position relative to rate adequacy. And as we move to the next four quarters, we\u2019ll complete that journey and are going to feel very good. So you\u2019ll see more moderate rated rates in our pricing profile with Personal Lines auto and as such, I expect our new business levels to grow accordingly.","Kai Pan","My second follow-up question, probably for Chris. Thank you so much, very clear on -- your capital management priorities. I just want to drill down a little more specific. With the closing of Talcott, is there some investor anxieties on potential large deal. Could you discuss under what circumstances you would use stock to do the acquisitions. What are some financial hurdles you will need for large deals versus small cash acquisitions?","Chris Swift","I hope we have enough time to talk through it. But what I would share with you is as I said in my commentary, capital management is important you know our priorities as far as organic growth, M&A and then returning the deployable capital to shareholders. But as it relates to M&A, I would share with you couple of themes that we've talked about in the past. We tend to think in terms of more bolt-on activities or extensions into adjacent markets. We talked about premium levels in the billion dollars, maybe even up to $2 billion of premium that a target we would have. We have a good team. We have models that watch market activity.","So I can tell you as we sit here today, we don't think about using stock in a transaction, because generally a lot of the things that we think about that could be actionable at some point in time in the future are probably less than the $4 billion range. So that tends to be our sweet spot. And as I said, we're patient about exploring opportunities. We\u2019re thoughtful about exploring opportunities. There is a lot of things that we see that -- just the numbers don't work the math can't work based on expectations of value. So all I could tell you is that we\u2019ll continue to be thoughtful and disciplined about deploying capital to create shareholder value.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse, your line is open.","Elyse Greenspan","My first question, there has been some headlines about the NCCI pushing for basically price cuts within comp following on tax reform. How does that factor into your pricing and margin outlook on your comp business for this year also and as you think into 2019?","Chris Swift","Elyse, as we shared last quarter, we largely see tax reform working its way through the P&L in \u201918. But over time we and others I'm sure are adjusting inside our pricing models for the new tax rates. And as such, as we go through filings, we\u2019ll appropriately make sure that we have the right tax rates in our filings as well. I look at the last three to four years of comp experience and I think of how favorable, basically the aggregate environment, has been for comp as a line. And I think that's the real fuel driving this loss cost trend that is dropping through these filings.","So we have worked and continue to work hard on our claim confidences, our underwriting profile, understanding our segments, et cetera. But I wouldn\u2019t sit here today and suggest to you that there isn\u2019t downward pressure on pricing and workers comp, there is. I would say to you that when I think about it relative to our markets, we have a bit more flexibility at the risk level in middle. And so based on the characteristics of the risk, there is a bit more underwriter judgment involved.","Clearly, our small commercial world is a bit more spot-rated. So there are a number of competing dynamics across, but the line in total had a good first quarter for us. We\u2019re watching our trends. But it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if there is some compression in the line over the next latter half for the year into '19.","Beth Bombara","And I think Doug the only thing I\u2019d add to that is you always start with the fact that overall we see workers compensation as a very profitable line for us. So even with some of that pressure, we\u2019re still very comfortable writing business in that line and growing in comp.","Elyse Greenspan","And my second question, Chris in terms of your M&A comments, very thorough. You did say that you guys would -- depending upon the duo and what it could bring to, you will be willing to take on a small amount potentially of reinsurance exposure. Just wanted to clarify that comment. Would that mean small amount in terms of the pro forma fitness when you think about Hartford after a deal or do you mean you would consider a deal of acquiring something and the property that you would acquire would only have a small amount to bring insurance?","Chris Swift","Elyse more of the latter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Josh, your line is open.","Josh Shanker","Two questions that are in-related, I promise no follow up. First, the 10-Q used some materially different language to talk about buyback compared to the 10-K. The 10-K from February said that the Hartford does not expect to offer rising equity repurchase plan in 2018. While the 10-Q filed yesterday nearly said the company does not have an equity purchase plan yet in 2018. Have you changed your stance on 2018 buyback, which of course I think you should do. And secondly, there is a press and investors have commented that you appear to have been interested in XL. I\u2019m not going to ask about that. But also buyer of XL told everyone a year earlier that they are only interested in smaller bolt-on deals and large transactions would surprise the market. How much flexibility are you giving yourself in regard deviating from your self-imposed rules around acquisitions?","Beth Bombara","I\u2019ll take the first question and then I\u2019ll leave the second question for Chris. But yes, the language that is in our 10-Q was an intentional change. And as Chris said, share repurchases can be an effective use of excess capital, sustain the fact that we do not have an authorization in place today, does lead open the possibility that we could have on authorization in place at some point in 2018.","Josh Shanker","And second part about rules and flexibility.","Chris Swift","I would say again here, as we sit here today, we are focusing on the bolt-on category. I can\u2019t predict what may or may not develop in the future. So as long as there is understanding about the strategic and the financial hurdles and discipline that we have with our shareholders, if we flex up in size in any way just know that we\u2019ll continue to have high bars for performance, high bars for our alignment on strategy. I can't for shadow a scenario right now where we would do something in that major transformational area. It\u2019s just there is not that much that's actionable.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Randy Binner with B. Riley FBR. Randy, your line is open.","Randy Binner","I wanted to ask about sales in the group, which were good and better than expected. And one of the risks of the integration with Aetna is losing shelf-space with distribution. So the question is how is that distribution, communication, and interaction process going? And is there a potential here for you not to have these premium lapse assumptions kick-in if sales continue to trend better than expected?","Chris Swift","Randy, let me just -- I'll ask Doug to add his color. Again, the strategic logic of putting is to benefit business together has never been stronger or more confirmed with our activities over the last four or five months, whether it\u2019d be feedback from distributors, whether it\u2019d be using their claim system, whether it\u2019d being creating a team that is really motivated to lead the market and create new opportunities to serve customers. I think we got great alignment around the organization.","I would also tell you that our distribution partners and what they share with us is that they have a high degree of confidence in our ability to integrate and continue to serve their existing customers. And Doug, I think you and I see that we're being shown a lot of new opportunities and maybe in the past a standalone Hartford would not have seen, but Randy that's my perspective. Doug, what would you share?","Doug Elliot","Super sales quarter for us, and I would first comment that both the Hartford and Aetna had very strong sales quarter. So on a standalone basis would have had a terrific start to the year, but also Aetna likewise, particularly in the phase of what they're going through last year, had a good sales quarter. So you put the two together and we really start 2018 strong. Secondly, our pipeline has never been stronger. So we are active in working on proposals now. Obviously, there is a lot of activity around the latter half of \u201918 effective and \u201919 deal date.","So Chris and I participate in many of them but our team upstairs is fully engaged; number one, on the sales side and new sales; and secondly, I think there was a piece of the end of your question about retention. So we're also working on our renewal strategy. And we were out in market with several renewal quotes on our 1119 national account jumbo deals as well. So we feel very good about it. I will be with the team in Colorado in a few weeks at EBLF engaging locally, I love what our sales and support teams are doing. We have lot of work in front of us but we feel really good about the last hundred days of progress.","Randy Binner","And so I guess my follow-up on those comments, I guess I would characterize them as new product. So does this new platform position you to introduce new and different products into the group market, maybe move more toward supplemental, is that something that this might enable?","Doug Elliot","There was a word at the end of one of my sentences in the script that I want to make sure, I highlight here. We\u2019re very pleased with our growing momentum in voluntary products. So we've worked hard to build out our voluntary suite and in 1119 had terrific success. And if you look in our stuff, you can you look at the other sales growth below disability and Group Lines, and see a little bit of that momentum. Now, it\u2019s small so we\u2019re just starting against $5 plus billion base, it's not something that is going to be huge any time soon. But the interest in that product, our ability to launch and service, the generation of new demand, we\u2019re very excited about. And I think it will be an opportunity across both books of business, including Aetna\u2019s.","Chris Swift","Randy, just a simple fact is again we have 20 million customers in the book of business now. So what we\u2019ve talked about and as Doug referred to what we've been building patiently voluntary products additional A&H products, other services that we can bring to that product set, including lease management on a more integrated basis. All of that has been on our vision and we're really beginning to execute to it that I think will really accelerate our growth and our profitability.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Meyer, your line is open.","Meyer Shields","Two quick questions, first obviously P&C results were very strong. But I\u2019m wondering whether you also saw some adverse impact from non-cat fee weather in the quarter?","Doug Elliot","Our non-cat weather pretty consistent with prior trend, so we didn\u2019t have the same dynamic maybe others as spoken to, but there was clearly a lot of weather in the month of March and we looked across our footprint, we feel good about our cat calls but nothing that I would call out extraordinary right now.","Meyer Shields","And then second bigger picture. Can you walk us through the strategy for getting the underlying combined ratio in specialty down? Is that an expense issue a sale issue?","Doug Elliot","Largely it\u2019s a mix issue, Meyer, because our national account book is in that segment. The duration on our liabilities on our workers\u2019 comp excess product are in the 12 to 15 category. So that book is going to tend to run at very different combined rations than our normal middle and small. So it\u2019s all about mix. Our national account book is performing well, strong ROEs. I just think you have to keep in mind what's in the segment very different than the other markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Jay, your line is open.","Jay Gelb","Couple of clarifying questions, first on M&A. I believe the range of premium volume mentioned was $1 billion to $2 billion. Would that be gross or net?","Doug Elliot","Again, when we think about it and look at it, we think in terms of gross, because then we think of our own reinsurance strategies and appetite, Jay.","Jay Gelb","And then I think it might be helpful just to understand Hartford\u2019s excess capital position given the net of announced acquisitions versus dispositions. How much excess capital does Hartford currently have adjusted for deals that are about to close?","Beth Bombara","Jay, couple of things, when you look at holding company resources I think end of the quarter and we\u2019ve got about billion on resources there. I\u2019ll remind you we are planning on paying down $500 million of hybrids in June. We then have the net proceeds that will come in from the Talcott sale, which is about $1.7 billion as I said in my remarks, and that\u2019s in the short term. Again, when we did the acquisition of Aetna last year, we had talked about the fact that we expected lower dividends this year from our operating subsidiaries, so no dividends from the group business.","So, really as we go into 2019, we'd expect to see dividends increasing again both from P&C and from Hartford Life & Accident, which is the group business. And then the other things you keep in mind is that we will be generating cash flows at the holding company as it relates to monetizing our tax assets. And we'll start to see some of that in \u201919 as we get refunds our AMT credits and then utilize those NOLs. So those are the sources that I think about over time if that\u2019s helpful.","Jay Gelb","It is, but based on my probably simplistic knowledge of this. How does that all translate relative to what Hartford would typically desire to have in terms of holding company resources and what does that mean for us?","Beth Bombara","So as it relates to our target as a holding company, we typically look to 1 to 1.5 times interest and dividend requirements. But we also want to maintain flexibility, so as we have in the past, we\u2019ve used our excess capital ratably over a period. So those are parameters that we think about. But again, as Chris said, we do want to make sure that we maintain a strong balance sheet and any capital that we would deploy, we would look at doing that over a period of time.","Jay Gelb","And is there a tie into that in terms of when the decision may be made whether to resume share buybacks?","Chris Swift","Jay, I would decouple some things in terms that there's no bright line or date on the calendar to say, these are what we're trying to make decisions on. Some of it obviously as it relates to M&A is the fluidity of the marketplace and the dynamics there. We want to be able to react to opportunities that make strategic and financial sense. But we also realized that we\u2019re not going to be able to and should not hold excess capital forever. So I think what Beth was describing is that we are going to build a healthy position of deployable capital. We\u2019ll continue to be aware of marketplace opportunities. But at some point in time, we would have to begin a return program in the form of either increase dividends or buybacks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","YaronKinar","So one maybe net picky question with regards to commercial, so I think you've highlighted record new business growth in small commercial. We've also achieved our more significant rate increases than in middle market and yet net premiums in small commercial have actually slowed, which I\u2019m thinking I mean that maybe there is maybe some erosion retention levels in that business. So would that mean that there is increased shopping behavior among customers as we push through and that there is still abundant capacity willing to offer lower or maybe even unattractive rates in order to one business out there in the market?","Chris Swift","Yaron, I don't feel that. I feel two factors relative to the core of your question. One is that we've been rather aggressive on our auto re-pricing and re-underwriting. And so our auto retentions are down significantly and that's definitely causing a bit of a drag on our overall top line and small. And then the second thing is that although we\u2019re positive on the pricing side for comp, we\u2019re slightly positive. And so we\u2019re not getting any significant lift on a good segment of our small commercial book and our comp pricing. So all in, I am more focused around the auto book that we\u2019ve taken action that we think we needed to take to correct that. I see the progress in our loss ratios that\u2019s why we're continuing to post terrific numbers there. I don\u2019t feel a lot difference in the marketplace yet.","YaronKinar","And then the second question I have is with regard to the group benefits business. And I apologize if I missed that. But when you talk about the group disability improved incidents trends and better recoveries. Is that across both the legacy Hartford business and the new Aetna block, or is it coming more from one than the other?","Chris Swift","Both disability books, Yaron, and our exhibiting solid behavior. So we feel good on both disability sides.","Sabra Purtill","Amy, we have time for one more question I think.","Operator","Your next question comes from Amit Kumar from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Amit Kumar","Two very quick questions, number one going back to the discussion on consolidation. Would your answer on the business mix as it relates to reinsurance, would that have been different if the tax cut act would not have been passed and implemented?","Chris Swift","I don\u2019t think so. I mean, think in terms of strategies first and alignment of businesses you want to be, and then the finance and the math has to work, but the pre and post tax reform, we wouldn\u2019t have had a different view.","Amit Kumar","Because I was wondering about the re-domicile aspect that\u2019s where I was going with the question. The second question, I guess the final question I have is again going back to the comp numbers. If I look at the Schedule P and compare the Hartford Scheduled P with the industry Schedule P, and if you look at the development of loss specs, why has the development being lower. I guess why have you taken down the loss specs on lower basis versus the industry? Is there something in the book or is it just conservatism here versus the industry trends?","Beth Bombara","As we said before as we think about our comp book and the long tailed nature of that, we\u2019re very thoughtful about some of the trends that we build into reserves, specifically around severity and medical cost severity. So we have seen, over the last few years, very favorable trend there but we really think about it more for the long-term. And so as we evaluate our reserves each quarter, we look at how things are developing and take action accordingly. But we\u2019re not prepared to take down our long-term view of those trends or those factors that affect the reserves.","Chris Swift","And we have made some slight adjustments, Beth, but we\u2019ve reacted candidly more to the frequency side over the last couple of years, because we now feel like we\u2019ve got a pretty solid look at those last couple of action years, particularly '15 and '16. So Amit, thanks for the question.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you. Thank you all for joining us today. And if you have any additional questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to follow-up with the Investor Relations team. Thank you for joining us today and have a good weekend.","Operator","This concludes our conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Hartford Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Ms. Sabra Purtill, you may begin your conference.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you, Darlene. Good morning, and welcome to The Hartford Second Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Our speakers today are Liam McGee, The Hartford's Chairman, President and CEO; and Chris Swift, our CFO. Other members of our senior management team here today include Doug Elliot, Brion Johnson, Alan Kreczko, Andy Napoli, and Bob Rupp.","As detailed on Page 2 of the presentation, statements concerning The Hartford's future results or actions should be considered forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may be materially different. We do not assume any obligation to update the forward-looking statements. You should consider the important risks and uncertainties that may cause The Hartford's actual results to differ, including those discussed in our press release, our second quarter 10-Q, 2011 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC.","Please note that our presentation includes financial measures that are not derived from Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP. Definitions and reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are provided in our financial supplement, press release, 10-Q and on our website.","I'll now turn the call over to Liam.","Liam E. McGee","Thank you, Sabra. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before I get started, I want to welcome Brion Johnson, our recently appointed Chief Investment Officer. Prior to his appointment in May, Brion was Head of Strategy and Finance for our Investment Management subsidiary.","This was a productive quarter at The Hartford. We generated good underlying financial results, marked by improved performance in our go-forward businesses. We successfully refinanced the Allianz debt and completed the $500 million equity repurchase program. We also made progress in executing our new strategy, particularly in the sales processes for the Life businesses, which are proceeding as expected.","Let me start with an overview of our quarterly financial results. Core earnings were $119 million or $0.23 per diluted share, including high catastrophe losses, although less than last year's; restructuring expenses; and an unfavorable DAC unlock. Adjusting for these items, core earnings were $0.85 per diluted share, ahead of our May outlook.","Importantly, earnings were marked by favorable momentum in our go-forward businesses. Core earnings in P&C Commercial increased 67% from the prior year, reflecting lower catastrophe losses and the favorable impact of the pricing and underwriting actions launched last year, particularly in workers' compensation.","We saw adverse loss trends in the comp line early and immediately began taking action. Workers' compensation trends are generally performing as we expected, with only a slight adjustment this quarter.","Our actions are now yielding results, and we're optimistic that we've turned the corner. We're getting price increases in all lines with a 7% renewal price increase in standard commercial. In Middle Market, our renewal pricing was up 16% in workers' compensation, and we expect to continue to improve margins and product mix.","Retention remains strong for the accounts we want to keep, although down a bit in total as we shed more of our unprofitable accounts.","In Group Benefits, core earnings were up from first quarter. We had favorable Life and AD&D results, as well as a seasonal improvement in long-term disability trends. The Hartford was among the first to recognize adverse trends in incidence and terminations, which we addressed by taking pricing actions beginning in early 2011 and continuing through today. It will take more time and work to get this business back to historical profitability, but I'm encouraged with our progress.","In Consumer Markets, the quarter's financial results were adversely affected by heavy cat activity. We remain focused on profitable growth and improving both margins and ROEs. Retention continues to improve in both homeowners and auto, even as we continue to take rate in each. New business trends are also good, up 17% over the prior year.","We remain excited about the prospects for our Mutual Funds business and our expanded relationship with Wellington. During the quarter, we completed the transition of fixed income funds to Wellington, and our marketing initiatives will expand in the second half. We're confident that our Mutual Fund assets will grow, given Wellington's leading capabilities in managing both equities and fixed income. This is particularly important, given the continued flows out of equity and into fixed income funds industry-wide.","We're on track for our targeted expense reductions, and as Chris will present in more detail, have increased our 2013 goals. In addition, in order to remain efficient in our go-forward businesses, we will eliminate all expenses for the Life businesses that are being sold.","Now let me review this quarter's progress and our strategy announced in March, to focus on P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds. As you recall, these businesses satisfied all 3 of our requirements: first, that they have competitive market positions on which we could invest for future profitable growth; next, that they generate, not consume capital; and finally, that they will lead to lower market sensitivity for the company.","We also announced that we shut down our U.S. VA business and put it into runoff, and that we would sell the Individual Life, Retirement Plans and Woodbury Financial Services, our retail broker-dealer. Since that announcement, we've made solid progress in achieving our sharper focus strategy.","First, the sales processes are proceeding as planned. On Tuesday, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to sell Woodbury Financial Services for proceeds totaling $115 million, subject to closing adjustments. The sales processes for the remaining Life businesses continue, and we look forward to updating you when definitive sales agreements have been reached.","Second, we have effectively shut down our U.S. variable annuities business. We signed a definitive agreement to sell the new VA business infrastructure, which we expect to close by year-end. The sale provides a smooth transition to more than 100 of our teammates in the U.S. Individual Annuity organization. We expect to reduce expenses by $100 million before tax in 2013 as a result.","Third, on the legacy annuity block, we announced the appointment of Beth Bombara as President of the Life runoff business. Beth has a deep knowledge of The Hartford and the annuity business and has a track record of significant accomplishments. She and her team will accelerate the good work already underway to reduce the size and risk of our legacy annuity liabilities, as well as initiatives that could isolate or separate them from the ongoing businesses and, over time, free up capital.","Given current economic conditions, this process will take time, but we will be prepared to take advantage of opportunities to reduce or sell blocks of business. We will balance economics and any possible consumption of statutory surplus against the potentially positive impact on shareholder value of reducing the block.","We are confident that we will achieve our goals. In the meantime, the VA hedging programs provide protection to policyholders and shareholders from adverse economic environments.","I know that there's a lot of interest in our plans for the use of the proceeds from the sales of the Life businesses. As we discussed in March, we will maintain capital sufficient for adverse economic environments and supportive of our go-forward businesses and their current ratings. We will work with all of our constituencies, including regulators and rating agencies, to develop a final plan that supports both our business and capital management goals.","Now, while our plans are not final, we expect to repay a minimum of $320 million of debt maturing in July 2013, in order to maintain leverage and interest coverage ratios at levels that support current ratings and also to pursue accretive actions for shareholders, which currently would be common stock repurchases or future potential transactions that would reduce the size and risk of the annuity book. We will update you in early 2013 as our plans and the business sales are finalized.","So to conclude, the second quarter was successful at The Hartford on many fronts. We had good core earnings and continued momentum in our go-forward businesses. We completed the $500 million stock buyback, repurchased the Allianz debt and made more progress on our expense initiatives. We announced an agreement to sell Woodbury Financial Services on Tuesday, and the sales processes of the Individual Life and Retirement Plans businesses are proceeding as planned. We are diligently exploring opportunities to reduce the size and risk of our annuity exposures, isolate or separate them from the ongoing businesses and, over time, free up associated capital.","We know we have a lot more work to do, but we are confident that we're on the right path. And I look forward to sharing our progress with you next quarter and beyond.","I'll now turn the microphone over to Chris, who will cover our financial results in more detail. Chris?","Christopher John Swift","Thank you, Liam. Good morning, everyone. My comments this morning will cover 3 areas: a review of second quarter results; an update of our expense targets; and our third quarter current outlook.","Second quarter core earnings were $119 million or $0.23 per diluted share, representing a significant improvement over prior year. These results include 4 items I want to highlight. First, catastrophe losses were $189 million after tax, which is $105 million higher than our original outlook. Second, we had unfavorable prior year loss reserve development of $32 million. Both of these items are in line with our July 16 announcement. Third, our results included unfavorable DAC unlock of $127 million, largely related to our quarterly adjustment for market performance on our runoff annuity block. Finally, we also incurred $31 million of restructuring charges, primarily for severance and retention associated with the sales of Individual Life, Retirement Plans and Woodbury Financial services, as well as the shutdown of U.S. VA new business.","Core earnings this quarter, excluding these 4 items, were $414 million or $0.85 per diluted share based on a 485 million share count. This is higher than May's outlook of $0.70 to $0.75 per share, primarily driven by better-than-anticipated group benefit results. In this low interest rate environment, we remain focused on pricing actions, as well as strategies to maintain investment yields. The investment portfolio yield was stable this quarter at 4.3%, excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments, which had a 10% annualized return in the quarter.","Consistent with last quarter, we modestly extended the duration of the portfolio and slightly increased our holdings in higher-yielding asset classes. Impairments and changes to the mortgage loan loss reserve rose this quarter to $60 million after tax and DAC, largely due to losses on some recently downgraded financial institution preferred equity securities. Overall, fundamental credit performance remained strong, with no material changes in default experience or expectations.","Turning to Slide 6. Second quarter book -- 2012 book value per diluted share was $45.59, an increase of 14% over last year. Book value benefited from declining interest rates, which increased the unrealized gains in our fixed investments. Excluding AOCI, book value per diluted share rose by 2% to $40.91. Book value growth over the last year was muted by higher catastrophes, as well as this quarter's $587 million charge for repaying the Allianz debt. This was a major step in restructuring the balance sheet and enhancing our financial flexibility. We also repurchased $106 million of common stock this quarter to complete our $500 million share repurchase plan. This is also reflected in our book value.","Turning to segment results. Slide 7 shows the summary results for P&C Commercial. Core earnings were $160 million, a 67% increase from the prior year due to better catastrophe results. Results also include a $12 million after tax of net unfavorable prior year loss reserve development across multiple lines. This included about $28 million after tax of adverse development on our workers' compensation book, largely for accident year 2011. The combined ratio, x cat, x prior year, was 94.5%, up slightly over prior year's 93.1%, which did not include the change in our 2011 accident year loss picks we made in the third and fourth quarter last year. We continue to expect the P&C Commercial combined ratio, x cats, x prior year, to improve based on achieved pricing and outlook for future rate increases.","As Liam mentioned, we continue to see strong price increases in P&C Commercial. We achieved renewal rate price increases of 7% in standard commercial equal to the first quarter. Workers' compensation is a key driver, with a 16% rate increase in Middle Market. Consistent with first quarter, all other commercial lines had rate increases as well, with 6% in Small Commercial, 8% in Middle Market property, 6% in Middle Market general liability.","Our pricing actions have impacted retention slightly. Middle Market retention was lower at 73% in the quarter, which is a top line trade-off we are making to improve margins. Small Commercial retention remained strong at 82%, slightly down from last year and last quarter. We will continue to be disciplined in our pricing initiatives, which are focused on achieving better margins on underperforming accounts, while maintaining margins and retention on our best performing accounts.","Shifting to Group Benefits. Core earnings of $34 million were a significant improvement, well above first quarter levels and up $4 million from last year's quarter. The loss ratio was 78.6%, an improvement over the first quarter, which tends to be seasonally high but still up from the 78% in prior year. As a result of our rate actions and the very competitive marketplace, premiums declined 6%. This reflects the impact of pricing action on both new business and renewal trends occurring over the last 18 months.","We had favorable Life and AD&D experience, so I wouldn't annualize this quarter for the second half of the year. We still expect Group Benefit results this year to be flat, with the $86 million earned in 2011. Nevertheless, we are encouraged by our results in this line, and we are confident that our initiatives over the past 18 months will get us to where we need to be.","Turning to Slide 9. Consumer Markets had core losses of $48 million due to catastrophe losses above budget, although below last year's level. Andy Napoli and his team are managing the book for profitable growth by balancing pricing, retention, new business levels, and like the entire organization, expense efficiency. Retention has improved over the past several quarters and was up 2 points in both lines compared to a year ago.","Net written premiums declined 2%, partially due to lower than historic retention, which was partially offset by strong new business production. Auto new business was up 13% for the quarter and 21% year-to-date. AARP Agency is a strong growth source. First half 2012 written premiums in AARP Agency almost doubled to $59 million from the prior year period. The second quarter combined ratio, x cat, and prior year development was 91.3%, essentially flat with last year's 91.2%.","Homeowners, in particular, remains negatively impacted by elevated weather events. We remain focused on improving profitability with renewal, written price increases in the quarter of 6% in homeowners and 4% in auto. Auto physical damage loss severity remains a challenge, and we are watching frequency carefully. Auto liability frequency ticked up a little bit in the first quarter, but that trend did not continue in the second quarter. We are monitoring auto loss cost trends closely, and we'll adjust our pricing as necessary. But in general, we are comfortable with our current balance of pricing, retention and new business. Homeowners, on the other hand, needs more rate industry-wide, principally because of cats and non-cat weather.","We are encouraged by our results in Consumer Markets as we continue to focus on opportunities for profitable growth and improving margins and ROEs.","Mutual fund results are summarized on Slide 10. All fixed income funds have now transitioned to Wellington, and expanded marketing initiatives are planned for the second half of the year. However, near-term earnings have been impacted by continued negative flows from equity funds, an industry-wide trend.","Mutual fund core earnings this quarter were $18 million, down $9 million from prior year due to a 14% decline in assets under management compared to a year ago. Core earnings also included expenses for moving the business to Pennsylvania and expanding distribution teams.","The results of our combined Life and P&C runoff division are on Slide 11. Core earnings, x DAC unlock, were $148 million. This includes $162 million from Life and a loss of $14 million in P&C, which includes the asbestos environmental charge. Excluding the A&E charge and DAC unlock, core earnings were in line with our expectations.","I know there is interest in our annuity surrender experience since our March 21 announcement. Surrender activity for the U.S. block averaged an annualized rate of 17.5% for the quarter. The surrender rate increased to 20% in April immediately following the announcement but has since trended down to last year's level of 14% in July. Some of the decline is probably due to the decline in market levels, as we normally see lower surrenders in down markets. These surrender rates include both full and partial surrenders, which are now disclosed separately in the IFS.","Full surrenders for the second quarter were 13% annualized, up from 10% in the first quarter. Partial withdrawals were flat at 4.8%. While either type of activity helps reduce the size of the annuity liabilities, full surrenders completely eliminate the risk of those contracts. It's worth noting that this 2Q in-the-moneyness surrenders have been running about 35% of the total, roughly consistent with the overall in-the-moneyness of the U.S. VA GMWB block.","Slide 12 provides a summary of VA hedging results for the quarter. Our VA hedging programs primarily focus on economics. As you know, there are differences between GAAP, stat and economic results. During the quarter, the net statutory impact of our VA liabilities and hedges was a negative $228 million before tax, which excludes fees and other impacts to surplus. We ended the quarter with nearly $4 billion of VA statutory reserves in our U.S. and Japan subsidiaries.","Slide 13 is our surplus roll-forward. Total U.S. statutory surplus increased approximately $200 million in the second quarter. This is after $200 million of dividends from the P&C operations to the holding company. P&C had statutory operating earnings of about $100 million. VA statutory impacts were $100 million positive. Other items, primarily deferred taxes, were almost $200 million favorable.","In total, U.S. statutory Life surplus increased to $7.7 billion from $7.5 billion, while P&C surplus was essentially flat at $7.7 billion.","As you can see on Slide 14, capital resources remained strong at $18 million after -- excuse me, $18 billion after completing the share repurchase program and the Allianz refinancing. Holding company cash and short-term investments totaled $1.3 billion, down slightly from March, due principally to the settlement of the warrant repurchase and the $106 million of share repurchases in the quarter.","Slide 15 set forth our updated expense target reductions. In December of last year, we laid out a $450 million expense reduction target for year-end 2013. We have increased that by a net $30 million to $480 million. This includes a $70 million reduction reflecting the portion of the original target that was attributable to the Life businesses being sold. It also reflects $100 million of expense reductions arising from the shutdown of U.S. VA business.","Additionally, in the quarter, we incurred about $31 million of after tax restructuring and other expenses associated with the sales process, including retention expenses and advisory fees. We expect to incur approximately $40 million after tax in additional restructuring charges related to these activities in the second half of 2012.","Before taking questions, I want to briefly provide you with our outlook for the third quarter. We expect third quarter core earnings to be in the range of $0.75 to $0.80 per diluted share, including catastrophe losses of approximately $75 million after tax. Our third quarter estimate does not include the following items: first, it does not include prior year P&C loss reserve development; second, the outlook does not reflect any DAC unlocks, including those related to our annual third quarter assumption study; finally, it does not include any expenses or charges relating to the sales processes for the Life businesses, and it excludes $25 million of restructuring and other expenses we expect to occur in the quarter.","To conclude, I am pleased with our business results this quarter and for the year-to-date. With the exception of catastrophes, our businesses this quarter performed largely in line with our expectations, with a slight positive from Group Benefits. Our investment results remained strong despite the challenging low interest rate environment.","Looking forward, we will continue to maintain our pricing discipline in the P&C businesses, and we expect our initiatives in Group Benefits and Mutual Funds to help improve profitability in 2013 and beyond.","At this point, I'd like to turn the call back over to Sabra to begin the Q&A session.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you, Chris. We have time for about 30 minutes of Q&A. [Operator Instructions]","Darlene, could you please start the Q&A process?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","On the proceeds from the sale of the businesses currently in runoff, Liam, you talked initially about using buybacks or reducing the size of the annuity book, giving us an update there in early 2013. Does that mean the sale process might be taking a little longer than you thought? And can you frame it out just a bit more in terms of how you're thinking about deploying those proceeds?","Liam E. McGee","Jay, first of all, the sales process is proceeding as we expected. As you recall, Jay, when we announced our decision to sell the 3 businesses in March, we also indicated we were prepared. We have done all of our actuarial studies, and so the offering memorandum were in the marketplace approximately a month after our announcement. I would say that, as I said earlier, the process is proceeding as we expected. These are attractive businesses, and it's been a competitive process. In terms of the capital plan, we want to get the agreement signed. As I mentioned in my remarks, work with our constituencies. And I think the convergence of those things says that we'll give you a final capital plan in early 2013. So I would describe everything proceeding as we had expected when we announced things in March.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then for the third quarter DAC study, can you -- is there any sort of boundaries you can give us on that in terms of what we should be thinking about in terms of potential charges going into that study?","Liam E. McGee","Chris?","Christopher John Swift","Jay, it's Chris. I wouldn't say there's anything other than normal, I'll call it expense, mortality, interest rate-type assumptions, policyholder behaviors. So I wouldn't say there's any boundaries. It's just our normal annual update that we'll go through.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Year-to-date, how are things tracking along with current assumptions?","Christopher John Swift","I'd say they're tracking very well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel with Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","So just as a quick follow-up on the early 2013, Chris or Liam, it sounds like that's really just around giving us some clarity on the deployment of proceeds. So nothing really changing in terms of your expectation for timing of actual sale announcements. Is that correct?","Liam E. McGee","That's an accurate statement, John, so let me reiterate. I want to be crystal clear on this point. The sales processes are proceeding as we expected. These -- we're pleased to have announced the Woodbury transaction on Tuesday. The Life and Retirement Plan process is proceeding. It -- these are attractive businesses, and it's been a competitive process. The -- we want to present to you and investors an updated, more final capital plan, which will include prospective capital management actions. So I think we're right on schedule.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. So then a question -- maybe 2 quick ones for Chris. A question on interest rate risk. Just on the conference call before this one with the folks at Met, they sort of gave us an update of looking at instead of a 2% 10-year, looking at a 1.4%- or 1.5%-type 10-year environment. Can you give us a sense, too, for what that incremental 50 or 60 basis points lower-type rate environment would do to that earnings sensitivity you had provided some -- a few quarters ago?","Christopher John Swift","Yes, happy to, John. And low interest rates, as you know, just are a headwind for everyone in financial services. But our specific, either way I think about it from a momentum side, the assets that we have on the books, so the maturing cash flows and the new cash flows, if we look at the impacts in '13 and '14, I'd call it, roughly the $25 million to $30 million in '13. And you can roughly double it from there in '14 if rates stay low at today's level.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","So that's it? That's the incremental above the original guidance?","Christopher John Swift","Yes, it is the incremental impact to sort of the momentum that we will give up in the run rate earnings.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes. Okay, that's helpful. And then just a last real quick one. On Slide 12 in your conference call presentation, just can you give some granularity on the VA? I guess the hedge assets didn't quite keep up with the liability in the quarter. Can you give us just a little bit of granularity on what drove that? Was that equity markets, rates, currency? What...","Christopher John Swift","Again, John, I think the attribution, we could work with you off-line, if that's really important to you. But I think the big thing is just, generally, keep in mind, we're not 100% hedged on the economics. So there's always going to be a basis difference. You're always going to have, I'll call it a Japanese impact because most of our Japanese hedges are in the U.S. legal entity. So I would describe it mostly basis difference from my perspective.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So I kind of wanted to try and, I guess, follow up on Jay's question and talk a little bit about your comments on kind of reducing the size of the VA book, isolating and separating it. I appreciate that this is not what's in focus now. Right now, you're focused on selling the 3 other properties. But, I mean, would it be possible to kind of at least frame out at a high level what that might look like? Meaning, could we expect to lose the DAC that's associated with the VA business? I mean, that's an assumption we're making with the potential Life divestiture. And kind of feel confident that there's some material on a capital that could get out of the VA book if you are able to isolate or separate some of that risk from Hartford.","Liam E. McGee","Well, Randy, I'm going to ask Chris to give a little more detail on that, but let me just be very clear in the comments that I made. Our -- under Beth's leadership, our goal is to reduce both the liabilities and the risk of the annuity book. And if opportunities present themselves, to potentially isolate or separate it. In terms of the -- and we do think, over time, there will be a capital that will be freed up as a result of that. In terms of your question on DAC and everything, I'm going to turn to Chris.","Christopher John Swift","Randy, a couple of points. One, I agree with Liam. And I think what we've been trying to communicate clearly is that as the block runs off, capital will be freed up, not necessarily literally, probably, generally, just take more time. And of the $7.6 billion of, I'll call it, statutory surplus, we have in all the legal entities. I mean, that's our -- our objective is to maximize that value and trading off maybe potential transactions or other types of things. So we're focused in on statutory. Your point on DAC, obviously, DAC is a GAAP concept, so that doesn't affect statutory results. And a lot of our DAC assumptions, as I said, are updated quarterly, and we still make money on these blocks of business. I mean, they're still earning fees, so we are still following our historic, I'll call it, U.S. GAAP accounting conventions is how we amortize DAC in.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Well, yes, I mean, I guess just a follow-up on DAC. I appreciate that they're currently there, but if there was a transaction to separate -- I mean, the stock is trading like $14 below book value. So I think it's -- it would be helpful to just kind of understand that if there was a separation, what would happen to that intangible that's in the GAAP book value?","Christopher John Swift","Yes, I hate to speculate on types of separations, what would be involved and things like that. But any, I'll call it, separation transferred to a third party of any liabilities, we'd have to account for that in proceeds and have a gain or loss that's reflective of total proceeds. So in a transaction setting, correct.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","One more related follow-up, and this is kind of a simple, maybe it's a dumb question. But, I mean -- so the surrenders have been elevated on balance since the runoff decision being made. Is that positive for freeing up capital? Meaning, the faster the VA block runs off, that would lead us to freeing up capital sooner?","Christopher John Swift","Yes. What we're trying to say is that all surrenders, all reductions of account value, are beneficial over the long-term, and that's our goal. And just to give you the perspective, surrenders in '11 ran about 14%, '10, they were about 11%. So they're going to settle in somewhere between 14% and 16% in my judgment going forward. And the block will run off, and we'll look for opportunistic transactions to help accelerate that runoff if they are in a marketplace that we find accretive to shareholders. That's the real strategy, simply, Randy.","Liam E. McGee","Randy, we are laser-focused on all possible ways to accelerate reducing the liabilities and the risk.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of questions here for you. Just first one, on the commercial Middle Market's retention, I'm curious, why the sudden drop-off this quarter? You've been pushing the rate in that business for a while now. Was something different that happened this quarter? Where you pushing a little bit harder on terms and conditions or something?","Douglas G. Elliot","Brian, this is Doug. I don't think the marketplace was really any different in the second quarter. We are continuing our march to improve our margins. As you know, workers' comp is a priority for us. And so as I reflect on our chief pricing increases and the trade-off on retention, I'm very satisfied with what happened in the second quarter and expect to see more of that moving ahead.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Does it say you expect the retention to stay pretty low for Middle Markets here for a couple more quarters?","Douglas G. Elliot","I at least think third quarter. We're very pleased with the pricing increases, and as you can tell, our margins are improving. So we feel good about that progress. And at the moment, the trade-off between rate and retention, I think, is a good one for us, and we're going to stay right there.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then just a quick one over on the personal lines on consumer side. AARP written premium still declining here. Are we getting close to a point where you're comfortable from a profitability standpoint that we're going to start to see that start to pick up here going forward?","Andr\u00e9 A. Napoli","Brian, Andy Napoli here. Yes, good question. I would say, over the past year, we've had a really nice, strong rebound in new business production, in AARP Direct and Agency, you can see that in the numbers. That's probably at a level that relative to total premium, where we're comfortable with a new business production at this point at about 12% to 13%. So then you shift the conversation to retention. We've had 2 points improvement in retention on a year-over-year basis. We've got a little bit more ground to make up there. I see growth to the division being flat in 2013. And as I think about the factors that could influence that, we're experiencing a rate need relative to -- or because of the increase in physical damage severity that I think is pervasive across the industry, and we'll have to sort of dynamically manage how we price that into our business going forward. And that's something we're going to pay very close attention to.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent DeAugustino with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Vincent M. DeAugustino - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","The press release mentioned 7% renewal price increases for Middle Market, and I think it also mentioned overall increases of 10% for the same segment. And I'm -- if I'm thinking about that correctly, I should be able to attribute the GAAP to even stronger new business pricing. Am I thinking about that right?","Liam E. McGee","No. Let me adjust your thinking just a bit. First point I'd make is, although it looks relatively flat quarter-over-quarter, 7% versus 7%, actually, there was an increase in the second quarter. We rounded up the first quarter. It was 6.6%, and the second quarter came in roughly at 7.4%. So there is positive movement in the second quarter that we feel good about, and actually, that positive movement really runs across our lines, including comp, which we spoke to. The new business environment really sits outside of the pricing disclosures that we've shared with you. So I would separate those 2. And we can talk about them separately, but they're really 2 different topics.","Vincent M. DeAugustino - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So -- sorry, I'm just a little confused in the difference between the 7% and the 10%.","Liam E. McGee","I think the 10% was a Middle Market pricing, and the 7% was the combination of our Small and our Middle together.","Vincent M. DeAugustino - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, I see. I'm sorry about that. And then also, you mentioned earlier in your comments that mutual fund marketing initiative is going to ramp up in the second half. Would you be able to say what the incremental expense would be there or would this be de minimis?","Christopher John Swift","I generally think it's rounding. I mean, it's people more than anything. So it will be -- the compensation will be tied to sales and things like that, but it's pretty de minimis, Vince.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Finkelstein with Evercore Partners.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I guess sort of a follow-up on the prior question. I guess how would you characterize the rate environment? I think you just said that 6.6% in the first quarter, 7.4%. Do you see this stabilizing? Do you see further momentum as you look at kind of the June and July results or any slippage?","Liam E. McGee","We see a relatively stable environment. I would look at the last 60 days and think about May and June and be encouraged by the improving signals. But overall, we see a relatively stable environment that we expect will move into the third quarter.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then when you think about, I guess, Small Commercial in particular, how would you characterize the rate increases relative to your assumptions around lost cost trend?","Liam E. McGee","At or slightly exceeding would be my answer in the Small Commercial space. It's a very strong line for us. You can see our returns, as noted in the supplement. And our mid single-digit pricing increases are essentially right on our trends.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. I guess can you just talk a little bit about -- the overall development was, in ongoing businesses was largely flattish, I mean, some favorable coming out of the cats. But the one notable was I think the $43 million of adverse development in workers' comp. Can you just talk about that and whether there's any changes in how you're looking at, I guess, the reserve levels based on the trend that you saw this quarter?","Liam E. McGee","Sure. Our view of the comp book really hasn't changed in the last 90 days. We did some tuning in the second quarter. I'd characterize out of the $43 million, roughly, $25 million of that was in accident year 2011. We're watching carefully those trends. We had some medical losses that moved to med and indemnity, but nothing that I would say would be significant or out of pattern. As you know, we call our reserves straight up as we see them in the quarter. So we did do some adjusting in the quarter, but I feel like we're all over the issues, we're watching them carefully. As we've mentioned in the past, we feel positive about the improving claim incidence trends inside our book of business. So we're very bullish about an improving go-forward comp book and the fact that we've got our arms around our prior books.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I guess just one question on Group Benefits. I mean, the results were more favorable, I think, than most have expected, including myself, but it sounds like it was largely group Life and AD&D. And I'm trying to understand how much of that is just good luck versus some core margin expansion, particularly on the disability side that we should be thinking about as trendable.","Douglas G. Elliot","This is Doug again. As Chris mentioned, our run rate for the year still looks like it's going to be flat with 2011, which is in that 80, 85 range. As I think about the quarter, clearly, it was $5 million to $6 million of favorable Life and AD&D experience, and there's some good things on the expense side that were kind of one-timers. So when I look at the quarter and think about Chris' comment about overall 2012 performance, I think we're right on pretty solid run rate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess one additional question just on the VA runoff book. We're starting, I guess, to see some competitors that are trying to accelerate the runoff, offer lump-sum payments. Can you comment if this is something you're exploring the regulatory and capital considerations for doing so? And then lastly, just any comments on appetite from external participants in the VA market.","Liam E. McGee","I'll take the first one, and I'll leave the second one for Chris. We're well aware of what a couple of players are doing to your point in product. I would say, Chris, we are exploring, under Beth's leadership, every possible area for accelerating the runoff, including that concept. As you know very well, guarantees differ from insurance company to insurance company, and there is no evidence yet that, actually, consumers will make that trade. But notwithstanding all that, we are aggressively looking at that. But that is one of many work streams that we're considering with great urgency and diligence because we're determined to reduce the book as quickly as we can. Chris, any comments you'd make on Chris' second question?","Christopher John Swift","Yes, I think your question really was an appetite in VA transactions. I would say, right now, it's very early, Chris. I don't think there is much appetite at all in the marketplace right now, so we would continue to explore, continue to have discussions and thinking. But as far as real appetite, it's just not there yet.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So should we take that sort of a sense the decision was reached in March, sort of the opportunities as you saw them at the time are really pretty consistent today with where you saw things back in March?","Christopher John Swift","Yes, I would say so. I mean, I think what we're trying to say, hopefully, as clearly as possible, that the opportunities are probably more short-term based on the fixed block businesses, and that will take longer time on the VA. So I think there is good interest. We've seen transactions, you've seen transactions in fixed annuity space, our fixed annuities' structured settlements, terminal funding. Those are all blocks of business that we're exploring, what is the most economic to do for the long-term.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one quick one...","Liam E. McGee","Chris, if I might add, I totally concur with what Chris Swift just said. And as the environment evolves, and we expect that it will, we fully understand the potentially positive effect on shareholder value, if there are transactions that make sense to get some of these block-off off of our book. And we have a mindset consistent with that sentiment.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Understood. And then just a quick one for Doug. I guess specifically on the rate you're getting in the Mid Market comp book, the 16% that you guys alluded to. Can you comment about how much of that rate is needed purely just based on the decline in interest rates?","Douglas G. Elliot","So let me take that in 2 pieces. Clearly, we feel like we're out in front of trends and improving our margins across our comp lines, for sure. When we look at the change in the yield, I would say, across our Middle comp lines, the pressure for more rate is roughly in the 4 to 5 range over time that we need to get to make up what I'll call 200 -- 150- to 200-basis-point change over the last 6 quarters.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just, first, wanted to follow up on the VA restructuring opportunities a little bit. So if I've heard you correctly, especially with the comments Chris just made, if we used the hypothetical, fast forward it to year-end, assuming your -- the 2 other property sales transactions are consummated, so you have those proceeds or at least the anticipation of those proceeds, there's nothing in the environment today, again, I'm kind of pro forming this, that would suggest there would be a third-party transaction market solution for restructuring the VA book, based on what you're seeing today. Thus, is it fair to conclude, if I'm right on that, that buybacks would be the preferred use of proceeds, assuming nothing changes in the environment today? Is that a fair way to think about it?","Liam E. McGee","Tom, going back to the remarks I made, the formal remarks, we do intend to pay down some debt, as you would understand, to manage our leverage and debt service coverage ratios, to protect our ratings and take shareholder accretive actions. I think either one of those, whether that would be share buybacks or transactions that would economically and appropriately get the -- some part of the annuity book, a block off of our books would both be shareholder-accretive. If there's not -- I can't speculate on what's going to be happening at a particular given time, but it is clear to say that among the most accretive things we could do today at the share price self-evident, where it is would be to buy back shares. But we're going to be -- our measure is what is the most accretive thing for shareholders.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And just in terms of -- can you also just discuss a little bit about what is the main impediment or challenge as you think about restructuring opportunities? I'm not even asking for something so specific, but as you think about what potentially can be done here, is there -- is the most likely course here, having a third party involved that assumes the liability? Would it be actually legally separating the liability through some kind of spin-off of the business where there isn't a third party involved per se? And then also if you could just mention whether the whole captive reinsurance encumbers your opportunity set here.","Christopher John Swift","Tom, it's Chris. The challenge, I'll call it succinctly, is, I mean, if you look at the balance sheet, we have about $165 billion of liabilities that are in runoff in the Life group. So one, it's obvious, just the sheer size and scale. There's not going to be, I'll call it, 1 solution, 1 silver bullet. So the way we're thinking about it right now, I mean, this will be a series of moves over a longer period of time to eventually transfer runoffs, isolate, separate these liabilities. So there isn't going to just be 1 thing. I think I've always said, Tom, and particularly, I know you know, I mean, if you really look at the fundamentals of the U.S. and Japan, they're different. The U.S. block from a relative risk perspective or relative size and its components are fixed and variable, actually, it's a balanced portfolio liabilities. Japan, on the other hand, I think from a shareholder value perspective, is the greatest opportunity we have to manage that in the most accretive way long term. So whether that be a short-term transaction or that would be long-term, just managing the cash flows as effectively as possible, those are the things that we're thinking about and modeling and working very diligently on.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And Chris, any issues with captive re and whether or not -- I think there's some level of speculation out there that because the way the captive reinsurance is capitalized, the captive reinsure is capitalized, that it would take years and years before you could release capital out of these businesses. Is there any truth to that? Or maybe you can comment on that.","Christopher John Swift","No. I don't think the reinsurance structure has anything to do with capital movements and release. And as you know, we have 2 captives: one that manages our XXX program that will be dealt with in the sales process; and then White River, which is our Vermont-based captive. So is there -- I mean, it is -- just view it as a way to manage RBC and risk-based capital between the 2 organizations. So they go hand-in-hand, but there are no structural limitations, just to be clear, on how and when we would release capital because of that structure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel with Langen McAlenney.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Chris, I wanted to just push you a little bit on -- you said the stat capital is really the most important consideration over the near term, which I agree. Could you amplify your answer to John's question of the stress test of $1.50 [ph] 10-year for 5 years, whether there would be any statutory implications to that?","Christopher John Swift","Bob, I know you know the answer. I mean, low interest rates over a longer period of time won't be good, and I think we've discussed in prior quarters managing cash flow testing, C3 Phase 1 implication. So all that would come into the mix, Bob. And you never want to be, I'll call it, totally predictive and judgmental, but those would be issues everyone in the industry would have to face, including The Hartford, in the amount of additional reserves and capital we would have to put up for interest rates if we're 5 years out.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Okay. Just a rough sense of like number of years of $1.50 [ph] 10-year that you can withstand before it becomes a stress.","Christopher John Swift","Well, again, I'm not going to try to predict the precise number, so it's hard. All I could say though from a current point of view, I mean, we do have cash flow testing reserves up for blocks that see compression of spreads out 5, 6 years right now. So we're dealing with it right now. I think you're ultimately asking about the pace of that, and I'm not going to be in a position to predict that right now.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Okay. And just -- as I read your comments on sort of pausing on capital until 2013, you want to keep some flexibility to deal with runoff more seriously. Is there a maximum statutory hit that you'd be willing to take on the runoff business? Is there sort of a borderline -- how much flexibility do you have?","Christopher John Swift","I think from a pure financial side, we have a lot of flexibility. I think the calculus that Liam referred to is -- will it create shareholder value, and that's the math and calculus we'll go through, when and if we're presented with transactions.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Okay. So there's no sort of upper bound on how much of a hit you'd be willing to take, even though it would make sense to get rid of it from an economic point of view.","Christopher John Swift","Yes, I think what you have to think about, Bob, is on 1 individual transaction, what does it mean for the rest of the block, the rest of the liability? So I mean, it is, I'll call it, a complex equation because, again, it's not just 1 transaction. So if for say you wanted to take a hit, what does that do for the other liabilities? What does that do to your stress scenario? So those are all the things that we would consider.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you. And Darlene, I know we're bumping up against somebody else's conference call. So for those of you who are in the queue, thank you very much. I'll be happy to follow up with you after the calls today. We appreciate your interest in The Hartford, and the IR team is here today and available for any follow-up questions you may have after the call.

Our speakers today include Liam McGee; and Chris Swift; as well as Doug Elliot, President of Commercial Markets; and Andy Napoli, President of Consumer Markets. Other members of our executive management team are also available for the Q&A session.","Today's prepared remarks are longer than normal in order to cover the 2013 outlook, as well as Doug and Andy's presentations about their businesses. We will still have about 30 minutes for Q&A at the end of our prepared remarks.","As detailed on Page 2 of the presentation, today's statements concerning future results or actions are forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

McGee","Thank you, Sabra. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. As you saw from our release last night, The Hartford had a strong finish to 2012, and the fourth quarter completed a successful year of strategic transformation, as well as execution for the company. Following the life divestures, we enter 2013 with a sharper focus on the Property & Casualty, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds businesses. We are transforming and profitably growing the organization with the continued goal of delivering greater shareholder value.","As Sabra mentioned on today's call, Chris and I will speak, and then Doug Elliot and Andy Napoli will review the Commercial Markets and Consumer Markets results and preview their 2013 outlooks. We're going to use this format going forward so Doug and Andy can share greater detail about the operating fundamentals of their businesses.","Chris will provide an update on the impact of Storm Sandy, but I do want to express our deep appreciation for the professionalism and excellence demonstrated by our claims team in their response to the storm. Their dedication to serving our customers is a hallmark of The Hartford about which we're all very proud.","Before we start, I also want to say thank you for the many wishes of good luck and good health. I'm feeling great, as well as very fortunate, and we are back to business as usual.","Since I arrived at The Hartford in 2009, our top priority has been to restore the operating performance of the company and deliver increased shareholder value. We have taken significant steps to improve the company's financial strength and stability. As examples, we repaid the TARP funds, refinanced the Allianz debt, successfully repositioned the investment portfolio, implemented a tail hedge in Japan, and executed a series of necessary expense actions.","As you know, to accelerate our progress, last March, we announced a sharper strategic focus that returns The Hartford to its historical strengths in underwriting, distribution and claims management. The strategy aligns the company's resources with ongoing businesses that have competitive market positions, strong capital-generating ability and lower sensitivity to capital markets.","Roughly 9 months later, on January 2, we closed the last of the life divestitures. The transactions were executed at attractive valuations with strong strategic buyers. I'm proud of what the team has accomplished. We made difficult decisions, then executed them as planned. These changes position the company to continue to grow shareholder value in the years ahead.","With the sale successfully closed, we're pleased to share our capital management plan with you. The capital plan is accretive to shareholders and is the culmination of a thoughtful, comprehensive process that effectively balances several critical goals.","We have reviewed the plan with the rating agencies and have received approval from the Connecticut Insurance Department. In the first quarter of 2013, we will make a $1.2 billion extraordinary dividend from our Connecticut domiciled life insurance companies, and also in line to our Vermont life reinsurance captive, and move about $300 million up to the holding company as well.","First, we are allocating $500 million to a share repurchase program, which we will execute over 2013 and '14. Looking ahead, our intention is to continue of a consistent capital management approach of returning excess capital as appropriate to our shareholders.","Second, as part of the plan, we will reduce holding company debt by $1 billion. This will save about $55 million pretax of annualized interest expense by the end of 2014. Debt reduction is an important capital use for 2 reasons. First, it's appropriate to reduce debt levels for the lost earnings from the divestitures. In addition, given The Hartford's increasingly P&C centric businesses, our goal is to reduce the company's debt leverage ratios to levels that are more consistent with a capital structure of other leading P&C companies. Our year-end 2014 target for debt to capitalization is in the low 20s range.","Third, we're retaining additional capital in the life companies to supplement our financial flexibility to take actions to reduce risk in the legacy annuity blocks, ranging from customer-oriented offers and exchanges to transactions with third parties. We have the necessary resources to take future economical actions to address the legacy annuity liabilities, which should create significant shareholder value.","As we look to 2013, we're focused on achieving profitable growth in each of our go-forward businesses primarily by driving margin improvement. We saw a good progress in 2012 particularly in P&C Commercial and personal lines homeowners.","In standard P&C Commercial, we achieved 9% renewal written price increases in the fourth quarter and 8% for the year. This contributed to improvement in the combined ratio, ex CAT and ex prior year, and we expect these positive pricing trends to continue through 2013.","We are also better balancing our mix of P&C Commercial business, building on our historic strengths in worker's compensation. We've expanded our property capability significantly over the past year, which positions us to be a broader risk taker in the marketplace.","In Consumer Markets, I'm pleased with the progress Andy and his team have made improving margins and growing new business. And Andy will talk more about that later in the call.","In Group Benefits, our disciplined repricing of the book has resulted in the shedding of some unprofitable accounts but has also improved margins and returns. We think this is a good tradeoff, and we're encouraged by the profitability trends in this business. We saw a nice recovery during the fourth quarter, and the 2013 outlook is positive.","Our Mutual Funds business is positioned for profitable growth through its expanded relationship with the Wellington Management. We saw improved sales and net flows in the fourth quarter, and fund performance for 2012 was outstanding, with 80% of our funds beating their peers.","So we took significant steps in 2012, and the goal for '13 is to continue to drive profitable growth in the go-forward businesses.","We are determined to reduce the size and risks of the legacy annuity liabilities. As you know, last year, we put the annuity business into runoff and named Beth Bombara to lead that effort. She and the team have been evaluating a number of contract holder initiatives and other actions to reduce the risk embedded in these liabilities with the ultimate goal of being to isolate or separate them from The Hartford.","As you know, as an initial step, we're launching the enhanced surrender value offer for a subset of U.S. VA policyholders. Communications about the offer started in January. We believe this offer will be attractive to certain policyholders and will result in an increase in surrender activity in this block.","As you know, global equity markets posted strong results in the second half of 2012 and that continued in January. In addition, the yen has weakened significantly against the dollar and the euro over the past several months. These market conditions have positive economic implications for The Hartford and have significantly improved the in the moneyness of the U.S. and Japan VA blocks.","For example, the net amount at risk for the Japan income benefit has declined significantly from $6.1 billion at the end of the third quarter to $1.9 billion at the end of January. And the general consensus is that the yen will continue to weaken, which would be positive for us.","Our goal is to maximize shareholder value by effectively managing the runoff of these liabilities and reducing the amount of capital needed to support them. Improving market conditions may make it more attractive for policyholders to take actions, such as surrender annuitization, and should also create expanded opportunities for us to explore risk transfer transactions with third parties. All of these actions would reduce our exposure to this business and result in lower capital required to support these liabilities.","As Chris will detail, we will hold an Investor Day in April, and much of the agenda will focus on our runoff annuity operations, which we've named Talcott Resolution, and how we will maximize shareholder value by managing these liabilities, particularly in the context of the recent market improvements.","Chris will cover our 2013 earnings outlook of $1.375 billion to $1.475 billion, which reflects lost earnings from the life company sales, better margins in the ongoing businesses, declining assets under management at Talcott, an increase in the budgeted CAT load in our P&C businesses, and the elimination of expenses from the divested life businesses, 90% of which will be taken out by year-end 2013.","So to close, the fourth quarter was a strong end to a transformational year for The Hartford. We feel very good about what we've accomplished. With our focus on driving profitable growth in the ongoing businesses and reducing the size and risk of the annuity liabilities, we are confident in our ability to execute our plan and drive increasing shareholder value.","With that, now, I'll turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher John Swift","Thank you, Liam. Good morning, everyone. This morning, I will focus on 4 areas. First, I'll briefly cover fourth quarter and full year 2012 results. Second, I will provide an update on our Life runoff operations, which we have named Talcott Resolution. Third, I'll discuss our capital management plan. And last, but not least, I'll cover our 2013 core earnings outlook.","Let's begin on Slide 7. Fourth quarter 2012 core earnings were $265 million or $0.54 per diluted share. This quarter, we changed our definition of core earnings, which now excludes restructuring and other costs and DAC unlocks. We believe this definition gives a better view of fundamental operating results.","Storm Sandy generated significant CAT losses this quarter. 2 months have passed since we released our preliminary estimate, which is the same as what we recorded in this quarter's results. This quarter, this storm generated more claims than any other CAT event in our history. To date, we've closed about 80% of property claims and 90% of auto claims. For the quarter, total pretax CAT losses were $335 million, including the $350 million for Sandy. This means that fourth quarter CATs after tax were $174 million higher than our original guidance.","Core earnings in the quarter, after excluding CATs, prior-year development and a small retiree tax benefit, were about $0.87 per diluted share, above our November outlook of $0.77 to $0.82 per diluted share. Improved group LTD results, lower expenses in Talcott Resolution and favorable non-CAT weather results were the principal drivers over this outperformance.","Slide 8 summarizes full year 2012 results. Core earnings were $1.4 billion or $2.88 per diluted share. Excluding prior year development and the retiree tax benefit and catastrophes above forecast, 2012 core earnings were $1.6 billion or $3.27 per diluted share.","Turning to Slide 9. The Hartford's book value per diluted share rose by 5% to $46.59 over the past year. Net income and higher AOCI were partially offset by charges for the Allianz debt refinancing and warrant share repurchase in April of 2012, both of which reduced shareholders equity.","Excluding AOCI, book value per diluted share declined slightly to $40.79, principally due to the Allianz transactions. For 2012, core earnings ROE was 7%, a strong improvement from the 5.6% in 2011. We continue to focus on improving core earnings ROE.","This quarter, we also realigned our financial reporting to reflect the company's focus on its P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds businesses. In order to help you reconcile your models to prior recording, we posted a schedule on our website for both the new core earnings and the line of business presentations.","On Slide 10, you can find our consolidated P&C results, which include P&C Commercial, Consumer Markets and P&C Other Operations.","P&C results improved significantly in 2012. 2012 P&C core earnings totaled $714 million compared with $279 million in 2011, reflecting improved underwriting results and lower prior year development.","Our accident year P&C underwriting margins improved over 2011. The P&C combined ratio, excluding CATs and prior year development, declined to 94.8% versus 95.5% in 2011. We achieved underwriting margin improvements in both P&C Commercial and Consumer Markets although we still have work to do.","The P&C full year combined ratio was 101.9%, almost 5 points better than the 106.8% in 2011. We had much lower prior year development and slightly lower current accident year CATs in 2012. 2012 prior year development was favorable by $4 million before tax compared with unfavorable by $367 million in 2011, which had significant charges for legacy asbestos exposures and workers' compensation.","Let's turn to results for Mutual Fund, which are summarized on Slide 11. So far in 2013, we are pleased to see positive momentum in key areas of the business, including sales, net flows, fund performance and market appreciation.","Fourth quarter retail Mutual Fund sales were good, rising 34% from prior year. Net outflows, while still negative, improved significantly versus prior year as redemptions slowed. Overall, the team is making progress on its distribution and product expansion goals, which are key tactics for generating profitable growth in this segment.","Fund performance also improved substantially in 2012, with 80% of our funds ranked in the top half of their Morningstar peers. In particular, the Capital Appreciation Fund went from bottom quartile performance in 2011 to top quartile in 2012, outperforming the S&P 500 by about 400 basis points. These metrics are very important to retail broker sales, and we are optimistic that this will help to improve 2013 net flows compared with the last 2 years.","Talcott Resolution results, my second topic, are on Slide 12. The principal goal for Talcott is to reduce the size and risk of its liabilities. As a result, between the business sales and the decline in annuity blocks, we expect reduced core earnings in 2013 and thereafter as fee income shrinks.","Consistent with this outlook, Talcott's account values shrank during 2012, although core earnings were up by 7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 primarily due to lower expenses.","Year-over-year, U.S. variable annuity account values declined 6% as surrenders more than offset strong U.S. equity market appreciation. The surrender rate rose to approximately 16% for the year, and U.S. variable annuity net outflows totaled $11.4 billion. The full surrender rate, which excludes partial surrenders and withdrawal benefits, was 10.9% for 2012, about 1.5 points higher than 2011.","As Liam mentioned, we are now beginning to launch the ESP program. In our initial phase, we will reach about 45% of eligible policyholders. Contract holder outreach began in late January, but it will take a few months for us to gauge customer response.","I'd now like to turn to VA results. On Slide 13, it provides a summary of the 2012 VA impacts, including hedging. The significant driver of the $716 million GAAP loss was yen hedge losses for our Japan VA book, where the corresponding liability is not fair valued under GAAP. As we have shared with you previously, our hedging programs are focused on economics through which neither GAAP nor statutory are a good estimate. Nevertheless, we know you are keenly interested in our statutory results.","The negative statutory impact in the quarter was $439 million pretax and before fee income. Net of hedging, we expected a modest negative statutory impact due to the improving market environment, which generated hedge losses. The final impact was higher due to about $300 million of nonmarket related impacts for assumption changes on reserves from increased expenses and the duration extension of the macro hedge program. I would note, the cost structure of our macro hedge program has improved, which is now estimated to be approximately $75 million to $100 million annual cash spend, down from the previous $200 million to $250 million.","Before moving on, I wanted to talk about the yen. We are encouraged by the weakening of the yen, which reduces net amount at risk and improves the net economics of the book. We also expect this may influence policyholder behavior at annuitization.","Based on the January 31 closing price of JPY 91.7 to the dollar, our net retained death benefit NAR declined 31% from $4.8 billion at year end to $3.3 billion, while the net income retained benefit NAR declined 42% from $3.3 billion to $1.9 billion. These are significant moves in the month of January.","The weaker yen will reduce the book's in the moneyness and could accelerate the runoff of this block, which ultimately reduce our economic liability to contract holders. We are encouraged by this trend, and we'll continue to maintain our dynamic hedging program for Japan.","Now I'm going to cover our capital position, which is summarized on Slide 14 along with our capital management plans. The Hartford's capital resources totaled $16.6 billion at December 31, 2012. This was a decrease from September, but was more than offset by the $1.7 billion statutory gain from the sales transactions.","The far right-hand column of Slide 14 shows that we would have reported an approximate $500 million increase in surplus if the transactions had closed by December 31 versus early January. Further down that column, you can see the pro forma capital position after the $1.5 billion dividend and return of surplus. Pro forma life statutory surplus would be about $6.6 billion and total capital resources would increase to $18.3 billion.","The end result is, our capital position remains strong. We estimate that the pro forma RBC for the Hartford life entities would be approximately 420%, taking into account the net reduction and required capital due to the business sales and the dividend payment. We intend to keep the life companies well capitalized for their business risk and consistent with their current ratings.","In addition to the transactions in the VA impacts, we moved the Mutual Funds legal entities out of the life stack to the life holding company, which reduced life surplus by $200 million.","Finally, other statutory impacts include deferred tax assets and additional reserves for fixed rate liabilities in this low-interest rate environment.","Total holding company cash and short-term investments at year end totaled $1.4 billion, equal to last quarter. This will increase to $2.9 billion after the dividend associated with the capital management plan. Let me turn to that now.","Last night, we announced that our capital plan had been reviewed and approved with the Connecticut Insurance Department and the 4 rating agencies. We expect to dividend $1.2 billion from our Connecticut domiciled life insurance companies in the first quarter of 2013. In addition, as a result of the Individual Life sale, we expect to dissolve our Vermont life reinsurance captive in the near term and return approximately $300 million of surplus to the holding company.","Let me now cover the capital management plan. As mentioned in the press release, we are launching a $500 million share repurchase program. We expect to execute the program ratably between now and year end 2014 at about $50 million to $100 million per quarter. Second, we will reduce the outstanding by approximately $1 billion. We currently expect to pay off the $320 million July 2013 and the $200 million March of 2014 maturities when due.","Our goal is to lower The Hartford's debt to total capital ratio into the low 20%, and over time, to improve the fixed charge coverage ratio to about 5 to 6x.","I'd now like to cover our 2013 outlook and summarize the key assumptions. These assumptions and other macroeconomic factors are included in the table on Slide 15.","Our outlook for 2013 core earnings is $1.375 billion to $1.475 billion, which includes the impact of lower investment yields and the $260 million to $280 million decline in Talcott Resolution's earnings due to the continued shrinkage of the VA books and the sale of Individual Life and Retirement Plans.","In our P&C and Group Benefits business, we expect to see improvements in our accident year combined ratios before catastrophe losses based on the pricing and underwriting margins we have achieved in 2012, which we expect to continue into 2013.","In P&C Commercial, our outlook calls for a 92.5% to 95.5% combined ratio compared with the 96.6% actual in 2012.","The Consumer Markets outlook is 89.5% to 92.5% compared with 90.8% in 2012. Keep in mind that we've increased the budgeted CAT loads for both Commercial Markets and Consumer Markets in 2013 as compared to 2012.","In Group Benefits, our loss ratio outlook is 77% to 80% compared with the 79.5% in 2012. We expect a mid- to high teens increase in core earnings as the impact of our pricing and underwriting initiatives flow through an additional year of earned premium. Doug will talk about this in a minute.","On a consolidated basis, our outlook assumes that corporate core losses decline by approximately $40 million in 2013, reflecting the sale of Woodbury and the reduced reduction of interest expense although actual amounts will depend on debt repayment timing and results. We'll update you on our progress on the debt plan as it is completed.","With respect to the share repurchase program, we plan to be active each quarter, and we will start buying back shares once the 10-K is filed.","Finally, I'd like to briefly review first quarter expectations. Our current outlook is for core earnings of $0.75 to $0.80 per diluted share, including budgeted CATs of $57 million after tax. The first quarter is normally a light CAT quarter and so far, that trend is holding. This amount does not include restructuring and other costs, which we expect to be in the range of $15 million to $20 million after tax.","We expect to report first quarter earnings in the last week of April, and as Liam mentioned, we look forward to seeing you in April for a financial and risk review of Talcott Resolution. A formal invitation will be sent out soon, but we will have that meeting on April 11 here at our Hartford campus.","To wrap up, we ended 2012 with significant accomplishments and we begin 2013 with momentum. We are focused on continuing our transformation of The Hartford by strengthening profit margins and improving operating efficiencies, and we have a balance sheet with increased capital flexibility. Finally, we are preparing to launch our capital management plan.","I'll now turn the call over to Doug to talk about the P&C Commercial and Group Benefits results and outlook. Doug?","Douglas G. Elliot","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to cover our P&C Commercial and Group Benefits results for the fourth quarter and full year 2012. I'll also provide some commentary on the marketplace, and our 2013 business objectives and outlook.","The P&C Commercial segment made strong pricing progress during 2012, including a very solid fourth quarter. We're confident that our end-market actions are driving improvement in our underwriting margins. And while these actions put pressure on our new business and retentions, our continuously improving risk analytics convince us that we're making the right tradeoffs on a daily basis.","Our all-in combined ratio for the year was 102.9%, a decrease of 1.7 points from the 104.6% in 2011. This margin improvement reflects our focus on pricing and targeted underwriting actions, as well as lower unfavorable prior year development versus 2011. I'll cover each of these shortly.","Catastrophes were a major contributor to losses during the fourth quarter due almost entirely to Storm Sandy. Current accident year CATs were 5.2 points on the full year 2012 combined ratio, which coincidentally, is the same as 2011.","For the year, CATs totaled $325 million pretax, with Storm Sandy contributing $207 million in the fourth quarter. Excluding prior year development and catastrophes, the combined ratio on P&C Commercial improved to 96.6% for the year, down slightly compared to 97.3% in 2011.","Our fourth quarter results further highlight the significant improvements we're seeing and the depth and speed of our actions since a year ago. The ex CAT, ex prior year combined ratio for the quarter was 97.8% versus 101.1% for the prior year period, a solid improvement. Our cumulative rate change in Middle Market over the last 6 quarters positions us among the more aggressive companies in the industry and sets us up well for margin improvement in 2013.","On an ex CAT basis only, the fourth quarter combined ratio was 98.9% versus 107.8% for the same period in 2011. Last year's fourth quarter included significant prior year reserve development in our workers' compensation line. Our pricing and underwriting actions have taken hold and are now beginning to earn through to the bottom line. We continue to refine our reserve position as we evaluate new data to make sure that we're on top of our indications. We see current actions very much as business as usual compared to last year's more significant prior and current accident year adjustments.","Unfavorable prior year development for the quarter was $18 million while full year was $72 million pretaxed. Both numbers compare favorably with 2011 actions.","Workers' compensation and auto liability were the primary drivers of loss development, while our general liability lines continued to release favorable news.","We achieved margin improvement across most lines of business but with a more intense focus on Middle Market worker's compensation. In this line, we achieved 15 points of written price increases for the fourth quarter and 14 points for the full year.","Using our risk analytical tools, we aggressively managed our mix of business as well to retain our better performing accounts while shedding our least performing, increasing margins overall.","Middle Market results, which are heavily influenced by our workers' compensation book of business, improved 3.6 points in 2012 to a full year combined ratio ex CAT, ex prior of 99.3%. Still more work to be done but terrific progress.","Another area for us of focus was in Middle Market has been the expansion of our property line. Despite the increased CAT losses over the last several years, we continue to see property as a strategic opportunity, balancing our portfolio and providing us an account-based value proposition to our agents and customers. David Carter, who joined us in late 2011, and our property team spent a good part of the year refining our property underwriting approach, updating our pricing and coverage, and driving the enhanced offering throughout our frontline organization.","As you may recall, at our December 2011 Investor Day, I talked about our long-term goal of moving property premiums from about 10% of our Middle Market commercial book to closer to 20% over time. We've made major strides to set the foundation for this change. This year, our new business writings in property were up nearly 28% and the total combined ratio for our property line was down more than 14 points.","Our Small Commercial segment had another strong year in 2012. As an aside, our Small Commercial business has now posted a combined ratio over 120-plus years, and even with the weather events of 2012, that record remains intact.","Workers' compensation in Small Commercial has performed extremely well over these years. However, this book of business, while still providing strong returns, has experienced margin compression in 2012 driven by not only the economic downturn but also some class and territorial factors. We've been aggressive in taking corrective actions. Written pricing was 6% for the full year and nearly 8% for the fourth quarter, double our targets just 12 months ago. We've adjusted our appetite in certain industry classes and implemented rigorous underwriting standards.","2012 also presented some challenging trends in auto liability for our Small Commercial segment. Similarity, we're addressing these trends with rate increases and tightening underwriting standards as well. Even with these headwinds, Small Commercial posted a 2012 full year ex CAT, ex prior year combined ratio of 91.1%. A strong result, but not quite at the 89.5% we achieved in 2011. For the quarter, the Small Commercial combined ratio ex CAT, ex prior was essentially flat at 92.8%.","In specialty, national casualty had an outstanding year with double-digit growth on both the top and bottom line. Our program in captive area had mix results with some fine tuning occurring on underperforming accounts and implementation of tighter underwriting standards for our auto liability programs.","Efforts to reposition our financial products business continue to be successful as we become a more Middle-Market focused insurer, driven less by the Fortune 500 and large financial institution segments.","Now let's turn back to overall P&C Commercial. Written premium was up 1 point in 2012, which is in line with our expectations and consistent with the pricing and underwriting actions we took during the year. While policy retentions held up well at 83% in Small Commercial and 77% in Middle Market, new business premium was down 8% and 21%, respectively, consistent with our margin objectives. We're very comfortable with this tradeoff, and we'll continue to balance retention, new business and pricing to improve margins in 2013.","Turning to 2013 overall, our goals remain consistent with 2012, continued focus on margin improvement, drive greater product diversification in property and general liability, and build on our momentum across the business portfolio.","We expect flat to modest growth in net written premiums across our Standard Commercial lines in 2013 as we continue to balance underwriting, pricing retention on our renewal book and exercise discipline in our new business efforts.","In specialty commercial, we expect the top line to decline by 7% to 10% as we continue to streamline our programs business and adjust the mix of our D&O book.","We expect to see further improvement in underwriting results in 2013 as we continue to earn in 2012 rate increases and focus on overall profitability. Our current outlook is for our 2013 ex CAT, ex prior year combined ratio range of 92.5% to 95.5% compared to 96.6% in 2012.","Offsetting some of the improvement in underwriting results is the increase in CAT load that Chris mentioned.","In P&C Commercial, our 2012 CAT budget was 1.9 points, but the actual results were 5.2. We are raising our CAT budget assumption to 2.5 points in 2013, reflecting higher loss assumptions as well as the expected growth of our property business.","Let me now turn to our Group Benefits segment, which ended the year on a high note, with core earnings of $39 million in the quarter.","As you know, we've been focused on improving the margins of this book of business for about 2 years now through rate increases, underwriting discipline and overall improvement in our sold price to guide on new and renewal business. Given the multi-year contract terms and long-term disability incident rates that remain at elevated levels, we still have work remaining to return our performance to more acceptable levels. However, we are pleased with progress to date and believe our actions are beginning to pay off.","In 2012, Group Benefits core earnings were $101 million, up 17% over 2011. The improvement has been driven by our pricing actions on both STD and LTD, as well as improving claim trends on our disability business. High unemployment levels continue to put pressure on disability experience. However, we're confident that our actions address margin challenges we face, and any improvement in the U.S. economy will add momentum to our efforts. Our disciplined rate actions have impacted the top line of this business, declining by 7% in 2012. We are intently watching the balance between renewal rate actions and persistency, as well as new business pricing and close rates as we continue to target improved profit margins. Although our core margins improved during 2012 to 2.4% from 1.9% in '11, we're still not at target levels of performance.","We had a very strong fourth quarter with earnings of $39 million. Adjusting for favorable disability seasonality and a onetime expense benefit, we ended the year at a quarterly run rate more in the $30 million range, still very solid.","We have more work ahead, but I'm encouraged that we're starting to see a more rational marketplace and confident we're taking appropriate steps to drive continued improvement in our performance.","Turning to 2013 for Group Benefits, we expect the top line to continue to decline. The early 2013 pricing view is extremely positive, with rates increasing in the 15% to 18% range for long-term disability. However, we did not renew our largest account effective January 1 after being unable to agree on terms and have not renewed a segment of our program business. These 2 decisions will contribute to an overall top line decline in 2013 of approximately 10% to 15%, but will have minimal impact on our bottom line performance.","In fact, we expect core earnings growth in the mid- to high teens despite the top line decline. Improved disability results, both STD and LTD, will be the primary driver between -- behind our 2013 earnings growth.","Overall, we think the loss ratio in 2013 will be in the range of 77% to 80% compared with 79.5% in 2012. Taken together, I'm very proud of the work our Commercial Markets team has done in the past year. We have improved alignment and accountability across our Property & Casualty divisions. We have made seamless leadership changes in 3 of our 4 divisions, all while continuing to build momentum in the market. Our outstanding claim operation continues to be a market leader. And we dealt with 2 years of significant CAT activity, but kept our focus on the fundamental blocking and tackling needed to improve P&C Commercial and Group Benefits results. That focus will remain unchanged, and we expect you'll see a continued progress in 2013.","I'll now turn the call over to Andy Napoli.","Andr\u00e9 A. Napoli","Thanks, Doug. 2012 was a year of significant progress for Consumer Markets in which we improved profitability and established the foundation for a return to growth in 2013. Our financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year were strong and demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy.","In 2011 and into 2012, our primary focus was restoring profitability to auto and homeowners in both our AARP Direct and the Agency channels. In 2010 and 2011, we were willing to accept decreases in retention in new business levels as we implemented above-market rate increases across the board.","As our margins improved, our pricing moderated, and we saw retention and new business begin to recover nicely in 2012.","Now let's shift to our fourth quarter results. Both auto and homeowners were significantly impacted by Storm Sandy, as current accident year catastrophes accounted for 13.8 combined ratio points in the quarter. Excluding CATs and prior year development, our combined ratio improved to 90.0% in the fourth quarter, a 2.4-point improvement from last year, a result we're very pleased with. In homeowners, the improvement was driven by strong earned pricing, coupled with favorable non-CAT weather frequency. Homeowners loss costs also dropped in the quarter due to lower severity of fire losses.","Auto margins also improved, driven by earned pricing increases and favorable liability frequency. The physical damage severity trend increases that began in the second half of 2011 appeared to have leveled off, increasing only slightly in the fourth quarter.","In the quarter, written premium was flat over last year. Auto policy retention improved to 86%, up 3 points over last year and 1 point sequentially. Homeowners improved as well, up 4 points from last year and 1 point sequentially. Auto new business was flat to last year, while homeowners was up 30%, which was driven by the rollout of our Hartford Home Advantage product, most significantly in California where we have very favorable margins.","Now let's shift to Consumer's full year results. Our combined ratio improved about 4 points to 97.4%, driven by an almost 19-point improvement in homeowners, which ended the year at 97.0%, a nice improvement but still work to do to achieve its target.","The combined ratio for auto deteriorated slightly from 2011, finishing at 97.6%. This was largely due to the trend of higher physical damage severity that has since made it into our pricing models.","I'd like to note that these results combined AARP Direct and Agency. AARP auto is performing better and finished near its combined ratio target, reflecting favorable loss experience inherent with this preferred customer segment.","Shifting to growth for the full year, we continued to drive new business in our AARP Agency channel. We grew written premium in AARP Agency by $64 million or 89%, authorizing more than 6,400 agents to write the AARP product.","As mentioned previously, a more -- a majority of AARP members prefer to shop for their insurance through a local agent. And with our AARP auto and home programs now in market across the country, we continue to be very excited about the upside potential of this channel.","Top line trends for AARP Direct have also improved dramatically from a year ago, benefiting from a 2-point lift in both auto and homeowners policy retention, along with improvements in overall marketing effectiveness.","We're growing top line in markets where we expect to be profitable, and AARP members across both channels now accounts for 78% of total written premium, up from 72% 3 years ago.","Now let's move to our 2013 outlook. In 2013, we expect to return to total written premium growth with an estimate of flat to plus 2%, driven by growth in both AARP Agency and AARP Direct.","Growth in AARP Agency will be driven by more deeply engaging our authorized AARP agents as they capitalize on the value proposition offered by The Hartford and the AARP brand. Within AARP Direct, we expect strong new business growth and further improvement in premium retention as we continue to take mid-single-digit written pricing increases in auto and high single-digit written pricing increases in homeowners.","In both auto and homeowners, pricing is being taken to stay ahead of loss cost trends in such a way to achieve or maintain our combined ratio targets.","In terms of auto profitability, we expect an additional point of ex CAT current accident year improvement in 2013. We believe auto frequency will continue to be favorable and that auto severity, both in bodily injury and auto physical damage, will be moderate.","For homeowners, it's important to note that non-CAT weather frequency in 2012 was much better than the historical average, and we expect non-CAT weather loss cost to revert to a more typical level in 2013. Thus, even though we're taking written rate increases in excess of loss cost trends, our outlook calls for a slightly higher ex CAT loss ratio for homeowners in 2013. We expect written pricing increases for homeowners will be a bit higher in 2013 as our rate indications reflect higher CAT loads after several years of damaging tornado and hail events.","In addition to pricing, we've taken action to mitigate risk in homeowners, instituting higher win deductibles and introducing roof value schedules that adjust the claim payout based on the age of the roof. All in, we expect the combined ratio before catastrophes and prior development to fall within a range of 89.5% to 92.5%.","In closing, we're very pleased with the results in Consumer Markets for 2012, and our ability to improve profitability while positioning the division for growth in targeted markets in 2013, and we began the year with positive momentum and focused execution.","I'll now turn the call back over to Liam.","Liam E. McGee","Thanks, Andy. Thanks to Doug and Chris as well. As you heard from our comments, this was a good quarter for The Hartford and a strong end to a transformational year, and we all feel very good about our progress in the ongoing businesses.","So operator, let's turn it now over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","My first question is just on the earnings guidance. I guess for Chris, can you just remind us the -- how much of a back-end loading we should expect to get from the expense savings here? Maybe if you can frame it in the way of, how are we going to start out in 1Q, where are we going to be by 4Q in terms of the bottom line benefit of cost saves? That's my first question.","Christopher John Swift","Sure. Happy to, Tom. I think just to remind everyone, we had an $850 million total plan and we think about $500 million is already out with the transactions plus cuts we made at the end of 2012. We have $285 million to take out this year. I would say that it is more back-ended because there is a little bit of an expense drag in the first couple quarters primarily. So it's hard to slope precisely, but I would make -- weight more the expense saves. It will start to come out in the second half for the year.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So Chris, that -- the $285 million, is that from now to the end of the year? That's going to be the bottom line pretax benefit that we would expect to see by the end of 4Q?","Christopher John Swift","Tom, those are the gross saves that we need to achieve that we set for ourselves in essence to make up for the lost revenue. So I don't think of it as all dropping to the bottom line, or a very little dropping to the bottom line, in fact, because those are -- revenues and expenses have gone away, and that is the corporate overhead we need to cut in essence to maintain our existing revenue streams. Now there is an incremental goal. In there, you have about a written [ph] $80 million that will improve margins overall. But the vast majority was to cut our overhead expenses in relation to revenues that are going away.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, understood, Chris. I just wanted to make sure because I know you're going to lose the associated revenues in 1Q, but that you would expect to essentially get that back by the end of 2013. Is that the way we should be thinking about it?","Christopher John Swift","Liam addressed this...","Liam E. McGee","Yes, about 90% of the stranded costs, Tom, that were not transferred to the buyers will be out by the end of this calendar year, the other 10% will come out early in the first quarter. And then, and I will -- I want to be very clear on this. We have this down to the dollar, to the head. We know exactly where it's coming from. We have a very disciplined plan. Yes, this will occur.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I appreciate that. So the -- just moving on to the net amount of risk improvement in Japan. I just want to understand from your standpoint, what does this practically mean for you? Because obviously, when you see a reduction in net amount of risk of that magnitude from 3Q to now, it's been cut more than half, you would sort of assume that an associated liability would be going down pretty meaningfully and potential capital lift or capital getting freed up, but then you have the complexity of money being tied up in captives here. So anyway, just, I guess broad question, what does this mean for you in terms of the yen weakening and the reduction in net amount of risk and the liability from a practical standpoint?","Liam E. McGee","Well, clearly, the high level, and I'm sure Chris and Doug may have some -- their own perspectives, Tom. At a high level, prima fascia, the economics of the book have improved very significantly. And as I commented, I think the general market consensus is the yen, as it relates to dollar and euro, is likely, worse case, to stay where it is and perhaps even weaken further. So the economics are better. I think you're well aware that our hedging program is very dynamic. And so as the yen weakens, it enables us to take more risks, if you will, which gives us a greater upside. And clearly, as I commented and Chris reiterated in his remarks, the improving economics should give us a greater ability to consider potential derisking transactions either to reduce the risk or permanently move the risk. So I think, from all those perspectives, and ultimately, as these things annuitize, and if they annuitize at these kind of values over the next 4 years, that's also attractive to us from an economic and cash flow perspective. So I think we're quite encouraged by this. I think that the magnitude of the reduction and the net amount of risk, I think, does give shareholders a view of -- with more normal yen-dollar, yen-euro, the economics are much more manageable for us.","Christopher John Swift","Yes, I think you're right on, Liam. And I think, Tom, also, I think the April Investor Day, the real intent is to dive deeper with Beth and her team into exactly some of those questions, how we see these blocks running off, policyholder behavior, sensitivities, more economic values. So stay tuned. But we'll try to be much more clear of why we think the net economics of these blocks are improving significantly, as Liam said.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then just my last follow-up on that is, Chris, you had mentioned the annual cash spend on hedging has gone from $200 million to $250 million to $75 million to $100 million. Is that mainly the currency hedge getting -- being able to hedge less, it's -- or it's cheaper, or is that not related to the currency?","Christopher John Swift","Not related to the currency. That reference, I thought the words that I used were macro hedged. So as the macro equity protection that -- with Bob Rupp and the team, we just made much more economics virtually for the same amount of coverage. So we cheapened up that program, and the risk management techniques of managing Japan is still our dynamic program, where we manage interest rates, currency and equity dynamically.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And I believe, you had said you were spending $200 million on a currency hedge or so annually, is that still about the same?","Christopher John Swift","No, never talked in those terms, Tom.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And any guidance you can give us on what you're spending on currency hedges for Japan?","Christopher John Swift","Again, I think, we could give you general views but we'd like to spend a little bit more time with you in April -- so we save that for April, and we could be more scenario specific, and then you could see the effects of the hedging programs and the economics that emerge.","Liam E. McGee","Tom, this is Liam. Just one final comment I make. I think the ability to purchase effectively the same protection on our macro hedge at half or less of our historic cost, I hope it is an indication to investors on how far along our risk management has come in the last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Liam, I'm very glad to hear you're feeling better as I'm sure everyone else is.","Liam E. McGee","Thank you, Jay. Very kind of you. I feel -- I actually feel great and very blessed.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Glad to hear it. With regard to the capital deployment, the proceeds from the sale of the units was around $2.2 billion, and it appears currently around $1.5 billion of that is being deployed into debt repurchase and share buybacks. So I think what a lot of people are wondering is, why hold back the $700 million?","Liam E. McGee","Well, you're correct, Jay, that, first of all, we presented management and the board's capital management plan, and work collaboratively with our regulators, and we're gratified that they approved the plan that we presented to them. I'll just go back to the concept, which I think I've been very consistent about over the last 3 quarters, is, first of all, we are going to do share repurchases, the $0.5 billion that we have outlined, which clearly will be accretive for shareholders. Second of all, we will reduce the holding company debt by $1 billion. A couple of additional perspectives, as I make on that. First of all, as you recall, The Hartford, during the financial crisis, significantly levered up, number one. Second of all, the foregone earnings from the sold businesses require us to delever a little bit. And third, we do want, we've said all along that we want to be more of a P&C centric, a leading P&C-oriented company, and we want to get our leverage down, as Chris and I both said, in the low 20s and our debt service coverage up in that 5 to 6 range, also accretive for shareholders. $55 million reduction in our interest cost as well. I've always been clear that it was likely that we were going to preserve capital in our life subsidiaries, which I think is even more important now with the improving markets that we just discussed with Tom when transactions, whether it'd be customer offers either in the U.S. or Japan, potential permanent transactions or other risk reduction transactions, may be more available and we want to be ready to act as soon as those things present themselves. So I think this is a very thoughtful, balanced plan. It is very friendly to shareholders. And that third element of being able to either reduce or permanently eliminate VA liabilities is also very good for shareholders. I think you'd agree. So I think it's thoughtful, it's balanced. We feel very good about it. And I remind you, as I said, I think Chris alluded to it, our intention particularly with the historic capital generating ability of our go-forward businesses, as well as what we expect will be some success reducing or permanently eliminating VA liabilities of these market values, our intention is to continue to have a consistent capital management approach of returning excess capital as appropriate to our shareholders. But this is our plan now for '13 and '14, and we feel good about it.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. On the variable annuity guarantee exposure, last night, as I'm sure you saw, Berkshire Hathaway announced a deal with Cigna to reinsure the remainder of those guaranteed minimum benefits. Would something like that have an attraction to Hartford as well, knowing that already a good portion of it is -- of that exposure is reinsured?","Liam E. McGee","Well, at a high level, Beth may have some comments. I would say, first of all, obviously, I can't comment on conversations we may or may not be having for obvious reasons. What I can assure you of, particularly with the capital flexibility and I think more normal market scenario we have today, Beth and her team are leaving no stone unturned in terms of ways to move the risk off or reduce the risk, which very well could include transactions. Beth, anything you'd like to add?","Beth A. Bombara","Yes, I think Liam has said it very well. He said from the beginning that we are open to looking at transactions where they make sense, so we're -- our view of the underlying economics are there, and we can maximize the use of our resources and our capital to reduce our risk. So we continue to work with our advisers, and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities in that space. I think seeing transactions getting done, seeing different players that are interested in these exposures, I think, is all positive for us.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just a quick one for Chris or Sabra. The corporate expense in 2013, that's going to -- I believe you said $40 million less. Is that $40 million less than the $315 million that was the full year 2012 core corporate impact?","Christopher John Swift","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel with Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Let me echo Jay's comments. Liam, I'm very happy to hear you're in good health. A couple -- just one quick follow-up on Tom's question about the expense saves or cuts. I just wanted to clarify. So should we think about $285 million as the total expense saved for all of 2013, and should we think about that as a run rate by the fourth quarter? So something like $70-or-so million by the fourth quarter?","Christopher John Swift","No. That -- you think about that as the actual cuts that will happen in 2013, so that's a run rate reduction that will be achieved by the end of '13.","Liam E. McGee","John, our commitment was -- we've all been associated with selling businesses and not getting the costs out. Our commitment was we're going to get all the costs out, and so we're -- that's why we've been so clear about it. And again, I'll reiterate, we're very disciplined about it in the company. Those -- this will be a cost neutral exercise at the end of the day.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Fully appreciate that. The guidance for 2013, what -- if you could give us sort of a modest ROE range, what type of ROE are you expecting to achieve?","Liam E. McGee","John, I think at a high level, we're going to give you some more details in ROE in April. I think '13 is a year where if we see ROE increase, it will be very modest. The real increase in ROE is going to occur in '14  -- in '14 and 15. We'll show you that. You should expect pretty significant increases in ROE in '14 and '15. But with all the moving parts, the kick-in over time of the capital management actions, the loss of the earnings, and as Chris said, a bit of a lag in getting the costs out and we've increased our CAT load as well. I think '13 is a year where if we see ROE increase, it will be modest.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just finally. Given all the shifts in capital in the life side, in particular, reflecting the business unit divestitures, the dividend, et cetera, is it fair for us to assume that the vast majority of what's remaining pro forma at $6.6 billion or $6.7 billion of life statutory capital relates to the runoff U.S. VA business? Or is there something else still remaining in there, the Group Benefits business or other?","Christopher John Swift","John, I think you're right. We tried to talk about this the last time. We think of sort of $6.6 billion as the new beginning normal, $4 billion for the life statutory surplus. Of that, approximately $1.5 billion, it would be, I'll call it, allocated to Group Benefits, and there's a little bit allocated to the reinsurance sort of recoverables from our transaction. So that's how we think about it. And then, we have obviously the holding company liquidity also. But from a statutory bluebook side, that's how we think about it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Finkelstein with Evercore Partners.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I've got a few. I guess my first question, kind of back to Gallagher's question a little bit. And maybe the way I'll frame it out is, back in -- what was it, October of 2011, you gave some scenarios around the Japan block and kind of a benign scenario, as well as a kind of an adverse scenario. The question I would ask is when you look at where things are today, the yen kind of JPY 93, market is higher, et cetera, should we expect a meaningful improvement in that net cashflow in that benign scenario in the Japan block?","Christopher John Swift","It's a definition of meaningful. It is improved, and I would say, particularly, if the trend continues, it can be meaningful. But it is a definite improvement, and again, something we could talk more about in April, and we plan to. So if you could let us update our complete models and present them to you, I think that would be very helpful.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then Chris, just how do we think about statutory capital generation in the life company going forward? Obviously, you've had some expenses in annuities, markets are a tailwind, you've got Group Benefits improvements. I mean, how should we think about free cash generation in the life business?","Christopher John Swift","I'm more positive on it, particularly at these market levels and condition. You've always heard us talk about the low interest rates and sort of the constraints that, that has and some of the additional liabilities we put up at the end of the year. But I would say, there's more tailwind mark to have a modest expansion in statutory surplus going forward in '13. Beyond that, a lot depends just on market conditions and policyholder behavior. But I'm encouraged with the potential to do increase in gross surplus in 2013.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I guess, just a follow-up on that. I mean, just if things kind of trended from here the way you would ordinarily expect them or how you normally model them, would you expect the VA business to generate capital in '13?","Christopher John Swift","Yes. I would say I'm not hesitating, I'm just trying to quantify it from a range. I mean, it's in the range of a couple hundred million we could generate from the VA book over time. And then I'd remind you, that the life -- the Group Benefit operations are also in there, but we do have some interest sensitive liabilities that will still feel some pressure from interest rates. So I'm trying to be balanced on the positives but still, the existing pressure on certain blocks of business.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one quick final question is, I saw the cut in the macro hedge costs more than in half. Are there any changes in how we should think about the below the line kind of structural loss on the dynamic hedge, which I think historically has been around 15 bps? Or is that about the same going forward?","Christopher John Swift","On the dynamic program was your question or the macro?","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","No, you told us the macro, I'm thinking more about the dynamic.","Christopher John Swift","Right. The dynamic for both pieces, Japan and, I'll call it, the U.S., I would say, are generally remain consistent. And we've talked generally about it in total, about 40 bps for both programs.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Right. But the macros -- I assume the macro is much lower than the 25 that you've historically talked about, is that wrong?","Christopher John Swift","The macro, we just said, was $75 million to $100 million in annual spend. I mean, I think you could do the translation, which less is coming down. But the dynamic program for the U.S. VA block and the Japan block still is in -- around 40 bps.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions here. First, with respect to the capital management, one quick question, Chris. You've got like, I guess, $520 million of debt coming due over the next 2 years. How do you plan on dealing with the remaining $40 million? Do you have any call provisions in any of your debt? Or will you have to go into the marketplace and buy it?","Christopher John Swift","I'd rather not be too specific. It really involves a tender process. So we're going to be active here in the near term, but we are looking at trying to reduce that debt that ultimately is NPV positive compared to any premium that we might pay.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So in the $1 billion -- the $1 billion is a part reduction, right, so it could cost you a little more than $1 billion to actually reduce it?","Christopher John Swift","Yes. So the $520 million is the component of the $1 billion, and then the rest would come to reducing the amount that we will tender for.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then the next question, I'm just curious to know you've kind of carried [ph] by this, how did you come up with the $500 million of share buyback by year-end '14, particularly given the additional liquidity, you've got the holding company and the capital generation you'll have over the next 2 years, which should be pretty substantial?","Liam E. McGee","I think I'll just go back to what I said. We're really working -- management working with our board. I believe this is the most prudent, balanced approach. All 3 elements of it are very accretive for shareholders. And for the reasons that I noted, both the amount of leverage that the company added during the crisis, the earnings loss from the sold businesses and our desire to get a balance sheet that is consistent with our go-forward strategy of being a P&C-centric company, as Chris -- I think, as Chris has noted, the $1 billion was the right number. We thought $0.5 billion was the appropriate number for buybacks. I think, as Chris has said, we'll be pretty methodical about that. And then lastly, I think, for reasons that should be even more apparent now, preserving incremental capital in the life subsidiaries to potentially do the most accretive thing, which is to either reduce or eliminate VA, and particularly Japan VA risk, we thought was a really good balance, and as I said earlier, I feel really good about the plan. And then I'd reiterate for the reasons that I said earlier, we -- Chris and I intend to have a consistent capital management approach of returning excess capital as appropriate to shareholders going forward once this plan is complete.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just a quick question with respect to the specialty business, Doug, it was -- wonder if you could tell a little bit about what needs to be done to really improve the profitability there. Is it a pricing issue? Is it a risk selection issue? And how quickly do we think we can get those underlying combines down into, call it, mid-90s area, where they probably need to be?","Douglas G. Elliot","Yes, good question, Brian. And let me just give you some context. I think this will help all of you think through this. Inside our specialty businesses, we really have 4 businesses. We've got our national account business, which largely is an excess -- casualty excess workers' comp line. In the program captive area, we have some dollar 1 programs, but we also have pretty significant excess casualty programs in there as well. And then, obviously, we have our D&O financial products business. When you look at the 4 businesses, 2 of those businesses have target combined ratios for our levels excess 100% right? So we have a mixed component of businesses in there. Our national account casualty business for returns in the teens has target combined ratios in excess of 107% to 110%. So when you look at combined ratio, you can't just think of specialty as, okay, where is my D&O book running? So I give you that as an outdrop. Number two, our national account book had a terrific 2012. We're very satisfied with our returns. We feel good about that book. And as I've mentioned, we have work right now underway inside our program and excess program captive group as well. And last but not the least, our D&O book needs work just as others in the industry would describe as well. So we are attempting to achieve rate. Our rate incline so far for 2012 fourth quarter in the mid single-digits, but we're not satisfied yet with our combined ratio performance in our professional practice.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of questions. First, on the workers' comp, obviously, you had a little bit of adverse development, not that much, but still it is kind of an ongoing drag. And I'm wondering if you could talk about what's happening from a claim standpoint. You had talked about frequency popping up, I guess, about 1.5 years ago. What are you seeing these days?","Douglas G. Elliot","Jay, this is Doug. You're right. We have worked hard at our workers' comp book, both actions in the marketplace and also books and records relative to reserving. I would say this in terms of frequency severity. Our frequency has really settled down very well in our Middle Market based on the actions and drivers that we've taken over the last 5 or 6 quarters. We're seeing a little bit of continued frequency in Small Commercial. I think, we've got our focus around a few key programs that's driving it and a little bit on the geography side, but what -- we have started to take steps to address it, and that's where that margin pressure has come from in small, albeit, very, very solid returns still in that small arena. So I feel like comparing where we were 12 months ago to where we are today, I feel so much better about our comp progress. More work ahead but significant strides in the last 12 months.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And then on the -- just the buyback portion of the capital plan. I could see, over time, why you would want to be consistent in your buyback activities if it's based on earnings. But in this case, it seems to me, you've got capital free and clear, it's at the holding company, you don't need it. Why wait 2 years to return a relatively modest amount of capital to shareholders when doing it quicker would be even more accretive, if, in fact, it is free and clear?","Christopher John Swift","Jay, it's Chris. Thank you for your perspective. I think, as Liam said, we do feel good with the overall plan on debt and equity, the priorities and sort of the amounts that we're starting with. Consistency portion is important to us. I think to your specific point, I think, you just need to keep in context that we're still managing large risk positions in our runoff block. And so we're looking...","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You have capital in the runoff business to handle that.","Christopher John Swift","Yes, but we're still managing to stress scenarios. That would indicate that we still need to move capital and liquidity around the organization if those stress scenarios emerge. So I understand your perspective when you see it. But when you stress the organization the way we share with the regulators and the rating agencies, the plan that we adopted is still the prudent one for 2013 and as we head into 2014.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then if I could ask one last question, I don't want to overstep my bounds here. But you have seen 2 other transactions where runoff businesses have been eliminated or sold to another party. What makes your runoff business different than Sun Life or Cigna's that makes it more of a challenge for you to complete a similar transaction?","Liam E. McGee","Well, Jay, I think that's a big leap to assume that's the case. Just because we haven't done one, it doesn't mean it's more or less challenging than those that have been done, number one. We certainly are well aware of the unique characteristics of certainly, the Sun Life transaction have been done for a while and what we've learned of the Cigna transaction. And again, I don't think it's appropriate for us to talk about the nature of discussions that we may be having. So what I can say is what I think Chris and I and Beth have said pretty repeatedly, as you can assume, we're talking to the parties we should be talking to or the advisers we should be talking to, and if there's a transaction that makes sense for us and for shareholders, we'll do it.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So there's nothing specific about your business that really prevents you from engaging in such a transaction?","Liam E. McGee","I think there are nuances and idiosyncrasies to every book. But at a -- in a general sense, no.","Christopher John Swift","Jay, I would add a little color that -- and Liam's right. I mean, we're -- Beth and the team are very proactive. But as we've talked about it, the book really has 3 components, Japan, VA, U.S. VA and a big fixed block of annuities. Those characteristics are different so there isn't going to be one holistic transaction that just sort of says, yes, here it is. I think, structurally, we have some short-term limitations given that we write the Group Benefits business in life legal entities. And if you look at the deal besides the Cigna deal that you referenced, those involved legal entities, where acquirers wanted legal entities and structures to absorb. We can't do a legal entity deal right now until we deal with the Group Benefit business and where it's being written. So there are some short-term constraints. But over the long-term, you ought to think in terms of what we're thinking along those 3 blocks in trying to have buyers that have appetite for Japanese exposures, U.S. VA exposures and fixed annuity exposures here in the U.S.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bass with Citigroup.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So first question, can you just talk a little bit about how much capital do you expect the core ongoing business kind of x the runoff to generate in 2013?","Christopher John Swift","Erik, I would estimate that the core P&C business would generate about $900 million of statutory surplus. I would estimate that the Group Benefits business would generate approximately $100 million to $125 million. And then what we did with our life Mutual Funds operations, moved it up to the life holding company. I would say that the cash-based earnings that we could have access to, thereabout $75 million.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then just one follow-up on -- Chris, I guess, on the point you are just making on kind of the moving of the Group Benefits business. If you could talk a little bit about maybe what that process is and then any other actions you're taking within kind of the U.S. life subs to isolate and consolidate the variable annuity blocks, and maybe a timeline for potentially completing this.","Christopher John Swift","I think what I would just like to share, Erik, is that the Group Benefits business is strategically important to us. It's written in 2 life legal entities currently, and we're figuring out what is the right structure going forward. So there isn't anything sort of an aha here. This is just what legal entity are we going to use to write Group Benefits. And we're going to align it to Doug and his management team going forward. It's just as simple as that.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then on the annuity side. The Japan block is standalone, but the, I think, the other -- the U.S. piece is in -- is it 3 different entities currently?","Christopher John Swift","Yes. We have 3 different U.S. legal entities that write that. And we're looking at, obviously, a lot of different strategies to how to manage legal entities and books of business over the long term. But once -- if we make any changes, we'll let you know, but we're always looking to how to be more efficient with our operating structures, our hedging programs and long-term risk management.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel with Langen McAlenney.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","On the migration to becoming a Property-Casualty company when you grow up, I mean, you talked about the -- getting your debt in line with P&C peers. I'm curious on where the investment portfolio stands on that migration? And just looking at your BBB's are 26%, your bigs [ph] are 5%. You've got 3% in CDOs. Travelers, which is probably at one end of the spectrum, is at 9% BBBs, 3% junk and no CDOs. You obviously needed to get your ROE higher to -- so there's a tension on that point. So are you closer to using an AIG game plan of cranking up risk here on the margin? Or do you want to move more towards Travelers over time, and how long would that take?","Christopher John Swift","Bob, it's Chris. I would say, we're trying to have a prudent portfolio. We probably favor a Travelers model long term. There are some holdover and transitional issues as we migrate out of some of our life books and assets that were retained or transferred back to us that the buying parties didn't want to have. So I think we'll balance all that out over the next couple of years here. But I think, Brion Johnson and his team at HIMCO have the appropriate mindset to run a P&C and Group Benefit-orientated group going forward. I would say, again, with that Group Benefit business, there are longer duration liabilities that we need to continue to manage there similar to the workers' comp line. So the component could be just slightly different, but think more along the Travelers model long term.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","So let's say, a couple of years from now, what do you think BBB's would be versus 26% today, down a couple of points or down 5 to 10 or?","Christopher John Swift","Bob, I'm just trying to get through this month and next month, so I'm not really focusing on '14 yet where it's at. But we'll see if maybe, at Investor Day, we can address that. But I don't have a vision right now for you.","Beth A. Bombara","Thank you. Thank you all, for joining us today. I know it's been a longer call than usual, and we appreciate all your attention. If you have any follow-up calls, please reach out to the Investor Relations department. And again, I'd like to add my invitation to you all to join us on April 11 in Hartford for an Investor Day focused on Talcott Resolution. Thank you all, and have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"10743":["The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.

My name is Sean. I\u2019ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Hartford's First Quarter 2015 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Head of Investor Relations, Sabra Purtill, you may begin your conference.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you, Sean. Good morning and welcome, everyone, to The Hartford's first-quarter 2015 financial results webcast. Our news release, investor financial supplement, first-quarter financial results presentation, and Form 10-Q were all filed yesterday afternoon and they are available on our website. Our speakers today include Chris Swift, Chairman and CEO of The Hartford; Doug Elliot, President; and Beth Bombara, CFO.","Following their prepared remarks, we will have about 30 minutes for Q&A. Just a few notes before Chris begins. Today's call includes forward-looking statements as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results could be materially different.","We do not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements and investors should consider the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from these statements. A detailed description of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our SEC filings, which are available on our website.","Our presentation today also includes several non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations and reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure, are included in our SEC filings, as well as in the news release and the financial supplement. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher Swift","Thank you, Sabra. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Last night, we reported financial results for the first quarter. Our results show that we\u2019re off to a good start for the year, and that we are managing the increasing challenges in the marketplace.","We continued to execute on our strategy and make progress across all of our businesses. Compared to the same period last year, core earnings per share for the first quarter 2015 rose 11%, adjusted for net favorable items in both periods, and book value per share, excluding AOCI, increased 3%. In addition, we delivered a 12 month core earnings ROE of 8.1%.","Our operating businesses performed well, despite low interest rates in an increasingly competitive pricing environment. Let me share a few highlights from the quarter. In PMC, our combined ratio of 91.7 is essentially flat compared to prior year when adjusted for CATs, prior-year development, and the New York assessments.","This is a good result, given the weather conditions, and Doug will discuss more about each line of business in a few moments. In group benefits, core earnings margin increased eight tenths of a point to 5.9%, with outstanding first quarter sales that increased 67%. These results reflect our focus on pricing and underwriting, as well as superior service and claims handling. Our mutual fund businesses generated 28% growth in sales and more than $500 million in positive net flows in the quarter.","In addition, we continued to successfully manage the runoff of Talcott, with a $500 million return of capital during the quarter, and year-over-year declines in variable and fixed annuity contract counts. In addition, we are pleased with the upgrades to our ratings from S&P and Moody's, which we received last week. These upgrades represent a notable milestone for us and earn an affirmation of our improved balance sheet, operating performance, and financial flexibility.","As we look ahead, we are committed to expanding our capabilities to support our growth. This includes making investments in our technology platform, where we have a number of significant programs in flight. Two of these programs are currently being deployed and are having a very positive impact on our distribution relationships, and the customer experience.","First is our new P&C claim system, which continued its rollout across the country. Our colleagues continue to comment on their vastly improved user experience, and how that translates into improved customer experience. With enhanced data collection, we are improving our ability to assign the right expertise to resolve claimant needs in a timely and supportive manner.","Second, is our new consolidated underwriting desktop for middle market. We have modernized our underwriting process with this application, delivering immediate benefits in quote turnaround time and communication with our agents.","Over time, this platform is the vehicle by which we will deliver new tools and decision support to all our underwriters, which is an exciting step forward. I\u2019m happy about the rollout of these important new technologies and look forward to updating you on our continued progress in the future. One of our strengths at The Hartford is our deep pool of talent.","Since our last call, we have made some leadership changes that I wanted to share with you. David Robinson will assume the role of General Counsel when Allan Cresco steps down from the position at the end of May. David has been with us since 2006, and has a broad range of legal and business experiences, including playing a key role in our transformation, and we welcome him to the executive leadership team. I would like to acknowledge and thank Allan for his loyal service to our Company.","Few people have played such an influential role in our Company as Allan, who served as General Counsel to three CEO\u2019s. And helped us to manage through difficult times and a successful transformation. We thank him for his countless contributions and wish him all the best.","We also appointed Ray Sprague as permanent Head of Personal Lines. Ray joined The Hartford in 1985 and has held leadership positions in both strategy and property and casualty, including running our market-leading small commercial business. Personal lines is an important part of our strategy and we remain committed to improving our performance as we go forward.","In closing, I want to reiterate that the first quarter was a good start to 2015. I am confident that we are well-positioned to navigate the more competitive market in a continued low interest rate environment. We will maintain our underwriting and pricing discipline, while also investing in our businesses with a goal of increasing ROE and book value per share to drive shareholder value creation. Thank you. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Doug. Doug?","Doug Elliot","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Our property and casualty and group benefits businesses started 2015 with solid results for the first quarter. Retentions continue to be strong, helping to post modest top-line growth. Loss trend in our major lines of business remain benign and within our pricing targets.","And in general, our operating performance was very steady, an outcome we are pleased with. We are locked in our core metrics and performance indicators, as we continue to balance margins and growth amid increasing competition. We\u2019re focused on new business risk selection, retention of our best performing accounts, and overall rate adequacy.","The marketplace has grown more competitive over the last quarter. We\u2019re beginning to find that there are fewer new business opportunities transacting at our target return levels. We\u2019re also seeing more pressure on our renewals, as the rate adequacy of our book has clearly improved in recent years. We are going to compete aggressively, however, we\u2019re not going to chase business outside of our underwriting and profitability parameters.","Our intense operating focus over the last several years, as well as the investments we\u2019ve been making in product, underwriting and technology, position us on a solid foundation to compete effectively under various market dynamics.","I\u2019ll share a bit more about this as I recap the first quarter performance for our business units. In commercial lines, we delivered core earnings of $234 million with a combined ratio of 95.9. This was an earnings decrease of $30 million from first quarter 2014, largely driven by last year's one-time expense benefit from changes in New York Workers' Compensation Board assessments.","Adjusting for this item, our combined ratio improved four tenths of a point. Renewal written pricing in standard commercial lines was 3% for the quarter. This is actually down about half a point from fourth quarter, although both quarters rounded to 3%.","Overall pricing is being buoyed somewhat, by increases in commercial auto. In workers' compensation, improved rate adequacy for the industry has resulted in greater competition, especially in middle market, where our renewal written pricing of 1% was down just over 2 points from fourth quarter. In small commercial, workers' compensation renewal written pricing was 2%, declining by just half a point.","Our loss trends in worker\u2019s compensation continued to be favorable, and our returns are within our target range. Catastrophe losses for the first quarter 2015 were very similar to what we experienced a year ago, although storms this year were much heavily concentrated in the north-east than last year's widespread activity.","We again saw higher loss activity in commercial lines rather than personal lines, largely attributable to the different geographic concentrations in these businesses. In small commercial, written premium for the quarter grew 5%, with strong policy retention and a slight uptick in new business. The underlying combined ratio, excluding catastrophes and prior-year development, was 89.6, up four tenths of a point versus last year, after adjusting for the New York Assessment benefit.","The increase reflects higher expenses as we continue to make investments to improve the customer experience, enhance our products, deploy new technology features, and add local sales representatives. We also saw an increase in agency supplemental compensation costs, driven by improvements in our loss ratio. We remain very pleased with our overall margins in this business and the capabilities we\u2019re bringing to market.","Catastrophes hit our small commercial business a bit harder in this quarter versus last year, largely the result of winter storms here in the north-east, where we have a higher concentration of business. As always, our claims response was outstanding and we will continue to evolve our catastrophe modeling and pricing to keep pace with emerging weather patterns.","In middle market, we posted another solid quarter, with an underlying combined ratio of 93.7, improving 1.1 points after adjusting for the New York Assessment benefit in 2014. Much of this gain is coming from margin improvement in workers' compensation, as our pricing and underwriting mix actions earn through the book of business.","Written premium growth was 3%, as retentions remain steady and new business production benefited from a higher mix of larger accounts. As I mentioned in my opening, we\u2019re seeing a slowdown in our new business pipeline for accounts that meet our underwriting profile. Both the selection of new accounts and the renewal of existing accounts is driven by the talent, portfolio management tools, and data analytics we\u2019ve enhanced in recent years.","We will continue to write business when it\u2019s well priced, and exercise the discipline to walk away when it\u2019s not. Middle market commercial auto has been an area that has not met our return targets. In particular, our corrective actions have taken longer to gain traction and show the improvements we expected.","Price increases in the quarter were in the high single digits, and we\u2019re continuing to push even harder to achieve a rate adequacy in this line. Within specialty commercial, the underlying combined ratio of 99.1 improved versus prior year, after adjusting for the New York Assessment benefit in 2014. At this combined ratio, the overall business is operating within our target return range, reflecting particularly strong performance in bond and financial products.","Favorable prior-year development in financial products contributed to specialty commercials' combined ratio of 94.5. D&O claim trends since the financial crisis have been more favorable than our initial estimates, and we continue to see strong performance in the E&O line. These coverages are becoming an important part of our overall value proposition across all our commercial line business units, and it\u2019s great to have strong results coming from financial products. National accounts continues to perform well, and we\u2019re pleased with the overall profile of this business.","We feel comfortable with our retentions and new business hit rates in a very competitive market. In personal lines, core earnings were $75 million for the quarter, down from $101 million last year. The underlying combined ratio of 89.9 deteriorated 1.2 points from last year, largely driven by auto, where we\u2019ve seen a slight uptick in our physical damage severity trends. Total written premium for the quarter grew slightly better than 1%. That included 1% growth in AARP Direct and 23% growth in AARP through agents.","We\u2019re pleased with the momentum of the AARP offering through independent agents and we continue to balance growth with overall rate adequacy to ensure that we\u2019re building a strong book of business. On the direct side, we\u2019re adjusting our advertising campaign, and early test results have been positive.","Our focus on member value, with the support and insight of the AARP organization, continues to evolve this program and drive its success. In the non-AARP agency channel, written premium was down 7% versus the first quarter of 2014. This is partly due to the highly competitive comparative rate of dynamics of the channel, and partly due to our own underwriting actions.","We continue to see opportunity in this channel to grow our business through highly partnered agents. These actions will better position us to align with our best distributor relationships, and deliver competitive products to their customers. Shifting over to group benefits, core earnings for the first quarter were $52 million, up 16% from 2014, delivering a core earnings margin of 5.9%.","We continue to see favorable trends in our group life and disability loss ratios versus prior year, although the rate of improvement has slowed. Looking at the top line, fully insured ongoing premium, excluding association-financial institutions, was up 4% for the quarter. Overall book persistency on our employer group block of business is in the low 90%s, and we continue to achieve our renewal pricing targets.","Fully insured ongoing sales were $300 million for the quarter, a strong start to \u201815, and as I have previously indicated. Approximately 25% of the sales gains are win-backs, customers that left us in recent years, but have now come back. We consistently hear that our service capabilities are a key differentiator and the primary reason clients come back. We\u2019re proud of our Hartford team mates who make that value proposition real every day. And we\u2019re continuing to invest in the tools and technology necessary to meet the needs of our customers.","Let me conclude with a few general themes. Across our property and casualty and group benefits businesses, we are well-positioned to compete. We\u2019ve made important investments to improve our capabilities, and taken some hard actions to address shortcomings in our portfolio. Notwithstanding this consistent progress in recent years, there are always pockets where we can and will do better.","We will continue to dig deep into our business metrics to effectively manage our performance, retain our best customers, and build value. 2015 is showing signs of greater competition and this is the time for our skill and experience to guide our actions for long-term success. We have a much stronger foundation for the journey ahead. Let me now turn the call over to Beth.","Beth Bombara","Thank you, Doug. I am going to briefly cover first quarter results for the other businesses, and then provide an update on the investment portfolio and our capital management activities. Mutual funds core earnings rose 5% in the first quarter, primarily due to an increase in fees from higher average assets under management, excluding Talcott variable annuity funds.","As expected, Talcott-related AUM continued to run off, which reduced the segment's total AUM compared with a year ago. Fund performance remained solid this quarter, with 70% of funds outperforming their peers over the last 5 years.","Our strong performance track record has helped drive strong mutual fund sales, resulting in net positive flows of $529 million. Talcott posted good results this quarter, with core earnings of $111 million, about $20 million above our expectation because of higher investment returns, including limited partnership returns. We model limited partnership income at a 6% annualized return.","Assuming that return, Talcott's quarterly core earnings for the balance of the year would be in the $85 million to $90 million range. As Chris mentioned, Talcott's annuity contract counts continue to decline. Our ISV and ESV programs added slightly to the variable and fixed annuity runoff. And we will continue to look at contract holder initiatives and other programs that can help accelerate the decline in these books of business.","Since we put Talcott into runoff, variable and fixed annuity contract counts have dropped by almost one-third, down 32% and 29% respectively, since June 30, 2012. During the quarter, Talcott paid a $500 million dividend to the holding company, which contributed to the decline in statutory surplus to $5.1 billion from $5.6 billion. We generated about $63 million of net statutory surplus this quarter, in line with our prior outlook of $200 million to $300 million of surplus generation for the full year.","However, low interest rates could provide downward pressure on that estimate as we approached year end. We do not expect this to impact our current intention to take two dividends of $500 million each from Talcott. One in the second half of 2015 and another one again in early 2016. Corporate segment first quarter 2015 core losses were about flat to the prior year. We expect some reduction in interest expense during 2015 as we repay $280 million of maturing debt during the quarter, and also intend to repay another $167 million of scheduled debt maturities later this year.","In addition, we will utilize up to $500 million for additional debt management, including the call of our October 2017 debt maturity we recently announced. Turning to investments, the credit performance of our portfolio remains strong, with a modest $15 million of impairments during the quarter. Our portfolio yield also held up reasonably well this quarter, despite the headwinds from low interest rates, with an annualized yield of 4.1%, excluding limited partnerships.","In addition, we had more fixed income make-whole premiums this quarter than normal, which added a few basis points to the all-in yield compared with fourth quarter. New money yields remain low, although within the range we expected for the year, which will continue to put pressure on investment income levels. Limited partnership returns, on the other hand, were well above our outlook, with an annualized return of about 14%, consistent with the prior year, but more than double the 6% average we use for planning purposes. This impacted Talcott's results in particular, as I noted earlier.","Our private equity and real estate partnerships drove most of this upside, while our hedge fund investments, which are principally global macro funds, had low single-digit annualized returns consistent with our outlook. To wrap up on our results, we had a good quarter, with consolidated core earnings per diluted share up 11%, excluding net favorable items in both periods, such as catastrophes below budget, prior-year development, and the New York Assessments.","In addition, book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, rose 2% from year end 2014, reflecting net growth in shareholders' equity and the accretive impact of the share repurchase program. Growing book value per share is a key financial goal for The Hartford and an important driver of shareholder value creation over time.","A second key financial goal is increasing our core ROE. The 12 month core earnings ROE was 8.1%, a good improvement over the prior year, which included the benefit from several net favorable items. While this remains below our cost of capital, we intend to improve the ROE over time with continued core earnings growth and capital management. The 12 month un-levered ROE for our P&C group benefits and mutual funds businesses was 10.6%.","Before turning to Q&A, I\u2019d like to provide a brief update on our capital management plan. As a reminder, the two-year plan initiated in 2014, was $2.775 billion for share repurchases, and $1.2 billion for debt capital management.","That plan remains unchanged and through April 24, we have repurchased approximately $2.1 billion of common equity, totaling 57 million shares, for an average purchase price of $36.93. We have $656 million remaining under the equity program, which we will complete over the balance of the year, including a total of approximately $250 million during the second quarter.","Under the debt management program, we repaid maturing debt of $200 million in 2014, $289 million in 2015, and expect to repay $167 million in November, which leaves approximately $500 million for other debt capital management.","On Friday, we noted the custodian of our intention to call the 4% notes due in October 2017, which have PAR outstanding of $296 million. Including accrued interest and the make-whole premium, this bond call will use approximately $320 million of the remaining $500 million. We expect to use the balance for other debt management actions.","As I previously mentioned, during the second half of 2015, we expect Talcott to dividend $500 million to the holding company, and P&C group benefits and mutual funds to also generate about $700 million of dividends. We have made significant strides in reducing debt and improving our balance sheet and risk profile over the past several years, which contributed to the S&P and Moody's upgrades.","We expect our capital management plans to include both equity and debt, as we look for opportunities to redeploy excess capital accretively, both as capital management and investment in our businesses. We will continue to execute the current capital management plan, and during the second half of this year, we will update you on our capital management outlook for the remainder of the year and 2016. To summarize, first quarter results were a good start to the year.","Our strategy remains unchanged as we remain focused on growing core earnings in our P&C, group benefits, and mutual fund businesses to offset the runoff of Talcott's core earnings. While competitive conditions may be more challenging, the underlying returns in our businesses have improved significantly compared to several years ago, and we are well-positioned, both financially and competitively, to continue to create shareholder value. I will now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you, Beth. As I noted earlier, we have about 30 minutes for Q&A. In order to get through the queue and allow everyone to have time to ask their question, we would request that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up and then re-queue if you have additional questions. Sean, could you please give the Q&A instructions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs, your line is open.","Michael Nannizzi","Couple questions. Is there any way we could quantify, Doug, the technology investments and higher commissions based on business profitability on 1Q results?","Doug Elliot","Mike, we don't share the details to allow you to do that. I would say this, that Chris and I have shared that our technology invest plan over this three year period is a $1 billion-plus plan. That\u2019s putting a little bit more than half of the - about half of the expense pressure, namely inside small commercial, as I called out this morning?","Michael Nannizzi","Right.","Doug Elliot","And as I mentioned, we obviously are seeing a very solid, profitable run through our loss ratio. So we\u2019re feeling a little expense pressure in our supplementals because we\u2019ve got a three year trigger for loss ratios with many of our agents and brokers.","Michael Nannizzi","Okay. Got it. Okay. So I mean, as that continues, then, we could expect to see - I guess we\u2019ll continue to see the expense pressure from supplementals. And then as you work through your technology spend, then we should probably see that normalize at some point?","Doug Elliot","Yeah, I would say that. And clearly, as we replace \u201812 with \u201815 - \u201815 starts out in a good spot from a loss ratio standpoint. The three year run with \u201815 will be \u201813, \u201814, \u201815, which will be three good years. \u201815 clearly is in a better place than \u201812 would have been. So I think now we get to a normalized level as we approach \u201815.","Christopher Swift","Mike, I would just add on the expense side, we are harvesting gains today. So you should not think that we\u2019re not trying to be efficient today and improve our existing processes, particularly as we spend money on new technology, which will continue. We do capitalize some of those investments that will be amortized over a five to seven year period, depending on the project. But we ultimately expect the payback through increased - I'll call it productivity, reduced unit cost and ultimately, faster growth. So that\u2019s how Doug and I have been thinking about it.","Michael Nannizzi","On the upgrades this last week, Beth, thinking about those, where do those fall in your expectation? I mean, clearly, you\u2019re working towards this type of recognition. Is this earlier than you expected? Earlier affirmation than you expected? And does this change in any way how you're thinking about your capital management plan as you start penciling the second half of the year? Thanks.","Beth Bombara","Thanks, Mike. So obviously we're very pleased with the actions that both S&P and Moody's have taken. Obviously, over the last several years, we\u2019ve been working with them closely to share with them our plans, and we plan to continue to work for continued improvement. So I don't see it changing our views relative to our capital management plans. Again, it\u2019s nice to get the recognition for the improvements that we have made.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS, your line is open.","Brian Meredith","Couple questions here for you. Doug, just curious, on the increase that we saw and some of the severity on the personal auto, would you attribute that to kind of industry what\u2019s going on? Or is anything - any of that related to maybe some selection issues with the big rapid growth you're getting in the AARP agency business?","Doug Elliot","We\u2019re looking at every component of that. And we do feel like there are some things happening here that we need to kind of lean into and we have some work programs around. We\u2019re clearly looking at vehicle year and making sure that our new open road product is appropriately pricing those.","In the quarter, it looked like our subrogation was a little light. So we\u2019re leaning into subrogation. And as you understand that, that\u2019s something we can catch back up with. So we\u2019ve got a number of things that we\u2019re looking at internally, but we understand there\u2019s probably been a little bit of physical damage pressure across the industry as well.","Brian Meredith","Great. And then staying on the P&C topic, I\u2019ll let you keep going here, Doug. Commercial auto. What exactly are the issues with your book that you\u2019re dealing with right now? Seems like some other companies are actually saying they\u2019re finally getting to the right profitability level on commercial auto?","Doug Elliot","Yeah, I would start by saying the pressure we\u2019re feeling today in commercial auto is very different than some of the programs and captives we had several years back. So those are in our history, and I feel good about the way we\u2019ve moved away from those programs. This is more organic middle market and to a lesser extent, small pressure just across severity.","We\u2019re seeing severity trends in those books of business. We\u2019re pricing for them. We\u2019re looking at vehicle weights against our price per pound. We're looking at driver experience. I would say that we\u2019re leaning probably a little bit more aggressively into driver experience this year than we had in the past. So we\u2019re working across that auto book. We're going to get this book performing much better as soon as possible. And I would say right now, we\u2019re leaving no stone unturned.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Vincent DeAugustino from KBW, your line is open.","Vincent DeAugustino","Just a quick follow-up on a previous question on the auto loss cost side. Just with this hitting the physical damage severity side. I\u2019m curious if this is the result of just greater actual damage to vehicles, or if there's any inflation in the repair cost? And the reason I ask here is, if it\u2019s on the actual damage levels to the vehicles, I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s any type of correlation on the bodily injury side, just maybe to a lesser magnitude?","Doug Elliot","Vince, this is Doug again. We are looking at year of vehicle. So obviously, the newer vehicles will have more technology in the bumpers on both sides. So that\u2019s something that\u2019s got our full attention.","We obviously feel great about our claim process, but we\u2019re going back. As you know, we have a new claim system that is rolling out as we speak. So we\u2019re looking at the work streams that now revolve around that new system, and looking at similar type and year to make sure we\u2019re on top of all those trends.","Vincent DeAugustino","Okay. So your driver base isn't as sensitive to gas prices, but any notable shifts on the frequency side?","Doug Elliot","A general up-shift, but not dramatically, we've watched this carefully over the last 10 months, 12 months and so not that I think this is inside our patterns relative to loss at the moment.","Vincent DeAugustino","Okay. And if I can squeeze another one on just pricing on the workers' comp side. Workers' comp is a generalization of a lot of smaller micro markets and geographies and injury class codes. I'm curious, based on your comment this morning, within those aggregate numbers, if there are any pockets of really favorable or destructive pricing that you\u2019ve got to watch out for?","Doug Elliot","I think you probably have a great sense of the marketplace. In general, there\u2019s been a downward pressure across the filings in workers' comp. So some of the major states are looking at moves in the pricing realm that now are flat to down. I would say, across the middle market, I don't see major swings from the geographic standpoint. I think we\u2019re competing well, I think the tools are in place; the books are very adequately priced.","So the improvements we\u2019ve made over the last three years, I think do position a bit more competition, which is what we\u2019re seeing. But we\u2019re going to keep our discipline, and I\u2019m very comfortable that we\u2019re going to be thoughtful as we play this out.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays, your line is open.","Jay Gelb","First, on Talcott, I just want to get a bit of a better understanding why you feel the quarterly run rate of earnings would be $85 million to $95 million, given the strong - or much stronger performance was on the first quarter. Was that just all simply due to excess limited partnership income?","Beth Bombara","Yeah. That\u2019s exactly what drove the out performance for the quarter. So when we look at just normalizing the run rate for investment income, it gets back down within the range that we previously gave.","Jay Gelb","Okay. And then on the capital structure, Beth. I'm looking at page 5 of the supplement. I think this lays it out pretty clearly. Could you remind us where you feel a target range should be for the dollar amount of debt, and also debt to capital? My guess is you\u2019re focused on rating agency adjusted debt to capital? If you could remind us your targets there, that would be helpful for modeling purposes.","Beth Bombara","Yes, absolutely. So we do focus on the last line that you see on that schedule, which is the rating agency adjusted debt to capitalization. So ended the quarter at 27.3%. When we look forward to the year and anticipate the debt reduction that I covered in my remarks, all things else being equal, we\u2019d expect that 27.3% to be on a slightly under 25%. And we stated all along, our goal has been marching down to the low 20%s.","Jay Gelb","Okay. So even after the Company finishes up its debt reduction for this year, that seems to imply there could be more to come in the years ahead to get that ratio lower?","Beth Bombara","Yes. So as we look forward and we think about capital management actions in the future, debt reduction was something we\u2019ll always consider. As we said in the past, we don't need to get to that target immediately. So we intend to continue to be balanced in how we approach that. But obviously, as you do equity repurchases, that also puts pressure on the ratio. So we\u2019re really just looking to balance all of that. And I would call it a steady march down to the low 20%s.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from Piper Jaffray, your line is open.","John Nadel","A question for Doug on the commercial lines side, and maybe it\u2019s sort of wrapping up a couple of the earlier questions, maybe in one maybe easier fashion for us to understand. I think for 2015 you had targeted a combined ratio ex-CATs in prior year between 89.5 and 91.5. 1Q was definitely a bit above that range, but obviously tough weather.","But also on the expense side, it sounds like things are going to be a little bit higher. Can you give us a sense - do you still feel good about that range for 2015? Or could this expense component push you modestly above the upper end of that?","Doug Elliot","John, I would say that we still feel like that range is achievable. A couple of thoughts. One is, I do think the first quarter on the expense side is a tough compare, because of the one-timers that were achieved last year. But we\u2019re conscious of that, and as Chris said before, we\u2019re driving efficiencies inside this operation.","So although we\u2019re driving some of the dollars back inside the invest part of our business, we are looking to become a more streamlined efficient company over time. And I do think, obviously, we\u2019ve got to wait and see how weather plays out second and third quarter. But I look at this as a solid start to the year ,and those targets definitely achievable.","John Nadel","Okay. Thank you. Then separately, maybe a question for Beth on the runoff annuity block. The variable annuity surrender rate remains high, although I guess it\u2019s coming down modestly, but can't stay in the 20%s forever, I suppose. But the fixed annuity surrender rate this quarter dropped pretty significantly. Was there any specific thing that happened there?","Beth Bombara","Yes. So I will remind you, John, we had a program in place in 2014 that increased that surrender rate, our ISV program. So that obviously impacted those surrender rates that we saw in \u201814 and then going into \u201815. And as I said in my remarks, we will continue to look at ways that we can target specific portions of the book, as we have in the past. And obviously, that can make the surrender rates sort of ebb and flow.","John Nadel","Okay. So ex-some sort of modified program, we should expect probably something more in the low to mid single digits on the fixed annuity block?","Beth Bombara","Yes. It does tend to bounce around a bit, too. But I think on average, I would say that that would make sense. But quarter-to-quarter, depending on just where various contracts stand relative to choices that they have to make, you can sometimes see the numbers bounce. But on average, I think that\u2019s a good place to be.","John Nadel","Okay. Thanks. And then I'm going to sneak one last one in, unless Sabra wants to beat me up. But as we look forward to an updated capital management outlook in the back half of the year, can you just remind us what the ongoing cash needs of the parent company? How much cash do you want to hold back relative to interest expense and dividend payments, etcetera?","Beth Bombara","Sure. So as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, when we think about holding company cash and levels that we'd feel comfortable at, we typically target around 1.5 times interest and dividend requirements. And when you look at where we are with interest and dividends, you can think about that as being in like the $650 million range.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, your line is open.","Jay Cohen","A couple of questions. First is, Doug, I think you mentioned that you had planned to adjust your ad campaign for the AARP business. What specifically will you be doing, and how do you think that will affect the revenues?","Doug Elliot","What we\u2019ve done in the ad campaign is, we\u2019ve adjusted slightly to be a little bit more value-based, tied in with the AARP membership. So as we\u2019ve made some tweaks over the past 90 days, our response rate has risen positively. And our close rate on those responses also has seen some favorable reactions. So more to come as we work out the rest of 2015, but very encouraged by the early start.","Jay Cohen","Great. And then sticking with personal lines, the agency - non-AARP agency business, you had said it\u2019s getting pretty competitive with comparative raters. Was there a change in the quarter, or is this just a gradual continuation of what you\u2019ve seen over the past several years?","Christopher Swift","I would say from the industry side, no change that we can tell. We have made some adjustments in our own strategy, really around classes in vehicles and geographies, just normal tuning that goes on day-to-day. And so the combined actions of competitive pressures on our own actions contributed to the quarter.","Jay Cohen","Got it.","Christopher Swift","Let me just add just a perspective, too, because I called it out, particularly in my prepared remarks, that we are - I mean, personal lines is an important strategy for The Hartford and complementary, obviously, with our strong commercial capabilities.","So that\u2019s why we appointed one of our seasoned leaders, Ray Sprague, to really lead this and help us continue to improve it, because we have a wonderful 30-plus year relationship with AARP that we want to continue to leverage and serve their customers. Specifically on your ad question, if you haven't seen them, I\u2019ll get Sabra sent to send you a clip.","But they\u2019re really powerful connections - emotional connections, Doug, I would say. They\u2019re strong testimonial-based, hearing directly from AARP members themselves and explaining the value proposition that we offer.","As opposed to just competing on price and just a minimum, I'll call it, features and capabilities in the products. So we offer a rich product that we\u2019re proud of from a coverage side. And I think we're going to try to do a better job in explaining why those coverages are needed to insure for the unforeseen. So those are just a couple thoughts I just share with you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Credit Suisse, your line is open.","Tom Gallagher","I\u2019ll have a question and then I\u2019ll turn it over to [Ryan Tunis] for a follow-up P&C question. Beth, just coming back as a follow-up to what John Nadel asked about on the capital management front. So if I understood your answer correctly, that should leave the full, we\u2019ll call it, $500 million dividend that you expect to get out of Talcott in the back half, plus the $700 million of operating dividends or $1.2 billion.","It should leave all of that for incremental capital management or other, over and above your existing capital plan. Is that right, or is it some fraction of the $1.2 billion that would not have been accounted for yet?","Beth Bombara","Yes. So the way I would have you think about that, Tom, if you recall, back in February, we provided you with an update on our projections of holding company cash and where we expected the holding company to end the year at.","And that was at about $1.8 billion, and that remains unchanged. That took into consideration all the dividends that we just talked about. So when I was answering John's question on the holding company requirements, and if you think about $650 millionish being the annual interest and dividends that the holding company pays, and our target to hold 1.5 times that, I think that gives you a little bit of map as how we think about yearend \u201815.","And then again, as we said, going into \u201816, we have the additional $500 million dividend that we anticipate taking out of Talcott as well as just our normal dividends that we would take out of the other businesses.","Tom Gallagher","Got you. So that would leave a little under $1 billion, then, if I\u2019m solving - in response to that - with that response in mind, it would leave a little under $1 billion in terms of incremental capital management? Is that the right number to think about? And then obviously, it\u2019s a determination of what do you use for buybacks versus debt management, but is that the right figure?","Beth Bombara","Yes. So Tom, I don't really want to get into a specific number. As we said, we are going to look to update our plans in the second half, once we\u2019re going to see how the first half of \u201815 goes and our views of the remainder of \u201815 going into \u201816. There\u2019s nothing hidden in the math that I\u2019m giving you - so you can draw your own conclusion. But again, when we talk about updating our plans, it would be \u201815 through \u201816.","Tom Gallagher","Got you. And I\u2019ll turn it over to Ryan on P&C. So I guess my question is \u2013","Doug Elliot","Ryan, let me just follow up on Tom and - I appreciate your reconciliation and trying to pinpoint it. But I think Beth said it well, is that we will get into the second half of \u201815, go through our regular forward-looking planning process, and see the - and just make some final decisions. I think, from my perspective, I take great comfort in the fact that the agencies have seen the improvements that we\u2019re making.","We are sitting on excess capital that we intend to deploy in accretive ways. You\u2019ve heard our penchant to keeping things in balance between debt and equity, so I don't think there is anything really changed. And if you could just continue to be just a little patient with us in that we want to be a regular company, and sort of look at these things in a normal cycle and rhythm, and we\u2019ll communicate our views to you at the appropriate time. But thank you for your interest.","Tom Gallagher","Thanks, Chris.","Tom Gallagher","So yeah, I guess my question on the ongoing businesses, a little bit higher level on personal lines, it\u2019s for either Ray or Doug. But I guess just looking at auto, 7% renewal rate increases this quarter. Should we expect margin improvement in that business this year, given the magnitude of those rate increases? Or would you say those rate increases are necessary just to keep up, based on some of the elevated physical damage severity you mentioned? Thanks","Doug Elliot","As we start the year, loss trend is certainly eating into our pricing equation. We hope that that will change. We have got a number of work streams to try to bring incremental margin back inside that book. I would remind you that overall, our auto book is in actually pretty reasonable shape. And clearly, on the AARP side, very solid shape. We have some work to do in the agency channel and we\u2019ve chatted about that in the past. So I hope that we can turn that pricing into a benefit inside the ratio. That\u2019s the goal.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bas from Citigroup, your line is open.","Erik Bass","Just wanted to touch on the group benefits business. Obviously, it was a very strong quarter for sales and you cited the benefit from the win-backs. Can you also talk about the contribution from new products? And maybe, also, just discuss the competitive trends that you\u2019re seeing in the group benefits market?","Doug Elliot","I\u2019ll try to cover a few of those items in the question, which was a good one. Very pleased with the quarter, obviously, a strong sales quarter - our strongest sales quarter in several years. Although I would remind you that we\u2019ve had quarters like that in the past, when this business was really running well for us back in the late 2000s and even into 2010, so pleased with our start to 2015. You can also see that a bit more success has been on the life side.","So as we look at the long-term duration contracts in LTD, strong start, but not as strong, probably, as we had seen on the life contract side, so just something in terms of marketplace. Yes, we\u2019re excited about the new product development over the past several years, and we\u2019ve got two new voluntary products in market, including a new disability flex product.","We have sold several of those deals. I will also tell you that we\u2018re looking to populate them with employees of the contracts that we\u2019ve written them on, but I think off to a good start. They're recognized by many of our policyholders, and I think we\u2019re going to begin to see that success play out in 2015. So very pleased with our group benefit start.","Erik Bass","Got it. Thank you. And just any comment on the overall competition? I guess when you\u2019ve talked about - your comments around competition picking up generally, it seems it was more related to P&C. But anything similar that you\u2019re seeing on the group benefits side, or is it still a relatively benign environment?","Doug Elliot","I would say it\u2019s a relatively consistent environment, so we see competition there. Maybe a bit more on the LTD side than what we had experienced in the past. And again, what\u2019s so interesting about the group benefit world is that, particularly in the national accounts, we\u2019re working six months, nine months in advance. So some of the successes we had in the first quarter were really the result of actions and proposals that went on last summer.","But we\u2019re feeling good about our ability to be successful in the middle market. That will be an increasingly important part of our group benefit strategy. But I do think rational competition really across in a consistent manner.","Christopher Swift","I would just add a couple of themes that Doug explained. One, if you look at sales, the life TI piece is interesting, so shorter duration versus longer duration. We\u2019re having a little bit more success, particularly in the lower stream environment. Two, it\u2019s obviously a heavy national account season, the 1-1.","But equally, there\u2019s a lot of good contribution that Doug and the team have been focused on in middle market in the small side. So our balance of sales is spread amongst the different segments. And then thirdly, the channel, I would say exchanges are beginning to contribute in a way that we anticipated, but is a positive development, too. So we rely on our existing agents and brokers. But there are a number of exchanges that we\u2019re participating in that are contributing nicely to our increase in sales.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from FBR, your line is open.","Randy Binner","A lot of good stuff, so mostly answered. But I want to actually jump back to the commercial auto discussion, and then some comments in the opening script, that D&O and E&O claim activity has been favorable.","So it\u2019s a reserve question in that the net reserve release in the quarter for commercial lines was relatively flat. And it was relatively flat overall. So the question is was there adverse POID in commercial auto that offset the more favorable D&O and E&O activity, or was there not POID in those items this quarter?","Doug Elliot","I think you can see in the sup that, yes, we had some adverse auto liability actions taken on our reserve position, for sure. Mostly middle market, I might comment. And then the financial product good news essentially did offset that. Just a thought about the financial product, D&O, E&O, book. We were heavier in the financial institution block back during the recessionary period, so we made appropriate reserve position judgments back in that period.","We've watched them play out as the last five or six years have played out. This quarter, we came to the decision that we had - it was time to make some of those adjustments. So the netting of those two is what\u2019s playing out in our reserve position on the prior, and I think it is well laid out in the sup for you.","Randy Binner","Thank you. And then the follow-up is just on thinking of more recent accident years. So if - especially with D&O and E&O, with the economy continuing to be good and loss cost relatively benign, especially in \u201812 and \u201813, there\u2019s been a pricing. Is there an early read you have on some of those - the casualty lines written in those more recent accident years and how they may develop?","Christopher Swift","I think it\u2019s too early for us to comment on that. We have a well-balanced book of business across sector, geography, etcetera. But I think it would be early for me to make a call on \u201814 or \u201813.","Randy Binner","All right, fair enough. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan, your line is open.","Jimmy Bhullar","Many of my questions were actually answered, but on the personal lines side, can you discuss just what\u2019s going on in the non-AARP agency channel premiums? They have been down for a while. Is it competition or are you being more selective in what you\u2019re choosing to underwrite?","And then, Beth had mentioned in her remarks on Talcott surplus being sensitive to interest rates. Maybe if you could quantify or give us some color on just how sensitive it would be to make 20 basis points, 30 basis points, 50 basis points of a change in rates?","Doug Elliot","I\u2019ll start and take the first half and then we\u2019ll flip to Beth. I would say that with Ray's leadership - and he and I now have been engaged heavily with the group over the past nine months - it\u2019s a great chance for us to do a refresh. We\u2019ve mentioned that we are rolling out a new auto class plan that always encourages tuning, as these things roll into market.","So I would consider what we\u2019re doing in the marketplace kind of normal for a competitive product adjustment strategy that we will continue to evolve as we move forward. Yes, it\u2019s a competitive channel, but I think our returns are really in very solid shape. We would like them to be a bit better, but I\u2019m satisfied with where we are and I think we will continue to do tuning as we move forward.","Beth Bombara","And Jimmy, on the question on interest rates, I don't have an exact sensitivity that I can give you - a basis point change and what that might mean. What I would tell you is that when we look at the overall book in Talcott, we feel very good about the cash flow generation that we see coming from the VA book. And as we get closer to the end of the year, low rates could just put pressure on that previous range that we gave.","But overall, still feel very good about the balance sheet strength and feel very comfortable with the dividend plans that we've put out there. And as we get to the end of \u201815, we will evaluate surplus levels to determine what, if any, additional dividends we would see in 2016, besides what we have already announced.","Jimmy Bhullar","And just lastly, is there a minimum level of surplus you would want to leave in Talcott, assuming a normal decline in the size of the block?","Beth Bombara","I don't have a specific target in mind. Over time obviously, we focus on RBC ratios. We look at the overall surplus, especially in stress situations and then also balancing liquidity. So again, the plan that we have announced and the dividends that we expect to take out put us well within all of those thresholds that we monitor. And again, as the book gets smaller, we will evaluate absolute surplus levels.","Jimmy Bhullar","And those amounts you are comfortable with, even with rates where they are, right?","Beth Bombara","Yes. The items that we have already disclosed, we feel very comfortable with.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman from Balyasny, your line is open.","Ian Gutterman","I wanted to follow up on Randy's question about the reserves in the recent accident years. Doug, I specifically focused on workers' comp. Obviously, that is your biggest area of reserves. And when I look at the recent accident years, they are reported to incur - the initial reported to incur is so much better than has been historically that I can't draw any other conclusion that you seem to be reserving a lot more conservatively.","The only possible exception to that is maybe there has been some meaningful shift in the book, where reports would be coming in later than it used to because of mix or some other underwriting change. Is there anything like that going on? Or should I be encouraged by seeing the early reported to incurred ratios looking so much better than historic?","Doug Elliot","First, I am pleased that you are encouraged. We are encouraged by our book profile over the past few years. Not only on the pricing side, but really very pleased about the mix changes and how they've played out inside our earnings and reserve profile.","So I think 2013 and 2014 are still early to call, but we are very pleased as to how they look and we hope they continue to look as solid as they are today. But you know, we call them as we see them. We feel good about progress, but these are long tail lines that take awhile to mature.","Ian Gutterman","Of course I was thinking more how they play out over time than expecting it this year. But that's okay and then just a follow-up on the agency auto business, then, for you and or Chris. Just strategically and I - you obviously talked a lot about some of the changes you are making, but as sort of Jimmy alluded to, that book shrunk for a long time.","And again, I am specifically talking about the non-AARP here. Are the actions you are taking enough that you can compete where you need to at the scale you are at? Or are you going to have to face a decision eventually of either you need to get bigger in then non-AARP business or maybe get out of the non-AARP business?","Doug Elliot","Ian, I think you ask very solid questions. As Chris had suggested, we are totally committed to this space. This is been a real solid complement to not only our personal lines agency franchise, but also to the commercial as well.","But we have been challenged and we have got to get those hit challenges head on from a financial standpoint. We are doing so as we speak today. I am optimistic about what the next couple years will bring, but I also know that challenge in the channel, based on how competition competes and the comparative rates, etcetera. So I think we will be talking about this as time plays out. And know it has our full attention. And we are on it and we are pulling levers to drive a better financial outcome.","Christopher Swift","Ian, I think Doug said it well. But I think when you think about it also strategically, we still believe in advice that the independent agents provide, provided that we have a good competitive home and auto product.","So I think when you speak of auto, don't forget about home in making sure that we have a total solution for our independent agents and our customers. So as Doug said it and he said it well. We are committed to figuring this out and how we can continue to add value in this segment.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you. Sean, we are coming up the hour, so we have time for one more question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Frost from Bank of America Merrill Lynch your line is open.","Scott Frost","Without getting into any predictions of ratings - credit rating trajectory, can you give us an idea of where you think your targeted metrics map in terms of NRSRO quantitative ratings? And I have a follow-up.","Sabra Purtill","I'm sorry, Scott. The tail end of your question got a little garbled. The metrics relative to --","Scott Frost","Yes. In terms of just the quantitative ratings that NRSROs have out there, you have targeted metrics. Where do you - what do you think they map?","Sabra Purtill","Right, like the 22% to 23%, for instance, on the debt to total capital.","Beth Bombara","Yes. I would say just slightly higher.","Scott Frost","Okay. And can you also remind us a couple things I want to ask about the Glen Meadows and the eight and eight junior subs. What Moody's basket treatment do they get and are they within S&P's equity bucket for you? And how would you characterize the attractiveness of those two instruments in your capital structure?","Beth Bombara","For Moody's , it is 25% and for S&P, 100%. The way I think about it, we looked at our debt stack in total in trying to manage to the targets that I said. So those obviously weigh into that as we look at really focusing on the rating agency adjusted targets. So right now, they fit very nicely. And as we continue to manage the debt stack, we really are looking at it more from the perspective of managing to those targets.","Scott Frost","So are you saying that both of those instruments are attractive to you now?","Beth Bombara","Right now, yes, they are attractive. They do help us achieve the targets that we have. Over time, that could change, but for where we sit today, we do see them as attractive.","Operator","There are no further questions.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you, Sean. We would like to thank you all for joining us today and for your interest in The Hartford. If anyone has any remaining questions, please feel free to contact Sean or myself by phone or e-mail and we will be happy to help you. Thank you and have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call."],"11040":["Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.

And in addition, John Wilcox, our Chief Strategy and Ventures Officer, will be on an innovations panel that starts at 11:45 AM that day. Both will be webcast.","I'll now turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Swift","Good morning and thank you for joining us today. 2018 was another great year at The Hartford. We had numerous accomplishments including excellent financial results despite a second consecutive year of high catastrophe losses. Full-year 2018 net income was $1.8 billion, and core earnings were $1.6 billion or $4.33 per diluted share, up 58%. The core earnings ROE for the year was 11.6%, well in excess of our cost of capital.","With the exception of catastrophe losses, business metrics were in line or better than our outlook. Group Benefits had an outstanding year, with better than expected disability experience and investment income. Commercial Lines delivered strong results, including superb small commercial underwriting performance, new business production, and retention.","The Commercial Lines underlying combined underlying combined ratio improved about 50 basis points to 91.5, among the best in the industry. Personal Lines results were negatively impacted by two hurricanes and the largest U.S. wildfire loss in insurance industry history. However, the underlying Personal Lines combined ratio of 91.2 was in line with our outlook, and two points better than 2017. New business levels were up in Personal Lines this year, which was a key goal that aligns with our AARP objectives. This partnership, which is approaching 35 years, is truly unique and collaborative. We provide their membership with unique products and quality service, and we are working together to grow the book with a focus on AARP's younger cohort, ages 50 to 60.","In addition to financial results, I am pleased with our effective and consistent operational execution in 2018. We continue to make investments in people, processes, and technology, enhancing service quality and speed. Our customers and distribution partners value the enhanced digital capabilities, broader product offerings, and an expanded risk appetite that we are bringing to them. Net promoter scores continue to climb, in claims quality ratings are strong. This year, we also made progress on our innovation agenda, including the launch of the small business innovation lab located in New York City, and the purchase of Y-Risk, a company specializing in the sharing in and demand economy.","Finally, major strategic activities in 2018 included the sales of Talcott, substantial progress on the integration of Group Benefits, and the announcement of The Navigators acquisition. Related to the acquisition, yesterday, we announced the new operating model and organizational structure in the formation of a new global specialty business. This structure aligns with The Hartford's Commercial Lines businesses with The Navigators U.S. and global operations, and will optimize underwriting experience and distribution relationships. Integration planning is well underway, and the new teams will be out in the market quickly after closing. In addition to its strategic contributions, we expect it to generate an attractive financial return with incremental annual core earnings before amortization of intangibles of approximately $200 million within four to five years after closing.","In 2019, we will build on our accomplishments and momentum. Doug will cover the outlook for key business metrics in more detail, but I have a few macro observations. Overall, we expect our businesses to perform well. U.S. economy remains in a relatively strong position compared to Europe and other parts of the world. That said we expect some slowdown in the U.S. economy.","In addition, with Brexit still unresolved, volatile equity and bond markets, slowing global growth, and continued uncertainty about global trade and tariffs, previous tailwinds maybe become headwinds particularly for investment performance. In P&C, generally, we expect underwriting margins and earnings to remain strong in 2019. With lower catastrophe losses, we expect Personal Lines to improve and underlying margins to remain healthy.","In Commercial Lines, we expect underlying margins to remain very attractive, but with some modest pressure on workers' comp. Finally, we expect the Group Benefits core earnings margin to remain very strong, although slightly down from 2018 due to lower projected limited partnership returns consistent with our long-term view. For 2019, our strategic priorities remain consistent and we will strive to maintain core earnings ROEs well above our cost of equity capital. Achieving this, along with growing book value excluding AOCI and dividends per common share will drive long-term shareholder value creation.","Turning to operational goals, expanding product capabilities and risk appetite remain key pillars of our strategy. With the recent acquisitions, we will have what we need, and will be intensely focused on realizing the combined potential, including deepening distribution relationships and meeting a broader array of customer needs.","In addition to product depth and breadth, our strategy also emphasizes customer focus and talent management, as well as building capabilities that make us an easier company to do business with. We take pride in our ability to attract and retain talent and having a diverse and inclusive workforce with a strong ethical culture. We are consistently recognized for leadership in these areas, including being designated the World's Most Ethical Company for the past 10 years by Ethisphere and a member of the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for the fourth consecutive year. Recently we were named a Best Employer for Women by Forbs in their first ranking on gender equality. Finally, we expect our organic capital generation to remain strong in 2019 and beyond, which will help fund the $1 billion share repurchase authorization we announced yesterday.","Beth will discuss our approach in using the plan, but I want to emphasize that our capital management philosophy has not changed. We remain committed to a strong balance sheet, and will continue to balance investing in the businesses for profitable growth, with returning excess capital to shareholders that exceed business requirements. To conclude, 2018 was an excellent year, and I'm really pleased about our operating performance and execution mindset. We are working hard to maintain and expand the momentum of progress and look forward to sharing the results with you.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Doug.","Doug Elliot","Thank you, Chris, and good morning everyone. 2018 was an excellent year for Property & Casualty and Group Benefits. Each of our business units delivered strong underlying financial performance, and operationally we continue to hit aggressive targets on our major initiatives. It was an outstanding year for Group Benefits. We're meeting or exceeding all milestones for the Aetna integration. Sales were very strong, and we delivered a year of record core earnings. In Commercial Lines, we continue to set the bar for superior customer service and underwriting performance among small businesses. Our middle market industry verticals are gaining traction, and with the acquisition of Navigators we are poised to deepen our relationships with customers and brokers with an expanded product suite and new underwriting expertise.","In Personal Lines, our underwriting auto results were strong, and the business is better positioned for both auto and home new business growth in 2019. This is the second year in a row marked by severe wildfire losses and hurricane activity. Our claims team and our entire enterprise continue to respond with care and professionalism in the aftermath of these tragic events. However, the losses were significant to our fourth quarter results.","We continue to evolve our catastrophe risk management strategies based on the loss events in recent years with increased focus on wildfire. This includes refinement of our loss models, exposure limits, underwriting guidelines and risk transfer arrangements. While we are generally pleased with how our overall book of business and risk management program performed given the cat events of 2018, we will continue to refine our wildfire and tornado, hail catastrophe underwriting approach.","Let me pivot now to summarize our financial performance for 2018. And then I'll conclude with some thoughts about 2019. Beginning with Group Benefits, we posted core earnings for the year $427 million, up $193 million from 2017 with a core earnings margin of 7%. This outstanding performance relative to our outlook was due to favorable disability loss cost trends and limited partnership income.","The Group Disability launch ratio for the year improved by 3.4 points due to the emergence of favorable incident trends on the most recent accident years, and to a lesser extent slightly higher pricing. The Group Life loss ratio remained solid, but was up 1.7 points versus prior year due mainly to a mix of larger accounts from the acquisition which carry a slightly higher loss ratio.","Fully insured ongoing sales for 2018 were $704 million exceeding our expectations for the year and persistency on our employer group block of business was stable at approximately 90%. This was simply an outstanding result from our sales and underwriting teams. As I noted earlier, our integration plans are on track. Our 2019 results will include approximately $85 million of our $120 million expense savings target.","We expect to achieve the additional expense savings as we complete conversion of business to our new systems. Conversion of middle market and large case customers to our newly launched ability advantage claims platform has commenced and will continue throughout 2019 and 2020. The reception of our new capabilities among customers, prospects and brokers has been overwhelming positive.","In Personal Lines, results for 2018 swung to a core loss of $28 million including catastrophe losses of $546 million before tax or 16.1 points versus our 2018 outlook of 5.6 points. The full-year underlying combined ratio, which excludes catastrophes and prior year development, improved 1.8 points to 91.2 driven by better results in both home and auto.","The Personal Lines auto underlying combined ratio improved 1.5 points to 98.2 for the full-year driven by earn rate increases and moderate loss cost trends, partially offset by higher expenses due to increased marketing efforts. Commercial Lines core earnings were approximately $1.2 billion for the year on a combined ratio of 92.6. This includes catastrophe losses of $275 million or 3.9 points versus our outlook of 2.6 points.","The underlying combined ratio is 91.5 for the year, improving 0.5 point over 2017, driven by general liability and commercial auto. The underlying combined ratio for Standard Commercial Lines worker's compensation was generally in line with 2017, which was a very strong result given the competitive market and recent loss trends. Renewal Written Pricing and Standard Commercial Lines was 2.1% for the full-year, down 1.1 points from 2017, driven by worker's compensation.","Fourth quarter 2018 renewal written pricing was down sequentially from third quarter driven largely by small commercial worker's compensation. Overall, I am very pleased with how effectively our team is balancing growth and profitability. We continue to be confident in our ability to manage worker's compensation loss cost trends despite the slight uptick in frequency we have noted in recent quarters.","In the fourth quarter, we began to see those trends flatten. Accordingly, we made no changes this quarter to our worker's compensation loss fix for accident year 2018. This flattening suggests that 2018 may have been one-time step change as the economy adjusts to recent growth and record employment levels.","Shifting to other business units, Small Commercial had another outstanding year. The underlying combined ratio was 87, improving 8\/10th of a point from prior year. Retentions remained strong and new business increased to $637 million for the full-year, up 7%. Total written premium increased 1%. In middle market, we posted an underlying combined ratio of 96.1 for the year, essentially flat with 2017. The slight loss ratio increase was more than offset by a lower expense ratio and a decrease to policyholder dividends.","Retentions remained solid and new business production of $553 million was up 14% versus prior year. Total written premium increased by 5%, achieving positive results from our investments in new industry verticals, and efforts to improve our underwriting process, which allows our underwriters to focus on building a strong new business pipeline while making appropriate risk decisions.","In Specialty Commercial, the underlying combined ratio was 97.5, 3\/10th of a point lower than 2017 driven by an improved expense ratio. Total written premium was up 2%.","In national accounts, our underlying combined ratio improved by three points primarily due to a lower expense ratio. Bond delivered consistent underwriting results and 4% written premium growth. And in financial products, our middle market centric platform delivered strong written premium growth of 8%.","Before I turn things over to Beth, I'd like to share a few thoughts about 2019. In Group Benefits, we remained focused on successfully converted customers to our newly deployed ability advantage claims system. This platform is a distinctive capability that puts us at the forefront in using data and analytics to better manage disability and workplace absence.","January is off to a solid start with renewal retention and new sales on par with prior year. For the full-year, we expect the Group Benefits for our earnings margins to be between 6% and 7%. In Personal Lines, we will continue to drive new business growth in AARP Direct. For 2019, we expect to achieve a Personal Lines combined ratio of 97.5 to 99.5 including six-and-a-half points of catastrophes.","In Commercial Lines, our top priority for 2019 is the successful integration of navigators into our business operations to accelerate our strategy. However, my comment this morning provides 2019 insights regarding the current commercial business of the Hartford. Across the marketplace, we continue to see varied competitive conditions based on line of business, geography, and industry. In property, general liability, commercial auto, we expect renewed risk pricing to be generally consistent with 2019.","In worker's compensation, we expect pricing to be flat to down modestly. With '18 accident year frequency flattening in the fourth quarter, we believe this continues to be a very manageable level of pricing change, and while our margins may compress slightly, profitability for the line remains attractive. As a result, we expect 2019, Commercial Lines combined ratio to be between 94.5 and 96.5 including three points of catastrophes generally consistent with our performance for 2018.","Overall, 2018 was a strong year for all of our business units across property and casualty and Group Benefits. We're a disciplined underwriting organization committed to maintaining strong margins and seeking growth when it meets our profit targets. We continue to effectively segment our business to determine those accounts that need price increases to reach target markets as we balance growth and margins.","2019 represents a new and significant Phase in our journey. With our acquisition of navigators, we are well-positioned to advance the key elements of our strategy, profitable product and underwriting expansion, deep partnerships with our distributors, and outstanding value to our customers.","Let me now turn the call over to Beth.","Beth Bombara","Thank you, Doug. I'm going to cover results for the investment portfolio Hartford Funds and Corporate and also comment on the announced share repurchase authorization. The investment portfolio continues to perform very well. Net investment income was $457 million for the quarter up 16% from the prior year quarter.","Net investment income of $1.8 billion was up 11% for the year primarily due to higher partnership income and higher invested assets. The increase in invested assets was driven primarily by the Group Benefits acquisition and receipt of proceeds from the sale of Talcott Resolution.","For the year, limited partnerships generated a 13% return primarily due to strong private equity results and gains from real estate partnerships versus our outlook of 6%. The total portfolio yield for the full-year was 4% and excluding LPs was 3.7% both flat with 2017. During the year, the average reinvestment rate rose to 4% from 3.5%, which reflects the impact of higher interest rates. However, this increase was offset by the lower yield on the invested assets acquired from Aetna after giving effect to the purchase accounting requirements to record the portfolio on the acquisition date at current market yields.","The after-tax portfolio yield rose from 3% in 2017 to 3.3% in 2018, driven primarily by the decrease in the corporate tax rate. The credit performance of our investment portfolio remains very strong with net impairments losses of only $1 million for the year. During the year, we repositioned the acquired Aetna portfolio to align with our long-term portfolio model, which generated in modest amount of capital losses due to the increase in interest rates since that portfolio was acquired.","Turning to Hartford Funds, core earnings were up 3% for the quarter, and 37% for the year, reflecting a lower corporate tax rate, and for the full-year higher average daily assets under management. Although markets were down in the fourth quarter, our investment performance remained strong with 68% of our funds beating peers on a five-year basis. Given the significant market volatility in the fourth quarter and consistent with industry trends, net flows were negative and totaled $1.7 billion. For the year, net outflows were $300 million as mutual fund outflows of $1.7 billion were offset by EPS inflows of $1.4 billion.","The corporate core loss was $46 million for the quarter and $233 million for the year. For the fourth quarter, the core loss is modestly lower than the prior year due to lower interest expense and higher net investment income. For the quarter, Talcott Resolution did not have a significant impact on earnings since investment management fees transitioned service revenues and income from our retained equity interest offset the cost of providing investment management in transition services. Corporate net investment income totaled $26 million in the quarter. Once we close the Navigators acquisition, pro-forma quarterly corporate net investment income would decrease by about $15 million.","At December 31, Holding Company Resources totaled $3.4 billion, which declined to $2.9 billion at January 31, after repayment of $413 million of maturing senior notes and quarterly dividend and interest payments. After the payment of $2.2 billion for the Navigators acquisition which includes transaction expenses, Holding Company Resources will be close to our liquidity target of 12 months projected interest and dividend expense or approximately $700 million.","In the fourth quarter, we completed our Annual Asbestos and Environmental Reserve Review. The four sessions to the adverse development cover we have in place, net reserves increased by $238 million before tax comprised of $167 million for asbestos liabilities and $71 million for environmental. Since inception of the adverse development cover, including the impact of the 2018 study, we have ceded losses of $523 million, compared to a limit of $1.5 billion. There are additional detail on our ANI reserves and the adverse development cover in the appendix of the slide deck.","To summarize, fourth quarter core earnings were $0.78 per diluted share, down 4% from last year, while full-year 2018 core earnings were $4.33 per diluted share up 58%. Aside from catastrophe losses, our actual business results were in line or better than the ranges we provided last February. Book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI rose 12% for the year to $39.40, and our 2018 core earnings ROE was 11.6%, a strong result in light of heavy catastrophe losses for the year. Total value creation, which includes both the change in book value per share, excluding AOCI and dividend paid to shareholders was 15%.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended 2018 with a debt to capital ratio, ex-AOCI of 24.2%, down almost four points from year-end 2017. Including the preferred stock, we issued in November, our debt and preferred stock total capital ratio ex-AOCI was 25.9%, and our rating agency debt to total capital ration was 29.2%. Our goal is to keep the debt leverage within the low to mid 20% range. Between the January debt repayment and the assumption of the Navigator senior note as part of the acquisition, we expect net debt reduction of about $150 million in 2019.","Finally, we are pleased to announce a share repurchase authorization of $1 billion, effective through December 31st, 2020. We expect to use this plan with discretion taking into consideration the amount of excess capital as well as the timing of future sources and uses of holding company resources. Given our projected cash flows, which were summarized on page seven of the slide deck, we would expect most of this program to be utilized in 2020. As noted earlier, upon closing the Navigators acquisition, holding company resources will be close to our liquidity targets. As holding company resources build in 2019 from subsidiary dividends, utilization of NOLs and AMT refunds, we will have some flexibility to utilize a portion of the authorization this year.","To wrap up, 2018 was an excellent year for The Hartford despite high catastrophe losses. In addition to posting strong financial results, we achieved important operational and strategic goals, including the sale of Talcott and a smooth integration of the Aetna book of business. In 2019, we are focused on continuing our momentum with the goal of maintaining and improving, where possible, strong margins and top line growth. We are intently focused on maximizing the potential of the two acquisitions in Group Benefits and with Navigators, and are excited about the opportunities we see to continue to build and strengthen our position as a leading property casualty and group benefits insurance company.","I'll now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you. We have about 30 minutes for questions today. Shelby, can you please repeat the instructions for asking a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Of course. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS.","Brian Meredith","Yes, thanks. A couple of quick here for you, first, Doug, I'm just curious, your commercial auto results are much better than the rest of the industry. Do you think that's just something to do with like mix of business? Why do you think that is why others are seeing some issues with it right now?","Doug Elliot","Brian, so commercial auto has been a focus of ours for, Chris and I talked last night, at least five years. We had some signs in our book five to six years ago that were acceptable to us, so we worked on closing down some programs. We've been working great, hard. Again, our commercial auto book is largely the compliment to our middle market strategy in small commercial. So, it has been a core priority of ours. Keep in mind we're still not pleased, and don't think we've reached the end zone on where our returns are today in commercial auto, but they are much improved from where they were a couple of years ago, and we'll continue to work at the line as we close up 2018. I feel very satisfied, confident in our reserve calls on the prior years.","Brian Meredith","Great. And then if I take a look at your outlook for the underlying commercial combined ratio here going forward, A, you've mentioned you're factoring in some deterioration in workers' comp. Any offsets there that we could be thinking of, like in the general liability or improvement in commercial auto. How should we be thinking about how your book should play out here?","Doug Elliot","Yes, it's a good question. So, yes, we expect some margin compression in the comp, but we also think that we're going to see improved results across general liability, property, and again we're going to work great, and we think we can improve our auto book as well. So, rate and underwriting attacking those three other lines, I think we're going to see an improved number for performance in 2019. And I think that'll offset some of the workers' comp compression.","Brian Meredith","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Tunis of Autonomous Research.","Ryan Tunis","Hey, thanks. Good morning. I just had a couple for Beth. The first one is looking at stat earnings and sources for dividends over the next couple of years. It looks like really strong stat earnings here. Should we think about if you have another like $400 million of stat earnings in Group Benefits, $1.1 billion in P&C, that's higher than what you've guided to for divvies, did all of that translate to the higher dividend of the Holdco income over the next couple of years or would some of that upside be holding in the subs. I'm just trying to understand how that maps to what could be deployable.","Beth Bombara","Yes, it's a great question. So, when we do our projections for dividend to the holding company we do tend to look at sort of over the long-term what we've seen from a performance perspective so that we have a strong degree of confidence that even if business activities are a little different from our outlook, that those dividends can still come to the holding company. So, over time, if we see those businesses performing strongly we could expect to see increase in dividends in outer years, but we try and go into our planning period putting some degree of looking at just kind of historically what we've seen there.","Ryan Tunis","Got it. And then just trying to get a better feel for the run rate in corporate once you've closed the acquisition, I think you said that the net investment income is going to come down a decent clip, but I would think there might be some other positive offsets to that. I mean is there any way you can help me in terms of what the run rate is once we're done with this?","Beth Bombara","Sure. Yes, it can be a little complicated when you look at the line item by line item view of corporate. But I think if you step back from it there's really two primary drivers of our results in corporate. The first is going to be interest expense after tax and our preferred dividend. So, if you look at 2019, we'd expect that to be about $230 million and you'd expect to see that pretty ratable over the four quarters. And then on investment income it's really going to be a function of just what cash we have at the holding company. So again, right now it's a little elevated. I'd expect that to come down, and we're probably more in the $10 million to $15 million range for invested income. And those are really the two primary drivers of what you see in corporate.","There obviously is other activities as it relates to the investment management fees that we get from managing the assets of Talcott, but those are pretty much offset by the cost of performing those services, so there's not a lot that drops the bottom line on that. And then the last item I'd point to us obviously we'll be picking up our share of our interest in Talcott, the 9.7% ownership that we have, and like obviously that can vary. So when I put all that together and you sort of look through it, kind of getting to more normalized run rate and investment income, you're looking at a loss per quarter in the $45 million to $50 million range.","Ryan Tunis","Thanks so much. That's helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, good morning. My first question, going back to the Commercial Lines' outlook for the coming year, and then just trying to drill down a little bit more into the commentary on comp, so it sounds like you guys are expecting stable frequency trends, continuation of what you saw in the fourth quarter. And so can you just expand, is that something you expect within both the small commercial and the middle market book, and were the trends more or less in line within both of those books in the fourth quarter?","Chris Swift","Elyse, improvement in frequency in both middle and small in the fourth quarter, and very stable, so pleased about that, and we're expecting that to continue into 2019, so I think you've got a fair summary of what we see moving out relative to frequency.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, and then what should we, from the outside, pay attention to? What do you think it would take for frequency trends to turn negative again or is it just kind of more or less paying attention to any changes in the unemployment rate?","Chris Swift","Well, we're spending a lot of time paying attention to unemployment for sure. We're watching job growth; we're watching all the economic indicators, including sales. As we look out, we're obviously managing our book of business by territory, et cetera, but class, we're looking for high-growth industries, we're being very careful about how we price forward. So I think the general categories that I talked about in the third quarter call are all key areas that we're focused on. We're also spending a lot of time in our claim group making sure that we're doing everything possible with nurse case managers, managing major medical, our managed care networks; we're spending a lot of time because we think we have been able to bend the curve. We think our durations in comp are top of market, and the combination of sound underwriting and excellence in claims, think it's a really good formula for us to compete moving forward.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. And then my second question is related to capital. The disclosure on the slides is very helpful. Beth, in terms of the cash tax receipts, that $600 million to $700 million, seems like that's going to be a big driver of capital to the hold co to finance what you might repurchase in 2019. Could you give us a sense of timing there? And then I think you said in your prepared remarks that you guys are now looking to keep about one-time interest and dividends at the hold co. I thought in the past that was one to one-and-a-half times, so if you guys okay going forward kind of keeping that at about one time?","Beth Bombara","Yes. So, agree, I'll take both of those questions. So, on the tax receipts in '19, they're coming from two sources. One would be a refund that we're due relative to our AMT credits, and those AMT credits, and those we'll receive shortly after we file our tax return. So, we typically file our tax return in the third quarter. We'll obviously look to see if there's things we can do to speed that process up, but that's dependent on that. And then the NOL, the way that that works through our tax sharing arrangements with the subsidiaries is we true up quarterly kind of where we are vis-\u00e0-vis estimates of taxable income, so there's a source of cash flow that's kind of coming in each quarter related to that. And when you think about the projection that we have for tax receipts that we shared, I'd say a little bit more than half of that is from NOLs, with the remainder coming from AMT.","And then for holding company resources, yes, in the past we've talked about one to one-and-a-half times. We've been grading down to one time as sort of the risk profile of the company itself has changed, and so again that's a target. It's not an absolute amount, but we feel comfortable being able to maintain holding company liquidity there as we sort of assess all of our access to liquidity across the company.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, thank you. I appreciate the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse.","Mike Zaremski","Hey, good morning. First question is a follow-up to Brian's question about underlying commercial margins. Were non-catastrophe losses materially above or below expectations for the full-year '18? If they were, could you offer some clarification.","Doug Elliot","Let me take that, Mike. For the year, our non-cat losses in property were pretty much on our expectations. I would say in our middle market business, slightly elevated to our normal pattern, so something that's got our attention, but nothing more than that, and then in small commercial had a very good year.","Mike Zaremski","Okay, great. Thanks, Doug. And then a follow-up for Beth on investment income excluding limited partnership returns. And thanks for all the color on the call so far about the corporate segment. But my question is, if I look at the new money reinvestment rate, it ticked up 30 basis points this quarter. And I was curious if that's sustainable into 2019?","Beth Bombara","And I'm assuming your question is on overall portfolio yield, not just in corporate. But as we look at where we ended the year and what our yield was on an ex-partnership basis before tax for 2018. We'd expect to see maybe some increase to that as we go into '19. And obviously to your point, we'll be really dependent upon just where reinvestment rates end up being for the full-year, but we're expecting to see a slight increase there.","Mike Zaremski","Okay, thank you for the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tom Gallagher of Evercore.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning. Hey, Doug, I just want to be clear that I understand your comments on workers' comp frequency. I think you said they flattened out in 4Q. So, does that imply that they recovered from the elevated levels from 3Q or were they consistent with 3Q levels?","Doug Elliot","Yes, I'm sorry. Let me be very specific. The fourth quarter compare, which did flatten out, so I'm talking zero would have been a compare to fourth quarter of '17, okay. Every time we do our quarterly comparison we're looking at same quarter last year, so that would've been an improvement over the prior several quarters where we had positive frequency change, meaning more workers' compensation claim losses in the quarters compared to the same quarter prior year.","Tom Gallagher","Got you. So, from what you can see, it does look like that was a temporary increase, and now you think it's more likely to trend where it's recovered to in 4Q.","Doug Elliot","Our thought process that we've shared externally that it looked to us like '18 was going to be a bit of the step change, '17 was a terrific year, maybe the best year we've seen in quite some time in comp. The absolute level now that we expect moving forward, probably looks more like '16 than '17, but at this point we don't see something further deteriorating from the earlier part of the year, and we're watching the economy, as I said before, very closely.","Tom Gallagher","Got you. And then my follow-up is just on Group Benefits. I'm not sure if I caught this correctly, but I thought I heard you say Group Benefit sales were strong in the quarter. And I noticed they were down a lot year-over-year. So I just want to know what you meant by that.","Doug Elliot","Yes. I was really referring, Tom, to the full-year. We felt very good about the full year. As you know a lot of the Group Benefit sales they lean into the first half of the year. So I feel very good about the overall effort particularly way they are writing a book. And then I did comment further about the beginning of '19 which we feel pretty good about. And when I say, \"Pretty good,\" we have some nice successes. We had a paid family leave at new case that came out on all 1\/1\/18. So when I adjust for that and look at our core disability and core life sales, I feel very good about 2019.","Beth Bombara","I think the only thing I would add to that, Doug, is when you look at the year-over-year compare for the quarter, in the prior year we had a very strong one case sale that skewed the results when you look at it sort of year-over-year.","Tom Gallagher","But if you -- and thanks for that color, and I guess, as you think about momentum for top line you know, would you say it's a good setup for sales, persistency, and also I would be curious what you are seeing on rate. Only because your results have been so strong, I am wondering if you have give back something on price right now.","Doug Elliot","So many of our accounts are rated on their own experienced base, so it really is a case-by-case answer for much of our national account book, but let me just step back. We feel really good about these last 15 months as it pertains to how the Aetna book has combined the talent, the ability for us now to stand up a very different unique claims platform.","So, yes, I am feeling very bullish about our ability to compete in the marketplace. There are situations where we are giving back a little bit of rate because of the performance. There are also some cases that need a little bit more rate. And we have been able to achieve that. So I think a really strong year in '18 and off to a good start in 19.","Chris Swift","Tom, I would just add from a top line orientation; remember, we've built over the last three years a voluntary capability. We've had added some new A&H products and refreshed some old one. We are doing things differently and creatively with some distribution relationships on the A&H side. So, we still think there is a momentum and upside potential from here. But it is competitive marketplace as you well know. There is lot of good competitors out there. But I think the agency brokers we deal with and the clients recognize that we've really upped our game. And we're seeing opportunities particularly in large case side we wouldn't have seen years ago. So we put it altogether particularly how the models and how actual results are performing compared to our purchase expectations, it been rock solid.","Tom Gallagher","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neil.","Paul Newsome","Good morning. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what appears to be some growth streams in the Personal Line side, and is there certain arc where we can see some of that stream reduced and the timing of that?","Doug Elliot","Paul, let me give you some color. So as I think about our return to growth in Personal Line, number one, we are very pleased with the progress on the profitability front. Our new sales in Personal Lines were up as you can see in the chart materially from last year. We expect more of that moving forward. Our direct ARP auto sales in the fourth quarter new to new 4Q to 4Q were up roughly 24%. I expect more quarters like that as we move into next year. So, we are working hard as more and more of our territories are rate adequate to compete in the marketplace appropriately. And I think that continued trend is within our side and certainly expectations for 19.","Paul Newsome","So kind of for the foreseeable future the thought, okay, that's my only question. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan","Thank you, and first -- highlight Chinese New Year today. My first question is on your guidance. The combined ratio guidance is not only including Navigator acquisition, Navigator historically having higher combined ratio than Hartford's, so I just wonder would that be dilutive to your like your combined ratio going forward? And what's your plan in that $200 million earnings targeting four to five years included some improvements in underwriting in Navigator?","Chris Swift","Yes, Kai. Thank you for the question. So you are right. It doesn't include that we have been clear, Beth and I and Doug that once we close, we will update our guidance. So as we think about the $200 million of incremental core earnings before amortization in tangibles, I think we have laid out a path and a track that we have talked about before. And that basically 50% of that incremental increase will come from investment income and expense saved.","A quarter of that incremental increase will come from what I would just describe as profit improvement opportunities in their book of business. And the other quarter would come then from synergies cross sell activities is how we would go to the marketplace. I would share and then Doug could add to his color that obviously he has announced the operating model and the organizational structure, but doing all that work getting to know the Navigator's team both domestically and internationally we have made trips there going back this weekend to London.","I am coming away more and more impressed with the challenge, the skills, the deep underlying knowledge they have in the organization. I think just as a larger company, I think we can bring them more capabilities from the technology side, the management routine side while still being entrepreneurial, while still having a distributor decision making model. So I feel even more confident that this is going to fit like hand and glove going forward, Kai.","Kai Pan","That's great. Then in the past, you have been providing the P&C net income guidance as well core earnings from Group Benefits, any insight you can provide there?","Beth Bombara","Yes. So on Group Benefits I will start with that, actually our practice has typically been to show margin. Last year, we did earnings just because with the Aetna acquisition we felt that it would be clear to just to give an earnings target rather than a margin. So we are actually returned for Group Benefits to our normal practice.","And then for P&C investment income, we concluded that just hasn't been an area of -- an area that we needed to highlight that. I think people's model are pretty consistent on that. And as I answered previously as we look at investment returns ex-partnership, we would expect the yields to be maybe slight above last year. And then again as a reminder, when we think about yield on partnership we budget sort of assuming a long-term view of around a 6% yield. Obviously, we are much higher than that this year. But we would not project that in the subsequent year.","Kai Pan","Great. Well, thank you so much.","Beth Bombara","Shelby, next question please.","Operator","I am sorry. Your next question comes from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker","Good morning everybody. Looking at the guidance on the Personal Line side from where it was a year ago, it deteriorated a little bit. And if I look at auto over the last three years, seems like you have had 28% rate increases. I am kind surprised given that some of your competitors are reporting declines in frequency or what not that the combined ratio is better at this point in time. Do you have any thoughts there? And also if we can talk about the change in the catastrophe outlook, you obviously have a higher cat loss ratio than you did a year ago. Has there been change about the underwriting or you are just like saying, look, there is lot more losses there in fields these days?","Doug Elliot","Josh, okay, let me take them in each of the pieces and then Beth and Chris can come over the top. So relative to the Personal Lines -- all in Personal Lines, the first thing I would say is that it really was an outstanding non-cat homeowners' year. So our performance far exceeded really the last three years - five years et cetera.","So, as we think about that moving forward, our pick on homeowners was a longer-term year which wasn't quite as positive as the outstanding year in '18 that we had. Relative to auto, we are watching the line. As you know, we work hard at that line over time. We are also spending more dollars on the marketing side. So, you are seeing a little bit of expense move there that is direct and something that we want to do to stimulate new sales.","So, we are very sensitive to where the overall performance in the line is. Feel very solid about our picks for accident '18 and '17, so I think we're in a good spot. But as we move into '19, you're going to feel a little marketing, and then we'll watch how pricing and loss trend move together. I would note that others and including industry data has seen a little pickup in collision severity, so it's something that we're watchful of.","Our book isn't demonstrating the trends at fast track data is showing, but we're clearly watching that carefully as things like new bumpers and you know, headlights, the replacement of those parts, I think is starting to kind of work its way into last trend in Personal Lines auto.","Chris Swift","Josh, and again between Beth and myself, we're looking hard at our historical catastrophe numbers in over the last 10 years, five years, in particular, and we decided to make an adjustment, because I think the trends were sort of undeniable, particularly from not only wildfire, which created all the attention the last two years, but winter storm activity, tornado, hail, you know, particularly, hail patterns moving, which I described in a non-meteorological sense eastward, you know, away from mountains more and more. So we did make a slight adjustment, I think it translates into roughly $50 million pretax, but again I think that the patterns are there. We adjust to it. I think it's more realistic, and ultimately, we need to begin to price and collect cash from the policyholders, but as you know regulators have a say in that. So it'll be baked into our pricing models going forward and then it's a matter of trying to collect from policyholders over a longer period of time.","Josh Shanker ","Thank you for the answers and let's hope for fewer catastrophes next year nonetheless.","Chris Swift","Understand.","Operator","Your next question comes from Yaron Kinar of Goldman Sachs.","Yaron Kinar","Good morning. Chris, in your opening statement comments, you said that you were expecting a bit of a slowdown in the U.S. economy in 2019, how does that factor into your commercial margin expectations in general and into worker's comp in particular?","Chris Swift","That's a great question. As Doug described, I think it does take some of the pressure off of frequency. Again, I think the analysis that we've done in here as it relates to tax benefits, economic demand, unemployment, I think we pulled a lot of economic activity forward with the stimulus, and I think that crated a surge of workers particularly new and inexperienced workers in certain industries. And I think in a strange sense, a slight slowdown -- we still see positive GDP in the 2.25% range, I'm looking at Brion Johnson our head of HIMCO, and -- yes, so, I think that takes some pressure off. If Doug didn't say it, I mean, we still are always going to be conservative with our severity picks in putting up long-term trends on medical severity in particular. So we think that's generally unchanged by economic activity and sort of separate. But Doug, what would you add?","Doug Elliot","Well, maybe as I think about adding something and the earlier questions maybe an example that just came across my desk a couple of days ago of what -- when I talk about increased economic activity and sometimes the pressure that puts on workers comp. I saw a claim come across, essentially it was a manufacturing client we've had for many years. Their demand to British product has grown substantially in the last nine months. So they took a piece of equipment that had been offline for five to seven years, put it back online and the third day it was in service not noticing that the safety guard was not attached. You know, we had a major hand-arm accident with a worker and that's the kind of claim -- that piece of equipment was not in use during what I would say level demand times over the last three to five years. And now with -- you know, in certain sectors, a little bit of needed increase in output, we had a loss that we might not have had last year or the year before. That's just a little example of why we're watching this economic activity so carefully.","Yaron Kinar","Thank you. That's helpful, and then maybe a follow-up to your answer to Josh's question on catastrophes. I did note that you reduced the limit per occurrence, but also reduced the attachment point for aggregate. Does that just -- as you're looking at your cat loss experience over the last couple of years, does that just signify that you're expecting maybe more of a frequency uptick, and not necessarily a deterioration in severity per occurrence?","Chris Swift","Yes, I think your observations are right. I think, if you look at our pattern, I think it was two, three years ago, Beth, we added an aggregate protection in a more material and meaningful way, you know, to project -- to protect on multiple occurrences as opposed to just one big one. So we think about spend and trying to maximize coverage on a power versus aggregate cover. We spent a little bit more on an aggregate. So again I would say it's a modest change, nothing major, Beth, but would you add any color?","Beth Bombara","No, I'd agree with that. You know, one thing to keep in mind is the layer on our per occurrence treaty that we eliminated, was a layer that used to be able to go between either the per occurrence treaty, or the aggregate. And really all we've done is now put it into the aggregate, and increased the aggregate protection by another $25 million from what we had before. So really again, to your point as we look at our experience and where we see the potential for protection, we felt that that was a better use of our dollars.","Yaron Kinar","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Amit Kumar of Buckingham Research.","Amit Kumar","Thanks for fitting me in. Two quick follow-ups, number one, just going back to the worker's comp comments, net-net I think what you're saying is that 2018 might have been a blip and the underlying CR uptick is due to the pressure on the pricing side of the equation. Can you just maybe expand on the level of pricing on comp, maybe give us some color and then talk about pricing expectations in 2019?","Chris Swift","Sure, let me provide a little color. And I think the exposure in loss trends have exactly on, right, we see stability moving out ahead watchful and not moving off our long-term medical severity picks, but a flattening frequency. Relative to pricing, you know, as I said in my script I see pricing worker's comp flat to down. I think we're going to see a little more downward pressure in small commercial where we don't have the underwriting ability to deviate based on our current experiences much more group rated. So we're going to see a little more pressure minus single digits, small single digits, mid-single digits in small commercial. And then in middle market it's going to be a risk-by-risk evaluation, and again we see quite a bit of competition in the industry but I see that pricing being flat to down a couple of points as well.","Amit Kumar","Got it, that's helpful. The only other question, I will end here, is -- I know this is early days on the buyback discussion, but is there any thought process based on where the stock has traded over the past few years, would there be any desire, let's say, if you get down to end of 2019 and early 2020, could there be a possibility this buyback could be frontloaded or am I getting ahead of myself, or is this going to be spread out over 2020, thanks?","Chris Swift","Yes, I think, it's probably premature to speculate on trading practices. I think Beth and we've been clear, historically, we've done things on a pro rata basis, but I think with this program and the intention to sort of foreshadow two years of demand, we'd rather be just a little bit more opportunistic when we see opportunities particularly as we get into later '19. It's not without -- it's feasible, we could be active sooner, but we have obviously funding requirements and we got holding company liquidity targets that we'd like to maintain, so -- but as we get into later half of '19 and into '20, I think it would be much more opportunistic and in buying patterns, as opposed to anything, frontloaded in a large program, a onetime buying opportunity or anything more mechanical. So just expect us to be more opportunistic going forward.","Amit Kumar","Thanks for that and good luck for the future.","Chris Swift","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Meyer Shields of KBW.","Meyer Shields","Great. Thanks for fitting me in. Doug, I was hoping you would talk a little bit about what you've seen over the course of 2018 and that lead to the worker's compensation reserve releases and did you see the reserve strengthening?","Doug Elliot","Okay. On the worker's comp side, we continue to reflect on positive experience in our prior accident years, so as we go quarter-by-quarter, Beth and I and our team actuaries sit down, and those calls we think were appropriate given what we saw coming out of the prior year, so feel very good about our positions in all our booked action years. Relative to GL, we've seen a little bit of product liability, adverse experience in the last couple of years, so we are watchful of that, but the moves in GL for prior have largely been in the product liability area.","Meyer Shields","Okay. Can you give us a sense as to the action years?","Chris Swift","Say that again, I'm sorry.","Meyer Shields","Which action years?","Chris Swift","Yes. On the workers' comp, we are talking about the last four action years, right, '14, '15, '16, I'd have to go back and check on the GL\u2026","Beth Bombara","GL is, I believe, is probably coming from the 2015 action year.","Meyer Shields","Okay, fantastic. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your final question comes from Jimmy Bhullar of J.P. Morgan.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi, good morning. So, most of my questions were answered, just maybe a couple, on M&A, are you still interested in pursuing acquisitions once the Navigator deal closes, or -- and if you guys, what sort of product lines or regions are the most interest?","Chris Swift","Yes, thanks for the question, Jimmy. I would say, again in the context of how we've talked about excess capital, obviously we've said what we want to do with our excess, which is authorizing our share repurchase. We are in the final stages of integrating the Aetna book of business during 2019. So there's still more substance of work to do there, and we haven't even closed the Navigators acquisition, which we are expecting to close in March or April. So I think from a practical point as I said, I mean, we have everything we need, at least for the foreseeable future, and who knows what would happen down the road, but we wouldn't take M&A off the table per se, but something attractive that fits within our existing strategy, it's like a foremost deal or another small bolt-on opportunity, we would look at it, but we'd have to make more financial sense going forward. So that's what I would say. I mean, it's not a current focus, it's not a current priority, we have higher priorities that we need to really focus on the next 18 to 24 months, but you'll see what things looks like in two years.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. And then just lastly on Group Benefits, the overall margins over the last couple of quarters have been pretty strong, I think the rest of the industry had seen a similar trend as well. As you went through renewal season for 2019, what was -- just a few comments on what you have seen in terms of pricing in that market?","Chris Swift","It's been a pretty consistent market. It will move by account. So yes, we've had a couple of accounts with outstanding performance, and I think we've made reductions thoughtfully, but generally I think it's similar consistent markets what we have experienced over the last 12 to 15 months.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay, thank you.","Operator","There are no other questions in queue.","Beth Bombara","Oh, thank you, Shelby. We appreciate you all joining us today, and look forward to seeing you at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Conference next week, or at AIFA in early March, if you are attending either of those events. And as always, if you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to follow-up with the Investor Relations team.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. Sabra Purtill, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. Today's webcast will cover our 2017 financial results and 2018 outlook for selected business metrics. We announced our fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results last night and the news release and investor financial supplement are available on our website.","Please note that consistent with prior year-end periods, our 10-K will be filed at the end of the month, but we have included some additional data in the investor financial supplement that will be in the 10-K, such as the P&C loss reserve roll forward. Also please keep in mind that as a result of the agreement to sell Talcott Resolution, current and prior financial results for this former segment have been accounted for as discontinued operations, which is in our Corporate segment, as required under U.S. GAAP.","This change does not change net income for prior periods, but it does reduce core earnings as income from discontinued operations is included -- is not included in our core earnings calculation. If you have any questions about this change, please consult the IFS and the 10-K when filed, but also feel free to give the Investor Relations team a call with any questions about the accounting.","Our speakers today include Chris Swift, Chairman and CEO of The Hartford; Doug Elliot, President; and Beth Bombara, CFO. Following their prepared remarks, we will have time for Q&A. Just a few comments before Chris begins.

Replays of this webcast and an official transcript will be available on The Hartford's website for at least 1 year.","I'll now turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Swift","Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. 2017 was an eventful year at The Hartford with several major accomplishments, including the acquisition of Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business and the agreement to sell Talcott Resolution. However, bottom line results were negatively impacted by the loss on sale of Talcott and the charge for U.S. tax reform. Core earnings were up 11%, and core earnings per diluted share were up 19% despite exceptionally heavy catastrophe losses in 2017. This is an outstanding result, reflecting the strength of the organization.","Commercial Lines margins were strong, Personal auto profitability improved great, Group Benefits and Mutual Fund results were excellent, and we had very good investment returns across the board. Looking back over the year, I am truly pleased with our results and impressed with our team's ability to deliver on the numerous initiatives we have underway.","In Personal Lines, I am very pleased with the strong improvement of our auto line, where the underlying combined ratio improved by 4.2 points. Improving auto profitability has been a top priority for our management team, and this is a significant milestone as we position the business to return to growth by leveraging the historical strengths of our AARP relationship. Overall, Personal Lines results were significantly affected by the major catastrophe events of 2017 with full-year CAT losses more than double our average annual expectations.","In Commercial Lines, we began 2017 focused on maintaining our strong underlying margins as we correctly anticipated increasing competitive forces. Margins did remain strong, although we expected pressure in workers' compensation and general liability. However, as Doug will discuss more fully in his comments, we have some optimism that pricing environment may improve in 2018, and our disciplined approach to underwriting and pricing will serve us very well as the market pivots.","We also advanced a number of strategic initiatives in Commercial Lines that continue to strengthen our value proposition and extend our competitive advantages. For example, in Small Commercial, we continue to innovate with an ever-improving agent and customer experience. We have now integrated E&S product capabilities within our ICON quoting platform, becoming a one-stop provider to more customers, including an integrated billing option. We also started offering automatic quotes through ICON for Group Benefit products at point of sale, enabled by our advanced data and analytic capabilities.","In Middle Market, our industry verticals are building momentum, led by outstanding teams of industry veterans who have joined The Hartford in recent years, excited to combine their underwriting and product expertise with our distribution and service excellence. In Group Benefits, we posted excellent financial results on both the top and bottom line. ","Our value proposition on service and claims management for life and disability, coupled with our voluntary product offerings, resonates very well with our customers, and we see the benefit of that in our retention. Lastly, we welcomed more than 1,800 new teammates from Aetna to our company, further strengthening our market-leading capabilities. ","In Mutual Funds, we continued to grow core earnings, supported by sales and positive net flows from strong investment performance and expanded fund offerings. And last but not least, in December, we signed a definitive agreement to sell Talcott Resolution for a total value to shareholders of about $2.7 billion, with an expected closing date by June 30. ","Across the enterprise, we are making investments necessary to compete in a digital world defined by customer experience. We are expanding our digital portals in Commercial Lines, Personal Lines and Group Benefits to give agents and customers greater access and flexibility in managing their coverage, billing and claims. We are deploying robotics in operations, allowing us, for example, to process e-mailed requests for certificates of insurance in minutes. ","And we are especially committed to our data and analytics journey. We continue to invest heavily in the talent, technology and data that we believe is increasingly defining our business. This work is generating new insights on risk, underwriting and claims management, which in turn elevates our customer experience and improves our financial performance. ","The addition of the group benefits business from Aetna is additive to our efforts as we are now the No. 2 writer of both workers' compensation and group disability insurance, with unparalleled data sets across those businesses. This is exciting progress in our vision to become a broader and deeper risk player in the market, defined by a unique focus on agent and customer needs. ","All of these 2017 successes are a part of a much broader plan to ensure that The Hartford is a contemporary company and prepared for a rapidly changing future, both financially and operationally. ","Turning to tax reform. There are many positives and a few watch areas. Growth in investment should accelerate with the passage of tax reform while cash is repatriated from overseas. In the insurance sector, we are pleased that the playing field has been leveled to a certain degree. ","On the other hand, there is uncertainty about how the lower tax rates play out over time and the extent to which the benefit will be competed away or be subject to regulatory rate reduction actions. For 2018, a good portion of the tax benefit will fall to the bottom line as most of the year's earned premiums were written in 2017. And many lines, including Personal and Commercial auto property and liability, still need additional rate to achieve our profitability goals. We will continue to work hard to achieve them. ","We also intend to use a portion of the additional cash flow we expect from tax reform to accelerate execution on our existing technology initiatives. We begin 2018 with confidence in momentum in all our businesses, focused on our financial and strategic goals for each. With the economy expanding, we see plenty of opportunities for profitable growth. ","Based on the metrics we provided for 2018. we expect to generate higher earnings and a core ROE of between 11% and 12%, including the benefit of lower tax rates. We expect the improvement to come from additional margin in Personal Lines, continued strong margins in Commercial Lines and earnings growth in both Group Benefits and Mutual Funds. ","However, we do not expect much of an impact this year from the sale of Talcott given the expected timing for closing the transaction. As we have shared with you before, the priority for our excess capital is to generate long-term sustainable growth, either organically or with acquisitions that make financial and strategic sense. We will also evaluate debt and equity capital management opportunities, being thoughtful and focused on creating sustainable shareholder and stakeholder value. ","Finally, it's not just what we did in 2017 but how we did it. Our philosophy is simple: we believe that doing the right thing every day is core to our character. Customers, agents, employees know we are a brand they can trust, that we treat people with respect and we honor our commitments to them. ","I am proud of the recognition we have received for this, including our third year of being in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index, nine years of recognition by Ethisphere as one of the most ethical companies and numerous Best Place to Work awards from various groups. We also believe that we have an obligation to make a difference in the communities where we work and live. You can see this in our sustainability report we publish on our website. The Hartford supports many activities, including educating kids on fire prevention through our Junior Fire Marshal program, which celebrated its 71 anniversary this year. We're also a founding sponsor of the U.S. Paralympic team, which will be competing in South Korea in March.","To conclude, 2017 was an outstanding year for The Hartford. While bottom financial results and book value were affected by some of our strategic decisions, I am very pleased with our underlying performance, the strength of our balance sheet and the value we provided to customers during a year of record catastrophes for the industry.","Now I'll turn the call over to Doug.","Doug Elliot","Thank you, Chris. And good morning everyone. Looking back on our business objectives for 2017 and the results achieved, both operational and financial, this was an excellent year for our Property & Casualty and Group Benefits businesses. In Group Benefits, we capped off a year of outstanding earnings and solid top line growth with the Aetna acquisition. In Personal Lines, we delivered strong improvement in the underlying auto combined ratio. And in Commercial Lines, we successfully achieved top line growth while balancing underlying profitability in competitive markets.","Our financial results were impacted by historic were impacted by historic industry catastrophe losses, but we're pleased with how our property book performed in these extreme events. Our claims team and the entire enterprise responded to our customers with the care and diligence our brand represents. In the midst of these tragic events, we were at our best, backing our promises and helping our customers rebuild their lives.","I'd like to share a few thoughts on our 2017 financial performance for each of our business units, beginning with Group Benefits, where core earnings for the year increased to $234 million, up $30 million from 2016, with a core earnings margin of 5.8%. The group disability loss ratio for the year improved by 4.9 points due to positive pricing as well as favorable incidence and recovery trends. The group life loss ratio was very solid but up one point versus prior year due to favorable changes in reserve estimates in 2016.","Looking at the top line. 2017 fully insured ongoing premium increased 14%. Excluding the two months of results from the Aetna acquisition, growth was 3%. Overall, book persistency on our employer group block of business, including the business acquired from Aetna, was approximately 90% for the year, and fully insured ongoing sales of $449 million were flat with 2016.","Fourth quarter sales of $103 million were up $60 million over last year, largely due to one national account sale. Integration of Aetna's group benefits business is on track. Our organizational structure is complete, and all aspects of the integration are moving forward with urgency. I'll share more details on this in a moment when I cover our 2018 outlook.","In Personal Lines, core earnings for 2017 were $13 million, including catastrophe losses of $453 million before tax or 12.3 points versus our 2017 outlook of 5.8 points. The full year underlying combined ratio, which excludes catastrophes and prior year development, was 93, improving 2.4 points from last year due to improved auto performance. The Personal Lines auto underlying combined ratio improved by 4.2 points to 99.7 for the full year, driven by the combination of earned rate change, underwriting and change, underwriting and agency management actions. These have clearly taken hold in our book of business, and we are confident that our auto profitability improvement plan is on track. Keep in mind, when looking at our quarterly results, that fourth quarter has the highest underlying loss ratio of the year.","In Commercial Lines we delivered $825 million of core earnings for the year on a combined ratio of 97.3. Catastrophe losses for the year were $383 million or 5.6 points versus our outlook of 2.3. The underlying combined ratio for Commercial Lines was 92 for the year, up 2.6 points compared to 2016. Overall, this is consistent with our expectations at the outset of 2017 and very strong absolute performance when compared to the industry and our peers.","Approximately half of the increase is due to margin compression in workers' compensation and general liability, and the other half due to higher variable compensation and technology costs. Renewal written pricing in Standard Commercial Lines was 3.2% for the full year, up a full point from 2016. This is a positive sign, and I'm encouraged by the recent price firming in property.","In Middle Market property, price change this quarter was up 1.5 points compared to third quarter. Pricing across all other lines for the quarter was generally consistent with third quarter, with continued strong trends in auto. Our workers' compensation rates are down sequentially in the fourth quarter by about 0.5 point, driving our overall quarterly pricing change down slightly. Loss trends in workers' compensation continue to be favorable relative to historical norms.","Written premium of $7 billion for the year was up 3% from 2016, driven primarily by growth in Small Commercial, including the acquisition of Maxum. Small Commercial had another outstanding year. The underlying combined ratio was 87.8, and written premium grew by over 5%, driven by strong retentions and $596 million of new business.","Our competitive advantage in this business has been achieved over many years through strategic innovation, consistent investment and rigorous execution, and 2017 was no exception. We began rolling out new capabilities in ICON that allow our agents to submit excess and surplus lines business through a national wholesaler to Maxum and other underwriters as part of our Small Commercial package. Behind the scenes, we continue to simplify our quoting process to make more quotes bindable with fewer underwriting questions by using advanced data and analytics.","And we expanded the functionality of our digital service platform, allowing over 30% of all of our service transactions during the year to be completed online. The momentum of this business builds by the day. In Middle Market, we posted an underlying combined ratio of 96.2 for the year, up 4.7 points from 2016. This was slightly higher than our expectations due to non-CAT property losses and margin compression in general liability and workers' compensation, including an increase to policyholder dividends on certain participating workers' compensation contracts, where loss performance has been superior.","We also had higher variable compensation and technology costs. Written premium increased 1% for the year based on solid retentions and new business production of $484 million, up 5% versus prior year. During 2017, we introduced a new multinational capability, allowing us to win more accounts with exposures outside the U.S. This has brought growth in domestic premium on accounts for which we might not have been able to compete in prior years.","We also stood up an energy vertical, achieving solid new business premium and a growing pipeline of opportunities. And our construction practice has matured into a strong business, delivering double-digit written premium growth in 2017. In Specialty Commercial, the underlying combined ratio of 97.8 for the year was 3.3 points higher than 2016. Nearly three points of this increase was driven by higher expenses, similar to our other commercial business units.","Our Bond business posted another strong year, delivering excellent underwriting results and strong growth, the result of new and expanding projects among our policyholders as economic conditions improve. And in Financial Products, we have successfully shifted to a Middle Market-centric platform where pricing and loss trends have been more stable. Looking back on our financial results and accomplishments for 2017. We are very pleased with our execution across our businesses.","Market conditions vary by business and line but have been competitive across the board. We are more confident than ever in our ability to navigate such challenges. But before I turn the call over to Beth, let me offer a few comments on our goals for 2018. In Group Benefits, continuing the successful integration of the Aetna business is a top priority. Now three months post-acquisition, we are even more enthusiastic about the team, the business and the claims technology we have acquired.","Integration milestones for 2018 are in place, including actions necessary to achieve our cost synergy target of $100 million. We are underway with plans to bring the newly acquired claims management application workability into our technology platform. Once combined with our existing case management system and newly developed billing and digital engagement tools, we will have a market-leading technology suite for our customers, both individuals and employers.","Overall, we're off to a great start in Group Benefits for 2018, with continuing strong core business results. January 2018 renewal retention on both our existing Hartford business as well as the acquired block has been strong, in line with prior year. And January sales are favorable to last year. We expect Group Benefits 2018 core earnings to be between $310 million and $330 million after tax.","Our 2017 results included very strong partnership investment returns, which our planning assumptions do not expect to repeat in 2018. We also had better-than-expected prior year loss outcomes in 2017 that we expect to normalize in 2018. Net income, which includes integration costs, is expected to be between $275 million and $295 million after tax. In Personal Lines, building off our substantial progress in 2017, we will continue to increase our new business marketing in AARP Direct, returning to new business growth in direct auto as momentum builds throughout the year.","For 2018, we expect to achieve a Personal Lines combined ratio of 96 to 98, including 5.6 points of catastrophes. This implies an auto combined ratio of 97.5 to 99.5, including 1.1 point of catastrophes, putting us in line with our targets. In Commercial Lines, industry-wide evidence of margin pressure began to emerge in 2017, triggering an inflection point in the market. And as a result, we are beginning to see improvement in property pricing. I expect this trend to continue and include general liability pricing improvement during 2018 as well.","Specifically, for our book of business, we expect our auto rate gains to continue in the high single digits. In property and general liability, we expect to see pricing trends improve to mid-single digits over the next four quarters. However, given favorable profitability trends in workers' compensation, rates in this line could range from flat to slightly negative.","We remain committed to underwriting discipline, maintaining strong margins and seeking growth when it meets our profit targets. As is always the case, we have some very well-performing lines of business as well as some pockets of business that need price increases to reach target returns. Our pricing actions will be driven by these profitability indicators, and a key priority will be the improved performance of our Middle Market property and liability book of business.","As a result, we expect an overall 2018 Commercial Lines combined ratio between 93 and 95.5, including 2.6 points of catastrophes. This represents a slight improvement from 2017 after normalizing for catastrophe losses. This is driven by our expectation of rate increases in areas of the business that are performing below targets and continuing strength in our workers' compensation results.","In summary, 2017 was a very strong year of execution across our Property & Casualty and Group Benefit businesses, with core earnings of $1.1 billion. Despite the historical level of catastrophe losses, our businesses performed well and achieved progress on many strategic priorities. This work continues in 2018, and our momentum is building. Our core priorities remain unchanged; profitable product and underwriting expansion, deep partnerships with our distributors and outstanding value to our customers.","Let me now turn the call over to Beth. ","Beth Bombara","Thank you, Doug. I'm going to briefly cover fourth quarter and full year results from the other segments and investment performance before taking your questions.","Turning to Mutual Funds. Fourth quarter core earnings were $37 million, up 76% after excluding a state tax benefit recognized this quarter. Full year 2017 core earnings were $110 million, up 41% over the prior year due to higher investment management fees as market appreciation and over $3 billion in net inflows drove an 18% increase in total segment AUM to $115 billion. Investment performance remains strong, with 60% of Hartford Funds beating their peers on a five-year basis, which contributed to the robust sales.","Corporate, which has been restated to include Talcott as a discontinued operation for all periods presented, had a net loss of $4.1 billion in the fourth quarter due to the $3.1 billion loss on discontinued operations and an $867 million charge resulting from U.S. corporate tax reform, reflecting a reduction in the value of net deferred tax assets.","The Corporate net loss for the year was $4.5 billion. In the quarter, Corporate had core losses of $51 million, slightly better than prior year, primarily due to a state tax benefit of $5 million. For the full year, Corporate core losses totaled $229 million.","Regarding Talcott, the sale and separation process is on schedule, and we expect to close by June 30. Since the transaction economics were locked in at signing, our results for the most part are not impacted by Talcott earnings going forward.","The investment portfolio continues to perform well. For the quarter, net investment income, which now excludes Talcott, declined about \u2013 by about 4% to $394 million, primarily due to lower income from limited partnerships compared to the prior year. For the full year, net investment income was $1.6 billion, up 2% due to higher limited partnership returns, which were 12% before tax in 2017, well ahead of expectations.","The portfolio yield for full year 2017, excluding LPs, was 3.7%, down 10 basis points from 2016 due in part to lower reinvestment rates and lower non-routine items such as make-whole payments on fixed maturities and prepayment penalties on mortgage loans.","To summarize, fourth quarter core earnings were $293 million, basically flat with fourth quarter 2016, and full year 2017 core earnings were up 11% to $1 billion. For the quarter and the year, the major factors were a change to favorable prior year development, better underlying personal auto results and higher Group Benefits and Mutual Fund earnings, offset by significantly higher catastrophe losses and some deterioration in underlying Commercial Line margins, driven in part by higher expenses.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our rating agency adjusted debt-to-capital ratio increased to 28.8%, up about 4 points sequentially as a result of the net loss in the quarter. We maintain our long-term goal of reducing our rating agency debt ratio to the low to mid-20s and expect debt leverage to improve over the next 12 months to 18 months due to future net income and net reduction of nearly $1 billion, as we have previously stated. ","Our overall reserve position remains strong. I'd note that the annual asbestos and environmental ground-up review conducted during the fourth quarter of 2017 did not impact earnings as the $285 million in net loss development was covered by the reinsurance agreement with National Indemnity Company that we put in place at the end of 2016. As a reminder, that agreement covers unfavorable development of up to $1.5 billion, so there is $1.215 billion remaining under the cover. ","Core earnings ROE for the last 12 months was 6.7%, up 1.5 points from a year ago. This ratio is depressed somewhat because it is calculated using average equity. If you normalize beginning equity for the loss on discontinued operations, pension transfer and tax charges, it would be closer to 8%. We expect our ROE to improve in 2018 due to earnings growth, including the impact of lower federal income taxes.","Based on the metrics we provided for 2018, we would expect our core earnings ROE to be in the 11% to 12% range. In addition, over time, we will deploy the cash flows generated from the Talcott sale and from the monetization of our tax net operating losses and AMT credits into higher-return opportunities.","Regarding capital management. During 2017, we repurchased about $1 billion of our common shares and increased the quarterly dividend by 9%, marking the fifth consecutive year we raised our quarterly dividend. Before taking your questions, I\u2019d like to briefly summarize the impact of a lower U.S. corporate tax rate in 2018. Our only major preference item going forward is municipal bond income as the dividend received deduction was in Talcott.","So aside from the 5.25% tax rate on muni bond income, almost everything else will be taxed at 21%. Our effective tax rate will be the direct result of muni bond income as a percentage of pretax income. In other words, if muni bond income is about 23% of our total pretax earnings, which is approximately where we would expect it to be in 2018, then the effective tax rate would be about 17%.","I\u2019d also note that the reduction in the corporate tax rate reduces the carrying value of the tax benefits we retained in the sale of Talcott. The tax assets we retained are now carried at approximately $700 million, down from the $950 million we discussed in December. However, the net present value of the retained tax benefit has increased as the reduction in value of the NOLs is more than offset by the accelerated monetization of the AMT credits we retained.","I\u2019d also like to point out there is one aspect of the accounting for tax reform which could result in a subsequent change to the 2017 loss on the sale of Talcott. We\u2019ve provided a summary of this in the appendix to the slide deck. This change would be the result of accounting guidance that the FASB may issue later this month. That guidance is expected to either require or permit us to retrospectively reclassify certain equity amounts from retained earnings to AOCI as of December 31, 2017, or may allow prospective adoption of that change in 2018 or 2019.","The amounts that would be reclassified represent the stranded tax rate differential that has already been reflected in earnings. The knock-on impact of this would be an approximate $193 million reduction in the loss on sale reported for 2017, but there would be no impact on the underlying economics of the transaction.","To conclude, full year 2017 core earnings demonstrated good improvement from 2016 despite high levels of catastrophes in each quarter of the year. As we begin 2018, our priorities include continued profitable growth, integration of the Aetna business, closing the sale of Talcott, reducing debt leverage and ultimately redeploying the proceeds of the Talcott sale into higher-return opportunities. We will continue to focus on maintaining strong margins and underwriting discipline while growing where it makes sense in a market showing early signs of improving pricing dynamics.","I will now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you, Beth. Before beginning Q&A, I wanted to mention that Bank of America will be hosting Chris and Beth on February 14 for a fireside chat at the annual Insurance Conference. Their discussion will be webcast, and there is a link to the webcast on our \u2013 on the Investor Relations section of our website so you can listen to it live or in replay. Jack, could you please repeat the Q&A instructions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Thank you. The first question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open.","Brian Meredith","Yes, thank you. Chris and Doug, I was wondering if you could comment on your thoughts of the impact of tax reform on pricing potentially going forward with respect to Personal Lines but also workers\u2019 compensation insurance.","Chris Swift","Sure, Brian. I\u2019d \u2013 happy to provide some color, and Doug, I\u2019m sure, will provide his views also, which are similar. I think the dialogue and debate here on tax rate is you got to put it in the context that it\u2019s just one component of pricing. I mean, there\u2019s other components: loss trends, underwriting classifications, acquisition costs, operating costs. I mean, so it\u2019s \u2013 you need to manage all of them together. I would also say it depends on the starting point from a pricing indication side of what may or may not change at the price level to a customer.","As we said in our comments, we\u2019re going to try and expect to hold on to a significant portion of the tax benefits in the near term, but we are going to put in our models for pricing purposes that are filed ultimately with regulators the new effective tax rate. I think ultimately, this will come down to then as far as, ultimately, a game theory of just what happens at the market level, what do competitive forces in the market do. But I would also state that not all lines of business are price adequate.","And as I said in my prepared comments, we\u2019re going to try to improve those lines where we need price action. I think the other thing, too, I alluded to, and I\u2019m going to give you the dollar amount, but we are going to accelerate some IT investments, digital investments in product development and data and analytic investments over the next two years. I would say that incrementally is about $50 million pretax that\u2019s in our plan. It\u2019s in the guidance that we provided you. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about tax reform from more of a macro level. But Doug, what\u2019s your point of view?","Doug Elliot","I guess I would just add, Chris, that I continue to think about our line profitability and our segment profitability, so feel very good about our auto progress but still more work to be done. We posted a 99.7 point of progress this year, but that doesn\u2019t leave a lot of underwriting profit, and we still have more work to do in that line. So we will see how this plays out. A lot of our pricing actions are already determined for 2018, and we\u2019re determined to improve our profitability, particularly in Middle Market and Personal Lines auto. So we will continue to talk about this and share as we go forward. I think it\u2019s still early.","Brian Meredith","Got you. And then one for Beth. Beth, just thinking about taxes and tax reform and elimination of the AMT, what is the kind of cash benefit that you expect kind of on an annual basis from just the reduction in cash taxes paid?","Beth Bombara","I\u2019m sorry, how much is the benefit or where is it going?","Brian Meredith","Yes. With the benefit, you gave us the present value number, but I\u2019m just kind of thinking, are you going to pay any cash taxes in 2018 now? What is it going to look like from a cash flow perspective for you guys?","Beth Bombara","Right. So looking at 2018, we\u2019d expect to pay little to no tax in 2018. As it relates to the AMT credits that we\u2019ll be able to monetize over time, that will really start when we file our 2018 tax return in 2019. So we\u2019ll start to see those cash flows coming through as well. So when we look at both our NOLs and AMT credits and based on our current projections for taxable income, we\u2019d expect to monetize those over the next three to four years.","Brian Meredith","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Kai Pan","Thank you and good morning. My first question is on personal auto. If you look at your rate increases, still in the double digits, I assume your loss cost trend probably in the mid to single digits. So there should be 5 point improvements in the core underlying margin going forward. So I just wonder why the guidance is only sort of showing 150 basis points to the midpoint. Are there more to come?","Doug Elliot","Kai, this is Doug. I would start by suggesting that over the next couple of quarters, you\u2019ll see the written pricing come down a little bit. So our earned trends now that we\u2019re achieving improved profitability are going to be slightly less than we\u2019ve had in the past. The other thing is we had very good trends across our frequency and severity in 2017. Hard to suggest they\u2019re going to repeat next year, so I \u2013 we try to be thoughtful and conservative in our selections going forward. I think those two combinations still imply that we will see improvement in the auto line underlying going forward. We\u2019d love to see the same rate of change in 2018 that we saw in 2017. But we\u2019ll have to see how that plays out.","Kai Pan","Okay. Then my second question on Commercial Line, could you talk a little bit more about the loss cost trend in workers\u2019 compensation and general liability? And what gave you confidence to achieve the improvements, given that the 2017 results was \u2013 fell sort of the original guidance?","Doug Elliot","Sure. Our overall workers\u2019 comp performance has been very strong, and that goes back a number of years. And although we tweaked it a bit in 2017, I still look at the overall performance and feel very good about it, particularly in our Small Commercial world. So that\u2019s just as a starter. As we move forward, I think our sophistication in underwriting and the work we\u2019re doing in claim to work and combat, if you will, trends that we expect to see in medical and in wage, give me confidence that we will be able to continue to produce very solid returns, right? And I \u2013 every time I think about my answer on a workers\u2019 comp question, I do ask you to think about Small versus National Accounts versus Middle Market.","They compete very differently. The results vary. But in general, we look across our segments. We feel good about the line. Our trends have been very solid. The frequency has been in very good shape for a number of years. We\u2019re watching severity around medical. It\u2019s still better than historical norms, but we are watching the hospitalization end of those costs. And as we go forward, we\u2019ll kind of compete month-by-month and quarter-by-quarter and make sure we\u2019re reflecting that in the pricing accordingly.","Kai Pan","Thank you very much.","Doug Elliot","Kai, let me add one other \u2013 as I was answering that question, I was thinking also about your Personal Lines question. I think we\u2019ve shared in the past that we are going to ramp up our marketing spend in Personal Lines. So when you think about the overall combined ratio, expect to see a little bit more cost in the Personal Lines expense component of combined. That's also adding to a part of the answer that I shared with you.","Kai Pan","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Elyse Greenspan","Good morning. I guess this is following up on some of the earlier questions. As we think about the underlying margin guidance, and this is both a Personal and Commercial Lines question, it seems like your commentary points to some improvement on the loss ratio and potentially higher expense ratios, given investments in both of the businesses. Is that how you see it when you think about 2018 with the spread between the loss and the expense ratios?","Chris Swift","Elyse, it's Chris. I would say, from a higher level, yes, generally the case. I mean, we think we could obviously get some rate in the book. We're going to try to manage frequencies and severities to a good outcome, but we are going to continue to invest in the organization, both IT, digital product. I would say that our expenses issue were probably a little elevated, primarily compensation related from our goals in performance side. So I would say that there is going to be a reversion to the mean going forward on compensation costs. But as far as investments in those areas that I described, that'll continue at a healthy pace.","Doug Elliot","Elyse, I would add as well that we're working mix of lines of business as well underneath the broad scenario. So as an example, I did talk about surety. Surety has been a growing \u2013 with a solid performance in 2017. Our top line in surety was up 10%. It's one of our outstanding return areas. We're going to do more in surety. And so we're also mixing the book underneath. Auto is showing signs of improvement in Commercial Lines as well as Personal Lines, so that's an improvement story. So we're battling hard to, number one, maintain the strong margins we've achieved, but to see if we can do a little bit better in 2018.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. And then another question. In terms of auto, in your guide for this year, you get to about that 96.5, which has been your target for that business. And you did 0.2 still taking rate in the high single digits. So maybe this is more when we think out beyond 2018, but do you think you can run that business better than a 96.5? Because meaning, if you keep taking high single-digit rates, essentially, you could get the margin lower or then where we just see greater expenses as well in that business.","Chris Swift","Elyse, it's Chris. I would say, again, as I pivoted, and Doug has been talking about, too, I mean, we're trying to return to growth, right? I mean, we've had to take some aggressive actions with the book in shrinking it. So I would say that the growth aspect of it will contribute to obviously an expanding combined ratio while we continue to manage loss cost in trends. And I would say, again, it's going to be a dynamic marketplace out there, too. I mean, there is a lot of strong competition in this area. We're focused in on the more of the mature market segment with a value proposition that is somewhat different. So we remain confident that we can grow and return to the higher levels of premium volumes, which should also generate some relief on the expense ratio. But make no mistake, I mean, it's still going to be very, very competitive.","Doug Elliot","Elyse, just \u2013 I certainly echo all of Chris' focus comments on growth. The other thing I would just point out, I think I mentioned returning to mid-single digits as opposed to higher single digits. So I expect pricing over the next several quarters to be more in that five range than the higher single digits.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, that\u2019 great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Your line is open.","Jay Gelb","Thank you. Beth, can you talk about the potential for share buybacks to restart and the timing on that and what we should think about in terms of magnitude of buybacks in 2018?","Beth Bombara","Yes. So Jay, I'll go back to the comments that we made in the fourth quarter when we stopped our share buyback due to the Aetna acquisition. We'll be back to you when we have a new capital management plan. But right now, we're focused on closing Talcott, and then we'll evaluate what the best use of that capital is and the timing, but not prepared to talk today about expectations for 2018.","Jay Gelb","Okay. And then my follow-up, and this is \u2013 I remember sort of asking this question on the Talcott call. I believe now that the expectation is for an 11% to 12% return on equity in 2018, I believe back when Talcott was announced, the expectation was for that to improve in 2019 as the full benefit of the Aetna transaction comes into play. Is that still the case for 2019?","Chris Swift","Jay, it's Chris. I think the \u2013 I probably led that charge on the improvement. And I would say, generally, directionally, we still see it, but I mean, there's going to be some competing forces, right? So we always try to stay focused on hand on what we need to do in 2018 that sets up a good 2019.","So know our focus is on executing, particularly as it relates to standing up Talcott as a separate company, integrating Aetna and making sure we're getting all the expense saves out of there, which obviously from an earnings side, I will contribute in 2019. But on the other hand, we are \u2013 with that 11% to 12% guide, that does reflect a significant tax benefit in 2018 that we'll have to see how that plays out in 2019 and 2020 and beyond. So that would be the only caveat that I would share with you. There could be some competing forces that impact that trend going forward.","Jay Gelb","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Josh Shanker","The first question, it looks like there are some competitors in the auto market who will be stepping up to make customer growth a priority for 2018. Can you talk a little about the sales proposition at the AARP business and how you retain those customers and how those customers might be less risky to be picked off by a more aggressive competitor in the market?","Doug Elliot","Let me try to tackle, Josh, that in a few pieces. Number one, we're certainly ramping up marketing, as I mentioned, so that we get more client contact, we get more inbound activity. And based on our marketing evidence in the last 90 days, that's happening. So we're feeling more flow. Second part is our ability to close, offer competitive prices and then close. And so we're focused on our skills on the phone. We're focused on our fine-tuning of our auto class plan. Again, this is a state-by-state mix dynamic. So there are a lot of dynamics that we are working on, all trying to improve our close ratio on those inbound calls. And again, we're going to continue to move our marketing spend up as we move throughout 2018. So I expect this to be a growing positive story, but we'll have to work our way through the first 90 days, and then we'll share progress as we move throughout the year.","Josh Shanker","All right. I'll take one more stab at the $25,000 question that Jay asked. In \u2013 your preference is obviously to do a transaction, I think, overdo buybacks if the right transaction came along. But what is your appetite for letting a war chest build or the priority about returning capital as it builds to shareholders? Is there a philosophy internally about what to do with money as it comes in?","Christ Swift","Yes. I appreciate the question, Josh. Yes, what I would say, again, in the follow-up to Jay's question, I mean, we've got a lot of levers still to continue to expand ROE. So as much as \u2013 and we talked about some competing forces that might be happening. I mean, there are levers that we have to be able to help manage to expand ROE beyond that 11% to 12% that we guided to in 2018. And clearly, capital management is one of them. So I think you've seen our history. We balanced. We're thoughtful. We're, if anything, consistent. So I would expect that philosophy to continue. I don't think there's a calculus I could share with you right now, but as excess capital builds, we know we have to deploy it effectively or return it to shareholders in a timely basis. And that's what I would say right now.","Josh Shanker","Thank you very much for the answers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open.","Meyer Shields","Doug, I'm wondering if you could give us a sense as to the auto claim frequency trends that you've embedded in current pricing?","Doug Elliot","Well, certainly, 2017, we've talked about them, right, so we feel very good. Our frequency has essentially been flat. We've had low severities, low single-digit severities. We are looking forward at similar frequency trends for 2018, and I would say small single-digit severity trends in the two to four range. So not a lot different in 2018 than what we think we're experiencing today, what we are expressing today. And that's as much as I want to give on the guidance front.","Meyer Shields","No, that's good. It's helpful. And second question, as we anticipate stronger U.S. economic growth, does that have any implications on its own for margins in workers' compensation and in Maxum?","Doug Elliot","Where we have felt that strong economy certainly is in our Bond business with construction start-ups. We've had a number of nice opportunities in our construction unit, in new projects, shovels in the ground, et cetera. And obviously, we continue to fill in Small Commercial. So the start-ups, the new economy, the small employee groups, under five, where we have a terrific product, and we have a lot of focus in that micro segment of Small. So those areas are clearly signs that we're bullish about. And I think we'll see more of that as we move through 2018. Overall, a solid economy is a good indicator of workers' comp and disability. So we understand that our trends relative to employment are good signals for key lines for us. And we have our fingers crossed that we'll see a very solid economy moving forward that we'll be able to grow from moving into 2018.","Meyer Shields","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel with Janney. Your line is open.","Bob Glasspiegel","We've had sort of a turbulent financial market in the first quarter. I wonder if you could just talk about your overall investment strategy going into the market and whether you're in a derisking, rerisking, looking at this as an opportunity to buy. How are you repositioning portfolio through this?","Chris Swift","Bob, let me start, and then Brion Johnson, our CIO, is with us here, and ask him to give you some additional color. But generally, I think we feel very good. And we\u2019ve got a high-quality portfolio, well diversified. We\u2019ve traded out of certain sectors a while ago that we did not think held its potential for returns. So the largest concentration we have is still in munis and in corporate investment-grade bonds. So generally, we feel very good. I mean \u2013 and if you look closely at the tape, I mean, credit spreads are holding in fairly well. We\u2019ll see how trading goes today. So to the extent that the equity markets have been rolled over, corrected a little bit, we\u2019re not seeing the same pressure to date in the credit environment. But Brion, what would you add?","Brion Johnson","So thanks for your question, Bob. I would say that Chris articulated it well. We take a sort of a through-the- cycle approach to the investment portfolio. We\u2019re very comfortable with the status of the portfolio. It is a high- quality portfolio. And over time, we have been lowering the risk profile of the portfolio just as the cycle got longer and the compensation for risk got lower. So since we\u2019ve been doing that, we\u2019re pretty reasonably well positioned for the environment that we\u2019re in. We\u2019re nibbling around the edges where we see opportunities, but we\u2019re we see opportunities, but we\u2019re not inclined to change the overall risk profile of the portfolio in response to recent developments.","Bob Glasspiegel","Thank you very much. Just a quick follow-up. First quarter weather in the Northeast sometimes nails you, cold and frozen roofs. Have issues yet that you\u2019d spike out, Doug? Or\u2026","Chris Swift","Bob, again, I\u2019m looking at Doug, too. There\u2019s nothing that hits our radar screen. I mean, you\u2019re always going to have some frozen pipes. I was in Minneapolis earlier this week, and it was cold, and \u2013 but it\u2019s the winter. So \u2013 but nothing\u2019s hit our desk as anything outsized right now, Doug, would you say?","Doug Elliot","I agree with that.","Bob Glasspiegel","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi, good morning. First, I had a question on Personal Lines. As you think about the price hikes that you\u2019ve been implementing, obviously, those have helped your margins recover. Have you been able to raise prices through all the states? Or are there states that are still pending that haven\u2019t fully flown through yet?","Doug Elliot","Jimmy, there are still states that we are working on. So we\u2019ve achieved rate adequacy in a number of states, the large majority of the states, certainly majority. But there\u2019s still a couple of key states that are working. And California is one of those states that made a lot of progress, but we have a little bit more work to do as we move into 2018.","Jimmy Bhullar","And I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s a material part of your business?","Doug Elliot","It is. It\u2019s a significant part of our Personal Lines business.","Jimmy Bhullar","Then on just \u2013 so what\u2019s your expectation for lapses on the Aetna group business as you onboard it? And are there any concerns that they sold a lot of business on a bundle or cross-sold business with major medical? And even though you\u2019re going to be doing it, it\u2019s still a separate company. So what\u2019s your expectation for lapses as you onboard the book?","Chris Swift","Jimmy, it\u2019s Chris. All the \u2013 and Doug made the commentary on it. All the data that we see, we knew going into it. We\u2019re not surprised. We are obviously trying to renew as much of that business as possible. We understood their pricing approach and philosophy. We\u2019re harmonizing it with ours. We\u2019ll be thoughtful. I would still say that, again, the guidance that we provided, I mean, there is a tolerance for shock lapses in 2018 that we\u2019re going to try to manage to avoid. But I think we have a reasonable to conservative plan on premiums from a lapse side. And Doug, I know we got weekly integration meetings, and we\u2019re trying to manage to outperform that, Jimmy, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any surprises. And we\u2019ve got similar experience with profit improvement on certain accounts in our book over the years, and we\u2019ll execute very thoughtfully. ","Doug Elliot","And Jimmy, you know how far in advance this book works, right? So we didn\u2019t expect to see much shock lapse in 2018 because much of that had been renewed over the course of the spring and summer months, certainly, the National Account book. We are right in the throes of working hard on the 2019 book. Chris and I are heavily involved in the key account decisions. So literally, I felt like we have information we\u2019re not sharing. We are working over the next 90 to 120 days on key 2019 renewals. And I think we\u2019ve built in some shock, but based on what we\u2019ve seen so far, we feel very good about the way the integration\u2019s going, the sales force coming together, the tools and technology road map. So I\u2019m optimistic about how this is coming together, and I think our plans are well-thought-out.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. And then just lastly, for Beth, can you quantify stranded overhead from Talcott that might need to be allocated to the other businesses? And how was that accounted for this quarter?","Beth Bombara","Yes. So we estimate that when we look at the costs that aren\u2019t transferring with the transaction, it\u2019s probably $35 million to $40 million annually, and we expect to eliminate those stranded costs over the next 18 to 24 months. So I don\u2019t see that as being a significant drag for our businesses. You\u2019ll see some of those costs in the corporate line until we close. But again, when you think about the size of our expense base, it\u2019s a pretty small amount.","Jimmy Bhullar","And that\u2019s stranded as well as allocated? Because there\u2019s some probably corporate overhead that\u2019s allocated to Talcott that\u2019ll be \u2013 that\u2019ll have to be allocated to the rest of the business.","Beth Bombara","Yes, that\u2019s how I\u2019m defining stranded. I\u2019m looking at all the costs that we previously allocated to Talcott, looking at those things that I know we\u2019re transferring, those things that we know will just get eliminated right away. And then this is the \u2013 really the overhead piece that we have to address.","Jimmy Bhullar","And this quarter that number was still in discontinued operations? Or was that allocated out of that already?","Beth Bombara","It\u2019s already \u2013 it\u2019s in the corporate line. It\u2019s kind of hard to see for the quarter, but yes, it\u2019s in the corporate line.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to the presenters. ","Sabra Purtill","Thank you. Thank you for joining us today. And if you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to follow up with the Investor Relations team. Thank you again, and we look forward to seeing you \u2013 some of you next week in New York. Goodbye.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

[Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. ","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Susan Spivak, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Spivak, you may begin your conference.","Susan Bernstein","Thanks, Alyssa. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for our call on fourth quarter and year-end 2019 earnings. We reported our results yesterday afternoon and posted all the earnings-related materials on our website. ","For the call today, our speakers are Chris Swift, Chairman and CEO of The Hartford; Doug Elliot, President; and Beth Costello, Chief Financial Officer. Following their prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A period. ","Just a few final comments before Chris begins.

Replays of this webcast and an official transcript will be available on The Hartford's website for 1 year. ","I'll now turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher Swift","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. 2019 was an excellent year and a pivotal year for The Hartford. We set ambitious goals and delivered on strategic objectives while achieving strong financial results. Fourth quarter core earnings were $522 million or $1.43 per diluted share, an 84% increase over prior year driven by significantly lower catastrophe losses, exceptional results in Group Benefits and strong investment performance. ","For the year, core earnings were $2.1 billion or $5.65 per diluted share, up 31% from 2018. Book value per diluted share ex AOCI rose $43.71, an 11% increase for the year. And the 12-month core earnings ROE was 13.6%, an impressive result in the current market environment. Hard work by talented employees across The Hartford enabled us to perform at this high level. ","Turning to our results. In Commercial Lines, the underlying combined ratio of 94 is a strong result particularly in a year where we have incorporated Navigators. Just as impressive has been the speed with which the 2 organizations have come together as a focused team able to strongly position The Hartford in the marketplace and capture new business opportunities in firming market conditions. ","As the integration progresses, we are seeing more opportunities to improve underwriting profitability, cross-sell products, improve claim processes and leverage all the capabilities of The Hartford platform. These activities, coupled with continued rigorous execution on renewal pricing and retention, will contribute to our goal of achieving $200 million of incremental core earnings from the acquisition. ","In Commercial Lines, I am pleased with achieved rate increases across the portfolio with a focus on margin improvement. In Middle Market, renewal pricing excluding workers' compensation accelerated through each quarter of the year, culminating with a 7.1% increase during the fourth quarter. Personal Lines core earnings improved to $285 million as we benefited from much lower catastrophe losses with an underlying combined ratio of 91.9. New sales for auto and home were up 36% over prior year with improving retentions, all contributing towards the goal of future net written premium growth. ","Group Benefits had an outstanding year with core earnings of $539 million, up $112 million from 2018, with a core earnings margin of 8.9%. This performance was largely due to a 3-point loss ratio improvement over prior year, reflecting continued favorable disability incidence trends and strong disability claim recoveries, partially offset by elevated life severity experienced earlier in the year. ","On the top line, fully insured ongoing premiums were flat to prior year. Fully insured ongoing sales for 2019 were $647 million, down $57 million as prior year included first year sales related to the new Paid Family Leave product in New York. ","Persistency, as expected, was slightly below historical trends as we adjust pricing on targeted segments of the Aetna book. Overall, earned premium on the Aetna book is in line with our deal assumptions, and case conversions continue to go well from both a platform and pricing perspective. We are very pleased with the operational execution, integration and financial performance of Group Benefits. ","Looking ahead to 2020. We are expecting a core earnings margin in the range of 6.5% to 7.5%, which assumes moderate premium growth over 2019 driven by sales and improved persistency, a lower expected investment yield driven by a 7% limited partnership return assumption and normalized claim incidence risk and recovery trends in long-term disability. January sales were solid in a competitive market but were down slightly from 2019 due to fewer large case sales. ","Before turning the call over to Doug, I'll provide my perspective on a couple macro themes. First, social inflation continues to dominate industry conversations as the current hot topic. Last quarter, I said that social inflation was not a new phenomenon. A quarter later, my view hasn't changed. But there are a few points to make. I expect some level of social inflation will be felt by many carriers, if not all, across the industry. However, the impact on loss costs will vary by company. Variation depends on several factors, including the line of business and coverage limits; type of coverage, such as primary, umbrella or excess; specific contractual terms; and reinsurance programs. Each company's ability to react to social inflation will be impacted by the quality of data and analytics supporting product pricing and loss reserve estimates. At The Hartford, I feel confident that we are -- that our analytical capabilities, along with our talented claims and legal professionals, have allowed us to build a track record of making timely adjustments to loss cost assumptions reflected in our financial results over the past 4 to 5 years. ","The second topic is interest rates. For several quarters, we have discussed the impact of a persistent low interest rate environment on the ability to grow net investment income. Currently, our portfolio continues to perform well, but it is clear that the interest rate environment is becoming more challenging. This will impact the investment returns on new cash flows, reinvestment rates and our overall portfolio yield. The implication is that net investment income will likely become a headwind to core earnings growth, requiring higher levels of underwriting income to support earnings and ROE. This, coupled with loss cost trends, leads me to believe the firming cycle we are experiencing will likely continue for the next 18 to 24 months. ","In closing, when I look out to 2020 and beyond, I think about how far our businesses have evolved over the past decade and how well positioned The Hartford is as a market leader. We have expanded underwriting capabilities and provide a broad range of products delivered through multiple distribution channels to meet customer needs in a dynamic market environment. We are focused on execution, integration, innovation and maximizing our enhanced capabilities to organically grow the business. ","In Small Commercial, we are a top industry player and have demonstrated consistent financial performance and innovation over the years with a focus on the customer experience. We are growth orientated with a multichannel distribution strategy and expansive underwriting appetite to serve more classes of business. ","In Middle & Large Commercial, we aim to improve margins and leverage new product breadth. Pricing is improving, and we have identified attractive opportunities to cross-sell specialty products. ","In Global Specialty, we are newly positioned with a broader product portfolio and expanded distribution. In the wholesale and Lloyd's market, we will focus on integration and improving margins. ","In our Personal Lines business, we have enjoyed a unique relationship with AARP for over 35 years. We continue to look for opportunities to drive top line growth. And finally, in Group Benefits, we are nearing the completion of integration activities. Our focus now is on future growth stemming from new products and services designed to complement existing risk products while improving the customer experience. ","We enter 2020 well positioned in the market. Moreover, we remain committed to making a sustainable and positive impact on society as an essential element of our ongoing success. Across The Hartford, we're making this happen by always doing the right thing, fostering a workplace where everyone is welcome and respected, using our resources and influence to address the challenge of changing climate and helping to make our communities where we live and work be safer and more successful. I'm very proud that these sustainability efforts are widely recognized as industry-leading. ","In summary, I'm confident our enhanced capabilities in a firming market, combined with ongoing capital management, provide the opportunity for The Hartford to enhance value for all our stakeholders. ","Now I'll turn the call over to Doug.","Douglas Elliot","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. 2019 was a very good year for Property & Casualty. We're pleased with the underlying financial performance of our business units and the achievement of important initiatives we established for 2019. In Small Commercial, we continue to outperform with another sub-90 underlying combined ratio for the year and early new business momentum from the launch of our next-generation Spectrum product. In Middle & Large Commercial, we're maintaining positive traction across our industry verticals while we work to improve profitability on our core book. In Global Specialty and across Commercial Lines, we're leveraging the product breadth and underwriting expertise arising from the Navigators acquisition to deepen relationships with customers and distribution partners. Through year-end, we've delivered approximately $50 million of incremental sales across Middle & Large Commercial and Global Specialty that would not have been possible without the acquisition. This positive start provides confidence that we will outpace our 3-year incremental revenue goal of $200 million. ","In Personal Lines, the business had an excellent earnings year. We continue to work on driving new business growth, while moderating renewal written price increases have helped to improve policy retention levels for the year. ","Let me now pivot to summarize our financial performance for 2019, and then I'll conclude with some thoughts about 2020. Commercial Lines core earnings were $1.17 billion for the year on a combined ratio of 97.7. This includes catastrophe losses of $323 million or 3.9 points. Net favorable prior year development for the year was $112 million or 1.4 points excluding Navigators prior year development recorded at the acquisition date. ","In the fourth quarter, we reported $37 million of net favorable prior year development, which primarily consisted of favorable experience in both Small Commercial package business and the workers' compensation 2016 and 2017 accident years. This was partially offset by $16 million of unfavorable development primarily on Navigators international reserves. ","The Commercial Lines underlying combined ratio was 94 for the year, increasing 2.5 points from 2018. The Navigators underlying combined ratio is higher than our legacy commercial book and contributed approximately 1 point of the increase. The remainder of the increase was from non-CAT property, workers' compensation and higher commissions. ","Consistent with our expectations, the underlying loss ratio for workers' compensation increased 1 point from 2018, reflecting the competitive market and pricing declines. Loss trends were modest with negative frequency, while medical and indemnity severity trends were in the mid-single digits. ","Renewal written pricing in Standard Commercial Lines was 3.5% for the quarter, up 50 basis points from third quarter. Fourth quarter 2019 renewal written pricing was up 1.9 points from the fourth quarter of last year. Middle Market renewal written pricing in the U.S. excluding workers' compensation increased 5.2% for the year, up 2.2 points from last year. In the fourth quarter, the rate increase was 7.1%, up 1.8 points from the third quarter 2019 and up over 4 points from fourth quarter 2018. We have now seen increasing renewal written price increases in these lines for 4 consecutive quarters.","Our Global Specialty book is experiencing even stronger pricing gains in both our U.S. wholesale book and the international portfolio, which is primarily written in the Lloyd's market. Our U.S. wholesale book achieved an 18% rate increase in the fourth quarter. Several lines were in excess of 20%, including property, auto and excess casualty. ","Our international portfolio also had strong pricing performance in the quarter with particular emphasis on professional lines and onshore energy. Ongoing underwriting actions, coupled with sustained rate increases in this book, will drive profitability improvement in 2020 and beyond. ","We continue to monitor loss trends in our book, especially liability. We expect 2020 primary liability and commercial auto loss trends to be in the mid-single digits. Excess liability loss trend will be a few points higher than primary. While our book is certainly not immune to the ongoing unfavorable tort trends, we continue to take underwriting, pricing and reserve actions to address this liability trend. Our teams actively monitor these claim trends and currently do not see significant shifts in either representation or litigation rates. This will continue to be a critical watch area for us in 2020. Overall, I'm very pleased with how effectively our team is balancing growth and profitability along with our pricing progress in the second half of 2019. ","Moving to our individual business units. Small Commercial had another strong year. The underlying combined ratio was 89.1 for the year, up 2.4 points from prior year, reflecting the workers' compensation pricing environment, higher property, fire severity and higher supplemental commissions. Total Small Commercial written premium increased 2% for the full year, with fourth quarter written premium relatively flat to 2018. ","Policy count and premium retentions remain strong, both up 1 point from prior year. And new business increased to $646 million for the full year, up 8%. In the fourth quarter 2019, new business declined from prior year primarily reflecting the increase in new business last year from the Foremost renewal rights transaction. Excluding Foremost, new business premium increased 9% in the quarter. ","Moving to Middle & Large Commercial. We posted an underlying combined ratio of 99 for the year, up 0.6 point from 2018 primarily due to higher commissions and technology spend. Total written premium increased by 9% for the full year, 6% if you exclude the impact of Navigators acquisition. We are achieving positive top line results from our investments in new industry verticals, particularly large property, construction, programs and energy. We're also growing our National Accounts business with written premiums up over 6% last year. ","The efforts to improve the profitability of our Middle Market book through rate and underwriting actions have intensified in the second half of the year. Middle Market retention levels were up slightly year-over-year, and new business premium of $584 million for the full year was up 8% versus 2018. However, Middle Market new written premium declined 11% in the fourth quarter compared to last year primarily in workers' compensation and auto. Premium retention was also up 3 points from a year ago. We remain disciplined with our pricing methodologies as competitors have been willing to write at more aggressive levels. ","In Global Specialty, the underlying combined ratio was 96 for the full year, up nearly 8 points over 2018 almost entirely due to the inclusion of the Navigators business. We continue to deliver strong underwriting results in our legacy, management and professional liability and surety lines. ","In the second half of the year, the underlying combined ratio was 98.5, 2 points above the upper end of our guidance we provided on the second quarter call. In the fourth quarter, we had several large losses written from our international desk, including a $6 million loss related to a Texas oil refinery explosion and a $4 million property and business interruption loss from a Florida tornado. ","The significant rate and underwriting actions we're taking across the Navigators book is pressuring retention in some U.S. business lines. Retentions are generally stable in the international book. With these actions, I'm confident we've established a path to meet our profitability goals over the coming years. ","Shifting to Personal Lines. Core earnings for the year of $285 million with a combined ratio of 95 improved from a 2018 core loss of $28 million. This improvement was largely driven by a $321 million after-tax decrease in catastrophe losses between years. The full year underlying combined ratio increased modestly to 91.9 driven by higher expenses, partially offset by slightly improving results in auto. ","The Personal Lines auto underlying combined ratio improved slightly to 97.9 for the full year. We've been able to stay ahead of loss trends. Year-over-year frequency continues to decline, while severity increased in the low to mid-single digits. Higher underwriting expenses due to increased marketing efforts combined with lower earned premium drove the Personal Lines expense ratio up 1.7 points for the full year.","Before I turn things over to Beth, I'd like to share a few thoughts about 2020. In Property & Casualty, we're focused on several priorities. First, we intend to fully leverage the combined product breadth, talent and distribution capabilities we now have at The Hartford. We will drive growth in Global Specialty and Middle Market with deep product sets and broader distribution across both retail and wholesale channels. ","Second, we continue the underwriting journey to improve financial returns across Middle Market and Global Specialty. We intend to achieve strong financial performance as we drive higher written pricing in both domestic and international property and liability lines while actively adjusting our limit profiles and class mix. ","Finally, we're focused on growth initiatives with both Small Commercial Spectrum as well as our AARP new business. Specifically in Middle Market commercial, we expect renewal written pricing to remain strong during 2020. In Global Specialty, we expect renewal written rate increases to remain in the double digits. We'll continue to lean into this rapidly firming market to improve the profitability of both our Middle Market core lines and Global Specialty book. In workers' compensation, we expect continued pricing headwinds. ","As a result, we expect the 2020 Commercial Lines underlying combined ratio to be between 92 and 94, slightly better than our performance for 2019. Contributing to this improvement are improved results in liability and property lines partially offset by margin compression in workers' compensation as negative rates earn through our book. ","Personal Lines will continue to drive new business growth in AARP Direct. We are fine-tuning our product segmentation and expect new written premium growth in the low double digits for the year. For 2020, we expect to achieve an underlying combined ratio of 91.5 to 93.5. Reflecting back, 2019 was a very good year for our business units across Property & Casualty. Our results demonstrate a disciplined underwriting organization committed to achieving strong margins and seeking growth when it meets our profit targets. We're pleased with the progress of integrating Global Specialty and its positive impact with our customers and distribution partners. I look forward to updating you all on our progress throughout the year. ","Let me now turn the call over to Beth.","Beth Costello","Thank you, Doug. I will review results for the investment portfolio, Hartford Funds and Corporate and cover a few other items before turning the call over for Q&A. Our investment portfolio continues to perform very well with strong limited partnership returns and generally stable investment yields despite lower reinvestment rates. Net investment income was $503 million for the quarter, up $46 million or 10% from the prior year. For the year, net investment income was about $2 billion, up 10% over 2018 due to the growth in asset levels primarily from the Navigators acquisition and higher partnership income. The annualized limited partnership return was 11.9% in the quarter due to higher valuations on underlying funds and real estate property sales. ","Net unrealized gains on fixed maturities after tax decreased to $1.7 billion at December 31 from $1.8 billion at September 30. Unrealized and realized gains on equity securities classified in the income statement were $73 million before tax in the quarter and $254 million for the full year. The credit performance of the investment portfolio remains very strong. There were no impairments in the fourth quarter. For the quarter, the current yield before tax excluding limited partnerships was 3.8%, up 10 basis points from fourth quarter 2018 due to higher make-whole payments and mortgage loan prepayment fees. Before limited partnerships and nonroutine income items, we expect a before-tax average portfolio yield of 3.4% to 3.5% in 2020 driven mostly by lower reinvestment rates and the projected decline in short-term rates based off of today's forward curve. ","Turning to Hartford Funds. Core earnings of $40 million were up 5% from fourth quarter last year and up $1 million sequentially. Daily average AUM rose 2% from third quarter 2019 reflecting strong market performance. Net flows were a positive $218 million in the fourth quarter driven by exchange-traded products and fixed income funds compared to net outflows in fourth quarter 2018 of $1.7 billion. ","Investment performance remains very strong. As of December 31, about 62% of Hartford Funds outperformed peers on a 1-year basis and about 72% of peers on a 3- and 5-year basis. ","Corporate core losses of $39 million in the quarter improved by $7 million from 2018. The retained equity interest in Talcott generated $17 million of income after tax compared to $6 million in fourth quarter 2018. During the quarter, we completed our annual study of asbestos and environmental reserves, which resulted in a $117 million increase in reserves, which was ceded to National Indemnity under our adverse development cover, resulting in no impact to net income. Of the $117 million, $65 million related to asbestos, which is significantly less than the development we have seen in recent years as the number of mesothelioma claim filings was favorable to our previous projections. The increase in asbestos reserves was largely driven by an increase in average settlement values. Environmental reserves increased by $52 million in part due to an increase in estimated cost to remediate sites as required by state regulators. ","As of December 31, 2019, the company has incurred a cumulative $640 million in adverse development on A&E reserves that have been ceded under the ADC, resulting in $860 million of coverage available for any future net reserve development. As Doug noted, in the fourth quarter, we recognized $16 million of unfavorable development on prior accident year reserves related to Navigators' international business. While adverse development on prior year reserves is economically reinsured to National Indemnity under the reinsurance we put in place at closing, that benefit is deferred under retroactive reinsurance accounting since cumulative losses ceded exceed the premium paid of $91 million. This deferred gain will be recognized in earnings in future years when we will start recovering cash from National Indemnity. After the actions this quarter, we have $193 million remaining capacity on this ADC. ","As of January 1, 2020, we completed the renewal of the property catastrophe reinsurance program. For the per occurrence treaty, the overall coverage and per occurrence retention of $350 million remain the same. Within the per occurrence program, we renewed coverage for $200 million of per event losses in excess of $150 million for catastrophes other than named storms or earthquakes. Our co-participation on the $200 million layer is 30%, up from 20% in 2019. We renewed our property catastrophe aggregate treaty and lowered the attachment point to $700 million of aggregate covered losses with a fully reinsured layer of $200 million above the attachment point. Effective with this renewal, catastrophe events from Navigators business other than from the assumed reinsurance business are covered by the program. A summary of the details of the catastrophe reinsurance program is included in the appendix to the slide deck. ","In the fourth quarter of 2019, we repurchased 1.8 million shares for $110 million. Since inception through January 31, we have repurchased 4.3 million shares for $254 million. In addition, yesterday, the Board increased the quarterly common stock dividend by 8%. With strong capital generation and financial flexibility, we are pleased to be able to both invest in our businesses and return capital to shareholders. ","Book value per diluted share excluding AOCI was $43.71, up 11% in 2019. Core earnings ROE over the last 12 months was 13.6%, well in excess of our cost of equity capital. ","In summary, 2019 was a very successful year for The Hartford. We generated strong earnings, closed on the acquisition of Navigators, and we are confident in our ability to continue to generate shareholder value. ","I'll now turn the call over to Susan so we can begin the Q&A session.","Susan Bernstein","Thank you, Beth. We have about 30 minutes for questions. Can you please repeat the instructions, Alyssa, for asking a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And the first question today comes from Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan. ","Jimmy Bhullar","So I had a question first just on the workers' comp line, if you can sort of quantify how much you're -- what you're seeing in terms of rate pressure in the business. And then on commercial auto, you're one of the few companies that has not seen sort of continued adverse reserve development. I think you had some last quarter, but this quarter, your results were better than some of your peers. So if you could just talk about what's going on there.","Douglas Elliot","Sure, Jimmy. Let's take each of the pieces. On the workers' comp side, two different dynamics, one with our small commercial sector where we're seeing negative pricing and have very little ability to do anything about it relative to underwriting. So those rates -- those negative rates flow through. On the Middle Market side, largely a flattish environment. And so that means we're dealing with account experience sector, performance and doing our best to work against the negative file trends across the various states. So that's the workers' comp situation. ","Relative to auto, I would describe auto as an ongoing work in process here over the last eight years. We've been working on auto, which is why I think you don't see the surprises in the quarter. We have strength in auto over the last 6, 7 accident years. We strengthened a little bit in the third quarter but felt very good about where our position was for Q4. So that's the reason there was no activity in Q4.","Jimmy Bhullar","And then if I could just ask one more on Group Benefits. Your margins, along with everybody else, in disability have been very strong. How much of this are you seeing companies begin to reflect in their pricing as you went through renewal season? And is there any reason to believe that, at least in the near term, that the trend in terms of margins will reverse?","Christopher Swift","Well, Jimmy, thanks for the question. I would say the market is competitive, no doubt about it, but largely still rational but competitive. And you're right. I mean we've been enjoying a pretty good run particularly with incidences and getting people back to work that have been out. How long this continues, I'm not sure I could predict. Obviously, we gave you our guidance for what we think is going to happen next year. And if I really sort of do a step change on where our margin is today to where we think it is next year on a normalized basis, I would say 0.7 decline due to net investment income, 0.8 of a decline due to again normalized loss ratios. And we're going to spend some incremental dollars in our infrastructure there. So there's a little bit of expense pressure. ","So we still see a good earning business in that 7-ish percent margin. And we'll try to compete with our competitors the best way we can on differentiating our services, our skills and our capabilities.","Operator","The next question today comes from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan","My first question, when you guys had announced the Navigators deal, the goal was about $200 million of income over like a 5-year period. And so kind of half a year into the transaction, seems like margin's a little bit weaker. And now we also have the headwind of lower interest rates on investment income. So can you just walk us through, I guess, bridge us to kind of what the offsets are and why you still think you can get -- what would help you get to that $200 million target?","Christopher Swift","Sure. Well, again, thank you for joining. I think you have the components that we've talked about. And the major ones are obviously net investment income, improved loss ratio performance and, to a lesser extent, expense savings. I think we also talked about, Elyse, on a short-term or near-term basis, we still see approximately $110 million of core earnings in 2020. And for the Navigators business, that will flow through the new Global Specialty segment. So that's again at the lower end of our range primarily due to the interest rate environment. ","But equally, in the past, the $200 million, and quite frankly, we think it's getting shorter than that 5-year period of time primarily due just to the rate environment and the improvement of possibilities that we are planning for and seeing in the book. Really pleased with the entire team, and Doug could give you more insights and analysis on it. But we're expecting significant rate with what we think is realistic loss cost trends that we're planning for. And eventually, those will cross and start to really improve. ","In fact, Doug, I think just my calculations and our analysis would say we're looking for a 5 or 6 point loss ratio improvement in the Navigators book next year, Elyse, based on activities that we're seeing today.","Douglas Elliot","Chris, I would just add, absolutely that we are bullish about what we think we'll achieve in 2020. The other thing is that the accumulation of underwriting actions that were taken across the book between change in limit profile, attachment points, exiting classes, adjusting MGA capacity, underwriting limits, et cetera, are also going to be a core driver of that performance change. And I'm very encouraged by the actions that not only we've taken but will continue to take into 2020. So I think Vince Tizzio and the team have done a terrific job at resetting the book. Yes, we're encouraged about the pricing, and that provides an awful lot of our tone. But I also think we'll see the benefits of the labor inside our underwriting activities also play out meaningfully in our $200 million run.","Beth Costello","Yes. And the only thing I'd add to that, and I think Chris touched on this, but your point about our original projections on investment income are obviously correct. The rate environment is different. But we're also seeing more expense benefit than we originally anticipated, and the offset of those 2 pretty much wash each other out.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question, as we think about capital return in 2020, is there any timing to think about in terms of when you can get some of the dividends from the subs or the tax attributes? Or should we just think about kind of even share repurchase throughout the four quarters? And then second question there, Beth, are there any tax attributes that we should think about for 2021 as we think about capital return beyond 2020?","Beth Costello","Sure. So a couple of things. So as we think about the cash flow to the holding company over the year, I really see those building over the year. Some of the tax benefits come in over the course of time, but a big chunk of that comes in with the AMT refund, which is really predicated on when the IRS accepts our tax return and when that's filed. So from a pace of share repurchase, I would expect that to be increasing over the year and not necessarily ratable throughout the year. ","And then as far as tax attributes, when we look towards 2021, based on our expectation of utilization this year, I expect that when we get to 2021, we'll probably just be in sort of the normal course of tax benefits coming to the holding company related to the deduction we get on interest expense through our normal tax sharing arrangement. So it would be significantly lower than what we're expecting this year and probably slightly under $100 million.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Newsome of Piper Sandler.","Jon Newsome","I was hoping you could expand a little bit more on the Personal Lines operation and give us a little sense of kind of where we are from a pricing versus underlying claim cost environment.","Douglas Elliot","Paul, sure, let me tackle that one. This is Doug. We're obviously pleased about our financial performance in 2019. You see the pricing is down a bit. I think it's down a bit commensurate with where we see loss trends. So as I've commented, frequency has been in very good shape for now an extended series of quarters. And we're watching carefully severity. We're watching physical damage in particular. But the aggregate of both frequency and severity put the loss trend in the low single digits, and I think that's where we are from a pricing perspective. So I feel like we're right on top of it. ","Now we also have goals to move our new business north. So we will address pricing and new business targets, et cetera, as we move through 2020 because we'd like to further stimulate new business growth. But I think we've done a nice job at getting the book healthy from a profit perspective, and we'll continue to balance both growth and profit as we go through 2020 and beyond.","Jon Newsome","And then my second question is, I'd like to know a little bit more about persistency, particularly just across the property\/casualty businesses. And normally, in a harder market, you have decreases in persistency. Do you think that's going to happen prospectively as well until the market climbs up?","Douglas Elliot","Paul, there are so many pieces to the marketplace. If we talked about it on the extremes, you could move to Small Commercial, and I would say that that's just a very competitive world, not a lot of change from where we've been in the last couple of years. And then you could move into either public D&O or the excess casualty world that is going through enormous amount of change, and the dynamics around pricing and retention are very different across those sectors. So yes, where you see capacity shortage and people are driving rate because of their performance, which I think is where the market is and some of these challenged financial classes, there may be some dynamics across the retention element, but we are determined to get rate where we need it in our book. ","And so I think we have got a very good sense of where that rate need exists across our various products. And if we have to give up a little bit on the retention side to get what we need to do on the pricing, I'm willing to make that trade, particularly in Middle Market and Global Specialty where our returns have to get better. And you saw that in the fourth quarter. I shared with you that our new business was down slightly in Middle Market in the fourth quarter, but I was also really encouraged by our pricing advances. And I'm willing to give a couple of points of retention to do that, which is exactly what happened in the quarter.","Operator","The next question comes from David Motemaden of Evercore ISI.","David Motemaden","Just for Chris or Doug on the Commercial Lines outlook for 2020. Maybe -- I'm just wondering if you could elaborate a bit more on the 92 to 94 underlying combined ratio guide after the, call it, 94.5% to 95% that you guys printed in the second half of '19. And I think, Chris, you mentioned 5- to 6-point improvement on Navigators in 2020. Just wanted to talk about just timing in terms of getting there and some of the other moving pieces that get you confident that you can get there given the results this quarter.","Christopher Swift","David, let me start, and then I'll ask Doug to comment. So it feels like it's like deja vu all over again. This time last year, a lot of our tone was -- is similar to this year, right? You have a workers' comp dynamic that we are going to face some pressure with price, but generally, loss costs there are behaving. And then you have, I'll call it, all the other lines that I think will contribute to margin expansion going forward, particularly the specialty line. ","So sort of it's a tale of a coin there, 2 sides of the coin. But you put them all together and we do still see, at least from where our run rate ended in 2019, the ability to expand margins on an overall book basis, offsetting some of the pressure we see in comp with the strong pricing in liability, property, commercial auto and obviously our specialty line. So Doug, that's what I would say as sort of a macro perspective.","Douglas Elliot","Yes. I agree with that, Chris. I would also add that we saw a little bit of a bump-up in the quarter for some accruals on the expense side. So the expense piece also is running a little abnormally high in the quarter. But when I adjust for the expense piece, some noise with Navigators and then the encouragement of what's happening on the pricing side, I really do feel like 2020 is achievable. Yes, we have a lot of work to get done to make that happen, but I believe we will. And I think we're off to a terrific start as we closed '19 and entered 2020 to get our numbers moving.","David Motemaden","Got it. Great. And Doug, if I could just follow up, you had mentioned some adjustments to the limit profile that you were making for 2020. Just wondering if you could comment just in terms of what the average in limit size is for you guys ex workers' comp and what changes are you implementing.","Douglas Elliot","When I talk about limit profile, I'm primarily talking about Navigators and our excess casualty book because, as you know, across the core HIG book, we're essentially talking about $1 million, $2 million limits, and we were not much of an umbrella player. Over the last 5 years, Navigators has been working on reducing its limits. So our average limits now are well down below $10 million and in very few places do we take limits greater than $10 million. So our normal book is in the $5 million, maybe in some cases, $10 million limit range. But that's where we play. And over the last couple of years, we've also been working hard at where we attach. So I would say that the profile of limit and the attachment point are keen in our focus, and we'll continue to adjust by class as we move through 2020.","Operator","Next question comes from Ryan Tunis of Autonomous Research.","Ryan Tunis","Doug, I guess, first of all, on workers' comp, did you say in the prepared remarks that, that was a 1-point drag this year on the accident year combined ratio or just on the workers' comp picks?","Douglas Elliot","I did, year-over-year, '18 and '19.","Ryan Tunis","On the overall commercial?","Douglas Elliot","Just on comp itself.","Ryan Tunis","So that means the overall drag would be, what, maybe like 0.5 point on commercial here in '19?","Douglas Elliot","That's a fair estimate to make, yes, Ryan.","Ryan Tunis","Okay. And I guess in the outlook for 2020, are you thinking about a similar type of drag from comp? Or do you expect that to accelerate?","Douglas Elliot","The 0.5 point across our book is what we're expecting in 2020. So when I think about all-in workers' comp across our lines, I think that's a good approximate number to use.","Ryan Tunis","Got it. And then I guess just on Navigators, the 5 to 6 points, it sounds like that could come from 3 areas. It could come from, I guess, less unfavorable loss activity, it could come from rate, and it could come from underwriting improvement, remediation. If you had to think about those 5 or 6 points, how would you divvy it up between those three?","Douglas Elliot","Well, rate is going to be the easiest to measure for sure. And I think based on the high teens that we posted in Q4, we're very positive about progress we're making there. I would add expenses to your pile. I'm not sure I heard expenses in your group, but we are working expenses. And yes, there'll be some expenses that come out of the equation. So that is also a part of it. ","The piece that will be most difficult to measure or quantify will clearly be the underwriting actions because they'll be embedded in losses and will be very difficult to know a loss that you've been able to either moderate or avoid versus an underwriting action taken. I don't think that's measurable. But the combination of those actions and our pricing activity against loss trend, to me, sets up the change that you talked about and that Chris and I referred to.","Ryan Tunis","Got it. And then I guess my last one, Doug, is just thinking about some of the large loss activity. I think you said that was in international. And obviously, this business mix is a little bit new to you guys. If you could maybe give us some perspective on why a $4 million loss and a $6 million loss is, in fact, something that you have a handle on that you wouldn't necessarily expect to recur.","Douglas Elliot","I think we've shared with you from the beginning that the core of The Hartford businesses were more frequency-based, and there's a bit more severity in the Navigators book. We've worked hard over the last 9 months to understand that better by product. As we move into 2020, our metrics will get tighter. Again, we've made and continue to make underwriting adjustments, appetite adjustments, et cetera. ","So as we looked at the fourth quarter and we looked at their property results, both domestically and also international, we just felt like there were a few losses that were beyond our expectations. And we booked them in the quarter and moved our accident year pickup accordingly. Again, as we roll into 2020, we still have to figure out what the right base is to launch from. But I feel like we have accounted for 2019 activity and know exactly what we need to get done in 2020 for us to make the plan that we've talked about.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS.","Brian Meredith","Two questions. Doug, I just wanted to follow up a little bit on what David was talking about as far as limit profile at Navigators. Given the limit profile there is obviously a little bit higher, more property, should we expect this kind of large loss activity to be more frequent in your business going forward?","Douglas Elliot","I don't think so, Brian. And I would actually suggest to you that we're spending a lot of time on their excess casualty portfolio as well. So their umbrella and excess limit product is certainly under enormous interest right now. The market is searching for capacity. And so I think we have deep experienced professionals in that space, a lot of interest on the part of many of our long-term Hartford retail brokers and agents. So the demand is up a lot for that excess casualty. We're using our capacity appropriate, and we're layering in actuarial, data science and all the capabilities that I think we bring as a firm. So encouraged about both opportunity, thoughtful about projections we're making, and we'll understand our book and adjust accordingly as we go through 2020.","Brian Meredith","Got you. But the loss is sort of more property-focused, yes?","Christopher Swift","Brian, it's Chris. Can I just add to Doug's point, including the prior questions? We've worked hard to get our arms around this book, and I believe we have. I think we have a deeper understanding of all aspects of the book, whether it be domestic or international. ","I'd remind you, we largely kept the Navigators reinsurance program in place that, again, on a closer-look basis, we think is well designed. And remember, part of the reason why we did the acquisition was because we like the people. We thought they were talented men and women that had immense capabilities in their own craft, in their own art. And we want to empower them obviously within a risk profile that we're comfortable with, we fully understand. But the execution day to day is -- was left obviously to Vince Tizzio and his team. And I think they're off to a great start in our environment, Doug. And we're growing and improving, and I think we're going to add a lot of value together.","Douglas Elliot","Brian, maybe one other comment on the property side. I don't think -- and I'm not suggesting that what happened in the fourth quarter is this new trend to continue with every quarter, multiple exceptions to our P&L. Yes, they've had some noise in it. I think we are aggressively pricing the sector. I talked about an excess of 18 to 20 points of price in the quarter. We're also non-renewing a series of accounts. And in some of our tech sectors, energy sectors, we have loss ratios that are not sustainable. So we're working on those as we speak and intend to get our property book in line with our expectations going forward.","Brian Meredith","Great. And then my second question, on the Personal Lines side. Just looking at the AARP Direct business, you talked about initiatives in place to drive double-digit new business growth. I guess my question there is are retentions -- are you happy where retentions are? And at what point do you think we could start seeing some actually growth in written premium in the AARP business again?","Douglas Elliot","Yes. Good question. So generally, we are pleased with the recovery on the retention side over the last couple of years. I still think there's a little bit of lift inside that, maybe 1 point, 1 point plus. There's a lot of shopping activity in the environment overall in Personal Lines, so we're mindful of that. But we're both encouraged with progress and also hopeful that there's more to be had on the retention side. ","Relative to new, we have just improved our capabilities both on the desk and with our people, I think, enormously over the last couple of years. We continue to dial in our marketing activities. So I feel pretty good about that. You saw a 35%-plus change for the year in sales. I'm not sure we're going to get there next year with that kind of number, but we certainly expect to be up next year, as I described in my script. So encouraged by that and think that as we move through the latter half of '20 into '21, we'll see that growth move into positive stage for AARP Direct.","Operator","The next question comes from Meyer Shields of KBW.","Meyer Shields","Within Personal Lines, I guess, looking at the guidance, can you give us a sense as to the expectations for non-CAT weather losses on a year-over-year basis?","Douglas Elliot","Beth, do you have the -- I'm not sure I have that handy. Meyer, we can -- let us go back and look at that one and see if we can help.","Meyer Shields","Okay. That's perfect. And then switching over to workers' compensation, we've seen recently, I guess, some signs of medical inflation and some signs of wage growth at least in broader macroeconomic data. Are we seeing any change in severity trends within your book?","Douglas Elliot","Our book is generally stable. So as we look at our long-term picks and our severity estimates, I think we're essentially in line. Now the last couple of years, we probably outperformed slightly. But as we move forward '20- '21, we have not come off our mid-single-digits severity picks, both medical and, to a lesser extent, indemnity.","Operator","The next question comes from Amit Kumar of Buckingham Research.","Amit Kumar","Two quick follow-up questions. The first question goes back to the discussion on the Standard Commercial Lines. If I look at the earned rate, the earned rate was 2.7% in Q4. And you're talking about the loss cost trends in mid-single digit in primary and higher in excess. So if I were to step back, is the thought process that earned rate will accelerate much faster than what you have seen and hence outpace the loss cost? Or how should that translate into margin expansion from here?","Douglas Elliot","Yes, I think that's the right way to look at it. Our delivered written pricing in the fourth quarter extending into 2020 is going to move north the earned rate increases to get on top of the loss trends that I described. So yes, slightly disappointed that we have not been able to drive more pricing, and I'm talking primarily about Middle Market business U.S. And so we've been slightly behind, which is why you're seeing some deterioration in our margins in Middle Market. I expect that to turn in 2020. And the expectation is that we will improve our margins, as Chris noted, essentially in all our lines ex workers' comp.","Christopher Swift","In fact, Doug, isn't it -- I think that the data that we have is ex workers' comp for Standard Commercial, which includes Small and Middle, ex workers' comp, our rate increase is actually about 6.4% during the quarter, which is that momentum that you talked about building and it's expected. And our execution is going to drive that continuation into 2020.","Douglas Elliot","It is. The 6.5% is a pretty solid number. And actually, even in Small Commercial ex workers' comp, we've been at or around the 6% range now for about 8 quarters. So encouraged by that steady performance. And that's really been a good driver in terms of why our combined ratio, both underlying and total, have been in very good shape in Small.","Amit Kumar","Got it. And then the second question I had was, in the opening remarks, you talked about social inflation. And you did mention it's not a new phenomena, et cetera. If we were to go back and compare today versus a year ago, based on the data you're seeing, would you say it's coming in, in line with expectations, slower than expectations or faster than expectations?","Christopher Swift","Yes. Amit, I would say in line with expectations. There isn't anything outside of norm that we see. Doug talked about litigation rates and representation rates that have been generally stable for us over the last 3 or 4 years. So we've had to make some adjustments. We didn't get everything right over a 6-, 7-year period here, but I think we're on top of it. And we're managing the best way we can and being proactive, not only looking back at data but actually trying to think what can happen going forward.","Douglas Elliot","Chris, and that's absolutely true for The Hartford book. What I would add on top of that is that probably in the excess area, we see a little bit more severity, a little bit more social inflation than maybe we expected a year ago. And that's also driving our price increases in the marketplace. So I didn't expect to be looking at a fourth quarter in '19, 12 months prior, in the mid-teens, but I think we need it. And as we better understand that book, we're driving the price increases that need to chase that loss trend. So I feel we're on top of it and pleased that our HIG book continues to perform about the way we expected.","Christopher Swift","And Amit, that's why we did the reinsurance transaction with National Indemnity on Navigators was to really take that tail risk off until we got our arms fully around it. Obviously, we paid a premium for that, but I still like that trade we did given some of the uncertainty in the marketplace today on social inflation.","Operator","The next question comes from Mike Zaremski of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski","First question on Group Benefits. Clearly, phenomenal results. Curious, Chris, in your prepared remarks, I believe you said you're kind of assuming more normalized incidence and recovery trends. So in the 2020 guidance, has HIG changed its incidence trend or recovery assumptions to kind of reflect an improved trend line? Or are you just kind of thinking last year was more of an anomaly?","Christopher Swift","I would say, Michael, that our assumptions and methodologies are generally consistent over the years. We haven't changed anything in how we think about setting reserves or pricing product, which generally uses, I call it, a mean average approach so that we're not using the most recent dot in an incidence report. We're taking more of a five year period of time. So there is a little bit of mean averaging going in there as far as our assumptions. So -- but it's been consistent between years.","Michael Zaremski","Okay. That's helpful. Lastly, and I need to delve more into it, but it looks like the catastrophe reinsurance program might be purchasing a little bit more reinsurance. And if that's correct, that could be behind the CAT load guidance coming in slightly below last year's guidance. Is that correct? And if so, is there -- should we be baking in any -- a higher underlying loss ratio from the increased spend?","Beth Costello","Yes. So a couple of things. And I would say, relatively speaking, our program is very consistent. We did purchase down in the aggregate treaty. And overall, when we look at the spend for the whole program and the various changes we made, it's really not a significant delta from the prior year. And as far as the CAT ratio guide at -- being in total kind of where we came at this year, that's not reflective of any changes in the reinsurance program. It's really just looking at underlying exposures and as we ran our models. And it's really, I think, only slightly down -- is down slightly from last year.","Michael Zaremski","And Beth, if I could sneak one last one in. Did you -- is there -- did you comment on the -- on PG&E, whether that refund, has that come through? And if it does, would that be used towards capital management?","Beth Costello","Yes. So I did not comment -- update our comments on PG&E. We continue to watch as that activity continues. We have not booked any recovery associated with the plans that are underway. We'll continue to watch what the final program is that comes out of bankruptcy. And yes, I mean overall, that -- any benefits that we receive, net of what we would have to reimburse our reinsurers for, would improve the capital position in P&C. But I wouldn't make a direct link to that to an increase in share repurchases. It will just go into the mix relative to capital resources.","Operator","And the last question today comes from Michael Phillips of Morgan Stanley.","Michael Phillips","One more, if I could, on the outlook on commercial and from the expense side. I guess there's a lot of moving parts obviously on your expense ratio. You've talked about higher commissions defending your Small Commercial. I don't know when that ends, if you could talk about that. Investments, the benefits of which could accrue at some point, you're still making investments. So talk about the expense ratio there. ","And then Doug mentioned some accruals or whatever that happened in this quarter that kind of bumped it up a bit, so I'm not sure the impact on that. But as we think about 2020 on the expense ratio side, kind of what's a good starting point? 34.5-ish looks like maybe for the year-end. Is that a bit high? And how do you expect that to move in 2020?","Christopher Swift","Yes. Michael, it's Chris. I would say, again, the context to the number that I'm going to give you is we've been on a program to invest in our platform, whether it be, call it, technology, whether it be digital, whether it be product and underwriting. We've been on a journey. And we've talked about sort of the elevation in our expense ratio primarily due to the invest side. ","I would say where we ended 2019 on a full year basis in that 32.5 to 33, Commercial and Personal Lines together, keep GB separate for the time being, is a good number for next year to maybe slightly down. I think we're coming to the point in that long-term program that we've put into place where the invest dollars are going to begin to slow down once we finish second half of 2020 heading into '21. I think we are a larger-scale organization or a growth-orientated firm that will continue to add premium, again, properly priced and good business. ","So all that would point to, particularly as we get out into '21 and beyond, I'll call it, a stairstep back to a normalized and competitive expense ratio over time. So -- but again, we've been deliberate about what we needed to do as an organization, we think, to create value and be competitive long term. And we're not backing away from that, but we're at the tail end of the program. That's what I would say, Doug and Beth.","Michael Phillips","Great. Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then I guess my last one, kind of more higher level. Chris, in your opening comments, you talked about the momentum in pricing. You were talking about the overall market, not just you guys, I believe you were. And I think you said you expect it to continue for 18 to 24 months from here. I guess -- hopefully, I heard you right. If that's the case, kind of what's behind that to you? That's a pretty long extension. And so what do you think is going to keep driving pricing up for the next two years?","Christopher Swift","Well, getting to ultimately target ratios that support an adequate return for the risk the industry is taking. I outlined low interest rates. That's going to be a little bit of a headwind. But if I look at product lines and where comp is headed, I mean -- and again, from managing the book of business, you never really want to shock your book of business and go to a 50% retention rate. So generally, what you try to do is be thoughtful on retentions but firm and disciplined and work through your distribution partners to talk through the actions that are going to be required in the near term and over a longer period of time. And I just think, given where we're starting from and given some of the pressure on social inflation and liability cost, commercial auto in general, it's going to take two years to get back to target margins.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

My name is Chris, and I\u2019ll be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Hartford second quarter 2015 financial results conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Sabra Purtill, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Sabra Purtill","Good morning and welcome, everyone, to the Hartford second quarter webcast. Our news release investor financial supplement second quarter financial results presentation and 10-Q were all released yesterday afternoon and are posted on our website. Our speakers today include Christopher Swift, Chairman and CEO of The Hartford, Douglas Elliot, President, and Beth Bombara, CFO. Following their prepared remarks, we will have about 30 minutes for Q&A.","Just a few notes before Chris begins. Today\u2019s call includes forward-looking statements as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results could be materially different. We do not assume any obligation to update forward looking statements and investors should consider the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from these statements. A detailed description of those risks and uncertainties can be found in our SEC filings, which are available on our website.","Our presentation today also includes several non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations and reconciliations of these measures to the comparable GAAP measure are included in our SEC filings as well as in the news release and financial supplement. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher Swift","Thank you, Sabra, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the call. Last night we reported strong financial and operational performance for the second quarter of 2015, completing a successful first half of the year. We continue to navigate in a dynamic market environment and reported improved results across all of our businesses. Core earnings per diluted share for the second quarter was $0.91, a significant increase compared with the prior year. P&C, Group Benefits, and Mutual Funds each delivered better operating margins in top line growth this quarter.","This quarter\u2019s strong performance contributed to a 12-month core earnings ROE of 9.6%. The quarter also included net favorable items compared with last year, including higher limited partnership income, lower CATs, a federal tax benefit, lower A&E reserved strengthening and a favorable litigation outcome. Even when adjusting for these items, underlying results were strong. Doug will provide more details on P&C and Group Benefits in a few minutes, but I\u2019d like to share with you a few highlights from the quarter.","In P&C, our combined ratio when adjusted for CATs in prior year development was 88.9, a 3.8 improvement over the second quarter of 2014. We are especially pleased to see improved underwriting results in both commercial and personal lines. In group benefits, the results reflect our focus on new business generation in disciplined underwriting. Sales increased 29% and after-tax core earnings margin increased to 6.3%.","We continue to successfully manage the runoff of Talcott with year-over-year declines in variable and fixed annuity contract accounts of 12% and 11% respectively since June 2014. In addition to strong earnings, we are also pleased to announce that our Board of Directors approved an increase in the company\u2019s capital management plan and extended it through December 2016. Beth will review the details in a few moments.","The plan reflects the successful strategic and financial transformation of the company including a sharpened focus on P&C, Group Benefits, and Mutual Funds businesses. Since the beginning of 2014, we have returned to shareholders more than $2.8 billion of capital. With the increase in this plan, we intend to return nearly 5.3 billion in share repurchases income and dividends over the three-year period ending 2016. Our primary focus going forward continues to be on the profitable expansion of P&C, Group Benefits, and Mutual Funds business where is we hold competitive market positions.","As you know, we have been investing aggressively in these businesses with the goal of improving operating capabilities. This effort includes a significant upgrade in technology such as our market leading small commercial icon system and the recent introduction of a new claims platform. And we have additional upgrades planned. As we consider management of excess capital in the future, we will prioritize opportunities that accelerate our premium growth and operating capabilities. In the event that we do not find opportunities that meet our strategic and financial objectives, we will continue to return excess capital to shareholders. Looking forward, I am confident that we have the right strategy, capabilities, and people required to successfully compete in a dynamic market environment.","The Hartford strategy is focused on four areas. First is product expansion. We continue to expand our products to meet a broader range of policyholder risk needs. We are also participating more deeply in targeted industries and extending our risk selection capabilities. The second is distribution effectiveness. We are actively expanding The Hartford\u2019s commercial line sales and underwriting presence in key geographies, particularly in the west and Midwest. This expansion, supported by enhanced marketing efforts and rigorous sales execution, is driving better outcomes. Third, we continue to improve the customer experience and the operating capabilities of our company through things like process efficiency improvements, technology upgrades, and digital access. And fourth, we continue to invest in talent. We are proud of our employees, and we are working diligently to attract, retain, and develop the best talent in the industry.","For example, we recently hired Mo Tooker as our Chief Underwriting Officer for the P&C businesses and added two new executives to compliment the Personal Lines team, Mary Boyd and Casey Campbell. Like the rest of you, we are closely watching developments across the industry including recent M&A activities. These activities certainly have repercussions on our markets.","While change brings risk, it also brings opportunity. We are prepared to address and benefit from opportunities that arise, particularly those that fit our primary focus of expanding products, increasing distribution effectiveness, improving the customer experience in our operating capabilities, and becoming a destination for great talent.","As I reflect on my first full-year as CEO, I am appreciative of the many contributions that our Hartford\u2019s employees make every day. What makes The Hartford special is our strong character. Throughout the past year, we have received numerous accolades for ethical conduct, risk management, governance, and diversity in inclusion practices, and those attributes are incredibly important us to.","In conclusion, we are well positioned to achieve continued success, and we remain focused and our goal of increasing ROE and book value per share to drive shareholder value creation.","Thank you. And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Doug.","Douglas Elliot","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Our Property and Casualty and Group Benefits businesses posted strong bottom line results for the second quarter. Favorable property experience for both catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses was a significant contributor to earnings. In other lines, our businesses produced solid margins consistent with recent quarters as loss trends remain benign. With the benefit of strong retention, we also delivered solid top line growth.","Favorable weather patterns were clearly the primary force behind our outstanding property results. While we have been increasing our property capabilities in recent years and I am confident that our improved acumen and risk selection and analytics is an important driver for our long-term success, we know that quarter to quarter results will be subject to the presence or absence of severe weather.","A well-balanced product mix that includes property is a competitive advantage with customers and agents, and we remain steady on our long-term strategic goals in this line of business. Competitive dynamics across all our businesses are largely unchanged from last quarter. As I commented then, adequately priced new business opportunities are more limited, and we remain disciplined in our risk selection approach.","We continue to find success in our local relationships with agents and brokers, and we have been investing in sales and underwriting professionals along with our product and technology capabilities to improve our market position. I\u2019ll provide some additional insights on this as I share the second quarter performance of our individual business units.","In Commercial Lines, core earnings was $264 million, with a combined ratio of 92.2%. This was an earnings increase of $51 million from second quarter 2014, largely driven by favorable property experience, margin improvement in workers\u2019 compensation, and higher net investment income. Renewal written pricing and standard commercial lines was 3% for the quarter, essentially flat with the first quarter of 2015 and down two points from second quarter last year. Pricing continues to be strongest in commercial auto where our profit improvement remains a focus.","Trends in workers\u2019 compensation pricing are generally in line with first quarter as we execute a very disciplined strategy to retain our best performing business at margins that meet or exceed our return targets. Catastrophe losses for second quarter 2015 were slightly higher than a year ago, but below our expectations.","In small Commercial, written premium grew 4% in the quarter driven mainly by strong policy retention as the new business growth rate has slowed somewhat in recent quarters due to competitive forces. The underlying combined ratio excluding catastrophes and prior year development was an outstanding 85.1%. The decrease of 2 1\/2 points versus a year ago is the result of lower non-cap property losses and improved workers\u2019 compensation margins. We\u2019re very pleased with our sustained performance in this business. Our strong written premium growth rate and profit margins have been very resilient as our underwriting and pricing analytics have helped to guide our book up business management actions.","In mail market, we posted a strong quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 89.3%, improving 8.3 points versus second quarter 2014. Much like in small Commercial the improvement is coming primarily from excellent non-cap property experience with contribution from margin improvement and workers\u2019 compensation.","A large portion of the favorable property result came from our marine business where we had an excellent second quarter. Written premium growth was 8% driven by strong retention in workers\u2019 compensation and increased new business in both construction and marine. We\u2019re pleased with recent success in these industry targeted businesses as they are a strategic focus for us. This is a positive indication of the traction we\u2019re gaining in the market as a result of talent and product investments made over the last several years.","Since earlier this year we have been adding underwriters in regions where we believe we can cultivate agency partnerships and compete effectively for new business. This is a longer term strategy for growth, and it will take time to build momentum in these local markets. However, we believe it is the right time to be investing in talent, to put our improved product and technology platform to even greater use in the market, and develop new books of profitable business.","In specialty Commercial the underlying combined ratio was 98.8% versus 101.5% in the prior year. The three main businesses comprising specialty commercial are all operating within our target return range. We posted solid top line growth of 4%, while margin improvement was driven by improved loss experience in financial products and a mixed shift in our results toward bond with a smaller capped business.","In personal lines, core earnings was $42 million for the quarter versus last year\u2019s $27 million loss. Much of this improvement is due to favorable catastrophes which are down this year by $64 million pre-tax. In addition, we had significant improvement in our non-catastrophe homeowner losses versus last year when we experienced elevated homeowner fire losses. Comparatively, fire loss this is year were at their lowest level in the last five years, and $11 million of the improvement in core earnings was due to a favorable resolution of outstanding litigation. The underlying combined ratio of 89.1% improved two points from last year, largely driven by the homeowner results I just described, partially offset by a slight uptick in auto liability severity. In addition, we\u2019ve been closely monitoring increased auto physical damage severity, having begun to see adverse trends several quarters ago.","Industry trends in early 2015 also appeared to be somewhat elevated. We have identified several opportunities for improvement to our physical damage claim practices and have taken action. Our early observations from these initiatives indicate that we\u2019re driving improved outcomes, particularly in areas such as subrogation and total loss management. Total written premium for the quarter grew 1%, including 1% growth in ARP direct and 14% growth in ARP agency. We continue to be encouraged by the growth and solid margins of our AARP business. On the direct side, new business increased by 4%.","In other agency, written premium was down 9% versus second quarter 2014. We\u2019re aligning ourselves with highly partnered agents who seek to deliver competitive yet value-based products and services to their customers. As we move in this direction, there\u2019ll be some agents and customers that do not match our profile and may seek other options.","Shifting over to Group Benefits, core earnings in the second quarter was 56 million, up 8% over prior year, achieving a core earnings margin of 6.3%. The increase is primarily attributable to top line growth and a lower expense ratio compared to prior year. Earn premiums excluding association, financial institutions was up 5% in the quarter, driven by growth in our employer group life and disability lines.","For the quarter, fully insured ongoing sales of 58 million, up 13 million from prior year, as we continue to have success marketing our differentiated service offering. In addition, our employer group business continues to maintain strong book persistency around 90% on an annualized basis. The overall loss ratio was essentially flat to prior year.","Improvement in the Group disability loss ratio was largely offset by less favorable mortality in group life, which looks to be a function of normal volatility in the line. This is another excellent quarter for Group Benefits. Markets remain competitive and we\u2019re performing well in all assets of our business. We are well positioned with strong book persistency and improved capabilities, allowing us to compete for new accounts. And we\u2019re executing on plan initiatives for our voluntary platform, further enhancing our value proposition.","With that, let me conclude my comments by reiterating that we had a strong second quarter. We enjoy favorable results from catastrophe and non-catastrophe property losses, and the performance of other lines of business remain strong. Across our Property and Casualty and Group Benefit businesses, we have strengthened our products, technology, and talent. Over the last six months we have attracted a number of experienced industry leaders to our team who will help drive our near-term execution and our long-term strategic objectives. We are confident that the business platform we\u2019ve been building in recent years will serve us well as we balance growth and profitability for the long term.","Let me now turn the call over to Beth.","Beth Bombara","Thank you, Doug. I\u2019m going to briefly cover results for the other segments and investments, and will then review our updated capital management plan. In addition to Commercial and personal lines, P&C includes the P&C other operation segment, which has a block of runoff liabilities, including asbestos and environmental. Core losses in this segment were 113 million in the quarter, down from losses of 146 million in the second quarter of 2014, due to lower reserve strengthening on our A&E reserves.","As many of you know, we complete the annual ground-up A&E reserve study in the second quarter. As a result of this year\u2019s study on a pre-tax basis, we strengthened our net reserves by 146 million for asbestos and by 52 million for environmental or a total of 198 million. This is down from 2014 when we had net reserve strengthening of 239 million, comprised of 212 million for asbestos and 27 million for environmental.","The asbestos reserve strengthening reflects lower than projected improvement in new mesothelioma claims for a handful of our peripheral accounts, less than 20 out of more than 1,100. The remainder of the accounts are trending in line with the assumptions used to set our reserves. The environmental reserve strengthening was driven by higher new claim severity, including at a handful of super-fund sites but frequency has declined.","We are often asked why we haven\u2019t done an A&E reinsurance deal. We evaluate options for A&E periodically, but to date these deals have not been cost effective, taking into account many factors, including the value we add by continuing to manage these claims ourselves, the price charged by potential reinsurers, the lack of a full assumption reinsurance or sale option, and the potential loss of investment income. Last year investment income in the P&C other segment totaled 129 million before tax.","Notwithstanding another year of adverse development on the A&E book, we believe that we can create a better outcome for shareholders if we continue to manage this book ourselves. We will, of course, continue to consider alternatives for these exposures as options and costs could change.","Turning to the financial results of our other segments, Mutual Funds core earnings rose 5% in the second quarter, primarily due to higher fee income on increased average assets under management, excluding Talcott variable annuity funds. As expected, Talcott-related AUM continue to run off, which reduced the segment\u2019s total AUM over the past year.","Fund performance remains solid this quarter, with 69% of funds outperforming peers over the last five years, helping to improve net flows to a positive 250 million in the quarter. For the first half of 2015, net positive flows totaled 779 million, the strongest net flow performance since 2010.","Talcott posted very strong core earnings of 171 million this quarter, well above our expectations because of a 48 million federal tax benefit and higher investment income, largely from very good returns on limited partnerships. Driven by private equity and real estate funds, limited partnership returns have been very strong this year, running at more than double the rate we used in our February outlook.","Talcott\u2019s annuity contract counts continue to decline. Our ISB program added slightly to the fixed annuity runoff, while variable annuity runoff was a more normal level since we did not have a surrender focused contract holder initiative this quarter. We continue to evaluate contract holder initiatives and other programs that can help decelerate the decline in these books of business. In July, Talcott paid the second 500 million dividend of the year, bringing the total to 1 billion. We expect another 500 million in early 2016.","Corporate segment second quarter 2015 core losses declined compared with the prior year and with the first quarter largely due to lower interest expense as a result of debt repayments. We expect interest expense to decrease in the second half, due to the second quarter bond call and the fourth quarter 167 million debt maturity. For the full-year, interest expense excluding the impact of any debt tenders or repurchases is expected to be about 357 million, down 5% from 2014.","Turning to investments, the credit performance of our portfolio remains strong with a modest 11 million of impairments during the quarter. Our annualized portfolio yield excluding limited partnerships was 4.1%, and continues to hold up reasonably well despite the headwinds from low interest rates. New money yields remain low, although within the range we expected for the year, which will continue to put downward pressure on investment income and yields as higher yielding investments mature and are reinvested at lower returns.","Helping offset this somewhat, similar to the first quarter, we had higher levels of income from fixed income make whole premiums and other non-routine items, and also from limited partnerships whose annualized yield was about 13% in the quarter.","To wrap up on our results, we had a strong quarter with consolidated core earnings per diluted share up significantly and a 12-month roll-in core earnings ROE of 9.6%, both reflecting lower caps, strong limited partnership income, a few favorable tax and other items, partially offset by unfavorable prior year development.","Excluding net unfavorable items from both periods, core earnings per diluted share was up 66% over second quarter 2014. In addition, book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, also rose up 4% from year end 2014 and 8% from June 30th, 2014. Reflecting net growth in shareholders equity excluding AOCI and the accretive impact of the equity repurchase program. Outstanding and diluted shares have decreased by 9% since June 30, 2014 as a result of the equity repurchase program.","Before turning to Q&A, I\u2019d like to wrap up by reviewing our capital management plan. As announced last night, the equity repurchase authorization was increased by 1.6 billion and extended through year end 2016. This provides us a slightly more than 2 billion of equity repurchase authorization for the balance of 2015 and 2016. We currently expect to use this amount ratably over the period subject to market conditions and other factors. Yesterday\u2019s increase brings the total equity repurchase authorization to nearly 4.4 billion for 2014 through 2016.","Debt reduction remains part of our capital management plan, as we strive to reduce our rating agency adjusted debt to total capital ratio to the low 20\u2019s, over time. Yesterday, we announced that we intend to repay the 2016 debt maturity of 275 million. As previously stated, we intend to repay the 167 million issue that matures in November of this year. In addition, we have 180 million remaining under the current debt management plan, which was extended through December 31, 2016. When and how we will utilize that portion will depend on various factors, including market conditions.","The increase in the capital management plan will be funded by current holding company funds, as well as future dividends from the operating subsidiaries and other sources. During July, we have received about 900 million in dividends for the holding company, including 500 million funded by Talcott. For the remainder of the year, we expect approximately 300 million in dividends from subsidiaries for a total of about 1.9 billion for the year, unchanged from our February projections. In 2016, our current outlook is for about 1.9 billion of subsidiary dividends and other cash flows to the holding company, including 800 million in dividends from the P&C companies.","Finally, recognizing the strong improvement in our P&C group benefits and Mutual Funds earnings, the board authorized a 17% increase in the quarterly common dividend to $0.21 a share, effective with the October dividend payment. Including the impact of share repurchases, we expect to pay dividends of about 330 million over the next 12 months, or about 30% of trailing 12-months consolidated net income, excluding Talcott. Combined with our equity repurchase plan, we are clearly delivering a substantial amount of excess capital back to shareholders.","As Chris discussed, with our strategic and financial transformation largely complete, our priority for excess capital utilization going forward is to find opportunities to invest in our businesses, helping to drive premium and earnings growth and expand our capabilities. We will continue to evaluate capital management options as it remains a good tool that we can use to return excess capital to shareholders in the event that we do not find opportunities that meet our overall objectives.","I will call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you, Beth. Before beginning the Q&A session, I would like to remind you all that consistent with past practice and company policy, we do not comment on market rumors or speculation. We appreciate your keeping that in mind so the Q&A session can be productive for everyone on the call. Chris, could you please repeat the Q&A instructions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","I certainly can. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Michael Nannizzi","Thank you. Beth, just wanted to sort of go back just a comment that you made there. So for 2016 you said the current outlook is 1.9 billion in dividends including 800 million from the sub. So am I missing something? Where is the other 1.8 billion coming from?","Beth Bombara","Sure, Mike. So, as you recall, I mentioned that we do anticipate getting $500 million of dividends from Talcott in early 2016.","Michael Nannizzi","Yup.","Beth Bombara","So that would be included. And we also expect dividends from Group Benefits and Mutual Funds. And similar to this past year, we would expect to have favorable tax receipts at the holding company as well. And all of that comprises the 1.9 billion that I mentioned.","Michael Nannizzi","Got it. That\u2019s great. Thanks for that. And then maybe for Doug, can you break out-- is it possible to break out the margin improvement that we saw in both small commercial and Middle Markets. It can from either the favorable [indiscernible] weather or underlying margin improvement related to comp?","Douglas Elliot","Mike, let me try to give you a little bit of color. You\u2019re right. It was a very good Property quarter and workers\u2019 comp too. It was about four points in Middle Market and a little bit less than that in small commercial and just in terms of the margin improvement in that line of business.","Michael Nannizzi","Okay, so those points you mentioned are related to the property and the remainder would then be related to workers\u2019 comp?","Douglas Elliot","Those are the two line drivers, yes.","Michael Nannizzi","Okay. Okay. And then in homeowners, would it be possible to quantify the - or just give us some marker around the impact of the favorable fire losses on the underlying?","Douglas Elliot","I can do that. You obviously get the CAT numbers and you can see that the CATs are down Q to Q seven points from last year. The fire losses, as I mentioned, were down to the lowest level in the last five years. I think we\u2019re about five to seven points less than the higher years during that five year period. So I would use as a gauge inside our non-CAT property element.","Michael Nannizzi","Okay, got it. Great. And then the last question, I guess, on the other agency business, obviously premiums there is have declined. I\u2019m guessing that that\u2019s because of maybe not acceptable levels of profitability. Can you talk a little bit about kind of what\u2019s happening there in terms of your profitability? And what actions you are taking and seems like the prudent thing to do, but just to get an idea where that is relative to your AARP business, for example. Thanks.","Douglas Elliot","Sure. Mike, a few things, one is, and we\u2019re working all angles of this. We\u2019re working on tuning our open road product which is our new auto class plan, so those tuning requirements continue throughout the country.","We are investing and working hard on our homeowner\u2019s product, probably a little bit more going forward than over the last three to four years. We think Homeowners is an important line relative to our personalized strategy, so a lot of work going on in homeowners.","Clearly challenged in the agency space thinking about how we compete and looking for partners that are willing to work with us, work on a value prop play. We have been tuning that segment and will continue to tune. We do feel good about progress. Very pleased with our overall return efforts, but also want to see if we can get the top line moving in a little bit more positive direction.","Michael Nannizzi","Great. Thanks so much.","Douglas Elliot","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from John Nadel with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","John Nadel","Hi. Good morning everybody. Doug, maybe just a quick follow-up. I understand the following up on Mike\u2019s question about the favorable weather and the impact that that had. Can you just sort of characterize that for the commercial segment overall as well as for the personal line segment overall? Significant accident year-loss ratio improvement, but just wondering what you think the actual underlying sustainable level of improvement really is. Recognizing, you know, each quarter can be somewhat volatile.","Douglas Elliot","Yeah, John, the underlying in small, again, really across all our commercial businesses on property was probably several points less than sustainable. That doesn\u2019t mean that we haven\u2019t seen improvement, but I would say two to three points.","When I look at our spectrum product in small commercial, a couple of points under where we have been the last second quarters of prior years, and really the key property business has performed pretty consistently the last couple of years. So at consistent levels but at solid levels. I like our loss performance, I think both [indiscernible] and CAT are in very good shape, but probably a couple of points better than a run rate perspective.","John Nadel","Got it. Okay. That is really helpful, thanks. And then maybe a question for you, Chris. I appreciate certainly the improvement that we have seen in the underlying fundamentals, the improvement in the balance sheet, etc., and the commentary about seeking opportunities to accelerate growth. I\u2019m curious because it still appears that there\u2019s a reasonable amount of financial flexibility and conservatism in your updated capital outlook. And so the question for you is this, do you think really buybacks versus potential acquisitions to accelerate growth have to be a mutually exclusive concept, or do you believe you have the capacity to pursue both?","Christopher Swift","John, thanks for the question. I wouldn\u2019t exclude one or the other at this point. I think you have seen our history and track record, particularly working to improve our financial position and deliver the firm, and obviously reward shareholders with accretive capital management. So the way we think about is we announced a plan through 2016. That is our intention. It is our highest and best use of excess capital, but I think what we were trying to signal is a little bit of an inflection point because we feel we\u2019re in a different place. We\u2019re in a different company today. And we can be a little bit more offensive minded about opportunities in the marketplace.","John Nadel","Totally appreciate that. And I guess just a quick follow-up along those lines, Chris. Any specific areas within P&C or even on the Group insurance side that you feel like are areas where you want to expand, where you want to be able to find that faster pace of growth, where you maybe lack some scale today?","Christopher Swift","John, I think we think about opportunities across all our businesses. I mean, you mentioned a couple, but in Commercial, you really think about two main themes. If you\u2019ve heard Doug and I and Beth continually talking about adding product and underwriting capabilities to the platform, being a deeper and broader risk player. That\u2019s really what we mean in growing our future capabilities and industry verticals. So we think of specialty in that area. We think, in terms of larger parts of the U.S. economy, maybe we haven\u2019t participated as deeply as I think we can or should.","John Nadel","Okay.","Christopher Swift","You referenced and you heard Doug talk about marine construction, real estate, infrastructure related. Those are the types of things we talk about as far as the real economy and expanding. And along with our geographic penetration and focus. So, anything along those lines, in Commercial, would be very intriguing to us.","And you mentioned Group Benefits. If I really look at our platform, I would say we gear it more towards a national or large account platform. Very balanced LTD, STD and Life business. About 50% of premiums in each of those categories. So, if there were opportunities in the small and medium case segments, and folks that potentially could accelerate the pace of our voluntary sales growth, those are the things we would think about there.","John Nadel","Okay.","Christopher Swift","And then, lastly, in Personal Lines. Look, we don\u2019t aspire to be a broad market player, but we think we have unique skills and capabilities in direct marketing, in sort of those niche areas. And we think in those terms, John, if there were opportunities to use our brand and direct marketing skills in our wonderful claim skills. So that\u2019s just to give you a little bit more of a flavor.","John Nadel","I really appreciate the color. Thanks very much, Chris.","Christopher Swift","John, just a last point there. I think in all of this and, hopefully, you of all people know, and others, is that we continue to be very thoughtful. I would say disciplined and deliberate in this area. Just knowing where we\u2019re coming from and how we want to use shareholders\u2019 capital in the most prudent fashion, going forward. But we did signal a change this quarter.","John Nadel","Yeah, no question, Chris. I have a lot of confidence. So, thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Meyer Shields of KBW. Your line is open.","Meyer Shields","Thanks. Good morning. Two quick questions I think for Doug. One, within the overall 3% standard commercial rate increases, is there a difference between the property and liability lines?","Douglas Elliot","Meyer, all the lines do have their own nuances to them. As I mentioned, Auto is right now achieving more rate across Commercial than other lines. So that\u2019s the lead line. Workers\u2019 compensation has been a bit more under pressure over the last couple of quarters. And even between small and middle, there are nuances. So, yes, very different dynamics across the lines. But, in general, pleased we still see rational competition. Maybe a bit more pressure, but I am very pleased about what we put up this second quarter, and feel good about our efforts first half of the year.","Meyer Shields","Okay. And can you talk a little bit about the adverse developments in Commercial, besides the asbestos environmental, in terms of what was going on there?","Beth Bombara","I will take that. This is Beth. We had very modest adverse development, excluding A&E. We had some favorable development in our workers\u2019 comp lines, which is offset a little bit by unfavorable development as it relates to the discount on workers\u2019 comp reserve, which reflects the fact that as we\u2019ve been settling claims at a faster pace, the amount of actual discount that you have in the reserve changes. And then, the other aspects were really just small puts and takes across the various lines. Really nothing that is worthy of calling out.","Meyer Shields","Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open.","Brian Meredith","Yeah, good morning, Chris. I\u2019m just wondering, can you talk a little more about, when you are evaluating financial acquisitions, kind of the financial benchmarks that you are going to be looking at? Be it, IRR\u2019s, return invested capital, how it relates to share buyback and those types of things? Tangible book value, dilution.","Christopher Swift","Brian, yeah, happy to. I think, a couple points. One, first, any acquisition opportunity first needs to be strategic and financially compelling to make sense. I think, second, we also think about it when we talk internally of the comparison to building organically, because largely what we have been doing is an organic focus. So an acquisition needs to be weighed generally in terms with an organic build. And those organic builds require an investment, requires timelines, obviously patience because it won\u2019t happen overnight. So, you sort of weigh all that to sort of see would an acquisition opportunity really accelerate our growth and make sense.","I think also, too, really since our transformation, we really driven down our cost of equity capital, reduced our leverage, improved our valuation. So, I think today we have greater flexibility to think about acquisitions. And, ultimately, we view it as a ROI or IOR type of analysis where it needs to add value over a longer period of time and exceed our cost of equity capital today or else we won\u2019t do it.","And I think from there then the historical metrics of EPS and book value per share will emerge in the accounting records that I think then will create value over a longer period of time for shareholders. So, as I said to John, we continue to be very thoughtful, disciplined, and deliberate in this area. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking.","Brian Meredith","And do you relate it all to share buyback and thoughts on return, share buyback versus M&A, organic growth?","Christopher Swift","It\u2019s part of the overall equation, but, again, from a strategic side when we\u2019re trying to grow our capabilities and grow our earnings, that also needs to be weighed in because by itself, share buybacks don\u2019t increase the nominal dollars of earnings going forward. So, but we do weigh that all very carefully, Brian.","Brian Meredith","Great. Thanks. And then just one quick follow-up for Doug. The investment spend that you\u2019ve been doing the last couple of years, system build-out (audio breaks up), those types of things, where do we stand in that kind of process as far as expenses, and how much longer do you think it\u2019s going to be a drag on the expense ratio?","Douglas Elliot","Brian, when I think about our invest, I think about it over a longer period of time. So, I don\u2019t think about it in spurts of quarters. This is a long-term process. I know we shared quite a bit of that progress in Charlotte with the investor day in June. We\u2019ve got some of those invests going on in Middle. Yes, a little bit of pressure on the expense ratio, but I look back at where we are in kind of our quarterly expense and our annual expense targets, and I think about what\u2019s happening through the bottom line in our margins. I\u2019m comfortable with those invests, and actually see them over a longer period of time than I do over just 2015 or 2016.","Brian Meredith","Great. Thank you.","Christopher Swift","Brian, it\u2019s Chris. I think just another thing you need to think in terms of is, and I\u2019m not sure where the industry stands in totality. All I can speak from is our company, but we really do need to modernize our tools, capabilities, infrastructure, digital content, and as Doug said, this isn\u2019t a simple one and done over the next 12 to 18 months here. This is a commitment to fundamentally improve our customer facing, exchanges, interfaces, for the long term. So we\u2019re going to be disciplined about expense management, but on the invest side we\u2019re over clubbing to really improve our capabilities in this area. So, I think we are balancing the best way we can in this dynamics, but make no mistake about it, we\u2019re committed to fundamentally improving our infrastructure and capabilities to improve our customer experiences.","Brian Meredith","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Erik Bass of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Erik Bass","Hi. Thank you. In Group Benefits you continue to have nice growth momentum. So, I was just hoping you could talk a little bit more about the competitive dynamics in the market and how much of your growth is coming from new products and your expanded voluntary product set.","Douglas Elliot","Erik, hi, this is Doug. A couple of thoughts about it. Really we had a terrific start to 2015, so we\u2019re encouraged about that progress and really feel like we have priced our way through the challenges of two or three years ago, so that is in the rear-view mirror. As I look ahead, there are strong competitors around us, but I feel good about our ability to earn our way into the finals, and we\u2019ve won our share. Inside our new sales, there\u2019s a positive story both on new customer, but there also is a positive story on growing inside our current customers with at issue sales in addition to where we were last year with that current customer.","So that\u2019s point number two. And then lastly, voluntary has been an important part of our strategic grow these last couple of years, particularly just getting the product ready to meet the street. I think we feel good that we were able to work those 11-15 and now into 15 with the accounts with our abilities in the voluntary area. It is slow, it\u2019s probably a little slower than Chris and I thought it might be. As we finish the year, our sales probably in the voluntary area will be just in the GAAP product area probably under 10 million for the year, but what\u2019s important is that we\u2019re able to be at the table with customers that demand that as part of their suite. And I think we\u2019re there today, and a couple of years ago I was not able to say that.","Erik Bass","Thank you. And then just a quick one for Beth. You mentioned that you still expect to pay a 500 million dividend from Talcott in early 2016, which I believe in the past you\u2019ve said doesn\u2019t include 2015 statutory earnings. So, given the pretty strong results you\u2019ve seen in Talcott so far in 2015, is there a potential to take either an upsized dividend or an additional dividend from Talcott in 2016?","Beth Bombara","Yes, so that is correct. I have only included the 500 million that we\u2019ve previously talked about. As it relates to 2015, I think what we\u2019ve always said is we want to see how 2015 year actually ends. Through six months in June, Talcott first rate [ph] surplus is actually relatively flat once you adjust for dividends, and so what we really need to see is where we end the year.","Right now we would anticipate that we would generate statutory surplus still in that 200 to 300 range, but as we said previously, kind of at the lower end of that range. But it really is going to be a function of just where interest rates land at the end of the year and how that potentially impacts reserves that we have to set. So until we end the year, we\u2019ll evaluate where the statutory surplus is and there could then be potential, but we\u2019re not putting that into our projections at this point.","Erik Bass","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Tom Gallagher of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning. Chris, just to start out, I just want to get a sense for the way you\u2019re thinking about potential M&A. Would you contemplate transformative M&A, or are we talking about more modest opportunities as ways of deploying excess capital?","Christopher Swift","Tom, thanks. I would say I think our current thinking right now is more modest, adding to capabilities and product lines.","And I made a point to be clear, we\u2019re a U.S.-focused company and organization right now. So, I assume if you were talking about transformative, you were thinking maybe beyond our borders, but our intent is I think we have opportunities to capture more market share with expanded products and capabilities in our U.S. territories. But also be sensitive to maybe following U.S. customers abroad with some of their skills. But we don\u2019t think about building international local market expansion currently.","Tom Gallagher","Okay. That is helpful. And then I just want to be clear here that the current buyback authorization, is that going to be competing with M&A when you contemplate what you\u2019ve announced so far? So in other words if you found attractive deals that could consume some of the buybacks or do you have additional resources or excess capital that\u2019s actually slotted for M&A?","Christopher Swift","Tom, it\u2019s a balancing act. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s competing. That\u2019s our plan, that is our intention, that\u2019s what we think is the highest and best use. And if there\u2019s alternatives that come along, we\u2019ll put that as far as the overall equation. But I think you know myself and Beth, we are appropriately prudent in managing the balance sheet and always have flexibility in mind.","Tom Gallagher","Okay. And I guess either Chris or Beth, just to be clear, though, your current capital plan doesn\u2019t necessarily allocate some additional capital buffer for M&A, or am I - can you comment on that at all whether there\u2019s something in that plan through 2016 that is allocating something that you\u2019re now holding on to for M&A or anyway can you comment on that?","Christopher Swift","Yeah, Tom, and Beth can add her point of view. Again, how we think about it and maybe others have talked about it, too, is we said the deal needs to be strategic and make financial sense. And if we find something that from an acquisition side hits those hurdles and makes our ROI\u2019s work, we\u2019ll figure out how to finance it. And so I said earlier, we\u2019ve reduced our leverage and will continue to reduce it, but we do have flexibility to figure out how we would, I\u2019ll call it fund or finance a deal, if we found the right one. So that\u2019s all I would say at this point.","Tom Gallagher","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Randy Binner","Thanks. You all discussed the A&E resolution market a little bit in your comments. Do you have any update on the annuity risk transfer market? From our perspective, it seems active. And so would be interested in any update you have on that market or should we think of Talcott as continuing to be internally managed resolution?","Christopher Swift","Randy, it\u2019s Chris. Beth can add her point of view also, but I think right now we\u2019re very pleased sort of with the runoff in total of Talcott. And particularly the capital that we\u2019ve taken out. I remind you we\u2019ve take a billion out this year and we plan as Beth said to take 500 million out in early 2016.","So we understand the risk. It\u2019s well managed. It\u2019s well contained from our perspective. And as Beth might comment upon, we do really believe in this low interest rate environment. That does depress valuation. So these are all the things that we consider in sort of a transact versus a continued runoff mode. But Beth, what would you add?","Beth Bombara","Yeah, I think, Chris, as always, I think you\u2019ve captured it very well.","Christopher Swift","Yeah.","Beth Bombara","I think it\u2019s very consistent with what we\u2019ve talked about in the past. And we are always open to the consideration of transactions, but at the end of the day, needs to make economic sense for us and where we sit today with the capital that we\u2019re able to extract. And as Chris said, to manage the risk in that book, we feel very comfortable. But of course, we\u2019ll always be open to other considerations as markets change.","Randy Binner","Great. And then the follow-up there is just on the withdrawals, which in the kind of the 12%, 11% year-over-year basis is good. And I think that\u2019s kind of as some of your programs that increase surrenders are winding down. Do you have any plans to kind of continue to push new programs there to continue to accelerate the wind down of those liabilities?","Beth Bombara","Yes, as we\u2019ve said in the past, we\u2019ll always consider other policyholder type initiatives that could further reduce the exposure and that book of business. We\u2019ve been very pleased with those that we\u2019ve had in the past. As I\u2019ve said pretty consistently is our thought process is to really be very targeted as we look at those initiatives. So we don\u2019t have one right now in place. There is a team that consistently evaluates those to see if there\u2019s something that could be done. But overall when we look at the continued reduction in the contract counts, we feel very good with the activity we\u2019re seeing.","Randy Binner","And those have been well received, those plans by agents and clients? There\u2019s been no real push back, is right?","Beth Bombara","Yeah, I mean, I think the results speak for themselves and what we\u2019ve been able to achieve with those programs. Again, we\u2019ve always said they\u2019re not right for everyone, and that\u2019s why policyholders have a choice. But as we said, we\u2019ve been pleased with the results that we\u2019ve been able to achieve on both the programs we\u2019ve had in the variable annuity and the fixed annuity space.","Randy Binner","All right. Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","The next question is from Scott Frost with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Scott Frost","Okay, thank you. From the debt side, appreciate the clarity in communicating your debt management goals. Thank you for that. But wanted to talk briefly about your junior sub issues as you may have expected. It\u2019s topical in our world. First, with respect to the 8 and 8\u2019s and then to the Glenn Meadows, how would you characterize the efficiency of each of these instruments in your capital stack? And I have a brief follow-up.","Beth Bombara","Okay. Thanks for the question. So again, as we\u2019ve been talking about in the past, we are focused on reducing our overall rating agency adjusted debt to capitalization ratios, also focused on things like coverage rates and so forth. And so we really look at our capital, our debt structure sort of across the spectrum. And today as we sit here, I think that the eight teams do provide us benefit in that we do get equity credit as we look at managing that ratio. And overtime we\u2019ll continue to evaluate the debt stack, keeping all those factors in mind, but no change in our views as to how we think about those.","Scott Frost","Okay. And just specifically for the Glenn Meadows, is it your understanding that this issue will continue to receive favorable capital treatment from NRS or Rose at the float date in 2017?","Beth Bombara","Yes, we do not expect any change in how those would be considered.","Scott Frost","Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from Jamminder Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jamminder Bhullar","Thanks. Hi, Good morning. Most of my questions were answered, but I had one for Doug. Overall I thought the results were pretty strong, but you did have weak premium growth in the non-AARP agency channels. Just wondering what is driving that and what are you doing to turn that around? What your expectations are for that channel?","Douglas Elliot","So that part of the challenge in our personal lines area is not new to the quarter. So we have had pressure in there. We see lots of competition. There are lots of names that continue to compete in that space. I\u2019m very encouraged. I like where our team is headed. You know we have made a couple of very important additions in the last ninety day, so I feel good about that, and I think we will be talking more about strategy through the next couple of quarters, particularly in that personal lines area.","Operator","The next question is from Bob Glasspiegel with Janney. Your line is open.","Bob Glasspiegel","Good morning, Hartford. It seems like there is a lot of deals going on right now in the marketplace, and I have never seen the Property Casualty world undergo more changes than we\u2019re seeing today, and the glass half full is just going to create opportunities and as there this is eruption in competitors. The glass half empty perspective would be maybe you need to rethink where you are as far as scale, tax structure, technology, efficiency, etc. Where do you see Hartford in this world, and I am sure you\u2019re going to take the glass half full preference, but maybe respond to the negative issues that some might suggest are popping up?","Christopher Swift","Bob, it\u2019s Chris. I think you outline some good points. We think about it generally as we are entering a very dynamic cycle, and that really every company, including our own, needs to think about competitive advantages. There is really a couple of drivers that we see.","One, not all the industry participants have really enjoyed the price increases that we and others have had over the last three years, and pushed so hard to maintain. Generally, lower economic growth and continued low interest rates is really has a compounding effect on companies balance sheets and ability to investment in new technology and capabilities while producing good financial results.","Alternative capital is just obviously disrupting some of the reinsurance base and it\u2019s got the potential to creep into other aspects of the market. And then very important for I think for all of us is that distribution in our agents and broker partners are really going through their own form of industry consolidations, which ultimately means in my judgment that fewer carriers are going to be on panels. And brokers and agent will continue to look for those companies that have the most to offer for their clients.","So I think the table stakes are higher to sort of meet the requirements of today. Ultimately as a national company, Bob, with a lot of great strengths, brand reputation, capabilities, new energy and vigor around it. I\u2019m very optimistic of our ability to continue to compete and have competitive advantage to drive shareholder value going forward.","So it\u2019s probably not any one of those things. It\u2019s probably all of it that we\u2019re trying to-- I\u2019ll call it manage for outcomes that we think are best for our shareholders and ultimately our employees and customers.","Bob Glasspiegel","That\u2019s a very fair answer. Is the pivot to M&A recognition that scale is going to be increasingly important and you need more volume to do the technology spend that you are signaling is necessary?","Christopher Swift","Yeah, I would say in and by itself, scale is not a driver. If you really look at our words and really what we\u2019ve talked about here is adding new capabilities that we don\u2019t have today or areas of the market-- the risk taking market. We\u2019d like to participate more in. I\u2019m sorry, I think that is more of an immediate focus, but you make a good point. Scale helps out, too. Obviously from an expense and efficiency side. And if you look at, at least one big deal that happened in New Jersey not too long ago. I mean, and we really think it in terms of it will over a longer period of time be a very compelling transaction that drives down unit costs, has greater tax efficiency, has a greater capital base to potentially take on risk. So those are all the things that we\u2019re very well off.. But we also know what we\u2019re focused on and particularly our segments of the market that we think we have great competitive advantage in.","Bob Glasspiegel","Fair answers. Thank you.","Beth Bombara","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you, Chris. I\u2019d like to thank you all for joining us today and for your interest in The Hartford.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.","The Hartford is off to a very good start in 2017. Core earnings per diluted share increased 5% in the first quarter, and we returned over $400 million to shareholders through repurchases and common dividends. Underlying P&C results were strong. However, catastrophe losses were exceptionally high due to elevated seasonal wind and hail activity in the central U.S.","Starting with personal auto. The pricing, underwriting and distribution actions we have implemented over the past 18 months, are gaining traction. The underlying combined ratio improved over 5 points when adjusting first quarter 2016 loss ratios for the average development we recognized during calendar year 2016. Renewal written price increases have been in the high single digit rates over the past several quarters and exceeded 10% this quarter, while our accident year loss ratio picks for 2015 and 2016 are holding.","While the top-line is down, our AARP relationship is a competitive advantage for The Hartford, and our deep knowledge of this customer segment positions us well for growth in personal auto as margins continue to improve.","All-in, I am pleased with the progress and remain confident that we will achieve improved results in 2017 and continuing into 2018.","Commercial Lines achieved the 90.9 underlying combined ratio, reflecting disciplined underwriting in a competitive market. Small commercial posted outstanding performance with 6% written premium growth and excellent margins but competition remains robust. We\u2019re intently focused on advancing our leadership in this market by innovating and enhancing our best-in-class capabilities. We\u2019re doing this by leveraging our technology, data and underwriting expertise, deep agency relationships and leading customer service centers.","Middle Market delivered good performance with 4% growth in written premiums and a 93.8 underlying combined ratio. In this challenging middle market environment, we remain committed to disciplined risk selection. The overall Commercial Lines results reflect the investments we\u2019ve made over the past several years, which have enabled us to become a substantially broader and deeper risk player with expanded product capabilities and new industry verticals.","In addition, our acquisition of Maxum is already contributing as our new E&S capabilities have given us the opportunity to participate in the wholesale marketplace. Group Benefits delivered excellent core earnings this year, excluding a charge for the previously disclosed Penn Treaty liquidation. Top-line growth picked up to 4% and loss experience continues to be excellent, reflecting our claims expertise and the improvements we\u2019ve made in our book of business over the years. Group Benefits is a core strategic business for The Hartford with a well established brand and a top five market position. The business has momentum with good traction in voluntary sales activities with our enhanced product suite and a total sales pipeline that\u2019s up significantly over the prior year.","Mutual Funds had a great quarter with total assets under management now exceeding $100 billion. Strong market conditions and investment performance led to sales of over $7 billion and net positive flows of $1.3 billion including significant sales and flows from the Schroders [ph] sub-advised funds.","As we look forward in 2017, our strategic priorities remain consistent: Organic growth; improved customer experience; and developing new operating capabilities. The priority for our excess capital is to support these strategic objectives, particularly in areas such as small commercial, specialty risk products, A&H, benefits in industry verticals that expand our underwriting appetite. We want to provide agents and policyholders with insurance solutions for more of their risk needs and being easier company for them to do business with. As I\u2019ve said before, we have an organic growth orientation but we will consider acquisitions that make financial sense and accelerate the achievement of our strategic objectives.","In closing, I am pleased with our execution in navigating very competitive market conditions in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits and with the progress we\u2019ve made in personal auto. I\u2019m optimistic about the initiatives we have underway to continue to profitably grow our businesses and to create long-term shareholder value.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Doug.","Doug Elliot","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone.","First quarter results for property and casualty and Group Benefits excluding catastrophes were very good and consistent with our expectations. Our Commercial Line businesses posted strong underlying performance in a competitive market. Personal Lines auto loss cost trends were in line with the full year outlook we shared in February. And after a very challenging 2016, we\u2019re pleased with our progress. And Group Benefits posted another quarter of strong earnings, excluding the Penn Treaty guaranteed fund assessment.","Before I get into the details of our performance, let me touch on catastrophe losses, which were $150 million pretax for the quarter.","Wind, hail and tornado activity across the South, Southeast and Midwest was higher than normal. First quarter catastrophes typically involve winter storm events, which were not as significant this year. Compared to first quarter of 2016, our catastrophe losses were up $59 million pretax. However, last year, several catastrophes hit near the close of the quarter. We subsequently received a number of late-reported commercial losses that drove our estimate for the quarter up to $131 million by year-end. On this basis, catastrophe losses for first quarter 2017 increased by $19 million.","Let me now share some additional details on the performance of our business units.","The first quarter 2017 combined ratio for Commercial Lines was 96, up 4.9 points from 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher catastrophe losses, as I just mentioned, and a change to slightly adverse prior year development versus favorable development last year. Prior year development for the quarter includes favorable development in workers\u2019 compensation where our loss trends remain excellent.","Frequency trends continue to run better than expectations, particularly in the more recent accident years. Bond was also favorable as trends in both contract and commercial surety continued to emerge better than expected. On the other hand, commercial auto remains a hotspot for us as well as the industry, and we increased prior year reserves in Small Commercial and National Accounts to ensure that we\u2019re proactively responding to the latest signals of higher bodily injury severity and increased litigation. Although the prior year development is disappointing, we continue to achieve high single digit written price increases and execute on our underwriting actions. Our new business and retentions across Commercial is down, which we expect to continue into 2017.","The underlying combined ratio for Commercial Lines, which excludes catastrophes and prior year development, was very good at 90.9 for the first quarter, up 1.3 points from 2016, in line with our expectations. Given competitive market conditions, I\u2019m very pleased with our execution across all our commercial businesses, recognizing that we have more work to do in commercial auto. Renewal written pricing in Standard Commercial Lines was 3.3% for the first quarter, up 90 basis points from fourth quarter 2016. Small Commercial was up in all lines versus prior year and sequentially. This speaks to the strength of our value proposition in the marketplace and the ability of our team to execute in product, sales and underwriting.","In Middle Market, renewal written pricing turned positive from flat in fourth quarter 2016. This is a market segment where price competition has been notable. I\u2019m encouraged by our disciplined pricing actions, particularly in workers\u2019 compensation. Our underwriting teams continue to hold the line, exercising sound judgment on a case-by-case basis.","Small Commercial had an excellent first quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 87.3. Written premium grew 6%, driven by strong retentions and $154 million of new business, including $15 million from Maxum.","Middle Market delivered a solid underlying combined ratio of 93.8 for the first quarter, deteriorating 1.8 points from 2016. Slight margin compression in several lines, including general liability and auto was partially offset by favorable non-catastrophe property losses.","Expenses were higher due to increased technology and other operating costs. Written premium increased 4% based on solid retentions and strong new business production of $128 million, up 24% versus last year. Our new business growth was driven primarily from our industry verticals and specialized practice teams, which we\u2019ve been steadily gaining traction over the last three to four years.","In Specialty Commercial, the underlying combined ratio of 97.5 for the first quarter deteriorated 3.2 points from 2016. This was driven by higher operating costs and margin compression in excess auto liability. Written premium in Specialty Commercial was up 5% for the quarter, largely the result of strong new and renewal premium and bond.","Shifting over to Personal Lines. We posted a combined ratio of 99.3 for the first quarter of 2017, improving six tenths of a point from a year ago. Higher catastrophe losses in 2017 were more than offset by a change from unfavorable prior year development in 2016 to slightly favorable development this year. The underlying combined ratio of 91.2 deteriorated 1.5 points from last year. This was heavily driven by homeowners, where the underlying combined ratio for the first quarter was 78.9, deteriorating 3.8 points versus last year due to higher non-catastrophe weather and fire losses.","In Personal Lines auto, the underlying combined ratio for first quarter 2017 was 96.6 with a loss ratio of 75.6 versus a 2016 reported loss ratio of 72.1. However, by year-end 2016, we had increased the accident year auto loss ratio for first quarter 2016 by approximately 6 points. Compared to this adjusted loss ratio, first quarter 2017 has improved 2.6 points, as noted in the slide presentation.","We\u2019re closely monitoring the effects of our pricing, underwriting and agency management actions on our overall loss costs and are very pleased with the improving trends we see. Auto frequency moderated considerably in the first quarter and severity returned to more historical levels.","The Personal Lines auto expense ratio for the first quarter was lower this year by approximately 3 points, due primarily to reduced new business acquisition expenses. The first quarter auto loss ratio improvement is consistent with our expectations and in line with the full year 2017 auto combined ratio outlook of 101 to 103 that we shared with you back in February. That outlook includes approximately 1 point for catastrophes.","Written premium for Personal Lines was down 7% versus first quarter of last year. New business has decreased as we have continued to address our rate needs with added filings and improved underwriting segmentation. We\u2019re pleased with our progress to-date as our actions and results continue to track closely with our expectations.","Given our improving trends and higher rate levels, we expect to increase our AARP new business marketing efforts during the second half of the year.","Now, let me turn to Group Benefits. Core earnings for the first quarter was $40 million with a margin of 4.3%. This includes a guaranteed fund assessment of $13 million after tax for Penn Treaty, which we noted last quarter. Excluding this assessment, core earnings was up $5 million, primarily due to favorable net investment income with an adjusted margin of 5.8%, reflecting very strong underlying performance in this business.","The group life and disability loss ratios this quarter were largely consistent with prior year. Group life trends have been slightly favorable and very stable relative to the volatility we experienced in 2016. Group disability, although slightly elevated this quarter, continues to perform within our expected range and we feel very positive about our trends.","Looking at the top line. First quarter fully insured ongoing premium increased 4%. Overall book persistency on our employer group block of business was approximately 90%, and fully insured ongoing sales were $211 million. Overall, it was a healthy sales quarter and we\u2019re pleased with our competitive positioning in the market.","In summary, first quarter 2017 represents a solid start to the year for all our Property, Casualty and Group Benefit businesses. Overall, we remain disciplined and balanced in our execution to deliver profitable growth.","Let me now turn the call over to Beth.","Beth Bombara","Thank you, Doug. I\u2019m going to cover the other segments, our investment performance and provide an update on the execution of our capital management plans.","Strong investment performance, net flows and rising equity markets led to Mutual Funds\u2019 core earnings increasing to $23 million this quarter compared with $20 million in the first quarter of 2016. At least 70% of our funds are beating their peers over the one-year, three-year and five-year period. Sales of $7.2 billion generated positive net flows of $1.3 billion in the quarter compared to $4.7 billion of sales and approximately $200 million of net outflows during first quarter of 2016. Strong equity markets and the adoption of the Schroders funds in October 2016 drove total segment AUM to $103.2 billion, a 14% increase from the same period in 2016.","Talcott continues to perform well. Core earnings were $83 million, up from $77 million in the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to higher returns on limited partnerships. Over the past four quarters, VA contracts count decreased 10% and fixed annuity contracts decreased 6%. As a reminder, Talcott paid a dividend of $300 million to the holding company in January and we expect another $300 million in the second half of the year. Talcott ended the quarter with $4.1 billion in statutory surplus.","The investment portfolio also continues to perform well. Total LP investment income was $17 million, before tax, compared to $8 million in the first quarter 2016, which included losses on hedge funds. Excluding LPs, the total before tax annualized portfolio yield was 4% this quarter, slightly lower than the 4.1% last year, largely due to the impact of lower reinvestment rates versus the yield on sales and maturities over the past year. For the P&C portfolio, the annualized yield excluding LPs was 3.7%, down from 3.8% in first quarter 2016. Credit experience remains very good with total impairment and mortgage loan valuation reserve charges of only $1 million before tax, down from $23 million in the first quarter of 2016, which included energy impairments of $16 million.","To conclude on earnings, first quarter core earnings per diluted share was $1, up 5% from $0.95 in first quarter 2016 as the impact of our share repurchase program more than offset the 2% decrease in core earnings. The 12-month core earnings ROE was 7.6% and the core earnings ROE, excluding Talcott was 8.6%, both of which include the impact of prior development on our A&E exposures prior to the purchase of the loss development cover. Excluding the A&E charge, 12-month core earnings ROE, excluding Talcott, was 10%.","Turning to shareholders\u2019 equity. Book value per diluted share excluding AOCI at March 31, 2017, was up 3% compared to a year ago.","Before taking questions, I want to provide an update on the execution of our capital management plan. During the quarter, we repurchased $325 million of stock. During the month of April through the 25th, we repurchased about 1.9 million shares for $92 million. This leaves approximately $883 million available under the $1.3 billion equity repurchase authorization for 2017.","With respect to debt management, in March, we repaid $416 million of senior notes, which is our only 2017 debt maturity. We also exercised the option on the Glen Meadow contingent capital facility, which resulted in the issuance of $500 million of junior subordinated debt. As a reminder, we intend to use the proceeds to call our 8.125% $500 million Junior subordinated debentures when they become redeemable at par in June 2018.","To conclude, we are off to a good start in 2017. The actions that we have taken in Personal Lines are taking hold and we expect further improvement in 2017 and 2018. Underlying results remain strong for Commercial Lines, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds, and we are very pleased with our investment performance. ","I will now turn the call over to Sabra, so we can begin the Q&A session.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you, Beth. Just a reminder that we have about 30 minutes for Q&A. If you have to drop off or if we run out of time before we get to your question, please email or call the Investor Relations team and we\u2019ll follow up with you as soon as possible today. Sarah, could you please repeat the instructions for Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Your line is open.","Brian Meredith","Yes. Thank you. A couple of quick ones here. First, Chris and Doug, I\u2019m just curious, the underlying combined ratio development that we saw in the Commercial Lines area, I think, related to GL commercial auto, is that something that you guys are anticipating as you laid out guidance for the year kind of within kind of where your expectations are?","Chris Swift","Brian, from a guidance side, Doug could give you a little more color on what we\u2019re really seeing and feeling but we don\u2019t guide for prior year adverse or positive development. So, Doug, I know we\u2019ve been watching commercial auto trends specifically. Do you mind giving Brian a little more color?","Doug Elliot","So, I guess, a couple of points. One is relative to general liability, little bit of pressure from a prior program but we are watching the GL line overall. First quarter is essentially in line with a little pressure from program that we had several years ago. On the auto side, we\u2019ve been underwriting, re-underwriting and working pricing last couple of years, a little bit of pressure in our excess National Account book and also in Small Commercial. So, feel good about the work we\u2019ve done in Middle but we did feel a little bit of prior year pressure in Small and we felt like we needed to address both that in our National Account book.","Brian Meredith","And then, second question is, Chris, there\u2019s a bill, I believe it\u2019s in the Senate right now, Connecticut Senate, that would enable, I guess, you guys could break up Talcott to separate pieces. Could you give us a status on kind of where you know that bill is right now, sort of time line? And what would it mean for your kind of desires to get rid of Talcott?","Chris Swift","Yes. I think the bill you\u2019re referring to is we call it the division\u2019s bill. I would share with you -- it\u2019s something that we have sponsored, really from all our restructuring activities over the last couple of years, Brian. We observed some better practices in the different parts of the country or the world, in fact. And we have worked with the Connecticut Department to sponsor it. I would say sponsoring it and reading anything into what it means from a possible transaction, I would not do that. I think what we viewed it as a piece of legislation and rules and regulations that we thought our leading regulator, in the Connecticut Department of Insurance, should avail itself and avail all Connecticut companies with the opportunity to separate new businesses and legal entities and transact those types of activities that are aligned to their go-forward transactions.","So the bill is in Congress right now. It\u2019s come out of Congress. The legislature side of Connecticut, it needs to go to the Senate side, it then needs to be signed by the Governor. The legislature is in session, I think, through late June, and we\u2019re optimistic that it will get passed and signed by the Governor.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb for Barclays. Your line is open.","Jay Gelb","Thank you. I have a couple of questions, first on personal auto. The magnitude of rate increase, 10.5% in the current quarter is probably among the highest of any of the companies I track. I just wanted to get your perspective on what kind of impact that\u2019s having on Hartford within the market.","Doug Elliot","Jay, thanks. This is Doug. Last quarter, I believe on the call, I did give you a little bit of forward lean into what we expected to see over the first three to four quarters of 2017. And this 10.5 is largely in line with that commentary. So, yes, we\u2019re pleased. Obviously, this is the written element, so it\u2019s got to earn its way in but we feel like there\u2019s forward traction on our actions, including pricing in our first line\u2019s book and encouraged by the start to 2017.","Jay Gelb","Okay. And then, on claims inflation personal auto, in the deck, it was mentioned that there\u2019s less impact from personal auto frequency and severity. Can you provide us some more insight in terms of what you\u2019re seeing on the trends there?","Doug Elliot","Sure. On the frequency side, Jay, our numbers have essentially flattened out. So, as we go back over the prior couple of years, we had some small single-digit moving to mid-single digit pressure on frequency. And as we look back over this quarter and the last several quarters, we feel very good, and it\u2019s essentially flat. On the severity side, as we\u2019ve talked on prior calls, in our plans, we\u2019re in the mid-single digits, maybe on the four to five range on severity, and the first quarter essentially came in as expected. So, pleased that our view of the year is playing out as we had hoped. Very watchful, 90 days does not make a final outcome. But relative to the path we have carved and our goal of over these two years to make improvements financially that are required, very good start to 2017.","Jay Gelb","Good to hear. And then, separately, there has been some persistent press reports about potential Talcott transaction. And I\u2019m just looking at the difference between statutory capital of $4 billion and GAAP equity of -- ex AOCI of $7.3 billion. If a transaction were to come in below stacked capital, how should we think about the financial implication to that?","Chris Swift","Jay, it\u2019s Chris. I don\u2019t know what you mean. To me, it\u2019s math, right? I mean, you\u2019ve got stat and GAAP, you\u2019ve got cash and really, I don\u2019t feel comfortable speculating too much here with you on any potential transaction. So, to me, I just would tell you it will be math. But I mean, we\u2019ve always said we\u2019re comfortable running Talcott off over a longer period of time. We\u2019ve shrunken its risk profile and that any transaction that we would consider has to be, first, economic for us and our shareholders it needs to be a provable or a clean break, potential parties need to take care of our customers and employees. So I mean we know the conditions we\u2019re looking for. And beyond that, I just would ask you to do the math yourself and you make your judgment sound what you think it means.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Ryan Tunis","Hey, thanks. Good morning. My first question I guess was for Chris. And just hearing emphasize Group Benefits as a core business, how do you think about weighing M&A opportunities when you think about P&C, Commercial versus Group? And then I guess, more specifically, you mentioned you\u2019re a top-five player, what would be the benefits, I guess, of becoming even bigger than that? Thanks.","Chris Swift","Ryan, thanks for the question. I would just say, from a business and capital allocation perspective, Commercial, Benefits, Personal Lines, Mutual Funds, I mean, we\u2019re comfortable deploying capital into those businesses that make financial and strategic sense. So, specifically, if there\u2019s a benefits opportunity in the marketplace, it\u2019s something we would consider seriously looking at. We like our Group Benefits businesses. You can see the returns, its earnings. It has a concentration a little bit in the large National Accounts base of over 5,000 lives. So, in Doug\u2019s leadership, we\u2019ve been trying to grow the small, the middle size of that. We\u2019ve completed our voluntary product suite and we think about A&H more broadly. So, it would be a business that we are now [ph] going to continue to invest in and we think we have capabilities and the brand to effectively compete over the long term.","Ryan Tunis","Thanks. And I just had a couple for Doug. I guess, the first one, growth is good in Small Commercial, but again emphasizing the competitive dynamic in the marketplace, is there potentially a need for another investment cycle, I guess, in that business in the near to medium-term, just given what you\u2019re seeing coming out of peers?","Doug Elliot","Ryan, I guess, I would answer it this way. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve ever stopped investing in Small Commercial. There is no question there are a lot of interested parties looking at that segment, trying to participate in that segment. We\u2019ve been at a long time very pleased with last several years of progress and excellent quarter. But this year and next, big priority around digital but capabilities we have in the service center, our selling skills, et cetera. So, I would like you to think about our investment in Small as ongoing and doubling down as we move forward.","Ryan Tunis","Okay. And then, in Middle Market, seeing the growth there in new business, if you could just talk a little bit more about what was driving that and how you could see the momentum there playing out through the rest of the year?","Doug Elliot","Good question, Ryan. And a little outsized, and certainly quite a bit different than last year first quarter. Largely, as I mentioned in my script, around our verticals, construction had an excellent first quarter, as did marine and some of the other verticals. So, we are still grinding our way in the generalist space of Middle and the growth there was clearly not as robust as it was in these other areas. Our momentum in construction has been very positive over the last couple of years. And in the first quarter, we were awarded two very large athletic arenas in the United States. So, feel good about some of the wins. Again, I think, it was a little outsized, I don\u2019t expect to have four quarters of growth like that in those verticals but I am pleased with the progress.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Cohen","Thank you. A couple of questions. First, you talked about non-cat weather in the two different segments having sort of offsetting impacts. Can you characterize a non-CAT weather in either segment as -- not relative to last year but relative to expectations, was it unusual, either bigger or less?","Doug Elliot","Sure, Jay. I will try to do that for you. When we think about homeowners, as I talked about it, in the non-cat weather category and fire, we were essentially 3.5 points high than our three to five-year average over a period of time. I\u2019d remind you that the early part of the quarter had a lot of West Coast water activity, not just California but really up to the Northwest, got a sizable part of our book on the West Coast. So, we were impacted by that water and also in our Commercial book as well. So, a little bit out of pattern; we felt the pressure from weather, but I think things will snap back in as we go forward.","Jay Cohen","So, homeowners was about 3.5 points above a normalized level, is that fair?","Doug Elliot","That\u2019s correct. Driving essentially to 3.8 variance that I chatted about, in our homeowners XX.","Jay Cohen","Yes. That\u2019s helpful. And then, the other question. In personal auto acquisition costs being down, is that a function of lower commissions, less advertising through the AARP channel? What really drive those lower costs?","Doug Elliot","Yes. What was driving fundamentally this quarter change was lower marketing activities associated with our personal auto book. So, as I commented, as we feel and continue to feel better about rate adequacy, which is a going to be a quarter-to-quarter march moving through this year and next, we will adjust accordingly, Jay, turning back on those, very specific state-by-state basis. But I do think that run rate, we will not be able to continue at that. You should expect to see some more marketing expense as we feel better about our rate adequacy.","Jay Cohen","Yes. Now, that makes sense. Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Ransom from Dowling & Partners. Your line is open.","Gary Ransom","Good morning. There\u2019s been an increasing discussion on the impact of the plaintiffs\u2019 bar on loss trends, either more lawyers looking for cases or more willing to go to trials or simply more legal representation. Are you seeing anything on that front?","Doug Elliot","Gary, we have looked hard at that issue, hard at the data, and with our new claim system that we\u2019ve brought on board last couple of years, better visibility. As I look at the representation rate, it\u2019s up slightly but not in big numbers. So, I do -- I feel slight representation numbers up. What I do see though on our data is a higher -- a quicker trigger to litigation, particularly at the moment around auto liability and also GL. So, we\u2019re watching very quickly those cases that are with representation and how quickly they\u2019re going to litigation and how that is working through our book of business.","Gary Ransom","Just as a follow-up, is that -- it\u2019s broad-based. Do you think the industry is responding in pricing? Obviously, they are in commercial auto, but maybe in GL, is there some upward pressure on pricing because of those trends?","Doug Elliot","It\u2019s a really good point. I do think the industry is responding to auto, I absolutely agree with you. I think GL, auto liability is an area that needs more attention and would benefit by a bit more discipline across the industry. It\u2019s a line that has our attention, probably differently than a year or two years ago. I look at what we\u2019ve been able to achieve on the pricing side in Middle, in that core Middle, and I think the line, over time, will demand more rate so that we offset some of the trends that we will feel. I don\u2019t think these litigation trends that others and we are talking about are going away anytime soon.","Chris Swift","It\u2019s Chris. I just would add, particularly given our book of business more in the Middle, we get exposed through our primary lines. We\u2019re not big umbrella or excess players. In fact, as we think about the future in expanding our risk appetite, it\u2019s one area that really causes us pause on the umbrella, the excess lines. Can we get paid and earn an adequate return? So until we see a little more correction and realism in price and exposure, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to deploy too much capital into excess umbrella lines in GL.","Gary Ransom","Right, okay. Should I read anything into the little uptick in renewal pricing that we saw in the first quarter versus last year?","Doug Elliot","Certainly, I asked you to read something in on small commercial. And that is we are leaning into some of the signs in our book first auto which we\u2019ve chatted up, but GL. We had some slip and fall type classes over the last three to four quarter that, Gary, we have tuned up our pricing around. And so, those changes are real and they are necessary. As we step back in our Middle Market book and we look at trends, generally, we feel pretty good, Gary, about frequency across our core commercial Middle Market lines, but there\u2019s a debate and discussion we\u2019re having about severity. And as I think about GL, it\u2019s a line that I think you\u2019ll see us be thoughtful and lean into a bit more on the pricing side. It\u2019s just -- we expect that trends are not going to be in the zero and two range, out in 2017 and 2018. I think it\u2019s more likely that we feel a four, five range, and that is clearly not where the market is pricing that line at the moment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is open.","Meyer Shields","Great. Thank you. Good morning. Doug, can you give us an indication of how the adjusted auto loss ratio played out over 2016, so we can use that as a base for 2017?","Beth Bombara","Yes, Meyer. It\u2019s Beth. I\u2019ll take that question. So, when you think about 2016, we increased our loss picks for accident year of 2016, both in the second quarter and in the fourth quarter. And you may recall that in the fourth quarter, we talked about the fact that it was probably about 6 points that we booked in Q4 that related to earlier quarters. So, you can kind of think about how you\u2019d adjust the fourth quarter loss ratio. So, it really leaves second and third quarter. And the way we look at it -- I don\u2019t have the exact numbers in front of me, is that it\u2019s probably around one to two points of difference you\u2019d expect from what we reported. So, in second quarter, the number we reported would be a little bit high because again we had strengthened the first quarter at that point. And then third quarter, the reported number is probably a little bit low by that amount. And when we kind of put all of that together, as Doug said, we do expect to see the improvement that was embedded in our overall combined ratios that we gave as an outlook back in February.","Meyer Shields","Okay. That\u2019s certainly helpful. Thanks. And second question, you talked about flattening frequency, again, I\u2019m talking about personal auto. What have you been assuming in the pricing just that you\u2019ve been filing in [indiscernible]?","Doug Elliot","Well, our 2017 plan had essentially a mid-single digit total trend outlook. And the reason I say we\u2019re encouraged by first quarter with flat frequency in the 3, 3.5 range of severity, feel like we\u2019re just underneath that. So, a good start to the year. We\u2019ll see as we go forward, again, next couple of quarters but mid single digits is where the entire sector has been running. Fast-track data is now out on fourth quarter, so you\u2019ve got to peek at that. And that has been our lean plus experience into our filing state-by-state. There\u2019s a lot geography and a lot of specificity in terms of territories that obviously loads up an individual state.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney. Your line is open.","Bob Glasspiegel","Good morning, Hartford. Following up a little bit on Gary\u2019s question. So, I think what you\u2019re saying is that the sort of rates that you\u2019re taking, 3% or so in Standard Commercial aren\u2019t like keeping up with underlying trend which you thought might be closer to 5. I\u2019ll give you credit, you\u2019re one of the few companies publicly sort of saying that our are underlying commercial will be deteriorating this year in your guidance. Are we still at a point where you\u2019re looking at 12 months margins are coming down or can you sort of offset that with better risk selection?","Doug Elliot","Bob, this is Doug. First thing I would say is when we think about our operating margins, I\u2019d separate Small from Middle, just they\u2019re very different marketplaces. But overall, our theme, my comments back 90 days ago, as I look out across, in general pricing has been at or slightly below loss trends for some period of time, several quarters at least. And the math on that, as you roll into 2017, unless you\u2019re predicting very encouraging severity signs across auto, GL and compensation and the medical, it\u2019s hard for the math to work in any other direction but pressure on core margins. So that\u2019s my own personal view. This is several cycles for me.","I\u2019m encouraged by our pricing lift in the first quarter though. So, the other side of that is the 90 basis-point lift in pricing, both in Small and a little bit of benefit in Middle, I\u2019m encouraged, encouraged with our discipline. And maybe we have a bottoming, if you will, on the pricing side in Commercial. That would be a good thing because we\u2019ve worked hard to achieve the operating levels we\u2019re at. Very pleased about those levels but I don\u2019t want to give them away. And that is a debate we\u2019re having everyday across our lines, across all our businesses but in a very segmented way. Did that help?","Bob Glasspiegel","Yes, very much. Switching gears, just on your acquisition target. Is there a size of what the ideal type company and how big you could go on an acquisition?","Chris Swift","Bob, it\u2019s Chris. I would say, just a couple thoughts on M&A in general that we\u2019ve been proactive in the marketplace. We\u2019re very disciplined about our approach. It has to make strategic and financial sense. So, we think in terms of a bolt-on and\/or extensions into adjacent markets that would be a little less complex to integrating into The Hartford. But I would also say we\u2019re open to larger opportunities that accelerate our growth in markets, product lines, geographies that we want to be in.","That, I would characterize as a target that has anywhere as between $500 million and $1 billion of premium. So, I don\u2019t know if that helps size, your size question, but I think that would be something digestible. But again, it has to make the financial sense, and we\u2019ve being disciplined, given we\u2019ve been at this over the last four years. And we\u2019ve said no to a lot of opportunities. So, that\u2019s what I would say, Bob.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Randy Binner","Hey, good morning. Thanks. I wanted -- I think this question is for Doug. I just wanted to jump back and kind of weave together some of those commentaries. So, it sounds like in kind of the I\u2019ll call it, the Small Commercial or Middle Market book, your severity trend is maybe in their loss trend rather is more in maybe in the 4% to 5% range. But then, drilling in on commercial auto, I think I heard your comments to say that you were planning on mid-single-digit loss trends, so call it 4% to 5%. But then, you\u2019re below that now. So, I just wanted to clarify that I\u2019m kind of hearing that right because some of the loss trend data points would begin in this earnings season would indicate that commercial auto is still kind of higher single digits and really is not stabilizing. So, I\u2019m just trying to tie that all together that you do see commercial auto trend stabilizing here.","Doug Elliot","The commercial auto results, I\u2019d start by saying, are not acceptable and are not acceptable in our book, and we\u2019re determined to continue to work at that. In the Middle Market, over the past four years, we\u2019ve put 37 points of rate into the book of business. So, good news is that with re-underwriting and rate, it\u2019s a much healthier book but we\u2019re also dealing with the same dynamics in the marketplace relative to driving behavior that we\u2019ve faced in Personal Lines. So, Middle has been a pricing story after years of re-underwriting. I feel pretty good about our core book.","In Small Commercial, we face some pressures over the last three quarters that to me have also come from the Personal Lines re-underwriting. And that\u2019s a book where in our micro end we\u2019ve got many businesses that have 1 and 2 and 3 employees. So I think there is a lot we can learn from Personal Lines. We\u2019re not pleased about our performance in Small Commercial and the auto side, we\u2019re addressing it through not only underwriting and pricing. And we still feel pressure on the bodily injury side of those trends in both Small and Middle with auto.","So, I\u2019m feeling mid-single-digit pressure on severity in our Commercial auto book and I don\u2019t expect that to change, because I think that\u2019s largely what we see out in the external environment and what our view of the external data is saying to us. And therefore, we\u2019re building our action plans around that.","Randy Binner","Are there particular kind of sub-segment to commercial auto though that are still kind of spiking into the high single digits? I\u2019m just trying to reconcile some of the data points we\u2019re hearing out there. Because I know you\u2019re going to have a bigger look at the market and then the fast-track data you discussed with 2. But are there still pockets that are seeing kind of bigger lifts especially in BI severity?","Doug Elliot","Well, there certainly is a geography twist to that. So, there are ZIP Codes and areas of the country where we feel more pressure than others. There are class dynamics to it. In Small Commercial, I\u2019ve mentioned in the past that we have changed our referral triggers on several of those classes that used to just hit the glass for quotes and run right through. Now, we\u2019ll take those quotes at a technology level and bring them back to an underwriter for more-strict underwriting. So, yes, I would say both class and geography are definitely triggers that we\u2019re looking at and impact an aggregate performance that needs more pricing and more underwriting.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, good morning. I had a question first on the auto book. I appreciate the additional disclosure this quarter. When I look at the underlying loss ratio for the first quarter, we see the year-over-year improvement but I\u2019m thinking, when I think about going forward, seasonally auto does run stronger margins in the first quarter. But does the fact that you\u2019re going to be earning in more rate over the rest of three quarters, change some of the seasonality that you expect when you think about the underlying loss ratio, Q2 to Q4 versus what you printed in the first quarter?","Doug Elliot","Elyse, this is Doug. Our plan did kind of play that. So largely, our expectations for the year and our guidance stands as is. So, yes, you\u2019re absolutely right. This seasonality that we\u2019ve seen in the past, we expect to continue. And essentially our pricing objectives are being met. And we continue to work hard to achieve the next three quarters, so that we can have a full year and get this back on track.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then, last quarter, you guys provided on some color around the retention within the auto book in terms of kind of by loss ratio. The retention did come down on the overall book a little bit in the quarter. But, when you would look by loss ratio band in a way, did you see kind of the same dynamics where you\u2019re seeing a greater drop in retention within some of the more-higher loss ratio part of the book?","Doug Elliot","We did, Elyse. We saw a very similar pattern, which is actually why we didn\u2019t put the exhibit. It would have been very similar to what you saw 90 days ago.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. And then, Chris, when we, last quarter, discussed the possibility of you guys putting into sale of Talcott, you had mentioned the potential proceeds from a sale that your preference would be to use that towards managing down leverage as well as M&A. Subsequent to that, we\u2019ve addressed it earlier in this call, there\u2019s spill going through Connecticut. Does the ability to sell parts of Talcott, and so obviously different sales could happen at different times, and the level of proceeds would come in at different periods of time. Does that change how you would consider thinking about what you might do with the proceeds?","Chris Swift","Yes. Elyse, I would say, it\u2019s got very tactical in an area that we\u2019re not going to speculate or comment on. One, I\u2019d remind you that bill is only through half of the legislature, so the other half needs to approve it and the Governor needs to sign it. As I said, we expect that to happen in June. And then, we\u2019ll evaluate things from there. But, I think it\u2019s way too premature to go down the path that you are going down.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman from Balyasny. Your line is open.","Ian Gutterman","Hi. Thank you. Doug, you mentioned in your script about being able to restart marketing for AARP in the second half. Should I take that as a sign that you feel pretty good about the progress you\u2019re making to have the confidence to do that?","Doug Elliot","Ian, you should feel good that we are pleased with the early start to progress. I\u2019ll remind you, and this is a multiyear effort, so one quarter does not make the goal we have in mind. But pleased about the early signals of our initiatives across underwriting and claims and pricing, et cetera. And again, you can see it because we shared transparently, there\u2019s a direct side of this financial dynamic and then there\u2019s the agency piece. And our top line is a bit more moderated in the agency side, so we\u2019re not shrinking early as much as we are in total, and that\u2019s something that is a clear focus for us. We\u2019ve got terrific partners at AARP. And we are intent upon stabilizing this book and looking for opportunities to grow going forward. That is our goal. And I think we\u2019re going to be at a healthier spot in the second half of the year to achieve that. And as such, we will direct marketing activities accordingly.","Ian Gutterman","Got it. I mean, I assume you if felt that you still didn\u2019t have your arms around this, you wouldn\u2019t be thinking about growing the book then. Is that a fair assessment?","Doug Elliot","That\u2019s a very fair assessment.","Ian Gutterman","Okay, great. And just a broader question for everyone to take it on reserves. Obviously, you said the last few years, you disclosed in the K the range about the midpoint and it\u2019s continued to creep up but that hasn\u2019t really shown up yet in reserve releases. And I\u2019m just wondering, philosophically, how you guys think about that. Is the goal sort of to keep growing that range above the midpoint each year and sort of keep the base reserve releases around zero and strengthen the balance sheet for the future or is it just that most of that move above the midpoint has been in the recent accident years and they\u2019re just not seasoned enough and over the next, call it, near to midterm, once it gets more seasoned, we\u2019ll start to see sort of more consistent releases?","Chris Swift","It\u2019s Chris. I\u2019ll let Beth comment also, but philosophically, there is no target there. I mean, we evaluate reserves every quarter and try to use our best math, our best judgment, both on what\u2019s happening and the potential scenarios, sensitivities going forward. So, that really informs sort of our view of what our carried position is compared to the actuarial indications. So, I would dissuade your mind into thinking in terms of a math equation, program releases should start to come because it\u2019s really facts and circumstances. And again, personally speaking for one member of our team, I mean, we are watching inflation very closely. We see wage pressures; we see litigation pressures in other areas. So, the wage sensitivity we have in our book and comp in disability is material. So, we want to be very, very prudent, have those accident years seasoned with great deal of certainty before we deal with them.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. Ms. Purtill, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you, Sarah, and thank you all for joining us today and for your interest in The Hartford.

And welcome to The Hartford\u2019s full year 2014 financial results and 2015 outlook webcast and conference call. Our news release, the Investor Financial Supplement and the fourth quarter Financial Results Presentation, which includes our 2015 outlook were all filed yesterday afternoon and are available on our website.","At about 8:30 this morning, we posted the slides for today\u2019s webcast, which are also available on the Investor Relations section of the website and which will also accompany the webcast today.","Our speakers today include Chris Swift, CEO of The Hartford; Doug Elliot, President; and Beth Bombara, CFO. Following their prepared remarks, we will have about 30 minutes for Q&A.","As described on page two of the presentation, today\u2019s call includes forward-looking statements as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results could be materially different.","We do not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements and investors should consider the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from these statements.

Explanations and reconciliations of these measures to the comparable GAAP measure are included in our SEC filings, as well as in the earnings release and financial supplement.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Swift","Thank you, Sabra. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. 2014 was an outstanding year for The Hartford. We continued the execution of our strategy and created value for shareholders. We accelerated the transformation of the company by expanding profit margins and increasing ROEs and P&C and Group Benefits and Mutual Funds.","Our selling the Japan Annuity business and reducing risk in Talcott, returning over $2 billion of capital to The Hartford shareholder and executing a seamless leadership transition. I want to thank Liam, the Board, the management team and all our employees for contributing to a great year.","Last night, we reported outstanding fourth quarter and full year 2014 results. Full year core earnings increased 9% to $1.55 billion. On a fully diluted per share basis, core earnings grew 16%, reflecting profitable growth and effective capital management.","The core ROE increased to 8.4% in 2014, a full 1 point increase over prior year. Core earnings growth was driven by margin expansion in P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds, and solid topline growth in P&C.","We achieved an almost 3-point year-over-year improvement in underlying combined ratio in P&C. The Hartford\u2019s pricing discipline and investments in new products and capabilities are producing strong results.","Strong profitability recovery continued in Group Benefits, with the core earnings margin rising almost a point in 2014 to 5.2%. I'm very pleased with how our businesses are balancing margins and topline growth in this market environment.","The Japan sale was another critical accomplishment in 2014. The transaction significantly improved the company's risk profile and enabled us to increase our capital management program. During the year we return more than $2 billion of capital to shareholders in the form of equity repurchases and dividends. We also reduce holding company debt by $200 million.","Before we move into 2015\u2019s outlook, I want to touch upon an important event that we originally expected in 2014, the Passage of TRIA. The TRIA legislation has been and continues to be critically important to policyholders that rely on the availability of terrorism insurance. We appreciate the efforts of Congress and the administration to enable its passage.","Now let\u2019s turn to 2015. We expect to generate core earnings between $1.55 billion and $1.65 billion. As Beth will cover in more detail, adjusting for 2014\u2019s low catastrophe losses, strong limited partnership returns and prior year development, earnings growth from P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds is expected to more than offset the anticipated decline in Talcott earnings. As Doug will detail, we are striving to expand our margins in 2015, recognizing the pricing and interest rate environment has become more challenging.","In P&C, we are optimistic that targeted pricing actions and enhanced capabilities will allow us to drive modest improvements in the underlying combined ratio. In Group Benefits, the core margin is expected to be relatively stable. We foresee continued improvement in disability loss trends, but expect that to be offset by a reversion to more typical life mortality.","We expect the key story in Group Benefits to be a topline growth recovery. Recent sales activity suggest The Hartford strength in claim handling and service are making a difference with customers.","We are committed to improving The Hartford\u2019s ROE and growing book value per share to drive top quartile shareholder returns. As I discussed last quarter, we will focus our activities in four major areas, expanding product and underwriting capabilities, increasing distribution effectiveness, improving the customer experience and operating efficiency, and effectively managing capital, including the ongoing runoff of Talcott.","We continue to add new product and underwriting capabilities to meet the needs of a broader range of policyholders. In 2015, we intend to introduce new industry verticals in middle market and to strengthen our underwriting presence in geographies where we have been underrepresented.","In Group Benefits, we have expanded our voluntary product suite to include disability flex, critical illness and accident coverages. These products and underwriting initiatives strengthen our relationship with brokers and agents by helping them better serve their clients. In addition, we seek to extend our distribution in 2015.","The micro segment of small commercial is best served by a multi-channel distribution strategy. We are aggressively moving in that direction with an AARP endorsed offering and other initiatives that will bring increased complicity and speed to small business owners and our distribution partners.","We are also investing in technologies that will improve the customer experience and create operating efficiencies. The early feedback from the rollout of our new P&C claim systems has been very positive. The system promises to improve claims handling, efficiency and consistency, as well as the entire claims experience for the policyholder and the agent.","Finally, effective capital management will continue to be -- will be continued to be critical in meeting the company\u2019s strategic goals. We plan to take $1.5 billion in dividends from the Talcott legal entities by early 2016, $500 million of which was completed in January, as we begin to appropriately reduce the amount of excess capital in Talcott to reflect its runoff status. This excess capital will provide the company with significant financial flexibility for future capital actions and investments in new capabilities.","As I reflect on the past 12 months, it is clear that this has been a pivotal year for The Hartford, with the sale of Japan and the significant improvements in P&C and Group Benefits, the company strategic transformation and restructuring is essentially complete. The Hartford enters 2015 as a strong competitor in each of our markets.","We have supplemented existing strengths in underwriting and claims, with enhanced capabilities and product, distribution and service. The company is positioned to create shareholder value going forward on a consistent and sustainable basis.","Now I'll turn the call over to Doug.","Doug Elliot","Thank you, Chris, and good morning. Today I\u2019ll cover the 2014 highlights for Commercial Lines, Personal Lines and Group Benefits, and then share some thoughts for 2015.","First, let me quickly remind you that I'll be discussing our results under the new Commercial Lines business alignment we disclose several weeks ago. 2014 was another year of strong financial performance across the Board. Our results were achieved through sound risk selection decisions, outstanding execution across our product and field organizations, and our relentless focus on getting right all the small things that go into a market-leading franchise.","Before I cover our results, I want to touch on a few broad themes affecting our businesses, both in 2014 and as we look forward to 2015. First, while 2014 accident year catastrophes and P&C were slightly higher than 2013, losses were below our expectations for second year. We will take the good news, but we won't plan for it to continue. We still follow our rigorous process to manager cat exposures over the long-term.","Second is net investment income, which trended down for the year and recent movement in treasury yields suggest that we aren\u2019t likely to see reversal anytime soon, this demand that we stay vigilant on our pricing and actively monitor competitive forces in 2015. Beth will have some additional perspective on our investment portfolio in her comments.","Turning to our financial results, in Commercial Lines, we delivered $996 million of core earnings for the full year on an all -- all in combined ratio of 93.4. This was an earnings increase of $169 million from 2013, largely driven by 4.7 points of improvement in the combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio, excluding catastrophes and prior year development was 91.5 for the year, representing 3.6 points of fundamental margin improvement.","On the topline, our written premium of $6.4 billion was up 3% from 2013. Excluding the written premium declines in our programs business due to non-renewal actions taken in 2013, growth was 5%.","New business momentum was building in the back half of 2013, particularly in small, commercial and middle market and that momentum carried into our 2014 results. On balance, we are extremely pleased with our competitive positioning in the market and our prospects for profitable growth.","Let me offer some details on that by looking at each of our commercial business units, starting with small commercial. Our Small Commercial business continues to excel with its unique skills and product distribution and service. Our focus on customers and distributors has propelled us for a very strong market position.","Written premium for the year grew 5%, aided by strong retentions. And the underlying combined ratio of 87% was 2.5 points better than 2013. New business was up 7% for the full year. We finished 2014 with three consecutive quarters of double-digit new business growth, driven by the full implementation of our coding application icon and other agency engagement initiatives.","We continue to make investments in this business to drive competitive advantage. We are adding new online features for services and we launched the partnership with AARP to extend our small business services to their members.","Moving to Middle-Market, I\u2019m pleased with our progress. The underlying combined ratio of 94.5% for the full year improved 4.5 points, much of this resulting from margin improvement and workers\u2019 compensation, the combination of years of underwriting and pricing actions.","Written premium growth was 1%, but this now includes our programs business, which was still shedding business in 2013 and 2014. Excluding programs, middle-market written premium growth was 4%, largely driven by our strategy to expand non-workers\u2019 compensation line and deliver a more balanced book of business.","Retentions were solid throughout the year and new business production of $458 million was up for the second year, much of our success in middle-market links directly to improved performance in the field. We have upped our game in underwriting, process effectiveness and agency engagement with new tools, better data and deeper analytics on the frontline.","We are strengthening our risk capabilities to be a top partner for our distributors and customers, effectively underwriting and servicing an expanded array of new accounts. Within Specialty Commercial, results held steady with an underlying combined ratio of 100.2% for the full year, up slightly from 99.6 in 2013.","National accounts posted another solid year with strong performance on both the top and bottom line. New business tapered off from 2013, which was a particularly active year. Nonetheless, written premiums were up 11% and account retention was in the low 90s.","Our financial products business also had a strong year. The team has successfully repositioned this business and I'm confident that by more closely aligning with our middle-market operation, we can build a competitive advantage across Commercial Lines.","Shifting over to Personal Lines, we delivered $210 million in core earnings, up 2% from prior year. Adjusting for Catalyst360, which we sold in 2013, core earnings actually grew 12%. The all-in combined ratio was 95.5% for the full year, improving 1.4 points versus 2013.","Excluding catastrophes and prior-year development, the underlying combined ratio was 90.6, improving 1.7 points from last year. The improvement was mainly driven by lower marketing and technology related expenses. Written premium grew 4% for the year with continued strong performance from our AARP through agents offering. AARP Direct also posted modest growth from favorable retention and written pricing actions.","During 2014, we rolled out our new auto product, Open Road in 32 states, increasing our pricing flexibility and improving our responsiveness to market trends. We also achieved greater efficiency in our AARP Direct acquisition process, improving our cost per conversion by 10%.","Now let me pivot to Group Benefits. Core earnings for 2014 increased to $180 million, up 14% from 2013. That results in core earnings margin of 5.2%. We continue to see profit improvement driven by favorable Group Life and disability results. Excluding the effects from terminating and association, financial institutions\u2019 marketing arrangement, the 2014 group life loss ratio improved 3.4 points due to continued pricing discipline and favorable mortality.","Disability trends also remained favorable compared to prior year, with the loss ratio improving 0.5 point. Long-term disability incident rates improved but at a slowing pace versus prior year. And claim recovery rates continued to be strong.","Looking at the topline, fully insured ongoing premium excluding association, financial institutions, declined 2% for the full year. Overall, book persistency on our employer group block of business came in at 89% for the year and we've been very pleased with our renewal pricing adequacy.","Fully insured ongoing sales excluding association, financial institution was $326 million for the year, down 12%. However, as we sit here today with considerable insight on the first quarter of 2015 activity, we are seeing a strong rebound in new sales. We are encouraged that our recent investments are enabling us to compete more effectively and close more cases.","So as we wrap up 2014, we are pleased with our continued financial progress by the growing market strength of each business. Across our enterprise, we are seeing strong and still improving levels of employee engagement and a deep commitment to achieving even greater levels of success as we look to the future. This is what defines The Hartford and why our customers and distribution partners trust us with their most important insurance needs.","Before I turn things over to Beth, let me offer a few comments on 2015. We continue to invest heavily in our capabilities as an enterprise, focused on areas of competitive advantage for each business. We've been on this journey for several years, making extensive progress in product development business metrics and easy-to-use technology applications for distributors, customers and employees alike. A great example is our new P&C claims management platform that will be completely rolled out by end of this year.","It is already delivering value through improved claim rep performance, better customer experience and process efficiency. And the data analytics supported through the platform will be a source of innovation for years to come. I'm also very encouraged by the initiatives for each of our business units. We are having a strong run in small commercial and we have even greater aspirations.","Our formula, based on customer value and innovation continue to separate us from the pack. This year, we will roll out enhancements to spectrum, our business owner\u2019s package policy, introduce new online services, and investing capabilities to better support distribution partners, as they pursue new marketing strategies and greater efficiencies for these small accounts.","Our technology and service operations make us a go-to carrier and our investments will keep us on the leading edge of this market. In Middle-Market, we have a number of new initiatives in play to compete more broadly in the market. First, we are introducing a new underwriting cockpit that improves speed, support and data-driven insights for our team of professionals. Underwriters will be better equipped than ever to smartly compete for business.","Second, we will begin deploying additional underwriting resources in targeted regions where we see new business upside. Working closely with our agents and brokers is critical to success and this demands local presence. And the third example of our focus is the build out of additional risk management professionals, specifically in engineering and loss control. We see this skill set is crucial for enabling our progress in new market sectors.","These types of investments give us the opportunity to grow our middle-market business, not by competing solely on price but by bringing our strong value proposition to a larger share of the marketplace.","Within Specialty Commercial, our major initiative will be leveraging the expertise of our financial products business. We now have a line, the strategy and management of financial products more closely with our Small Commercial and Middle-Market businesses.","In addition, we continue to compete in the public D&O market. These teams will partner on product development and automation to create differentiated offering across commercial lines. We expect our overall commercial lines margin to remain generally stable with an underlying combined ratio between $89.5 million and $91.5 million.","We will continue to seek improvement from a few pockets of lagging results such as commercial auto where we\u2019ll be aggressive with price increases and underwriting actions. In other well-performing lines, we will manage our pricing strategy to address long-term loss cost trends in individual account performance.","We believe that our leadership and small commercial investments in Middle-Market provide the opportunity for profitable growth as we better deploy the capabilities we\u2019ve developed. In personal lines, we will bring even greater focus to our AARP direct business, with new product analytics and improved marketing test and learn capabilities, we\u2019re systematically improving response and conversion.","We\u2019re also continuing to refine our AARP through agent\u2019s offering resulting in somewhat slower topline growth. We continue to be very excited about the quality of this business and believe that we can develop deeper partnerships with high-quality agents appointed for this program. Excluding catastrophes and prior year development, we expect the underlying combined ratio to be between 89% and 91%, a modest improvement in margins as we continue to focus on rate adequacy.","In Group Benefits, we are very pleased to be positioned for topline growth with our book of business performing well. Renewal rates on business in the first quarter 2015 are very strong as is new sales activity. New sales with 1\/1\/15 effective date are up over 60% versus the year ago. And our win backs cases the last several years ago have now decided to come back to us, continue to be impressive and especially gratifying. Our service in claim capabilities are the reason.","We truly have a differentiated experience and we\u2019re continuing to build on those capabilities. First, as we expand on the voluntary market, we\u2019re making additional investments in our products and capabilities to provide an even better experience in an increasingly consumer-driven market.","Second, we\u2019re investing in an enhanced producer analytics and increased fuel resources aligned with targeted growth markets. We expect our Group Benefit\u2019s core earnings margin to be relatively stable between 5 and 5.5 with underwriting performance helping to offset declines in investment income.","Overall across all of our businesses, we\u2019re focused on computing in an aggressive and disciplined manner. We believe that we have an opportunity to grow our business through smart product expansion and deeper local partnerships with our distributors. We have great scales in talents that can be deployed more widely without pushing beyond the boundaries of sound underwriting and risk selection.","In summary, we\u2019re very pleased with our progress in 2014 and excited to extend our reach in 2015.","Let me now turn the call over to Beth.","Beth Bombara","Thank you, Doug. I\u2019m going to briefly cover the other businesses in key 2015 business metrics before turning to the capital outlook for Talcott and the holding company. Mutual Funds core earnings rose 17% in 2014, primarily due to an increase in fees from higher average assets under management, excluding Talcott related funds.","As noted on slide 19, long-term fund performance remains solid with 64% of Mutual Funds outperforming their peers over the last five years. For the year, Mutual Fund sales were stable at $15.2 billion as a growth in equity fund sales was offset by reduced fixed income sale.","During the year, we exited certain types of funds and transferred some funds to our investment operations, which resulted in negative Mutual Fund net flow of $1.4 billion. Adjusted for these items, net flows were about breakeven for the year.","In 2015, we expect modest growth in core earnings as growth in Mutual Funds AUM will be partially offset by the continued runoff of funds included in Talcott\u2019s VA product. Talcott\u2019s core earnings summarized on slide 20 rose 5% for the year much better than originally expected due to higher limited partnership income and lower contract holder initiative cost.","Contract counts continue to decline down year-over-year by 13% for variable annuities and 18% for fixed annuities. There has only been a modest decline in institutional covered life as the majority of the block consists of longer duration structured settlements and pension-related terminal funding liability.","In 2015, we expect Talcott\u2019s core earnings to decline about 15% to 20% to a range of $340 million to $370 million. Almost half of this decline is due to lower projected limited partnership returns, which were 10% in 2014 versus 6% projected in 2015. Excluding the excess 2014 return in limited partnership income, core earnings are projected to be down around 10% in 2015 consistent with the runoff of the annuity blocks somewhat offset by lower expenses.","Turning to the corporate segment on slide 21, 2014 core losses were about flat to the prior year. The 2015 core loss outlook of $235 million to $245 million is slightly better than 2014 due to lower interest expense from plan debt repayments in 2015. During 2015, we expect to spend up to $1 billion for debt management, which will help us move towards our long-term target of debt-to-total cap in the low 20s. Rating agency adjusted debt-to-total cap was 28.4% at December 31, 2014 or 26% pro formas for the projected 2015 repayments.","Turning to investments on slide 22. We remain pleased with the credit performance of our portfolio with only $59 million of impairments in 2014, compared with $73 million in 2013. Investment yields, however, remained a challenge due to market conditions. Our portfolio yields have held up reasonably well in the low-interest rate environment, averaging 4.1% this year, excluding limited partnership or down about 10 basis points.","Our 2015 outlook which is based on market yield curve projects a modest decline in the portfolio yield due to lower reinvestment rate. Our outlook for annualized P&C only pretax portfolio yield is 3.9%, including limited partnership.","Turning to our capital management plan. Through January 30, 2015, we have repurchased approximately $1.9 billion totaling 52 million shares for an average purchase price of $36.46 under the $2.775 billion share repurchase program and we paid $200 million of debt maturities on the $1.2 billion debt management program. Our core earnings outlook includes the impact of the completion of both programs in 2015 although the precise number of repurchased shares will depend on market prices.","To summarize, as detailed on slide 24, core earnings in 2014 rose 9% to $1.5 billion which was the high end of the 2014 outlook. Core earnings per diluted share rose 16% to $3.36 due to the increase in core earnings and the impact of the capital management program. The core ROE rose to 8.4%.","Book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI at December 31, 2014, rose 4% to $40.71 from year end 2013, largely due to the capital management program. Shareholders\u2019 equity excluding AOCI declined 6% to $17.8 billion as the contribution of net income was more than offset by share repurchases and dividends.","Our consolidated 2015 outlook, which, you can see on slide 25, is for core earnings of $1.55 billion to $1.65 billion, which at the midpoint is 7% above 2014 results once you exclude favorable items in 2014, such as CATs and limited partnership returns both better than outlook as well as unfavorable prior accident year development. On a per share basis, including an estimate of the impact of share repurchases during 2015, our earnings per diluted share would be approximately $3.65 to $3.85.","Slide 25 lists several of the key business metrics for 2015, most of which we have already covered. Based on our 2015 outlook, we estimate an increase in core ROE to about 8.7% to 9.2% compared with 8.4% in 2014. As you know, one of our principal financial goals is to increase our ROE. We are frequently asked about our target ROE and how much we can improve ROE each year. As you can see, we have made a lot of progress over the last few years and we expect an additional 30 to 80 basis points of improvement in 2015. Our goal is to generate an ROE above our cost of equity capital, which, based on the current data and market factors, is about 10.6% today.","As you can see on slide 26, our P&C, Group Benefits, and Mutual Funds ROEs have been improving nicely. Note that the business ROEs on the slide are unlevered, so we do not include any debt allocation or interest expense. The unlevered P&C, Group Benefits, and Mutual Funds ROE has risen from 10.6% in 2013 to 11.2% in 2014 and we project additional improvement in 2015. These levels exceed our current cost of capital of 8.4%, including debt, indicating that we are creating shareholder value in those businesses.","The Talcott ROE, however, is much lower and reduces our consolidated ROE to below our cost of capital. However, as you can see on this slide, our one-year data has declined from almost 2 at the beginning of 2013 to about 1.25 today. The reduction in the size and risk of Talcott is the principal reason that the data has declined and is an important contributor to our progress in reducing our cost of capital. Nevertheless, our data remains higher than other P&C companies, which range from 0.6 to 1.15.","We have made a great deal of progress in driving ROE growth and reducing our cost of capital. We're optimistic about continuing to make progress with the goal of generating ROEs above our cost of capital.","Now I would like to turn to our capital outlook and specifically our views of excess capital in Talcott. As we have stated, we have been evaluating the appropriate capitalization for Talcott taking into consideration its improved risk profile with the sale of Japan. Our previous standard was to maintain a minimum of at least 325% RBC in a stress scenario. We have now updated that to a 200% minimum RBC in a stress scenario. Of course, in more favorable markets the actual RBC levels will be much higher.","Slide 27 displays the allocation of Talcott\u2019s $5.6 billion of statutory surplus at December 2014. As you can see, $1.2 billion is allocated to VA, $2.2 billion is allocated to institutional and fixed annuities, and $700 million to other which includes reinsurance credit exposure on divested businesses in our COLI\/BOLI book. That leaves $1.5 million of surplus that we consider today to be accessed in the stress scenario, in which we intend to take out of Talcott in stages. Last week, the first dividend of $500 million was paid to the holding company. We expect an additional $500 million in the second half of 2015 and the remaining $500 million in early 2016.","Slide 28 shows the capital margin in Talcott under base, stress, and favorable scenarios, the detail of which are in the appendix. All of these scenarios assume we take the $1.5 billion in dividend by early 2016. Assuming the stress scenario occurred in 2015, we estimate remaining capital margin at the end of 2016 of about $400 million, which roughly equates to 240% RBC, comfortably above the 200% level.","Slide 29 provides a reconciliation of capital margins in the different scenarios. The VA hedging program helps protect surplus in down markets. In fact, the significant portion of the approximately net $800 million negative impact from VA in the stress scenario results from the reduction of fee income that would result from lower asset levels. Talcott\u2019s major source of capital margin impact in the stress scenario comes from institutional and fixed annuities due to investment related impacts and the impact of interest rates.","Finally before turning to your questions, I wanted to summarize our holding company cash flow for 2014 and our outlook for 2015. During 2014, the holding company had about $2.9 billion in positive cash flow, including the Japan sales proceeds. During 2015, we expect dividends of about $1.9 billion. I would note that our projection for P&C dividend is lower in 2015. Having accelerated dividends in 2014, we do not have ordinary P&C dividend capacity until the third quarter of 2015.","During 2015 we expect to use approximately $2.6 billion for holding company obligations and the capital management plan, resulting in net holding company cash and short-term investments of approximately $1.8 billion at year-end 2015. This is a very strong base that positions us to deploy capital accretively for shareholders in 2016 and beyond.","2014 was an outstanding year for The Hartford with significant improvement in margins in P&C and Group Benefits, continued net flow improvement in Mutual Funds, and a substantial reduction in risk at Talcott. We are focused on growing core earnings in 2015, offsetting the decline in Talcott earnings with growth in the other businesses. In addition, Talcott is generating excess capital allowing us to deploy capital in more accretive ways to drive ROE improvement. We look forward to updating you on our progress in 2015 to grow both ROE and book value per share to drive shareholder value creation.","I will now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you, Beth. We have about 30 minutes for Q&A. And as usual, we would appreciate it if people could limit themselves to one question and a follow-up and then requeue so that others have opportunity to ask the question in the time we have available. Tiffany, could you please give the Q&A instructions","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open.","Brian Meredith","Thanks. A couple questions here. First, for Doug, just curious with the underlying combined ratio improvement both in personal and commercial, how much of that is going to come from expense initiatives versus loss ratios still improving here given where rates are in line with loss trend?","Doug Elliot","Let met tackle the Personal Lines first and then we will come back to Commercial. We still have very consistent approach in Personal Lines and we will be addressing loss trends through pricing in a very similar manner as we are in 2014. So I look at the strategy in 2015 with Personal Lines is very consistent with 2014.","On the Commercial Lines side, obviously an evolving environment, and as we talked to you on this call and shared our numbers last night you know that the fourth quarter was down a little bit on the pricing side versus third quarter. So we\u2019re being thoughtful about how 2015 will play out. We\u2019ve got a number of strategies in different places.","But much of our improvement is coming, number one, from the fact that our written prices in 2014 will earn their way into 2015. And I would say that much of the expense work we\u2019re doing is being invested back inside the platform. So most of the work and most of what you see inside the combined ratio will be pricing and underwriting driven.","Brian Meredith","Okay. And then the second question, just curious on capital management guidance here and you make the comment, the additional $500 million from Talcott, you\u2019re expecting to look to use that for debt paid. I\u2019m just curious, why that decision particularly given that debt capital is incredibly inexpensive right now? Why would you kind of make the decision to kind of continue to pay down your debt?","Chris Swift","Hey, Brian. It\u2019s Chris. I\u2019ll ask Beth comment too, but I think what we said along is that this two-year plan is the balanced plan of equity and debt. If you look closely at our language, I mean, we have allocated up to billion dollars of debt prepayment this year, half of that is just maturing debt and the other half is what I\u2019ll call, optionality to really look at our debts that continue to drive down. Basically, our debt to cap ratio is as about described. Beth, would you add anything else?","Beth Bombara","Yeah. I just had a couple things. First of all, I think you referred to the $500 million dividend from Talcott being the same thing as the $500 million of debt reduction and they're not related, so I would separate the two.","As Chris said, we announced our debt management plan last year and you may recall that in the fourth quarter we had anticipated using up to the $500 million to reduce debt and we decided to take a pause because interest rates had decreased at that time and they\u2019re still low.","And so we\u2019ll continue over the course of '15 to look at opportunistically what makes sense for us to use that $500 million in a way that we think is in the most benefit to our shareholders.","Brian Meredith","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR. Your line is open.","Randy Binner","Hey, good morning. Thanks. I wanted to touch on -- I\u2019m trying to understand the pace of the runoff and particularly through the trend that we\u2019re seeing in VA surrenders. So that came in, I think, at 11% in the fourth quarter and trended down throughout the year, but the contract count for VA was down about 13% for the year. And so just trying to think about what\u2019s the right way for us to think of how these liabilities runoff, is it more that full year result? Or is it something that could trend down as a single-digit as we look to 2015?","Beth Bombara","Thanks, Randy. It\u2019s Beth. So a couple things I would say on that. As you know, we did have some initiatives in 2014, which impacted that VA count coming down, which is why you see the 13%. And as you point out, as we went into the fourth quarter, we did see a reduction. And our estimate for 10% for next year we feel very good about when we look at sort of historical trends and the fact that we don't have a plan in a significant initiative in '15 at this point.","So as the year progresses, if we determine that there is something that we would do, we\u2019d obviously update you. But we think right now from all that we can see in our analysis that a 10% is as a good place for us to plan for '15.","Randy Binner","Okay. And then this 10% I know initiatives and then on the fixed and institutional blocks, is there any anything initiative-wise or transaction-wise that would make sense there? It seems like maybe the window for transferring those kinds of risks to some institutions is not as open as it was in last couple of years. Any color you can provide on that side?","Beth Bombara","Yeah. So I think about it in two pieces that we have our fixed annuity block. And again, the surrender rate or contract decreases that we highlighted for the year were impacted by some of the initiatives that we had in that block and we\u2019ll continue to look to see if that makes sense to do in the future.","As it relates to the institutional block as we discussed before, given where rates are at this time we don't really see a transaction for that book to really be economical for us since we\u2019d be basically locking into this very low level. If the interest rate environment changes as we said in the past, we\u2019ll of course look to see if there's something more economical that we could do at that book.","Randy Binner","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel with Sterne, Agee. Your line is open.","John Nadel","Good morning, everybody. A couple of quick questions for you. So if I think about -- and Beth, I\u2019m glad that you sort of commented on the $500 million from Talcott being above what was already embedded in your two-year capital management plan. So if I could get it the question maybe a little bit differently, I think you're targeting in the holding company cash levels by the end of 2015 at around $1.8 billion. I guess my question is what\u2019s your target longer-term in terms of how much cash you want to keep at the parent on an ongoing basis?","Beth Bombara","Sure. Thanks. So when we look at the cash at the holding company, we typically start with looking at what our annual expenditure is for covering holding company obligations, so interest in shareholder dividends, which again you can see on our slide is about $600 million for '15. So we typically talk about a target in sort of the 1.5 times range for that and then of course we always want to have I think a little bit of cushion, but that\u2019s kind of how we look at that.","John Nadel","Okay. So it's fair to say, you've got a pretty sizable cushion versus that level?","Beth Bombara","Yeah. As I said in my comment, I think ending at $1.8 billion is a very strong position. Again, that doesn't include the $500 million that we anticipate to take out of Talcott in 2016.","John Nadel","Yeah.","Beth Bombara","That positions us very well as we head into '16.","John Nadel","Okay. And then just a bigger picture question, given where rates are and you guys I think are obviously taking that into account in some of your outlook here investment income related and other. But with all the mix shift in the company, particularly the reduction in the risk and size of Talcott? Can you give us an update on how we should think about the longer-term earnings pressure and maybe balance sheet risk from a sustain sort of 2% or sub 2% tenure environment?","Beth Bombara","Yeah. So if you think about the projections that we have for year and maybe what I\u2019ll do is, I\u2019ll just talk more about our P&C book. If we look at our outlook right now for \u201915 and if rates sort of remained at current levels and didn't follow the forward curve.","For \u201815 we probably see a very modest impact kind of in the $7 million to $10 million range. Obviously, if they stayed there longer and you go into \u201916, you start to see a compounding effect of that.","John Nadel","Yeah.","Beth Bombara","I think the counterpoint to that though is what would happen on P&C pricing. So there is, obviously, the NII impact, but then there is also just what does that mean for the broader environment, if we were to remain in a low interest rate environment. But that kind of gives you a sense for the P&C portfolio.","John Nadel","And then related to Talcott or Group, maybe if anything we should be thinking about, I mean, discount rate on the Group disability side or spread pressures within Talcott?","Beth Bombara","Yeah. So, again, if I look at that same measure sort of putting in all in HIG, which would include the Group and Talcott piece. And again, if rates remain flat from kind of where they are now, that $7 million to $10 million impact rises to $16 million-ish.","So, again, there is obviously some impact on that. I don't have a breakout between Talcott and Group. And obviously, Group, I would say there again -- there is a pricing dynamic that would also have to be taken into consideration.","John Nadel","Okay. That\u2019s really\u2026","Chris Swift","John, its Chris. The only\u2026 ","John Nadel","Yeah.","Chris Swift","Just to offer from a Group Benefits side, I mean, we\u2019ve been discounting reserves for \u201914 and we plan in \u201915 in the 3.5% range.","John Nadel","Okay.","Chris Swift","So I think our liability structures are already reflecting that lower interest rate environment.","John Nadel","Really helpful. So we are looking at maybe 1% earnings pressure from sustained low rates at least for one year. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jay Cohen","Yes. Thank you. Just, I guess, more of a business question. I was interested to hear that you are -- through the AARP relationship going to be selling small commercial business? I am wondering, do you have any sense of what percentage of the Hart members own small businesses, how bigger population are we talking about here?","Doug Elliot","Jay, good morning, its Doug. We are aware that there are more than a million members that have small businesses. These -- I would characterize them largely as micro small businesses Jay, employees, less than five. But there is a sizeable component. I think it will take us time to work at that but we are excited about the opportunity and look forward to partnering with AARP and broader ways going forward.","Jay Cohen","That\u2019s great. My other questions are answered. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Your line is open.","Jay Gelb","Thank you. First, I just want to clarify on a previous statement from Beth, that $500 million of flexibility to repurchase additional debt? Did you say that could also go into share buybacks?","Beth Bombara","No. I did not say that, what I said was that, we had year marked $500 million and that we would look at through the course of \u201915 when the appropriate time is for us to use that for our debt management.","Jay Gelb","Okay. The other point I wanted to come back to is, I believe after second quarter there was some outlook with regard to ROE potentials and previously it was low 9% in 2015 and I believe 30 to 50 basis point expansion in both 2016 and \u201917? So that prior guidance would have gotten you right around 10% in 2016, is that still a reasonable expectation?","Chris Swift","Jay, it\u2019s Chris, I\u2019ll ask Beth also to comment. I think some of those comments you are attributing to me. So I still see and buy them, but I would say that, I think, the headwinds were just a little bit more than six, seven months ago honestly, low rates, P&C pricing cycles gotten a little more challenging as Doug and I\u2019ve been saying.","So it's not beyond, the realm of possibility, but it is a higher degree of difficulty as we sit here today. And if you really think about it, I -- once we get beyond \u201915, which again, we -- I think given fairly tight guidance, as far as ROE. I think then we are in that 20 to 40 basis point annual improvement from there. So, Beth, would you add any other color?","Beth Bombara","No. I think you said it very well. As we talked about before, we had -- we did -- we do expect to see in \u201815 a larger increase than that 20 to 40 that Chris just mentioned, because of the capital management actions that are working in from the sale of Japan, but I think that\u2019s our reasonable expectation.","Jay Gelb","Beyond 2015 would you expect the capital management mix to be more weighted towards buybacks as opposed to evenly split in \u201815 between share repurchase and debt pay down?","Chris Swift","Jay, if you give us a little time, we\u2019ll talk about that in due course. But right now we are focused on, obviously, executing the plan here in \u201915 and when we get to really developing the \u201816 plan, we\u2019ll give you views. But we've always said balanced, so balance could mean within a range. But also keep in mind sort of debt-to-equity ratios that we want to keep them balanced too.","Jay Gelb","Makes sense. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Erik Bass","Hi. Good morning. Excuse me. And thank you for providing the updated Talcott stat capital breakdown, I guess in addition to the stat capital, do you believe there's a level of redundant reserves at Talcott that could be freed overtime?","Beth Bombara","Yeah. So, obviously, there are reserves that we hold on especially in our institutional and fixed book for things that impact interest rates. And so when you look at our margins in favorable scenarios and baselines, you could expect to see some decline there but nothing that we are expecting sort of in any significant manner in the near term.","Erik Bass","Okay. And could you provide an update on the present value of the expected earnings from Talcott which I\u2019d think you\u2019d given probably most recently at the end of last year?","Beth Bombara","I think you are talking about our MCV analysis, yes. So again where we stand today with the VA book, we would estimate that the MCV is still very positive and about 1.1 billion at the end of December.","Erik Bass","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Gallagher with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is open.","Thomas Gallagher","Good morning. Just -- Beth just a few points of clarification. So the new news we are getting here today on the whole capital management plan is the extra funds coming out of Talcott. And just remind me though the \u201814 and \u201815 estimates for buybacks and dividend -- and debt repayment that hasn't changed at all, right. Like so the \u201814, \u201815 total capital return plan, is it same as it was but you're taking more money out of Talcott. And so my question really is if I'm right on that what are those funds being used for, is it just more money sitting at the holding company?","Chris Swift","Tom, it\u2019s, Chris let me start, and then Beth could share. I think you got the fact pattern right. So the only new news here is the -- we\u2019ve defined the amount of excess capital in Talcott at the end of 2014. And we plan to take that out basically over the next 12 to 14 months. As we really head into the second half of \u201815, we\u2019ll work on call it what's next related to our capital management program.","But I think what we are trying to convey and hopefully you see it, is we will have additional flexibility particularly as the cash comes out of Talcott to think about what is the most accretive use of that capital going forward. But we\u2019ve really haven't pinpoint it saying exactly, what we are going to do. But that's what we are going to work on and communicate it in the second half of \u201815.","Beth Bombara","Yeah. And then the only thing I would just add just to be -- perfectly clear is you are correct, we are not making any changes to the plan that we announced in July that we are currently executing on.","Thomas Gallagher","Okay that's\u2026","Chris Swift","And just one last point, Tom, do you mind -- and just philosophically, I just want to be crystal clear that there really hasn't been any change in our philosophy, and how we think about excess capital. You\u2019ve heard us say it before and we reiterated here. I mean we are going to continue to be balanced with that in equity, paydowns and repurchases. We still think it's a good use of our capital to buy in shares. We\u2019ll always have an appropriate dividend policy geared towards growing our operating earnings in P&C and Group Benefits.","And then we\u2019ve said repeatedly, I mean, we are investing in our capabilities and investing for growth and expansion as we go forward, really with the eye of creating additional revenue streams that create recurring value for shareholders. So that\u2019s how philosophically we were approaching our excess capital.","Thomas Gallagher","That makes sense to me, Christy. I guess my follow-up is simply -- of the $1.5 billion plan dividends out of Talcott, it sounds like you\u2019re describing that as the excess capital, that you believe exists in that block. But then it also generates earnings of, I guess roughly $300 million a year. What about the extra $600 million or so of capital that you should get from retained earnings in that block? Should we also expect that, so it would be $2.1 billion all in or is the $1.5 million also contemplate the money that's being earned their?","Beth Bombara","Yeah, Tom. It\u2019s Beth. I would think about this way. So again the $1.5 billion, we defined by the valuating the actual tax rate surplus at 12\/31\/14. And again and showing that we would have adequate resources in a stress. So that $1.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2014, would obviously have taken into consideration any previous earnings that we generated on the book.","But you are right as we think about it going forward to the extent a stress doesn\u2019t happen, and each year we generate statutory surplus as we evaluate our statutory position at the end of any given year, we could anticipate that there could be upside to that if we generate the earnings.","I would say sitting here today and looking at just a lot of the pluses and the minuses that happen with statutory surplus, I would guide you to think about a range of $200 million to $300 million because it does sometimes bounce around a little bit for variety of items. But again that would be the something we\u2019d evaluate at the end of \u201815, because obviously if a stress doesn\u2019t happen, you have one more year of earnings, one more year of the book running off and then you\u2019d kind of evaluate it from there.","Thomas Gallagher","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel with Janney Capital. Your line is open.","Bob Glasspiegel","Good morning, Hartford. Life analyst, I shouldn\u2019t be dominating. Doug, I got a PC question for you. Commercial auto, you said you are raising rates. That's a source of sort of margin improvement in 2015. Where is the sort of underwriting base that you\u2019re operating from a net line and how much are your raising rates?","Doug Elliot","Bob, good morning. We\u2019ve been disappointed in our commercial auto performance, primarily in the middle market but also in small commercial as well. This year, back half of the year, our pricing has been in a mid-single to higher single-digit range and I expect that to continue, maybe even strengthen a bit as we move into the early half of 2015, so disappointed. Feel like we have some very strong initiatives, both on the pricing side and also on the underwriting side to address it, looking for progress in \u201915 for sure. ","Bob Glasspiegel","Okay. And, Beth, just a clarification on your answer to John on sensitivity of Talcott to interest rates here. You\u2019ve talked a little bit about earnings in general terms but how different of a presentation on capital, which you\u2019ve been given if the 10-year was 50 basis point higher where it was at the beginning of the year?","Beth Bombara","Yes. So we -- obviously in the scenarios that we show for a stress we are, stressing interest rates in that scenario. And you can see kind of the impact that we see from capital that comes from that. So, I think that as we evaluated the $1.5 billion of access today, I think we appropriately took into consideration additional stress in interest rates.","Bob Glasspiegel","So -- I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t quip all the stresses. The current environment is stressing it or its 50 basis points from here which stress it?","Beth Bombara","So the stress scenario, as we outlined in the appendix, would have the 10-year at the end of 2016, I believe and like the 1.6 range. So, again, that would have been lower in \u201915, as you go through \u201916. I don\u2019t know if it was exactly the same sensitivity that you are highlighting but that\u2019s how we look at the stress.","Bob Glasspiegel","Got you. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman with Balyasny. Your line is open.","Ian Gutterman","Hi. Thank you. I guess I wanted to clarify a couple things. First on the P&C dividend, if you are setting off ordinary capacity till Q3, what stops you in Q3 from taking a full year's worth of ordinary dividend, why does it have to be much less in earnings?","Beth Bombara","Yes. So the way to think about it is, if you look at the dividend over \u201914 and \u201915, we typically take out about $800 million a year. And so what we did in \u201914 is we just frontloaded on that dividend that we normally would've taken out in \u201915. So over the two years, we kind of get back to our normal level.","Ian Gutterman","Okay. But P&C start excess capital at the end of 2014, right. So why couldn\u2019t they take a full year of earnings in \u201915?","Beth Bombara","So typically the way we managed the P&C balance sheet and making -- ensuring that we are providing enough capital for the P&C business to continue to invest in its operation. We target annual dividends of $800 million each year.","Ian Gutterman","Right.","Beth Bombara","And so that\u2019s again how we looked at it.","Ian Gutterman","Okay. And then just quickly on Talcott, sort of the stress scenario. Am I remembering correctly? In the past, I think you\u2019ve talked about the Holdco cushion being for the stress scenario. Now that Talcott on its own can handle its own stress scenario, do we need to think of any Holdco capital being held for a stress, or is that really held for something other than a Talcott stress?","Beth Bombara","Yes. So as we have said, going all the way back to April of 2013, we see that the capital within the Talcott entity is sufficient to handle a stress. So we are not looking to fund any deficit with holding company cash. And so when we think about the holding company requirements, we tend to focus on the actual obligations for interest and dividend. And then as I said, to have some buffer but obviously much less than what would have been needed in the past.","Ian Gutterman","Got it. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Frost with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Scott Frost","Hey. Can you hear me, okay?","Chris Swift","Yes, we can.","Doug Elliot","Yeah. We can, Scott.","Scott Frost","Okay. Thank you. Thanks for taking my call. Just to talk about the -- thanks for clarification on the debt management program. This is the same issue announced in mid last year. So, $0.5 billion is potentially available for tenders and over market repurchases that -- just to clarify that's correct, right?","Beth Bombara","Yes. That is correct.","Scott Frost","Okay. Could you tell us how you think about junior sub, also the Glen Meadows in terms of attractiveness to your capital structure? Does it factor into considerations in terms of ratings? Also agencies have talked about improvement, I think in P&C operations is one catalyst. Is that all -- is it your sense that they also are -- have already taken into account this plan to capital management that you\u2019ve talked about?","Beth Bombara","Yes. I will handle the second part first. So, obviously our plan that we have for capital management we share with rating agencies, so they're very aware of what our intentions are and expectation for this plan. As it relates to other resources that we have like Glen Meadows, we obviously look at that as additional capital, that we would have available to us. And as we get -- go through \u201915 and in \u201916, we\u2019ll take a look at what that means for us and how we might use that capital.","Scott Frost","Okay. So just to clarify, I mean, your capital management plan, is it something the agencies would have to see you execute before they would act in your sense? And again with your capital position being the way it is, do you need those capital securities really just attractive from a rate perspective and are you sensitive to serve loss on debt extinguishment or is it more of an interest coverage issue that you're working toward?","Beth Bombara","It\u2019s kind of probably a little bit of all of the above of what you\u2019ve asked.","Scott Frost","Okay.","Beth Bombara","First of all, it relates to rating agencies. We have had a record, a track record now for a couple years of laying out a plan and executing on that. We continue to share with them our expectation and all of that is considered as they look at evaluating the ratings of the various entities. And as it relates to just overall debt management, we\u2019re very sensitive to balancing all of those needs.","So we are looking at reducing our debt-to-capital ratios as Chris and I have talked about. But we\u2019re also very sensitive to looking at interest coverage and want to make sure that we\u2019re making the right trade-off there. So part of the reason why we held off of a bit on using that $500 million that we've been talking about is we felt the charge that we\u2019d have to take given the current interest rate environment wasn\u2019t a good trade-off. So we\u2019ll continue to evaluate that as we move forward and as rate change.","Scott Frost","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","There are no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Sabra Purtill.","Sabra Purtill","Thank you Tiffany and we\u2019d like to thank you all for joining us today and your interest in The Hartford. Please note that Chris and Beth will be at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Insurance Conference in New York City on February 11th at 8 AM. We look forward to seeing you there, hopefully with no snow storm. And in the meantime, please feel free to contact either Sean or myself by phone or e-mail if you have any follow-up questions on our financial results and outlook. Thank you and have a good day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
