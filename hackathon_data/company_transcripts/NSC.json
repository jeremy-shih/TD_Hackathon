[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. ","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Michael Hostutler from Norfolk Southern, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, you may now begin.","Michael Hostutler ","Thank you, and good afternoon. Before we begin today's call, I would like to mention a few items.

It's my pleasure to welcome you to our first quarter 2012 earnings conference call. With me today are several members of our senior team, including Don Seale, our Chief Marketing Officer; Mark Manion, our Chief Operating Officer; and Jim Squires, our Chief Financial Officer, all of whom you will hear from this afternoon.","I am very pleased to report that Norfolk Southern had an excellent first quarter, setting records in most financial and operating metrics. Our results included across the board, all-time first quarter highs for revenues, income from railway operations, net income and earnings per share. And the operating ratio of 73.3% equaled our best-ever first quarter performance.","Beginning with the top line, revenues for the first quarter rose 6% to $2.8 billion. Volumes were up 1%, notwithstanding a 12% decline in coal traffic. The overall volume increase was led by double-digit growth in automotive, as well as metals and construction. Revenue per unit rose by an average of 5%.","On the expense side, a strong focus on efficiency, combined with mild weather, resulted in record income from railway operations of $745 million, which then translated into net income of $410 million and earnings per share of $1.23. These results enable the first quarter dividend increase of 9%, a first quarter record operating cash flow exceeding $1 billion and first quarter share repurchases of $400 million.","Stepping back a little, the real story for the quarter was how the diversity of our franchise, along with a network that is performing at a high service level, helped us to deliver these excellent results. ","As always, Don will take you through all of the moving parts of our business. Mark will give you a look at our key operating metrics and the impact of our increased velocity and reduced terminal dwell times. And Jim will walk you through all of the numbers.","I'll return with some closing remarks before we take questions. But now, let me go ahead and turn it over to Don.","Donald W. Seale","Thank you, Wick, and good afternoon, everyone. During the first quarter, our broad portfolio of markets generated record first quarter revenue of $2.8 billion, up $169 million or 6% versus first quarter 2011, despite a weaker coal market. This included an all-time revenue record within Merchandise of $1.5 billion, up $177 million or 13% over last year. Intermodal revenues set a first quarter record of $527 million, up $42 million or 9% over 2011, while Coal revenue for the quarter was down 6%, primarily due to volume declines.","Overall yield increased 5% and volume grew by 1% with 5% gains in both intermodal and merchandise, which more than offset a 12% decline in Coal shipments.","Of the $169 million in revenue growth during the quarter, more than 80% came as a result of higher revenue per unit, including pricing gains and fuel surcharge revenue. Higher volume accounted for the remainder of the revenue increase.","Breaking out yield, the next slide shows we achieved an all-time high revenue per unit of $1,611 up $80 per unit or 5% versus first quarter last year, with increases in all business groups. Merchandise set an all-time record of $2,549 per unit, up $185 or 8% versus last year. Three of the business units within merchandise, metals and construction, paper and chemicals also posted all-time highs. Revenue per unit within Coal was up $125 or 6% over first quarter 2011, and intermodal was up $22 or 3% in the quarter.","During the quarter, we obtained pricing in excess of rail inflation to support balanced investment across our network and appropriate returns for our investors.","Now turning to volume for the quarter. Despite the challenges in Coal due primarily to weak electricity demand, the strength of our intermodal and merchandise networks drove volume up by 20,000 loads or 1% for the quarter. Intermodal gains came mainly from the domestic segment, up 13%, which led to a 5% increase in total intermodal volume. Merchandise volume also grew by 5% for the quarter on the strength of automotive and steel, as well as higher volumes associated with shale oil and gas drilling.","Now drilling down into our major business sectors, starting with Coal. Coal revenue for the quarter of $766 million was down $50 million or 6% due primarily to a 12% decline in volume. Notably, the majority of our coal traffic moves in unit train service. And in that regard, there was approximately a one-to-one relationship in terms of reduced crew starts and locomotives compared to the volume decline. An improvement in revenue per unit of 6% helped partially offset the effect of weaker volumes.","As depicted on the next slide, utility coal loads were down 17% during the quarter. This was the warmest first quarter on record according to NOAA, with records dating as far back as 1895. You'll note that heating degree days within the NS service region were down 27% for the quarter as compared to 2011, and also down 26% compared to the normal range. March, in particular, was a very warm month, officially the warmest on record in the contiguous U.S. And heating degree days during March alone were down by 47% versus last year.","Based on recent generation trends within our service region, we estimate that weak electricity demand accounted for roughly 75% of the volume decline in our utility market, while competition due to natural gas had less of an impact.","Coal burn at Eastern utilities was down over 28% through the first 2 months of the year, primarily as a result of this very mild weather pattern and competition from 10-year lows in natural gas prices. Within our utility network, volumes to our longer haul Southern utility plants were down 24%, while loads to Northern utilities were down 11%. Higher demand in our domestic metallurgical market, which was up 19% for the quarter, helped to partially offset the decline in utility coal. Domestic metallurgical volumes were up in response to increased domestic steel production, which was up 7% in the quarter.","Volume within our export market was down 10% due to the return of Australian supply and weaker global demand for steel. World steel production, excluding North America, was down 3% for the first 2 months of the quarter, driven primarily by weakness in the European market and weaker Chinese production in January. ","On the plus side, we handled over 600,000 tons of new export steam coal business during the first quarter. Low domestic demand for steam coal and excess inventories led producers to opt to ship thermal coal to overseas markets. And finally, we handled over 18,000 loads of industrial coal in the quarter, which was up 3% due to new business gains.","Concluding my comments on Coal, Slide 9 shows the relative differences and length of haul among our various coal market segments. Export met coal moves on average, for example, approximately 480 miles, while domestic met moves about 40% fewer miles. Conversely, in the utility segment, coal to our Southern utilities averages nearly 200 more miles per load than coal to our Northern utilities. Obviously, changes in volume between the market segments will impact revenue per car for coal in our network.","Now turning next to our intermodal network. Revenue in the quarter reached $527 million, up $42 million or 9% over first quarter of 2011, driven by 5% higher intermodal volume and a 3% increase in revenue per unit. As depicted on Slide 11, the volume gains in intermodal came mainly from our domestic market, which was up 13% or nearly 44,000 loads for the quarter due primarily to highway conversions. Our international segment posted a 3% decline for the quarter, as volume reductions associated with Maersk were partially offset by trade growth. And finally, increased demand for truckload services pushed Triple Crown volume up 4% for the quarter.","As volumes within our domestic network strengthened, so did our efficiency. As shown on the next slide, we experienced marked improvement in the stacking of domestic containers during the quarter, a metric which highlights loading efficiency and equipment utilization. During the quarter, 86% of all domestic containers in our network moved on stack cars, a 9-point improvement as compared to the first quarter of 2011, creating additional capacity across the network. And total intermodal crew starts went up by 2% on a 5% increase in volume.","Wrapping up our discussion of the business groups, we'll now turn to our merchandise sector. Revenue for the merchandise group in the quarter was $1.5 billion, up $177 million or 13% over last year. This is an all-time revenue record for our merchandise sector. Our first quarter record was established for metals and construction and new all-time high records were achieved for chemicals and agriculture as well. The 13% revenue increase in merchandise was driven by an 8% gain in revenue per unit and a 5% increase in volume for the quarter.","The growth within merchandise was led by automotive, which was up 23%, and metals and construction traffic, which increased by 12%. A projected 16% increase in North American light vehicle production during the quarter, along with business gains from Volkswagen and other manufacturers, drove the growth in our automotive sector. ","Our steel business was up 13% in the first quarter, as a result of rising demand from domestic production and increased import slab volumes from Russia and Eastern Europe. In addition, we saw a strong demand for frac sand into the Marcellus and Utica shale regions, which led to a 19% gain in miscellaneous construction materials.","Chemicals volume was flat for the quarter, as gains in plastics and crude oil from the Bakken and Canadian oilfields offset declines in rock salt for highway treatment due to the mild winter.","Two of our merchandise sectors experienced volume declines for the quarter. Agriculture volume was down 2% due to a fertilizer comp effect, which was not cleared until March 1. This was partially offset by a 6% increase in shipments of ethanol in spite of reduced consumption of gasoline. Paper volume was down 4% due to a weaker volume of newsprint, pulp and pulpboard, which was partially offset by gains in lumber, which was up 15% in the quarter.","Concluding now with our business outlook and our expectations ahead. For Coal, we do not anticipate the need for appreciable inventory replenishment in our utility market during the shoulder market months since stockpiles remain at target levels across our region. But we do expect offsetting demand in our robust domestic metallurgical market due to increased domestic steel production.","And on the export front, we expect new steam coal opportunities to partially offset weaker demand in the European met market. We are also encouraged by recent improvement in high-end world met coal prices, which may be signaling a tighter supply chain for this product. But clearly, in the short run, post April 1 of this year, we are pricing transportation service in this sector in a weaker international met coal market than existed last year.","In our intermodal sector, our strong service performance and tighter truckload capacity bode well for continued opportunity for highway conversions. And expectations for international trade remain favorable, as consumer confidence continues to improve. ","The outlook for our merchandise business is positive, led by growth in crude oil and waste products, as well as higher volumes of ethanol to new terminals. We're also well positioned to take advantage of prospects for continued growth in the shale region. And our outlook for our steel and automotive businesses remain positive.","In summary, we expect our diverse range of markets to support overall growth ahead despite current headwinds in the coal market. We remain committed to delivering a strong service product and pricing that product at levels that equal or exceed the rate of rail inflation. ","Thanks for your time, and I'll now turn it over to Mark for our operations report. Mark?","Mark D. Manion","Thank you, Don. Good afternoon, everyone. Starting with safety. We ended the first quarter with a ratio of 0.70. That's an 11% improvement over the same period last year. As we continue to reduce injuries and accidents, everyone associated with Norfolk Southern wins. Our employees have an improved quality of life. And from a business perspective, we reduce our costs and improve our operating performance. Our workforce increasingly drives improvements in safety and service.","Let me now turn to service as expressed in our composite service metric. For the quarter, we posted composite performance of 82.8%. That's a 15% improvement over last year. While led by train performance, all the components, train performance, connection performance and plan adherence, showed significant year-over-year improvement. While mild winter weather worked in our favor, improved crew availability has resulted in a big boost in operating performance. This continues a trend from the fourth quarter, where we've seen the velocity of the railroad continue to improve. First quarter composite performance, in fact, is just short of the second quarter 2009 record performance of 83.8% but with 23% more volume.","Similar to composite service metric, train speed for the first quarter improved 2.5 miles an hour or 12% over the same period last year. Again, we're approaching our record-setting second quarter 2009 velocities, but with significantly more traffic. Like train speed, terminal dwell showed a significant improvement in the first quarter compared to first quarter last year, a reduction of 4.4 hours or 17% and equal to our 2009 performance.","Turning to the last page, all of these service improvements also equate to greater velocity and consistency, and in turn, drive productivity. Let me list just a few. Train & engine service overtime has been reduced 15%. Re-crews have been reduced a sizable 35%. Equipment rents have been reduced as a whole, but the portion of equipment rents driven by velocity has been reduced by 9%. Locomotives in service have been reduced by 3%. Fuel consumption, reduced by 2%. Gross ton miles per gallon improved 1% and gross ton miles per train hour has improved 4%.","This quarter punctuates the importance of having the right resources in place to run the network. Properly applied, those resources drive service and velocity, which not only delivers a superior service product to our customers, but also productivity to the bottom line.","With that, I'll turn it over to you, Jim.","James A. Squires","Thank you, Mark. I'll now review our financial results for the first quarter. As Wick mentioned, after a balmy winter, we are off to a strong start, having set first quarter records for most measures.","Let's start with our first quarter operating results. As Don described, our 6% increase in railway operating revenue set a new first quarter record at $2.8 billion, the $169 million increase included an additional $76 million of fuel revenues, notwithstanding a $26 million unfavorable lag effect.","Railway operating expenses increased $24 million or 1% for the quarter. Income from railway operations was a first quarter record at $745 million, and the resulting 73.3% operating ratio equaled our first quarter record.","As you'll recall, our prior year expenses included a $58 million non-cash charge related to an unfavorable arbitration ruling, which contributed 220 basis points to last year's operating ratio. Excluding the arbitration charge, our 2012 operating ratio translates to a 2% or 160 basis point improvement compared to first quarter 2011.","Turning to our expenses. The next slide shows the major components of the $24 million net increase. As expected, fuel and compensation and benefits accounted for most of the upward pressure on our expenses. ","As displayed on the following slide, the $24 million increase in fuel expense was due to higher prices, which were partially offset by reduced consumption. Our average diesel fuel price per gallon was $3.16, a 10% increase compared with the first quarter of 2011. Diesel fuel consumption decreased 2% relative to a 1% increase in volume and a 1% decline in gross ton miles, reflecting productivity gains achieved from a fluid network.","Next, compensation and benefits increased by $21 million or 3%. Looking at the major components of this increase on the following slide. First, pay rates drove expenses up $11 million. Second, higher, health and welfare benefits due to increased headcount added $6 million. Third, payroll taxes increased $6 million. Fourth, employee activity levels, primarily related to non-T&E crafts, increased, adding $5 million. Train & engine activity levels increased negligibly despite higher train starts and volumes. Again, displaying productivity gains from improved train operations. Lower stock-based compensation partially offset these increases.","Depreciation and purchased services and rents increased $13 million and $8 million, respectively. The 6% increase in depreciation reflects our larger capital basis, as we've continued to invest in our infrastructure and equipment. Purchased services and rents primarily reflects increased intermodal operations, repairs and maintenance and other miscellaneous services, partly offset by lower equipment rents.","Equipment rents benefited from improved velocity, our acquisition of freight cars that had been previously leased, the plans for which we shared with you last year, and the reduction of leased locomotives.","Materials and other expenses decreased $42 million or 15%, reflecting the absence of last year's unfavorable arbitration ruling, partially offset by higher materials costs, largely related to equipment and roadway repairs.","Turning to our nonoperating items. Higher interest expense on uncertain tax positions was offset by net returns from corporate-owned life insurance and other miscellaneous items. Interest expense on debt increased $8 million, reflecting additional net borrowings over the last 12 months.","Next, income taxes totaled $244 million and the effective tax rate was 37.3%. Income taxes in the first quarter of 2011 were $190 million with an effective rate of 36.9%.","Net income and EPS comparisons are displayed on the following slide. Net income was $410 million, an increase of $85 million or 26% compared to 2011. Diluted earnings per share was $1.23, exceeding first quarter 2011 results by $0.33 per share or 37%. Excluding last year's arbitration adjustment, our net income increased $49 million or 14% compared to 2011, and diluted earnings per share increased $0.23 per share or 23%. Both measures set new first quarter records.","Lastly, as displayed on Slide 13, during the quarter, we generated cash from operations exceeding $1 billion, up $383 million from last year, and also bolstered by a return to normal accounts payable flows from the accelerated activity I mentioned to you last quarter.","Cash from operations more than covered our property additions, share repurchases and dividends. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter equaled $829 million, reflecting $600 million related to our 3%, 10-year senior notes issued in March. ","Thank you for your attention. And now, I will turn the program back to Wick.","Charles Wick Moorman","Thanks, Jim. As you've heard, Norfolk Southern again posted excellent results for the first quarter, driven, as I've said earlier, by a very substantial improvement in operations, velocity and customer service, along with the continued strength in key components of our franchise. Looking ahead, we're committed to driving even higher levels of service performance and efficiencies through continued investments in assets, infrastructure, technology and most importantly, our people. We have long believed that improving service links directly to greater efficiencies and the numbers that Mark showed you are certainly confirmation of that.","Looking to our markets, we continue to believe that the United States is on a path of continued, albeit slow, growth. And we feel confident that we can continue to grow our merchandise and intermodal volumes at above the rate of total economic growth.","Coal obviously remains something of a question mark, given our inability to forecast, let alone manage, the weather. But over the longer term, we have continuing confidence in the strength of both our domestic and export coal franchises.","Our company and the great people who make up our company are working hard to deliver the best possible value to our customers and superior returns to our shareholders. We have a great team. And our first quarter results are further proof that we are achieving success in both of those goals.","Thanks, and we'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Ceraso from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Let's see, a couple of items. The strength in your length of haul in the Coal business in Q2 and Q3 of last year drove some nice yield and revenue per unit. How much of a headwind do you think that creates this year in Q2 and Q3? And then if we couple that with the decline in the export met pricing and just a decline in export met volumes, do you think it's possible that revenue per unit could go negative in Coal in Q2 or Q3?","Donald W. Seale","Chris, this is Don. Certainly, last year we saw Utility South shipments and export shipments up substantially, and we faced that as a comp this year. Those are long-haul, higher RPU market segments of Coal, and they are under pressure somewhat. I had mentioned that our Utility South segment in the first quarter was down 24%. Our Utility North segment was down 11%. So there is a, that's a negative comp with respect to mix within those 2 segments. Also, our export market was off 10% in the first quarter, and that's a negative comp as well. So the revenue per unit based on that mix effect certainly could go negative if we continue to see that mix.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe thinking longer term, on more of the core price in coal for the domestic thermal, what's your expectation as you look forward, as contracts start to roll over. Do you think you may have to adjust prices downward? Or is your game plan to maintain pricing in domestic thermal?","Donald W. Seale","Chris, we do not have any utility coal contracts that will be renegotiated this year. So we will have to wait to see what the market looks like when those contracts are renegotiated.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And you're not willing to talk about next year yet?","Donald W. Seale","I think we have a ways to go to see what the market will look like by then.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Wetherbee from Citi.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just maybe another question on the export coal market. From the pricing standpoint, I guess most of it will recycle on April 1. I just want to get a sense, can you give us the order of magnitude? Is it 100% of your met business that gets repriced on April 1? Or is there some pieces of business that got redone earlier this year?","Donald W. Seale","We have some of the business that is under contract beyond April 1. But the majority of the export metallurgical coal market will be repriced, after the April 1 date.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then when you think about the mix of thermal, you mentioned thermal coming in and potentially providing some offset to the decline in the met business. I'm guessing that not much of that was moving in the first quarter. Is that a fair statement? I think you had mentioned that you'd gotten some in the month of March. But as you look forward, is that, the potential to offset that, that we didn't see in the first quarter, the down 10% number, but may come in the next couple of quarters?","Donald W. Seale","We handle 600,000 tons of steam coal into the export market in the first quarter.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And that could be a bigger number as we move forward potentially?","Donald W. Seale","Potentially, yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Justin Yagerman from Deutsche Bank.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First question on the intermodal side, just switching topics a little bit. I'll come back to coal, don't worry. But was curious, how you think about the profitability of that incremental double stacking that you were able to get in the quarter? I mean, is that pure profit as you're able to get more containers on those trains? Or how should we think about that in terms of the incremental margin in that intermodal business?","Donald W. Seale","Justin, this is Don. We realize increased efficiencies as we densify our intermodal train network. So when you look at the metrics of going up 9 percentage points in the stack configuration in the first quarter, plus having a 5% increase in volume with only a 2% increase in crew starts, both of those metrics support improved efficiency and incremental margin.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it, so it definitely helps out on that end. And then when I think about the steam coal on the export side becoming a bigger part of the mix, can you remind us, I guess on a percent basis, what steam coal is right now as a percentage of your total export? How does that export pricing margin compare to the met side of the export business? And where exactly is that coal coming from and where is it going?","Donald W. Seale","The steam coal component and the met coal component in the first quarter, we were 93% metallurgical coal going into the export market. The steam coal that we are targeting is predominantly Western Europe. Some could make its way to Asia as well. And it originates in much of the same production territory that we originate the met coal in. So it would be Central App, Northern App, Illinois Basin.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it. And the profitability on that relative to the met?","Donald W. Seale","The steam coal market is a different market than the met coal market. We will do fine on both segments, but it's a differentiated product.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","If you had one versus the other, which would you rather have?","Donald W. Seale","Both.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Wolfe from Wolfe Trahan.","Edward M. Wolfe - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","What are you seeing directionally in the domestic met yields going forward? What do you expect? And on the export, your closest competitor obviously posted a 12% decline in April. Is your experience similar to that?","Donald W. Seale","Ed, as you know -- this is Don again. As you know, we have our export pricing contained in contracts. And the contracts are confidential with producers. So we will not be able to discuss what the price levels of those contracts will be.","Edward M. Wolfe - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","So you won't even comment on directionally if they're similar to aggregated together relative to that negative '12 number?","Donald W. Seale","Ed, we cannot because they are contained in confidential contracts.","Edward M. Wolfe - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. On the domestic met side, on the domestic side, what are you seeing or expecting? And how much of that business is contract? How much potentially comes up?","Donald W. Seale","Well, we were up 19% in the first quarter on domestic metallurgical coal, and we're seeing our domestic steel market continue to improve. It was up 7% in the quarter in terms of production, and steel capacity, manufacturing capacity, is now running at 80%. They still have room to move up. We have an automotive market that's extremely good, and the steel market is following that. So we see good opportunity in the domestic met market. I'll put that into context a little bit, Ed. In the first quarter, we were down essentially 700,000 tons of metallurgical coal going into the export market. We were up 800,000 tons of coal going into the domestic metallurgical market. So...","Edward M. Wolfe - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","But in terms of pricing, not volume -- obviously, the volume is good. But what are you seeing on the pricing side? And what percentage of that business reprices throughout this year?","Donald W. Seale","We have most of that business priced for the year and we're pleased with the pricing levels.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Wadewitz from JPMorgan Chase.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to ask you on export coal that -- I think there's some recent data points that indicate maybe the market's improving a little bit on the met side. That pricing, I think $210 a ton, something like that, looked like it bottomed or popped up a little bit. So as you look at your export met in second quarter, do you think that, that potentially improves? And perhaps, you can comment on what March will look like. I think your January, February met export was down. But maybe you can tell us what March looked like.","Donald W. Seale","The latter part of that question first, Tom. This is Don. Our January export numbers were pretty close to our January 2011 numbers. We were down in February significantly, and then back up close to 2011 numbers in March. So it was a choppy distribution of traffic. To the first part of your question, we have seen in recent weeks the metallurgical coal price in the world market move from $210, an increase of about $10 a ton, back up to about $220 on the high-end of met coal coming out of Australia, so that is encouraging. The second thing we're seeing in Australia is that during the latter part of March, we had heavy rains, floods and labor disruptions and we've seen some force majeure of metallurgical coal for BHP and others coming into the market. So we're not declaring that the market is turned, but those signals are positive for us.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And on the utility side, you sound like you're, I guess, relatively optimistic given that the environment is so difficult. Do you think that utility, year-over-year, is going to get worse in second quarter? Or you feel like it's kind of a similar year-over-year decline to what you had in the first quarter? And then, I mean, it's tough to look out to second half, but if you have a normal summer, you think things might actually improve in second half? Or is that tough to figure out from this point?","Donald W. Seale","Tom, first of all, with -- let's talk about the comp. In the second quarter versus the first quarter, our comp for utility coal for our network will be a little less demanding than it was in the first quarter. We handled 2 million tons more utility coal in the first quarter of 2011 than we did the second quarter, so the comp will not be quite as high in the second quarter, so that's favorable, but by about 2 million tons favorable. The shoulder months, however, with inventories being as high as they are at the utilities because of the mild winter, we expect a very soft shoulder month period, with very little replenishment taking place, so the second quarter will be impacted by that. If we see a normalized weather pattern going into the summer -- in fact, we're hoping for something that's under the term hot and sweltering. If that were to be seen, we could see coal pick back up and, certainly, the second half of the year would be on a better track.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Troy from Susquehanna Financial.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just a quick refresher. I'm not -- I don't think you have any thermal contracts or any major thermal contracts coming up for negotiation this year. Is that correct?","Donald W. Seale","Mark (sic) [Matt], this is Don. That's correct.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","So if I look at your negotiating strategy, obviously nat gas is going to remain low for some time no matter whose model or forecast you look at. And stockpiles of 200 million, 210 million tons are a record for this time of year and we are going into the shoulder. Are you getting any change in posturing from utility customers? Are they looking for forgiveness on take or pay or negotiated minimums? Are they pushing back on price? Just what does the environment feel like when you talk to utilities that clearly don't want or need any more coal at this point in the year?","Donald W. Seale","This is Don. We're continuing to have discussion, as we always do, about supply chain management of their requirements. We are not engaged in contract discussions.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","All right. Okay. And then second question would be -- when we were there about a month or so ago, we talked about the resource being -- the network being adequately resourced from a headcount perspective, able to accommodate mid- to high-single digit volume growth, numbers today bear that out. Just curious, as we think about modeling for the rest of the year, headcount relatively flattish, incentive, comp seems to be a variable, hitting people this year to varying degrees. Your stock did exceptionally well last year, but may be a more difficult comp later in the year. But I'm just wondering, the moving parts and pieces on labor expense, what should we expect in terms of wage inflation? And any potential change in what incentive comps doing in that labor line?","Charles Wick Moorman","Well, I think you've already heard from folks that if you look at those components, health and welfare benefits, moderate a little bit this year. Headcount, we do feel that we've really gotten our workforce about back up where it needs to be from a T&E standpoint, and we'll still be hiring, but hiring more based on attrition, so that's flattening out. The incentive comp, we just have to wait and see. It's still early in the year to understand exactly what it'll do. Jim, your thoughts?","James A. Squires","We would foresee continued favorability in incentive compensation. But not to a material degree. Somewhat similar to what we saw this quarter, so about $10 million in the quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Walter Spracklin from RBC Capital Markets.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a question, you've dealt with the sort of the pricing effect from your coal. I was wondering if you could look outside your coal market and look at general pricing and sort of give us an indication of the impact that perhaps mix had outside of coal on your quarter. Was it favorable or unfavorable? And do you expect that mix effect, again ex coal going forward, to either continue in that same trend or not?","James A. Squires","Walter, it's Jim. Mix was unfavorable this quarter overall, not surprising given the growth rates in the varying commodity groups. And that's been the trend for some time now, so I see no reason to believe that, that won't continue to be a drag on overall yield as the year goes on.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Any order of magnitude as it comps with your 5% RPU?","James A. Squires","It was about 2% negative.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","2%, that's great. And I don't if I missed it, but headcount in terms of just wage inflation, what are you modeling for this year, just, not on headcount but on your wage inflation?","Charles Wick Moorman","We're in the 3% range, something like that. All of the contracts have been ratified, and that's giving us a lead on that number.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Seidl from Dahlman Rose.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Quick question. In relation to the weather in 1Q, obviously, there's a little bit of an offset for the negative demand on coal in that your operational metrics'll look a lot stronger because of the decent weather conditions. Could you talk a little bit about -- as we head into Q2 here and should we still see continued operational performance but maybe just not along the same magnitude as Q1. Is that how we should look at it?","Mark D. Manion","Yes. This is Mark. We expect to continue to see the kind of velocity improvement that's been ramping up. And in fact, that really has been going on since November last year. We saw some pretty good velocity year-over-year, fourth quarter, and fortunately, that's continued on through winter. And now as we get into the second quarter, we're just -- we're seeing the same, where we've got velocity improvements that are pretty significantly better than last year, even though we're out of the winter season.","Charles Wick Moorman","I think we feel relatively confident, barring unforeseen events that we have the assets and people in place to continue to operate the network at the metrics that we saw from the first quarter. There will always be aberrations, but we think we're adequately staffed and we have good power and all of the systems in place to continue a high level of network performance and customer service.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And my next question, guys, is in the intermodal side. Obviously, you lost a contract on the international front. Could you talk a little bit about your domestic business? The outlook, competing with trucks? And also in terms of where we are in the network? How much capacity you have left to grow that before you have to start adding some assets?","Donald W. Seale","This is Don. The domestic segment was a high growth segment again in the first quarter. It was up 13%. The driver of that is Eastern, local, intermodal growth, which is highway-diversion based. And we see a very large pool of motor carrier traffic that's available for continued conversion. As we open our new intermodal terminals this year, we'll be adding close to 750,000 additional lift capacity at those terminals. So we have good capacity coming with the new terminals. We're handling the business that we have today very effectively. So we're encouraged by that. We're optimistic about further growth. With respect to the intermodal train network, it's notable when we look at the train capacity, with the densification effort and the stacking effort that we have underway, our train length in the first quarter only increased by about 50 feet per intermodal train, and we handled 38,000 additional units of business in the first quarter. So less than 1% increase in train length with a 5% increase in volume.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","And that's all the benefit from the double stacking?","Donald W. Seale","Correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays Capital.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Maybe if I can just follow up on that, Don. What are some of the impediments today that keep you from double stacking more of the domestic container traffic?","Donald W. Seale","Well, the impediment to this point has been the availability of 53-foot well cars, having them at the right place, having sufficient containers in the pool to completely move our domestic freight in containers for stacking. When we talk about our domestic freight, by the way, I'm not talking about our premium segment, which is UPS and FedEx, they move predominantly in trailers. We're talking about our domestic market that is highway conversions for Hunt, Hub and others. We're now -- 93% of that market is moving in containers. So as we've increased the container pool, increased the 53-foot well car pool, as well as focused on getting the right car at the ramp at the right time and getting the right box on those cars, those metrics are moving in the right direction.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, but there's no structural impediments like clearances or tunnel heights that you have to get it across right now?","Donald W. Seale","We're 97% cleared for double stack across our entire network.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, and then just one last one on coal, if you don't mind. For the domestic utility contracts, I know you said that there's not any that you're going to be repricing this year. But obviously, there's built in escalation on a lot of those contracts. Do any of them mimic what we're seeing right now with RCAF x fuel? Or should we be thinking differently from that?","Donald W. Seale","RCAFs, as a percentage of our book of coal has become de minimis.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Even the ex fuel, like core inflation?","Donald W. Seale","Correct. We're not using RCAF to any great degree now on coal contracts.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","If I can just take on the intermodal for a second. Can you talk about the scaling of these yards as they come on the 4 yards that you're launching? Is that all a fourth quarter event? Are we going to see the benefits come on through the rest of year? Can you kind of just walk us through the time and the magnitude of that growth?","Charles Wick Moorman","Of the 4, Ken, we have already turned on our operation at Mechanicville, New York for our joint venture with Pan Am. That's been a significant improvement for us, because we can now stack all the way out of Chicago into Mechanicville, and only are now restricted into Ayer. That's online. We are optimistic that we're going to get the new terminal at Memphis up and running to, maybe to a limited degree, initially. But up and running, hopefully, sometime mid, late summer. And then the last 2 terminals in Rossville, Memphis, Birmingham and our terminal in Greencastle, are order of magnitude, all the same in terms of capacity -- I beg your pardon, Birmingham and Greencastle, Pennsylvania, are fourth quarter completion.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And this is an event where you see the growth once it's live? Or is there anything incremental that you work around that as -- or does it all start on day 1 when you launch?","Charles Wick Moorman","If you look at our existing terminals in that part of the world, we are largely operating at capacity today. We expect, when the new terminals are open, that they -- there's a lot of business that will move and it will ramp up very quickly, but we're not going to see much more incremental growth in those lanes prior to the opening of those terminals.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Appreciate that. And then just switching subjects for my follow-up on agriculture. Is this -- are we -- what do you see, I guess, Don, in terms of starting to overlap these negative comparisons? Are you starting to see the planting season go your way? Can you kind of get an early read on how things are trending there?","Donald W. Seale","Yes, Ken. The comp that we faced in ag was a phosphate rock move in Florida, and we did clear that negative comp, March 1. Now with respect to the crop, we expect a very, very solid corn crop planting. The season is already off to a pretty good start weather-wise. And if we get the proper amount of rainfall and the type of growing season that we would normally expect, it's going to be a very large crop. And as you know, the soybean crop and the corn crop in South America was substandard this past season. So we should see an export market from the U.S. on the horizon that should be much stronger than the export market that we saw this past year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Greene from Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I know your outlook longer term on the Coal business is pretty good. But if things sort of struggle for a bit here, how quickly can you move resources around the network? Are there friction costs we need to be thinking about? Or is it pretty seamless, that you can move to where there's growth?","Charles Wick Moorman","No. The resources that we employ in that business in terms of -- primarily locomotives, obviously, can be moved very quickly. In terms of people, we manage through that, obviously, those are folks that we can move temporarily if we get short somewhere else, but don't usually do that. And the balance is just coal cars, which we don't deploy in any other business. So there's really not much in what I would describe as frictional costs.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And if we had to make a decision, sort of longer term, about the coal franchise, is there a lot of CapEx that's tied up in that in each year's plan that you could sort of pull out if you decided, this is going to be sort of 3\/4 of the size it once was? How much flexibility do you have there?","Charles Wick Moorman","We actually have a fair amount of flexibility. As you know, Bill, we have been working on for a few years now and continue to work on the replacement of our coal car fleet, which is life expiring essentially over -- and we'll continue to do so over the next 5, 6, 7 years. We can throttle that program up and down. We can certainly curtail it if we feel that we need a smaller car fleet than we currently have today. So we do have flexibility in terms of that primary asset, our coal cars, over the next few years to really manage the size of the fleet to where our business is going to go.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","All right. That makes sense. And then, Wick, last question is just on the regulatory angle. Last year, the STB looked at various commodities and talked about should they all be exempt and what's sort of the thought process here. Is there ever a case to make here that because of the fact that natural gas is so competitive now that maybe coal regulations need to be revisited? That maybe there's not as much of a reason to be as aggressive there?","Charles Wick Moorman","Well, that's a very interesting argument, which I'm now going to think through and try to progress. But it's never been suggested in front of the board that there's a case to be made to do that.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","But that's happened for other commodities, no?","Charles Wick Moorman","Was anything exempted post the original exemptions that were published?","Donald W. Seale","Well -- this is Don. The STB, in the 80s, after staggers, had product and geographic competition.","Charles Wick Moorman","Right.","Donald W. Seale","As 2 of tests for regulation of commodities and exemptions. So I guess if gas continued to be below $2, we could certainly argue that we're seeing very, very robust competition from a product side as well as geographic.","Charles Wick Moorman","Right. The board has, as you say, reexamined exemptions last year, has made no changes. But I think Don is exactly right on the criteria. I don't recall them ever modifying, in any significant way, the exemptions since they were first established.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony Gallo from Wells Fargo.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Two questions, both around shale. You mentioned records within metals and construction. If you stripped out the metals piece of that, what did the construction look like? And obviously, my angle is what's going on with the frac sand.","Donald W. Seale","We had a very solid quarter in the first quarter with frac sand and related materials going into Marcellus for the drilling operation.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then, I'm sorry, go ahead.","Donald W. Seale","Go ahead.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I was just going say, as a follow-up, can you give us a little detail behind that, I believe it's Wisconsin sand but destination, length of haul and maybe what the competition looks like, I know truck and barge does very little. Up in that area, it's mainly other regional railroads, although CSX does some. Just a little color around the competition.","Donald W. Seale","We are handling a lot of Illinois and Wisconsin originated sand that comes to us over the Chicago Gateway. So it's an attractive length of haul from Chicago back into the drilling region of Pennsylvania and associated areas. So the competition, obviously, there's some truck competition, but we have a very favorable position with respect to those bulk commodities hauling at that length of haul. And we expect that, that volume to continue to grow, not only in the frac sand but drilling pipe, drilling pads, as well as the potential for handling wastewater.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then do the Canadian rails play up there as well, to some degree?","Donald W. Seale","The CP is involved in some of that business as well.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","It sounds like it's largely an NS market.","Mark D. Manion","We have a very strong position in Pennsylvania, both from an NS standpoint and our standpoint of short line partners, as we do in southern New York, which accesses a lot of that market.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Nesvold from Jefferies & Company.","H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions in the quarter have been answers. Are you able to tell us what percent of your revenue for this year has been contracted as of the end of 1Q? And what percent of the revenue by the end of 2Q will have been contracted?","Donald W. Seale","This is Don. With respect to the end of the first quarter, 75% of our book for the year has been contracted. I will wait on the answer to the second part, because we want to see that we've got all the negotiations done before I declare them done in the second quarter.","H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just as a quick follow-up, the industry rail car data came out yesterday. And I think one thing, though, a bit of surprise, is that steel coal cars were actually pretty good, which was a little bit of a surprise given what's happening obviously in coal right now. How do you -- you talked a little bit about this earlier, your flexibility to redeploy capital if coal, as a franchise, goes into secular decline. In the nearer term, in the next 2 to 4 quarters, how do you think about deploying capital into that business? I mean, do you hold off on ordering additional cars until you kind of see where volumes are going? Or is it just no change to the base case CapEx scenario for now?","Charles Wick Moorman","In terms of thinking about replenishing our coal car fleet, we look at a couple of things. One is what is the fallout rate of the existing fleet. And then, obviously, over the longer term, what's the total number, the fleet that we -- the coal cars that we require in the fleet for the business. We have a lot of ability to flex over the next few years. In the shorter term, we have made some contractual commitments and we are also looking at our fallout rate, and we are ordering accordingly. So -- every year is a new year. We'll take a hard look at it again next year and see what we need to order.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Vernon from Bernstein.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I just wanted to get a sense for where we are with respect to automotive volumes on 2 fronts. First, what you're hearing from customers in terms of how much pent-up demand remains to be filled? And then, on the second side, if you're also hearing that there's additional site relocation closer into the North American market for new vehicle production?","Donald W. Seale","David, this is Don. With respect to the first part of the question, our dialogue with our automotive customers is a very positive dialogue. We're seeing annual production look closer to 15 million units on the run rate that we're on right now. Certainly, our first quarter volumes being up 23% in that market reflects that demand. The average age of a vehicle on the U.S. highway today is 10.5 years old. So there's still room to run, with respect to replenishing that older fleet. So what we're hearing from our customers is pretty positive. With the second part of your question, we continue to have dialogue with manufacturers that are looking at possible expansion into the U.S. market for automotive production. We're seeing that in a positive way across manufacturing in general, as we see some of the re-shoring activity that's taking place. As Asian production continues -- that cost of production in Asia continues to get higher, the U.S. and Mexico are looking much more favorable to new plant locations for manufacturing in general.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Any specifics stuff in the automotive side that's on the planning calendar so far?","Donald W. Seale","Well, we couldn't comment with respect to any of the manufacturers that might be looking for plant sites since that's very confidential information.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","All right, great. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up, for Jim. What was the fuel surcharge revenue in the quarter?","James A. Squires","David, the fuel surcharge revenue was $325 million versus $249 million in the first quarter of 2011, a $76 million increase.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Kauffman from Sterne Agee.","Salvatore Vitale - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Sal Vitale on for Jeff Kaufmann. Just a quick question on the coal side, can you provide the breakdown of the utility coal tonnage between North and South?","Donald W. Seale","It generally runs about 50-50 with respect to the split in terms of the overall volume. Of course, this past quarter, we had one down 24%, Southern utility, and the North was down 11%. So it moves quarter-to-quarter based on that mix. But generally, on average, 50-50.","Salvatore Vitale - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I'm just trying to get a sense for the difference in revenue per car between met coal and utility coal, that is if similar length of haul profile. So if we assume, say, a 300-mile length of haul as a point of reference, what would be the approximate difference in the revenue per car?","Donald W. Seale","I think you can look at the slide that we presented on relative mileages. And revenue per revenue ton mile would track somewhat those relevant differences in mileage.","Salvatore Vitale - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Right. So if I'm looking at the right slide here, Utility North is roughly half of Utility South? So you're saying that's a good starting point?","Donald W. Seale","As we've said in the past, our Utility South business is about 1\/3 higher revenue per unit than our Northern utility.","Salvatore Vitale - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just one other question. On the fuel surcharge, has there been any increase in coverage on the surcharge side? So you said the $76 million was the absolute dollar increase, I'm just trying to get a sense for how much of that is attributable to higher coverage.","James A. Squires","Effectively 0. We have a very good coverage and the number's not changing.","Operator","At this time, we have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Wick Moorman for any closing comments.","Charles Wick Moorman","Thank you for your questions, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."],"16441":["Norfolk Southern Corp.

With me today are our Chief Marketing Officer, Alan Shaw; our Chief Operating Officer, Mark Manion; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart.","Now, let's go straight to the financial results. Our reported second quarter earnings were $1.41 per share, 21% lower than last year's record results. The decrease was largely due to lower coal volumes and lower fuel surcharge revenues.","These are challenging conditions, but there's some good news as our business mix undergoes a significant change. Our intermodal volumes top last year's second quarter record levels. And our merchandise volumes were up for the quarter as well despite pressure in the steel market.","Moreover, revenue per unit, excluding fuel surcharges, was positive for merchandise as well as for intermodal, which was even more positive than the first quarter. Alan will provide more detail on our revenue for the second quarter and outlook for the remainder of 2015.","I'm proud to report that our service improved significantly during the second quarter. Our composite service metric, an internal measure we use to assess network performance is approaching 80%. And this quarter, we will continue progress toward the higher-service levels achieved in 2012 and 2013.","We remain firmly committed to continued service improvement and Mark will share the latest on our service and operations outlook. Marta will wrap up the presentations with a full review of our financial results.","Before getting into the specifics, let me emphasize that we are confident in our long-term strategy and our prospects for growth and strong financials. We have a solid franchise and the right team in place to execute our strategy to be a top performer in the industry.","On that note, I will turn the program over to Alan, Mark, and Marta, and will return with some closing comments before taking your questions. Alan?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Jim, and good morning to everyone. I'll begin by providing context to our long-term focus from a sales and marketing perspective. And then I'll review our second quarter performance and our outlook for the balance of the year and beyond.","With our diverse portfolio, we are well-positioned to capitalize on the broad structural changes in the U.S. economy. Our extensive intermodal network and strategic corridor investments have enhanced our position in truck competitive markets where demographics and regulatory action will constrain truck capacity, highway congestion will increase, and the economics will continue the momentum of highway conversions to rail.","Within the energy arena, we benefit from the movement of crude oil to the East Coast refinery complex as well as increased natural gas drilling within the Marcellus-Utica region, driving inputs of sand and pipe and outputs of natural gas liquids. While reduced commodity prices have tempered 2015 growth, this will continue as a significant market for us.","Similarly, our coal franchise, which has been impacted by lower market prices this year, will remain an important part of our business. In manufacturing, the United States has substantially improved its cost competitiveness in terms of wages, productivity, and energy cost. While foreign exchange is impacting some production, the overall picture for U.S. manufacturing is still one of expansion and NS is well positioned to benefit as our service region covers 65% of the manufacturing in the United States.","In housing, recent data is supportive of the view that home sales and new home construction will be growth areas with expectations for housing starts to be up more than 10% this year and continued growth projected for 2016 and beyond.","Our team will pursue strategic and innovative solutions and partnership with our customers allowing NS to capitalize on these market opportunities that generate revenue growth. Improved service will provide increase capacity on our network and enhance the value of our product, aiding our efforts to convert additional highway freight to rail and achieve market-based pricing gains that we expect to exceed the cost of rail inflation. Additionally, we will endeavor to reduce volatility from fuel surcharge structures.","As previously discussed, we have near-term headwinds notably from declining coal and fuel surcharge revenues. However, we will lap these comps, which coupled with the strength in the markets just referenced, affords us great opportunity for future growth.","Now, let's turn to our second quarter performance. Marta will provide complete quarterly financial results later on the call, but I would like to discuss operating revenue as you can see on slide three. Overall, you will note the negative impact of the declining fuel and coal revenue. However, the positive aspect is that volume and revenue per unit excluding fuel increased for both merchandise and intermodal.","On slide four, you will note that facing very strong comparisons with second quarter 2014, the overall volume declined 2% with growth in intermodal and merchandise driven by increased consumer spending, energy outputs, stronger housing starts and automotive production. These gains were more than offset by a 21% decline in coal. As expected, coal faced a particularly tough comparison against prior-year volume, which I will talk about more on the next slide.","Coal revenue declined 33% to $453 million for the quarter with revenue per unit down 14%. Low natural gas prices depressed Eastern coal burn by 15% in the first two months of the second quarter, which reduced utility coal volume by 23%. A strong dollar and global oversupply led to a 38% decline in export coal volumes.","As shown on slide six, coal market conditions will continue to challenge our coal volumes for the remainder of 2015. Natural gas price projections below $3 per million btu have impacted coal burn and current stockpile levels will present headwinds for utility deliveries. We continue with our guidance of a run rate of roughly 20 million tons per quarter. Export coals are challenged due to foreign exchange rates and global oversupply, and we believe our run rate will fall to an estimated 3 million tons per quarter.","Moving to our intermodal markets, pricing gains continue to create an improvement in revenue per unit excluding fuel. Domestic volumes were effectively flat against last year's strong comps due to West Coast port issues impacting transcontinental freight coupled with temporary headwinds associated with rail service performance and increased truck capacity. Our international units grew 8% in the quarter benefiting from West Coast port issues as some vessel traffic shifted to the East Coast, a conversion we expect to continue.","While current truck capacity and lower fuel prices have limited near-term growth in the market, contract rates in the truck market continue to climb. This environment, particularly as our service product continues to improve, bodes well for intermodal pricing moving forward.","Moving on to merchandise on slide eight, volume grew 1% in the second quarter. Excluding fuel, revenue per unit also increased as solid pricing partially offset the negative effect of fuel surcharges. Metals and construction volume was down 6% for the quarter driven by global oversupply in the steel market and the impact of low natural gas prices on drilling inputs.","Aggregates were up due to construction growth in the Southeast. Our agriculture volume decreased 1% primarily due to reduced volumes of fertilizers and wheat while ethanol volumes grew from greater gasoline consumption. A 13% gain in chemicals volume was due to crude by rail as well as year-over-year growth in natural gas liquids from Marcellus-Utica shale plays.","Automotive volume was up 2% with stronger vehicle production. Finally, paper and forest products volume was up 2%, resulting from a rise in consumer spending and the housing recovery.","Let me close today with an overview of our expectations. In the near-term, foreign exchange rates and low-commodity prices will negatively impact coal, crude oil, and steel volumes. Combined with the overhang of fuel surcharges and despite expected continued improvement in core pricing, we expect third quarter and fourth quarter revenues will trail last year.","Even with these shorter-term challenges, our diverse franchise presents rich opportunities for volume and revenue growth in key markets through the balance of 2015 and beyond. We expect growth within our intermodal markets, and our international volumes will benefit from organic growth at East Coast ports. Longer-term, truck capacity constraints coupled with the increasing demand in economics will drive highway conversions.","The energy markets, we anticipate more corn and ethanol shipments due to rising levels of gasoline consumption as well as project-related growth. And our natural gas liquids market will see continued strength from fractionators in the Marcellus-Utica region. With North American light vehicle production projected to be up 3% year-over-year, we expect continued growth in automotive volumes.","Lumber, plastics, basic chemicals, aggregates and consumer goods will all benefit from increased housing starts and construction activity. As we cycle the near-term challenges from decline in coal and fuel surcharge revenues, we are well-positioned for and excited about our prospects moving forward.","Thank you for your attention. And I will now turn the presentation over to Mark for an update on operations.","Mark D. Manion - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to update you this morning on the state of our railroad, which has shown nice improvement. But first, I'll update you on safety. We continue to strengthen our safety process through the engagement of our people and the ownership they take for safety. The safety of our employees, our customers' freight, and the communities we serve have been and will continue to be at the core of everything we do.","Our reportable injury ratio for the second quarter was 0.96 and stands at 1.04 for the first half of the year. This is down compared to the first half of last year, which was 1.23. As you see, our train accident rate is up slightly year-over-year while our crossing accident rate was down slightly.","Now, let's take a look at our service. We told you on the last call that we'd turn the corner with our service and we expected the service composite performance to be near 80% by the end of the quarter. For the month of June, we operated in the mid-90%s and actually achieved a composite performance of 79% on June 30.","Looking at the graph on the right, you can see the improved performance from first quarter to second quarter, and again from second quarter to third quarter. Clearly, we're trending in the right direction and our customer service is reflecting that. Nevertheless, we're not satisfied with where we are and our team is working hard to further increase our composite performance and reach a higher velocity.","Train speed and terminal dwell are improving as well. Our speed of 22.5 miles an hour for the week ending July 10 was our highest speed in over a year. Our weekly dwell numbers have been below 25 hours for seven consecutive weeks, which has not happened since July 2014. Our resources have come online as expected and we are consequently seeing our metrics improve in a predictable pattern. As the momentum continues through the second half of the year, our focus will be on further improving our service levels and maintaining the right resource balance.","Turning to the next slide with regard to crews, we've come a long way to ramping up areas where we were short. On the slide, you can see a net increase in conductors in the first quarter and second quarter where we were replenishing locations where we were shorthanded. We're continuing to fill in shortage areas in the third quarter, but new hiring is tapering back to a normalized level. Hiring going forward will be in line with attrition.","On the locomotive side, we've almost completed the receipt of the SD90MACs. In addition, improvement in system velocity has been another driver in our higher locomotive availability. This is allowing us to store some of our locomotives, which will lead to a surge fleet and better reliability for the locomotives left operating.","In closing, we're very encouraged that our resources are coming in balance with our business volume and our operating metrics are trending favorably. We're tightening our belt as we move through the second half. Increased velocity will help us make more efficient use of manpower as well as locomotives and our car fleet. We look forward to continued improvement in our customer service through the rest of the year.","Thank you. And now, I'll turn it over to you, Marta.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Thank you, Mark, and good morning. Let's take a look at our second quarter financials. Slide two presents our operating results where we faced strong headwinds compared with the record-setting second quarter of 2014. As Alan discussed, the effects of sustained lower-fuel surcharges and continuing challenges in the coal markets drove operating revenues down $329 million or 11%.","Nearly three-quarters of the revenue decline was due to lower-fuel revenue which totaled $119 million for the second quarter, and based on current oil price forecast, is expected to be a similar amount for both the third quarter and the fourth quarter.","Operating expenses declined by $124 million, which only partially offset the lower revenues resulting in a 20% reduction in income from railway operations and a 70% operating ratio.","The next slide shows the major components of the $124 million or 6% net decrease in expenses. Total operating cost benefited from lower fuel prices and favorability in the materials and other categories.","Now, let's take a look at each of these areas. As shown on slide four, fuel expense decreased by $153 million or 38%. A lower average price accounted for most of the decline. Reduced consumption added another $5 million of favorability as gallons used were down 1.5% on the 2% decline in overall volume.","Materials and other costs shown on the next slide decreased by $13 million or 5%. Lower environmental expenses and favorable personal injury experience totaled $20 million for the quarter. Additionally, material usage, primarily for locomotive, declined by $7 million. Partially offsetting these decreases were increased travel and relocation expenses.","Going forward, we expect continued favorability related to locomotive materials in the third quarter. However, it will be fully offset by the impact of the costs associated with the closure of the Roanoke, Virginia offices.","We incurred approximately $5 million in the second quarter related to Roanoke relocations, and we expect to incur an additional $30 million over the remainder of the year with the majority of these costs affecting the third quarter.","Moving on to purchased services and rents expense, our costs increased by $24 million or 6%. Higher volume-related and service recovery costs, primarily associated with intermodal operations, equipment rents and joint facilities combined to account for $20 million of the increase, of which we estimate about $5 million was related to the service recovery effort. Expenses associated with software costs were also higher in the quarter.","Slide seven details the $9 million or 1% increase in compensation cost. Although a relatively small net variance, it was comprised of a number of significant items as listed on the slide. The first two, increased pay rates and higher payroll taxes were, as we previously discussed, front-end loaded this year.","The pay rate increase totaled $27 million but will begin to moderate in the second half of the year to around $17 million per quarter. The payroll tax increase was $13 million and should moderate to about $8 million per quarter.","The next two items were largely service recovery-related. An increased number of trainees accounted for $10 million of additional wages. As Mark mentioned, we have turned the corner on our hiring efforts and trainee expenses should begin to decrease in the second half of the year.","Additionally, we incurred $6 million in higher labor hours as crew starts were up, notwithstanding the drop in volume. Partially offsetting these costs were lower incentive and stock-based accruals down $47 million and driven by the decline in financial results.","Next is depreciation expense, which increased by $9 million or 4% reflective of our larger capital base. With regard to capital spending for the remainder of the year, and given the lower-than-expected volumes, we have trimmed back our 2015 capital budget by $130 million or about 5%. Two-thirds of the reductions are related to work on our line of road and one-third is related to equipment.","Slide nine presents our income taxes for the quarter, which had an effective rate of 38.1% compared to 37.4% in 2014. The slight increase in the effective rate is principally related to lower returns on corporate-owned life insurance. Assuming normalized returns on these assets in the second half of the year, we expect the full year rate to be about 37.5%.","Slide 10 shows our bottom-line results with net income of $433 million, down 23% compared with 2014, and diluted earnings per share of $1.41, down 21% versus last year.","Wrapping up our financial overview on slide 11, cash from operations for the first six months was $1.5 billion covering capital spending and producing $587 million in free cash flow. With respect to stockholder returns, we repurchased $765 million of our shares year-to-date and paid $360 million in dividend.","Thank you. And I'll now turn the program back to Jim.","James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","As you've heard this morning, we expect continued pressure in the short term, particularly in the third quarter and to some extent in the fourth quarter from lower coal volumes and lower fuel surcharge revenues. On the positive side, we expect service will continue to improve and better service will help us grow.","As we pursue growth in a changing mix environment, we're working to improve our train performance by further enhancing and innovating our supply chain integration with customers and employees and by leveraging technology. And we're committed to coordinating service capacity and capital investment along with pricing and volume growth to maximize returns for our shareholders.","In addition, we'll continue to capitalize on market opportunities that enhance our network capacity and efficiency as with our pending acquisition of rail lines from the Delaware & Hudson Railway Company. And as we do so, we are committed to reinvesting in our franchise and returning cash to our shareholders.","In sum, we have strong prospects for future growth. Intermodal and merchandise growth increased consumer spending and rebounding housing markets and improved manufacturing activity all support an optimistic longer-term outlook.","While we do face challenges in the short term in 2015, we have a strong legacy of success and we're confident we're taking the right steps to continue creating value for our customers, the communities we serve, our employees, and of course, our shareholders.","Thank you for your attention. I'll turn it back to the moderator, so we can take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Due to the number of analysts joining us on the call today, we'll be limiting everyone to one primary question and one follow-up question to accommodate as many participants as possible. Thank you.","Our first question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your questions.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. In terms of the service performance, when do you expect to have the network back in balance? And could you quantify for us the impact of the inefficiencies in the second quarter?","James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning. It's Jim. Let me take a first stab at that. We've made significant improvements in service in the second quarter. Velocity and terminal dwell are both trending favorably and we're making a lot of headway on our internal composite service metric as well. So we continue to \u2013 we expect that trend to continue in the second half as well, in the third quarter and through the fourth quarter. And that will continue to be our goal to push service ever higher.","Mark, would you like to comment next?","Mark D. Manion - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Only to say we've made a lot of progress. I mean if you think about it what we've accomplished so far, we're about 90% of the way toward our \u2013 what has been our historical high in the past. And we have every intention of getting all the way there, so.","James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Marta, why don't you comment on the resource implications in the second half?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Yes. We had estimated that our service-related costs in the second quarter would $25 million. And it turns out that that estimate was pretty much dead on. We \u2013 most of that \u2013 we estimate that most of that is in compensation and benefits. $15 million of the $25 million is there.","I talked about the two major things in that $15 million. And that is the higher-than-usual level of trainees, which we expect some of that to continue into the third quarter and the other one is additional labor hours. The remaining $10 million of service-recovery costs are scattered in various categories in about $3 million to $4 million increments. We have a little bit more fuel than we would have had otherwise. Our equipment rents were impacted by about $3 million due to the velocity, and then purchase services and travel cost. So those are all the components of the $25 million.","Going forward, Allison, we think that we will just have about $5 million of that hanging over into the third quarter. And that is primarily, as Mark described, as we work our trainees into our regular qualified fleet, we still will have a slightly elevated level of training.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thank you. And just my follow-up question, what was the split between export met and thermal coal during the second quarter? And do you have any sense of what you're thinking for this in the second half?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Allison, this is Alan. The split was about three-quarters met, and one-quarter steam thermal coal. And going forward, we've got it down to about 3 million tons per quarter, and it's going to be a function of foreign exchange rates. And the two indices that we watch closely which are the Queensland Coking Coal for met and then the API 2 for thermal.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Excellent. Thank you so much for the time.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.","Alexander Vecchio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. It's Alex Vecchio in for Bill. So you mentioned that you expect the domestic utility coal to run about 20 million tons per quarter and you lowered the export coal run rate to about 3 million tons. You also talked a little bit about some other commodities. But when we kind of take it all together can you give us a sense of what's embedded in your expectations for total volumes on a year-over-year basis in the back half of 2015? Do you think 4Q volumes might be positive on an easier comp, or should we be expecting kind of volume declines to persist for the balance of the year?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","We see some fundamental growth in many of our markets, which we expect to continue into the second half of the year. The overhang we're going to see is the fuel surcharge revenue that Marta referenced, which is going to kind of mask the core pricing gains and the volume growth that we're seeing in other markets.","Alexander Vecchio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Do you have a sense for like how the total carloads might track, though, in the back half?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","We expect that it'll be up over last year.","Alexander Vecchio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then just specifically on the lowered expectations for 4Q revenues to be actually down year-over-year instead of I think slightly up was your prior expectation. Is that entirely attributable to either the export coal and fuel surcharge or are there other areas that kind of contributed to that slightly lower outlook on the fourth quarter?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Good question. The other primary driver of that would be reduced crude oil volumes. And you can see that very easily as you take a look at Brent and WTI pricing.","Alexander Vecchio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks very much for the time.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey. Thanks. Morning.","James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning, Scott.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","So, Marta, you guys have been giving a little bit more transparency, which has been helpful. Wondering if you have a comfort kind of telling us that second quarter is the bottom for earnings and we should see sequential earnings improvement from second quarter to third quarter or if maybe from a margin standpoint, we see less of a margin headwind from \u2013 in third quarter than we did in second quarter, if you feel comfortable there. And then maybe specifically on the $47 million of lower incentive and stock-based comp, do you have any rough guidance on that for the third quarter and fourth quarter?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Okay. Well, let me start with the second question first. The stock-based comp did have a very large decrease in the second quarter of this year, and that's primarily because of the comp with the second quarter of last year. As you know, that was an all-time high quarter for us and so the accruals that quarter were very high, therefore, the relative comparisons. Going forward into the third quarter and fourth quarter, we think we still will have favorable comparisons in that line item, but they won't be to the degree they were in the second quarter.","And then moving on to the rest of the year, kind of overall, and I think it's really driven by the things Alan discussed with coal and crude. But we expect that some of the comps will get a little bit easier otherwise, and so, we do expect a somewhat of an improvement going into the back half.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Volume comps will improve as we get deeper into the second half of the year.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe one last one for Jim or Alan, just big picture as I think back the past five years or so. You guys have seen some of the better volume growth in the industry, but yield growth has lagged the other rails. Do you see that changing or the focus changing where you start to get more pricing and maybe sacrifice a little bit of volume going forward?","James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Scott, it's Jim. Yeah. I think you put your finger on the issue in the second quarter in particular, and for the balance of the year, albeit the next couple of quarters ought to be less worse. And so, yes, we certainly are going to lean into revenue per unit growth. The encouraging thing about even the second quarter was outside of coal, growth in revenue ex-fuel surcharge impacts, and we would expect that to continue for the balance of the year.","So we're seeing that positive trend in overall mix. And we're going to continue to push on that along with core pricing. We're satisfied with the level of core price increases that we have experienced so far this year. And we're going to continue to push that based on market conditions at a rate better than real cost inflation.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Barnes with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.","John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. A couple of things on the service side, going back there for just a second. You talked about crew starts still being up in the quarter despite carloads being down on a year-over-year basis. Are you getting towards a better ratio of crew starts to carloads and is that where you start to see that improvement from, say, that $25 million drag to the $5 million drag on the efficiency cost?","James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Mark, why don't you take that one?","Mark D. Manion - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. I'd be glad to. We are seeing improvement particularly as we got into the latter part of May and June. And we think that we'll continue to see improvement as the velocity of the railroad picks up and obviously helps the crew starts. We really, in a big way, reduced our re-crews these last couple of months. We feel that trend will continue.","John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. Very well. And then, lastly, as my follow-up, the other rails have all \u2013 as part of their earnings announcements \u2013 have been pretty vocal about furloughs and locomotives and storage. You didn't provide really near the degree of color around that. Is it that you haven't really started the furlough plan yet? Is it that you're still winding through and dealing with the service so you haven't yet started that? And the same thing on locos, I mean, it sounds like you put some in storage, but can you give us a feel for maybe the numbers in storage and where you stand on just resources kind of in the pipeline?","Mark D. Manion - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Sure. I'd be glad to. First of all, on the locomotive side, we have begun storing. We're at about 50 locomotives in storage right now. And we're going to be able to continue storing. I'd like to see us get up in the 200 range, not sure just how quickly we can do that, but that's the plan. And again as the velocity improves, it'll help us do that.","On the crews side, we haven't furloughed because we haven't had the need to furlough. We're trying to be really measured and balanced as far as the hiring goes. And we're getting this, as I indicated in the remarks, we are reaching that point where we are about at a balance and we are tapering off on the hiring now. But \u2013 and we will probably see \u2013 we're beginning to see indications in just very few select spots where there would be a possibility of furlough going forward, but I don't think it's going to be a big number.","And if you look back through history, our number on the furlough side just hasn't been quite as high as what some of the other railroads experience. So we'll see how it goes. But I don't think we're going to have a big furlough number. We're trying to hire the right number of people.","James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would characterize our resource plan in the second half as one of stabilization. And you heard Mark say earlier that we're trending towards attrition-based hiring in the second half. Similarly, we're starting to put locomotives up. We have a few more units coming online, but very few.","And we can pivot on resources if we have to. If we see the trend in car loadings moving against us, then we can obviously pivot quickly in resources. And we demonstrated that in the second quarter by reducing our capital spending for the year as Marta mentioned now, and we're doing so without hurting the long-term prospects of the enterprise or really disrupting our reinvestment plan. But we certainly can modulate resources and we will if necessary.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your questions.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Can you maybe comment a little bit more about pricing? You kind of highlighted that sequentially. I think we saw a bit of a step-up in the pricing dynamic. I just wanted to get a rough sense of sort of maybe how big is \u2013 what the magnitude of that was and maybe how you think about sort of the opportunity. How much more do we have as we go through this year? Does it still feel like sort of the underlying businesses where you are getting growth or still relatively ripe for that?","James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Chris. I will let Alan address that.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Certainly. Chris, we are seeing market-based pricing that is generally above rail inflation. And the good point for us is that we're seeing it in our growth markets. We're seeing it in intermodal where our RPU was up \u2013 ex-fuel, was up 3% in the second quarter. And we expect that kind of growth to continue. There's a latent demand for rail capacity out there. And the prices that we're putting out into the market are holding and we expect that to continue.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. And then when you think about the buyback in the second half of the year, you've stepped forward, I think, in the first half, so far and bought back a decent amount of shares. I guess when you think about sort of the second half outlook, should we expect more of the same? Just want to get a rough sense at these levels or how you see that opportunity playing out.","James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Marta, why don't you take that one?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","So, we have previously guided to a full year share buyback of $1.2 billion and we're still on track for that.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. So that's the way we should think about the back half.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","That's correct.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead with your questions.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you very much and good morning, everyone. I wanted to touch on intermodal a little bit. You referred to it, obviously, as one of your growth markets, and obviously, it's done well over the last couple years. Wanted to ask, have you guys lost a little share back to the trucking market? We've seen some of the major truckload carriers add a little capacity out here and the East is a little bit more competitive.","James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We'll let Alan address the specifics of the volume trend in the second quarter. But let me just say intermodal will continue to be one of our growth opportunities \u2013 truckload diversions in general both intermodally and in our merchandise sectors as well. And the other really encouraging thing about the intermodal revenue trend now is the increase in revenue per unit, as Alan mentioned earlier. Alan?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Number one, we are facing pretty difficult comps. Our intermodal franchise grew 11% in the second quarter of last year. And so, we posted growth on top of that.","Truck capacity, as you noted, has improved, but it still trails demand. And you can see that empirically in the fact that truckload pricing continues to move up, which gives us not only a good outlook for what our volumes are going to look like long term, but also what our price is going to look like.","We are seeing really strong growth on our internationals segment where our customers are shifting more volume to our East Coast partners. So that's a bonus for us. And long term, we feel really good about our intermodal market with respect to growth opportunities in both volume and in pricing.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC","And that stuff that shifted to the East Coast, how sticky do you think that business is going to be for Norfolk?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Some of it is. Certainly, there will be some that moves back to the West Coast, which is only natural but the percentage of volume move into the East Coast ports while it was in the very low-30%s will probably move up to 33%, 34%. So there's growth opportunity for our East Coast ports.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC","Perfect. A little follow-up here for Marta. Marta, I think you alluded to the fact that your relocation cost for Roanoke was $5 million in the quarter. And I think you said you expect $30 million for the remainder of the year at most in 3Q. If you exclude those relocation costs in 3Q, how should we look at sort of your margins on a sequential basis for the railroad?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","I think the \u2013 and Mark can speak more to, has spoken more to how the system, we expect the fluidity to improve. So I think the main thing that you will see is that those service recovery costs that we quantified at $25 million in the second quarter, we only expect $5 million of those as we work through our higher levels of trainees to remain in the third quarter. So you should expect the others to fall off: the extra overtime, the extra re-crews that he spoke about, that sort of thing. Those we do not expect to continue in the second half.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. So, sequentially, if we exclude the Roanoke cost, it should look okay compared to 2Q then?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Yes.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC","Fantastic. Thank you for your time as always.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead with your questions.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yeah. Good morning. So, I wanted to focus a little more on seasonality now that you've reported a full quarter with the fuel surcharge headwind, and presumably as steep as it can get with the WTI-based programs with the $64 trigger now at zero. The volume trend on a year-over-year basis seems to be stabilizing; the service levels are improving as you talked about earlier. So, looking forward, second half is consistently seasonally stronger than the first half for you guys. But the Street consensus is modeling second half versus first half earnings increased at a pretty steep level. It looks like the steepest since 2009. So, just from a high level, do you think \u2013 are you looking for an above seasonal outcome in the second half year?","James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Bascome as we said earlier, we do expect second half results to be less worse than we experienced in the first half. However, we still do face some significant headwinds, particularly in the third quarter. Fuel surcharge revenue in the third quarter of last year was still running strong, just below second quarter fuel surcharge levels in 2014 \u2013 pardon me, just above so actually, it's a little bit tougher headwind in the third quarter. In addition, we do have the extra Roanoke-related expenses we flagged. In other areas of expenses, we would expect a more favorable trend.","Alan, would you like to comment?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think, that we are going to see \u2013 we'll have better comps in the fourth quarter with respect to volume than we will in the third quarter. And we're still right now exposed to foreign exchange risk and the prices \u2013 mainly the commodities that we handle, and we see that with coal and \u2013 with coal, crude oil and steel right now.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","All right. Thanks for the color, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Thanks. If I could turn the discussion a little bit back to the intermodal side of the business particularly the domestic side, how much do you think that, in terms of the volume growth deceleration, was a result of some of the pricing initiatives, service not being quite where you guys wanted, although it's continuing to get better as well as just some softer broad-based demand that we saw last quarter.","James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Alan, why don't you comment on that?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. As we take a look at our second quarter domestic intermodal business, I think the headwinds and the factors that limited our growth are temporary. Number one is the West Coast port issue. As you were probably aware, much of or a high percentage of the volume that comes in the West Coast in 40-foot containers gets re-stuffed into 53-foot boxes and moves transcon, anywhere between 25% and 40%. That would show up normally in our domestic volumes, but did not this quarter. So that was a limiting factor, particularly early in the quarter.","And then while we didn't lose business to truck due to service, it limited our ability to grow. And we're working hard, we're improving our service, and we think that will be behind us.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And do you think that some of the pricing initiatives that you guys kind of undertook did have an impact one way or the other in terms of the domestic volumes?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","No. We see that truckload pricing is actually up this year. Our customers are increasing their pricing. And so, it's just the overall healthy environment for pricing and the truck market right now. It's just not growing as much as it did this time last year.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And would you expect pricing as we look out to next year to be in line with kind of what you're experiencing this year? Or do you expect that to potentially improve, given the better service proposition? Or are you a little bit cautious about some of the more balanced supply\/demand in the truckload marketplace?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I'll address that long term. We feel that the fundamentals are there for long term for increased demand for highway-to-rail conversions. We're taking a long-term view of this as our customers when we sit down and we figure out our relationship going forward and the need to ensure rail capacity and pricing.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right. Thanks so much for the time.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Matt Troy with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead with your questions.","Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to ask a question about intermodal and specifically the peak season. We've heard mix messages across the freight ecosystem about an inventory build in retail. We've certainly heard that from retail as substantially impacting volumes in June. Some folks expressing optimism, if you will, about a peak season perhaps being a little bit later, but it's just that optimism. I was just wondering based on the hard and real conversations you're having with your customers, what's your sense for the traditional peak? I know it's flattened in the last several years, but is it something that we should expect to see emerge in the third quarter? Is the initial read that it will be somewhat disappointing? I just wanted to get a sense of what your planning was given the resources on the network and your conversations with customers.","James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks and good morning, Matt. Alan, what's your sense of peak?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, as Matt had noted, it's relatively flat now and it's spread over the entire year over the last couple of years. Generally, peak, for us, has been associated with their national volumes that largely shows up in August and September. And as we've noted, our international volumes are really healthy right now. We've got a good franchise; customers are shifting more international volume to the East Coast ports. So there's opportunity for growth for us in the \u2013 in August and September in our international franchise.","Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. And that international share gain obviously contributing to that, just \u2013 I'm wondering if you could help us, from a mix perspective, is that comparable in terms of length of haul versus when you're getting hand-off traffic from the West Coast carriers? Is it mix negative in that it might be a little bit shorter or is it moving further inland and actually into West Coast markets? Just wondering about that share gain and just what it meant from a mix implication on that Newport volume that have been diverted.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I wouldn't say it's negative. It does allow us to generate more revenue density on a train and to the extent that we can provide more efficient service associated with that, then it certainly makes it more truck competitive.","Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. Got it. Thank you, everybody.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Good morning. Alan, just a little bit on the \u2013 on coal again. Just \u2013 you've seen accelerating downtick on your volumes overall \u2013 total volumes, almost 4% quarter-to-date. So is there anything dragging coal down further given you're down about 20% quarter-to-date? I get the 3 million ton outlook on international and that accelerates to \u2013 down, I don't know, 40%, 45% year-on-year. But are we seeing something on the domestic side? Maybe you could address on the utilities side a little bit.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","All right. Ken, I think we're still going to hold firm with our projection of 20 million tons for domestic. That will be \u2013 and that's over the next 18 months to 24 months. So, it's going to be subject to weather conditions and just general demand. But, no, we really haven't seen anything right now on the domestic debt is any more alarming than what we've already guided to.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But you are seeing an accelerating down \u2013 I mean, right, we are seeing an acceleration on the downside?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","For the first couple of weeks of this quarter, our domestic volumes are down versus last year, but we still feel good about 20 million tons for the quarter.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then on the domestic side, I just want to revisit the individual lanes; can you talk about growth on the Crescent versus the Heartland and kind of where you're seeing that? Are you seeing growth differentials between the different lanes?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","We are seeing \u2013 our primary growth drivers right now are on Crescent and on Heartland.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Can you provide us the updates like you used to on percentages, or do you no longer provide that level of detail?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","We've seen Crescent and Heartland quarter volumes along with other targeted quarter volumes rise in line with the trends that we have seen the last couple of quarters if I recall. So, for example, Crescent was up 6% in the quarter, better than the overall domestic intermodal trend, Heartland was up 2%.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Just if I can follow up on the first one, Alan, just to let it go at this, but if we are at 20 million tons on domestic, I just want to understand, is that utility and steel and industrial or are you talking 20 million utility alone?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Ken, that would be 20 million utility alone.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. So then, you're \u2013 just if you get the 3 million tons and 20 million utility \u2013 okay. Just there's quite a large differential between where you're trending now. So you're looking for a pretty big snap up in the last two months of the quarter, I guess, then?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. All right. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please go ahead with your question.","Brian Colley - Stephens, Inc.","Morning. This is actually Brian Colley on the call for Justin. So just wanted to talk about the negative mix impact we're seeing from coal, particularly with intermodal being the largest driver to carload increases for the rails. If this trend doesn't really have an end in sight, are there structural changes or pricing efforts where we could see you get more aggressive in order to mitigate this negative mix impact?","James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we certainly did see an effect from mix at a high level in the second quarter. And with coal being down as much as it was, that creates a challenge for us in terms of improving margin and growing the bottom line. With that said, our longer-term outlook is for coal volumes to stabilize. And now, we've guided down on the export side of the business for the foreseeable future. Now, that's been historically a very volatile part of the business. But the good news is, we think that we have seen and are at the bottom in terms of utility coals \u2013 the volume may vary from quarter-to-quarter depending on weather, in particular, but we think $20 million is a reasonable run rate at least for the next 12 months to 18 months or so.","So, that would imply stabilization. We'll wait and see. Eventually, we will see supply come out of global market and we should see it boost the export coal volume as well. And that will help with the mix. In the meantime, we're going to grow intermodal, and we will grow merchandise volumes. That's one of three parts to our overall strategy: grow the top lines through pricing based on market conditions at a rate better than rail inflation; grow volume particularly intermodal and merchandise volume profitably. And secondly, we're going to work on return on capital by prioritizing capital spending in favor of revenue growth opportunities and profit margin. And third service. Continuing to improve service is really the key to both the top line growth and better returns on capital as well.","Brian Colley - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks. And if I could just follow up real quick on that. I mean, just some of the rails have talked about this incremental margin framework of around 50% longer-term. Is that the right way to think about your business once we start to see volumes increase on a year-over-year basis? And if so, is that incremental margin framework only achievable at coal environment that's at least flat or stabilized?","James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We do believe 50% incremental margin is a reasonable goal going forward. Now, that certainly \u2013 it would certainly (54:09) if coal volumes do in fact stabilize.","Brian Colley - Stephens, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your questions.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities","Thanks very much, and good morning. I was just wondering if you could offer some thoughts on where you think head count will end the year versus last year.","James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Marta?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Okay. So, previously, in our January and our April calls, we guided to the fact that we thought we would increase 1,000 in total from the fourth quarter of last year average. And we still think we're on that run rate. So if you look at the fourth quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year, we were up 500, then sequentially the first quarter to the second quarter another 100. So, net we're up 600 through June 30. So we expect that in the third quarter and fourth quarter, we'll be up an additional 400.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities","Okay. That's helpful. And then I think you have indicated that it's your intention over time to convert to on-highway, diesel-based fuel surcharge programs. Just wondering if you can provide any update on your progress year-to-date on that.","James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll let Alan address that. That is a goal. We recognize that there's been a bit of a mismatch in having our revenues fuel surcharges based on WTI with expense obviously based on diesel prices.","So, Alan, why don't you talk about our plan for reducing some of that volatility?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","One way to reduce the volatility would be to shift the benchmark from WTI base to an on-highway diesel. We're going to approach that with our customers as individual contracts expire. The average duration of our contract is a little bit over three years. So it is going to take some time to make a meaningful shift in that. And we are also committed during that time period not to sacrifice market-based pricing for premature shift in the fuel surcharge program.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities","Okay. Thank you. That's all for me.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your questions.","Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Thanks. Marta, real quick, could I get your perspective on the dividend? I noticed on Friday the announced dividend for 3Q was flat relative to 2Q. It looked like that was the first time that has been the case sequentially, 2Q to 3Q since 2009. Can you talk about some of the components that drove that decision not to raise the dividend sequentially and maybe just provide perspective on what you expect the dividend policy to be going forward?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Well, our dividend policy just overall \u2013 stepping back \u2013 our dividend policy long term is to \u2013 is a one-third payout ratio. So, in the past, we have sometimes raised the dividend in July and sometimes not. So that's not really a departure from what we've done over the years. You're correct that the last couple of years, we have raised in January and July. So we feel comfortable with the $0.59. We feel comfortable where we are with our payout ratio, and then the future of course will be guided by our future profitability.","Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Investment Research. Please go ahead with your questions.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Hey, Alan, maybe just to \u2013 could you talk a little bit about the coal pricing trends in the fuel business, sort of ex-fuel. That number was down a lot \u2013 a little bit more than it has been in the past. I'm just wondering if that was all fuel decline or if you're also seeing some negative mix or some possible price declines in there.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, could you repeat that?","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Well, as you think about the coal pricing ex-fuel?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Coal?","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Yeah. There were \u2013 we did see a decline in our pricing with respect to coal. A lot of that has to do with mix changes as you know, export tends to be a longer haul move for us than utility. So, a 38% decline in export, coal volumes in the quarter is going to have a disproportionate impact on our overall RPU ex-fuel.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So it was predominantly mix? There wasn't another step down in export rates or any pricing action on the utility coal business in the quarter?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","I would say, it was \u2013 it's predominantly mix. We're looking at each of our individual moves individually with our customers. And applying market intel and analytics to figure out what drives the best results for our shareholders.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And then I guess as you think about the volume guidance for the back half of the year, I think you said you're expecting overall volume to be up year-over-year in light of the accelerating coal headwind and crude maybe moderating. Are you expecting a pickup in economic activity? Or is there something specific that you can point to that would give you confidence on the volume growth? Or is it just a case of the comps moderating?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. And let me be clear. That's more towards the fourth quarter of the year than the third quarter. We've got some heavy comps also in the third quarter. Last year, we handled over 24 million tons in the third quarter of the year into our utility market, which may \u2013 going back to Ken's question previously may be one of the reasons he's looking at some pretty hefty negative comps in our coal market. So comps will improve for us. We still see strength in many of the markets that we talked about with respect to intermodal, housing, energy-related, the NGLs out of Marcellus and Utica, and automotive.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. So the \u2013 but from an economic perspective, you're sort of still expecting kind of slow, steady growth? You're not expecting \u2013 you're not hearing anything that would tell you that there's like a reacceleration or anything at the back half?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","No, we're not. And you know the overhang of the oil and gas industry is weighing on manufacturing, but consumer spending is up, but nothing extraordinary.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead with your questions.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning. Jim, I wanted to ask you a question. It's \u2013 I guess notable, you did lower the CapEx number this year. And I know that sometimes that's tricky to do when you're in the midst of a year and you have to plan these things ahead of time. So that's notable.","Do you think your approach in terms of managing the company is going to be a little more aggressive in terms of paring back on CapEx versus maybe what we've seen over the last eight years or so, 10 years? Is that a fair way to look at it? And if so, how would you think about 2016-2017 CapEx? Could those fall a bit from where we're at this year?","James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Tom. Let me comment first on the 2016 mid-year reduction. We did make the decision to reduce capital somewhat this year. I wouldn't make too much of it. It was a rather modest 5% reduction, but we saw an opportunity and we jumped on it. We're trying to be disciplined with our capital spending. And as I said, target revenue growth with our CapEx and profit margin.","Going forward, we will try to manage capital spending ex-PTC down to about 15% to 17% of sales. Now, that may take a while. That's a big change from the level of capital spending where we've been. But we recognize the need to be judicious with capital reinvestments. We're committed to the business. We're absolutely going to reinvest in core assets on a steady-state basis, but we will also be mindful of the need to drive returns through better capital turnover as well. And that means prioritizing capital toward revenue growth.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Right. So that doesn't sound like a big change, but maybe somewhat of a tweak in terms of the way you look at CapEx?","James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. Exactly.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then as a follow-up, and I think, Jim, this is probably for you and for you Alan. What about on pricing? Is there also room for not a major change, but a little bit of a tweak where you say we're going to be a little bit more focused on price versus volume whereas in the past we've been looking at both price and volume, but maybe a little bit more focused on volume?","James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I wouldn't say we've held back in terms of our pricing emphasis in the past. So no real change there either. But we are determined to raise prices in line with market opportunities and market conditions at a rate better than rail inflation. That is our goal. We recognize that that's a vital part of growing our top line.","Alan, you want to comment on that?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I would say that, looking forward, particularly in our growth markets, price and volume are not mutually exclusive. We're investing long term. Our customers are \u2013 see the same issues in the trucking industry that we do. And they're looking for long-term partnerships.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. So, no real change in price versus volume for you guys versus the prior team. Obviously, you're part of the prior team, but I'm just saying given your \u2013 you know you could tweak things on the margin given your new positions.","James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Listen, we want both. We want both pricing and volume growth. And we think we can get both. We're going to lean into pricing. We recognize that's critical part of growing the top line. But we see lots of volume growth opportunities out there as well. Truck conversions will continue to be central to our volume growth strategy, and that means intermodal but also carload. So, yes pricing, yes volume growth.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Right. Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead with your questions.","Brandon Robert Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question here. Alan, I hate to keep harping on this, but it does look like in the last five weeks or so, and this is really near term, by the way, but your volume run rate has definitely steps below 150,000 units per week.","So, from our perspective, it looks like things are sequentially deteriorating. And I know you're calling for sequential improvement. So is there something about the last six months or two months that we shouldn't be that concerned with that will come back in your network as we go through the fourth quarter this year?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","No. I would say we are keeping a very watchful eye on it. And a lot of the decline that we've seen over the last four weeks to six weeks as you've noted has been associated with our export coal franchise, which we've previously discussed.","Brandon Robert Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Appreciate that. And, Jim, I guess following up on that line of questions there. Norfolk has seen pretty good volume growth the last five years under Wick, and obviously, the OR was flat. I know you had a lot of coal headwinds through that period. You did say that you think coal markets are at a bottom. But I feel like we've had that conversation on this call for three years or four years now where we think things have bottomed, but then natural gas prices go lower or another external shock happens with coal and we're again facing that same headwind. I'm sure it's not lost on you that your OR is now probably the highest amongst the major railroads here that are publicly-traded. So what can investors expect from you as CEO? Are we going to aggressively attack the OR with cost reductions even if coal doesn't stabilize from here?","James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You bet. I mean, we absolutely are determined to lower our operating ratio. I think we have the ability to do so. And let me just reiterate, our strategy here, it's a three parts strategy. The first thing we're going to do is grow the top line. Now, that'll obviously be easier if coal volume stabilize. But we're determined to grow volume and pricing. And secondly, we are going to push on return on capital by prioritizing capital spending around revenue growth, recognizing that it is in capital turnover where we have lagged in the past few years.","And third, service is the key to all of this. And I'm really pleased to report that we saw service and network improvements in the second quarter. We expect those to continue in the second half. So, the way we look at it, there's been progress evident on all fronts in terms of the top line growth with the exception of coal which faces clear near-term headwinds. We did see growth in merchandise and intermodal revenue ex-fuel surcharges. So that's very positive.","Secondly, in terms of return on capital, longer-term story, but we demonstrated our willingness to take a look at our capital spending plan in the second quarter, and we will continue to do so in line with our previous comments. And third, service is the key of it all, and we saw service improvements in the second quarter, which we expect to persist in the second half.","Brandon Robert Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your questions.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you and good morning. Thanks for taking my call. So, on the strength of merchandise, I just wanted to ask for a bit of characterization of the NGL market opportunity out of the Marcellus and Utica. It looks like chemicals was clearly a good area for carload growth this quarter. How early do you think you are in pursuing that opportunity? Are there other fractionators, other facilities coming online? And maybe from a mix perspective, if you could characterize kind of the length of haul relative to the overall portfolio?","James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Alan, why don't you tackle that one?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. There is additional capacity coming online in the fractionator area, also with current fractionators expanding. And so, we continue to see growth in that. The length of haul is really no different from what else we're handling. I will tell you in the chemical arena, the other headwind we are facing though is crude oil. And that's been another decline for us in the last couple of weeks. So back to the earlier question of what's changed in the last four weeks to six weeks, it's effectively export coal and crude oil.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then just one quick follow-up on coal and maybe just answer some of the questions about the possibility for it to improve in the third quarter and beyond. Where the inventory levels at the utilities? I think in the past quarter is around 70 days for the South, which is right around target. The North was a little bit above where average was. And if you could just update us with those numbers.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. On average, the utility stockpiles are about 20 days above target, about 25 days up in the North and 15 days in the South.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And South target is 70 or so and the North is 50 roughly?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Right.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.

Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you very much. Hey, guys. Quick question, I want to go back to the question you had on length of haul and mix in the coal franchise. I understand the export tends to be longer-haul coal and that would be mix impact. But when I'm running the algebra, it looks like your length of haul was down almost 7%, 8% on the coal franchise? I'm just doing basic math dividing revenue ton miles by tons. Can you talk about some of the other mix elements going on? Because I thought the story was we're sourcing more out of Illinois, a little less out of Central App. In theory, that should have been additive to length of haul. So could you discuss a little bit more on what's going on with mix in the coal area?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. We did have some spot moves in the second quarter of last year that were longer length of haul. And our utility South network tends to be a little bit longer length of haul than our utility in North.","Jeff A. Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. So that was the primary driver of the mix differential. And does that continue into 3Q? Or was that more of a second quarter effect?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, it depends upon are you comparing it sequentially? Or are you comparing it year-over-year?","Jeff A. Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Let's go year-over-year.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Then I would say that that does continue into the third quarter.","Jeff A. Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And then Ken Hoexter's question similarly, you identified the 20 million as just being domestic utility, the 3 million being export. So, really no change in your view in terms of coke, iron ore or domestic industrial?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Right. Correct. Which also, to your point, tends to be a shorter length of haul.","Jeff A. Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Right. And fewer tons per car. Guys, thanks.","James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Welcome.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your questions.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning. Can you hear me all right?","James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Good morning, Cleo.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning. My first question relates to merchandise yields. With (01:11:27) down 10% year-over-year and a continuation of the first quarter, perhaps down low single-digit ex-fuel. Can you help us understand any change in trend there in terms of mix and same-store sales into the second half and maybe next year? Thank you.","James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Cleo, actually, RPU, excluding fuel surcharge in the merchandise segment was favorable in the second quarter.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","I was referring to revenue-per-ton mile what people may also call yield.","James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Revenue-per-ton mile. Well, let me just say that our expectation is that we will see a continuation of core pricing, same-store sales pricing at a rate in line with market conditions and better-than-real inflation. And so, that's a trend that you saw when looking at it at the level of RPU, ex fuel surcharges in the second quarter. And as we've said, we expect that to persist especially in merchandise but also in intermodal in the second half.","Alan, did you want to add anything to that?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I'd say that were some mix impacts. We've seen declines in steel, which we've commented on and frac sand, which didn't have a higher RPU for us. So there's a negative mix impact there.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And those maybe should stabilize into year-end? Should we enter some kind of normalized comps next year?","James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","These mix impacts come and go. There is no longer-term negative mix trend under way that we can see. There were certainly some mix noise in the first quarter, a little bit in the second quarter as well. But overall, we saw our progress where it counts and that's in revenue per unit growth excluding the effects of fuel surcharges outside of coal.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","I appreciate it. And then, my follow up relates to the coal outlook longer-term, you said you saw some stabilization 12 months to 18 months out. But as we look to gas capacity additions coming on in 2017 and 2018, do you see a need to potentially adjust your network ahead of that, or you do not see those representing a big threat to the coal volume domestically? Thank you.","James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The outlook gets cloudier the further we go out. And looking beyond 12 months to 18 months, we certainly do see the potential for further encouragement of gas on our network due to new gas-fired generation. And, yes, we will and we are currently looking at our coal related assets, those would fall into a couple of buckets. Our coal car fleet, we had several years ago plans to replace coal cars pretty aggressively. We've basically been able to eliminate that from our capital budget, given the trend in coal volumes. Our coal track network is certainly under review as well and we have other coal facilities that we're taking a look at, looking out even beyond the 12 months to 18 months.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","I greatly appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tom Kim of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Tom Kim - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning. Thanks. I had a couple of questions on intermodal. I guess, just first off on the international side, we obviously have seen that the big benefit with the West Coast port disruptions the effect of it being resolved. And I guess as we look forward to the second half of the year, what do you think a reasonable growth rate for international intermodal should be? I mean, would it be safe to assume something close to GDP is sort of reasonable?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Typically, we've said that international will grow at 1 times to 1.5 times GDP to the extent that there's a greater shift towards East Coast ports certainly at least in the near-term, we have the opportunity for growth that's above that.","Tom Kim - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's really helpful. And I guess as we look a little bit further forward and supposedly the Panama Canal expansion should be completed first half next year, I would think that this should drive more business to the Gulf and to the East Coast, but I'm wondering what's your perspective around the puts and takes around the intermodal side of the business. Thanks.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Did you say Gulf and the East Coast?","Tom Kim - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. The U.S. Gulf and the East Coast.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. We've already seen a shift as many of these vessels are used in the Suez Canal to hit the East Coast. And the West Coast labor disruption shifted even more. So, the Panama Canal could certainly help. We don't think that that's going to be a threat to our international franchise.","Tom Kim - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That makes sense. Just to clarify then, so you're basically assuming that the share shift has effectively been done given that some of the big liners already moving capacities through the Suez?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I would say much of it has been done. There is still some that's being implemented right now, which is why we're seeing pretty strong growth in our international franchise.","Tom Kim - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. All right. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I will turn the floor back to Mr. Jim Squires for closing remarks.","James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right. Well, thank you, everyone. We appreciate your participation in today's call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Michael Hostutler, Norfolk Southern Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may now begin.","Michael Hostutler ","Thank you, Shea, and good afternoon. Before we begin today's call, I would like to mention a few items. First, the slides of the presenters are available on our website at nscorp.com in the Investors section. Additionally, transcripts and MP3 downloads of today's call will be posted on our website for your convenience.","Please be advised that any forward-looking statements made during the course of the call represent our best good-faith judgment as to what may occur in the future. Statements that are forward-looking can be identified by the use of words such as believe, expect, anticipate and project. Our actual results may differ materially from those projected and will be subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which may be outside of our control. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for discussions of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important.","Additionally, keep in mind that all references to reported results, excluding certain adjustments, that is non-GAAP numbers, have been reconciled on our website in the Investors section.","Now it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern Chairman and CEO, Wick Moorman.","Charles W. Moorman","Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. It's also my pleasure to welcome you to our Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. With me today are several members of our senior team, including Jim Squires, our newly appointed President; Don Seale, our Chief Marketing Officer; Mark Manion, our Chief Operating Officer; and John Rathbone, our Chief Financial Officer. As usual, Don, Mark and John will provide commentary in their respective areas, and then all of us will be available for your questions.","Norfolk Southern's earnings for the quarter were $1.46 per share, a decrease of 9% compared with last year, but a very solid result in the face of some considerable headwinds year-over-year.","We continue to face a difficult environment in export coal, with loadings down 16% in the quarter. In addition, we had a $65 million headwind associated with the fuel revenue lag. As you will recall, second quarter of last year had a $61 million favorable fuel lag compared to this year's $4 million unfavorable.","Despite these 2 factors, the majority of our other businesses performed well in the quarter. Revenues other than coal were up 3%. Overall volumes were up 2%, as increases in Intermodal and merchandise traffic up 5% and 2%, respectively, were partly offset by the 4% decline in coal volume. Don will provide you with all of the revenue details in a few minutes.","Our system velocity and service products remained at a very high level. Our most recent customer survey confirms the value of our reliable and consistent service, with overall satisfaction increasing to a new all-time high. In addition to this positive external response, we see continued momentum in our service metrics. Terminal Dwell and system average speed both improved compared to a very good second quarter in 2012. Crew starts during the quarter were down 2% on the 2% increase in volume, and equipment rents declined $5 million or 7%.","As all of you know, a more efficient network allows us to better utilize our people and our physical assets, and Mark will outline some more specifics following Don's remarks.","Wrapping up the presentations will be John with an analysis of each of our expense categories. The continued focus on productivity and efficiency improvements kept operating expenses only 1% above last year as compared to a 3% increase in revenue ton miles and resulted in an operating ratio of 70.2%.","Now let me turn the program over to Don and the rest of the team, and I'll return with some closing remarks before we answer your questions.","Donald W. Seale","Thanks, Wick, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. During the second quarter, both our merchandise and Intermodal networks achieved all-time revenue records, up 2% and 4%, respectively, while coal revenue was impacted by declines in our export and southern utility market segments.","Our overall portfolio of business generated $2.8 billion in revenue, down $72 million or 3% compared to the second quarter of 2012. Total volume grew by 2% or 39,000 units, led by Intermodal, automotive and chemicals.","With respect to yield, revenue per unit declined by 5% due to a 14% decline in coal revenue per unit. Merchandise RPU was flat, and Intermodal revenue per unit was down 1% compared to second quarter of last year.","Unfavorable fuel surcharge revenue accounted for lower-than-average RPU gains in both merchandise and Intermodal. Negative mix in price, mostly associated with export coal, and negative mix within our utility markets accounted for $75 million of the overall revenue decline for the quarter, and fuel surcharge revenue was down $59 million year-over-year.","On the plus side, higher volume contributed a positive $62 million in revenue variance.","With respect to volume, on the next slide, shipments increased 2% for the quarter due to gains in Intermodal and merchandise, which offset a 4% decline in coal. Intermodal grew 5% with a strong domestic market, and merchandise results were mixed as chemicals and automotive were up 16% and 8%, respectively, which offset declines in metals, agricultural products and paper.","Now turning to our individual market segments. Coal revenue was $626 million in the quarter, down $129 million or 17% over last year due to weaker demand across most market segments and pricing pressure in the export coal sector.","Weak economic conditions in Europe, slower growth in Asia and excess coal supply across the globe impacted the seaborne markets for both thermal coal and metallurgical coal. And the weaker Australian dollar now down 13% against the U.S. dollar since January has driven increased Australian coal production and exports.","On a more positive note, our utility sector improved this quarter with an increase of 6,000 carloads or 3%. Stronger deliveries into the northern power region was up 18%, offsetting weak coal demand at southern plants, which were down 12%.","Coal demand at northern plants improved as stockpiles began to reach normal levels in the quarter. In the South, challenging coal dispatch economics and high stockpiles built in 2012 remained an impediment for coal demand, but we see some signs of improvement ahead.","Domestic metallurgical volumes were down 11% for the quarter due to weaker steel production and the continued impact of the RG Steel bankruptcy, a comp which we cleared on July 1 this year. And industrial coal volume was down 6% due to competition from gas and higher tons per car as higher efficiency equipment is deployed in this segment.","As I've shared with you in some of the past quarters, the next chart depicts change in volume in the quarter by coal market segment and relative differentials in length of haul in various market segments. For example, with longer-haul southern utility volume down 12% and shorter-haul northern utility volume up 18% in the second quarter, the relative differential in length of haul between these 2 market segments was a large driver of revenue per unit. The same impact was experienced with the decline in export coal volumes and market-based pricing during the quarter compared to second quarter 2012.","Turning to the next slide, with respect to changing coal production in each of the coal production basins, this next chart outlines our changing business mix since 2010. As you can see, our coal sourcing has moved from longer-haul locations like Central Appalachia to the Illinois Basin, which has 75% shorter-haul characteristics, again, profitable new business but impacting revenue per unit.","Over the next several quarters, we expect Illinois Basin coal to begin moving to longer-haul southern steam destinations, which will provide a better balance and length of haul.","Turning next to our Intermodal network. Revenue in the quarter reached an all-time high of $588 million, up $25 million or 4% over the second quarter of 2012, driven by 5% higher volumes. As depicted on Slide 7, the volume gains in Intermodal came from both domestic and international markets. Domestic volume was up 6% due to continued highway conversions and the opening of new Crescent Corridor lanes during the quarter. While organic growth across our international accounts boosted international volume by 2%.","As in previous quarters, we continue to improve the efficiency of our Intermodal network. The second quarter experienced a 4-percentage-point improvement over 2012 to reach 95% of all containers moving at double-stack service. This metric highlights loading efficiency and equipment utilization.","This trend, along with other measures, allows trains to carry a higher volume with reduced crew starts. During the quarter, crew starts were up 2% while volume increased by 5%. And for the month of June, NS reached an all-time record for the number of Intermodal units handled per road crew.","Also, as shown on the slide, much of our volume increase occurred over our Intermodal corridors as we launch new services. For example, the Heartland Corridor continues to generate double-digit growth, up 18% in the quarter, again reflecting the efficiency and productivity of Double Stack service from the Port of Virginia to the Ohio Valley.","Turning to our merchandise markets on Slide 9. Merchandise revenue was up 2%, reaching $1.6 billion for the quarter. This increase came as a result of 16% higher chemical volumes and an 8% gain in automotive volumes. Iron and steel carloads were down 19%, primarily driven by the reduction in import slabs, reflecting excess capacity in the domestic steel industry.","Coil steel was also down due to an unscheduled plant shutdown in April. As with coal, the RG Steel bankruptcy also continued to plague year-over-year comparisons, which we have now cleared.","On the positive side, aggregates and miscellaneous construction were up 6% and 2%, respectively.","Agriculture continues to be impacted by last year's poor crop due to the drought. Volumes fell as tight soybean supplies were partially offset by increases in corn, driven by increased volume from Iowa and Nebraska into the Midwest processing plants.","On the plus side, the current crop is shaping up to be a good one, which bodes well for increased shipping activity later this fall. 2013 corn acreage totals 97 million acres, the most planted since 1936.","Chemicals volume continues to rise with a 16% gain as compared to last year. This increase was driven by growth in the crude by rail business, which accounted for 20,000 shipments, a substantial increase up 51% sequentially from the first quarter.","Automotive volumes were up 8%, which was double the projected North American vehicle production in the quarter as new business and increased production at NS-served plants bolstered performance. And finally, the rebound in the housing market increased lumber volumes by 12%, which partially offset a 16% decline in graphic paper.","Now concluding with our outlook, the market ahead continues to be mostly positive, but we face continuing headwinds across most of our coal business. Competition from natural gas and flat-to-declining electricity demand will continue to impact our utility franchise. The firming natural gas prices reflect some relief for coal in utility dispatched curves, and we're seeing utility stockpiles move in the right direction.","With respect to export met coal demand, we see continued sluggish demand in Europe and slowing shipments into Asia. Asian shipments are further being impacted by the weakening Australian dollar and lower benchmark met coal price settlements. Also, thermal coal exports will face lower yields and volume associated with the weak API 2 index in the Northern Europe. In view of these challenges in both met and thermal coal exports, we expect continued headwinds for export volumes through the rest of the year with a softer third and fourth quarter than we experienced in the first half of the year.","And finally, regarding domestic met coal here in the U.S., we expect modestly improved comparisons for the balance of the year.","Turning to Intermodal in our outlook. We anticipate a continuation of solid opportunities for highway conversion as we launch new service lanes and ramp up volumes at our newly opened terminals. We also expect continued growth within our International segment, as we are well positioned with excellent terminal and double-stack opportunities across our network.","In merchandise, we continue to expect growth in 4 of our 5 business groups in the months ahead, led by chemicals, automotive and housing-related materials. Agriculture should generate additional volume in soybeans and corn beginning in the fourth quarter as a result of the new crop. And we expect modest increases, primarily in frac sand, in the Metals & Construction segment.","Wrapping up in summary, we expect that our diverse market base will generate volume growth ahead despite continuing challenges in the coal market and a slow growth economy. We also remain committed to market-based pricing at levels that equal or exceed the rate of rail inflation. Obviously, with current conditions in our coal business, this is a short-term challenge. But that doesn't alter the value of our strong service product across a very diverse set of markets where our pricing remains solid.","Thank you for your time, and I'll now turn it over to Mark for our operating report. Mark?","Mark D. Manion","Thank you, Don, and good afternoon, everyone. Starting with safety, based on preliminary data, our second quarter performance stands at 1.07. We are well into our second year of implementing behavior-based safety. And while our safety ratio has increased in the second quarter, we're confident we're doing the right things to reduce injuries in our workplace. We see more and more evidence of engagement in the safety process by our workforce, as well as the proactive management of safety.","Turning to service. Our composite service metric continues to show consistent high levels of service performance and year-over-year improvement. For the second quarter, composite performance stands at 83.7% and it represents a slight improvement over the second quarter last year and above a goal of 82.5%. These gains were achieved despite a more normal winter this year in the first quarter and a very active spring weather pattern with flooding and a series of storms in the Midwest.","These gains continue to be led by train performance, which improved 2.5% versus the same quarter last year, and in fact even with these challenges, all the service components, train performance, connection performance and plant adherence have consistently remained at or above historical highs.","Turning to the next slide. Spring weather patterns primarily impacted train speed, but overall train speed remained essentially flat but consistent with the high levels that we've seen over the last 1.5 years.","Turning to Terminal Dwell. The other major component of network velocity showed good improvement, about 2% over the same period last year. On our next slide, building on the progress we've seen over the last 6 quarters, improved velocity and other productivity initiatives are the drivers behind the improvements you see here. Overall, we have reduced crew starts 2% against a volume increase of 2% and a gross ton miles increase of 3%. Concurrently, we've reduced T&E overtime by 13%, in addition to a re-crew reduction of 14% over the same period last year.","Velocity-driven equipment rents have been reduced 3%, while carloads per locomotive have improved 4% and gross ton miles per gallon have improved 1% despite an unfavorable traffic mix change.","Turning to the next page. We continue to manage our manpower and asset base commensurate with our traffic volumes and improvements in network velocity. Our active T&E workforce stands at 11,444, that's a 5.5% reduction over last year.","From an asset perspective, we have 244 locomotives in storage. Simultaneously, we've been able to reduce our active locomotive count by 2% versus the second quarter last year. And finally, we have approximately 9,900 freight cars in storage.","In addition to the velocity and productivity improvements that we reviewed on the previous slide, we will continue to adjust the manpower and asset base in line with our traffic volumes. We also continue to push productivity initiatives on all fronts, targeting improvements while maintaining high levels of service and velocity.","Thank you. And now, John, I'll turn it over to you.","John P. Rathbone","Thank you, Mark. I'll now review our financial results for the second quarter. Let's start with our second quarter operating results. As Don described, our railway operating revenues for the quarter totaled $2.8 billion, down $72 million or 3% compared to last year's second quarter record. Our results included a $4 million unfavorable fuel surcharge lag effect, which is a $65 million decline compared to last year's $61 million favorable lag.","Railway operating expenses increased $26 million or 1% for the quarter on a volume increase of 2%. Income from railway operations totaled $836 million, down $98 million or 10%, and our operating ratio increased 2.7 percentage points to 70.2%.","Turning to our expenses. The next slide shows the components of the $26 million increase. Purchased services and rents increased $18 million or 5%, reflecting higher expenses in shared Conrail operating areas, increased roadway maintenance repairs and greater haulage and other transportation activities.","For the sixth consecutive quarter, equipment rents were lower as we continue to see benefits from improved network performance and fewer equipment leases.","Materials and others increased $8 million or 4%. Increased material charges for equipment repairs and higher environmental expenses were partly offset by a more favorable personnel injury claims development.","We expected second half materials expense to approximate recent years' averages. Conversely, second half casualty and other expenses may face moderate headwinds as a result of prior year's favorability. As you recall, in the fourth quarter of last year, we saw a $17 million favorable reduction in personal injury expenses.","Turning to our compensation and benefits expenses. Similar to the first quarter results, productivity improvements reduced employee activity levels. In addition, the quarter benefited $8 million from a resolution of a payroll tax matter. These combined improvements effectively offset a $16 million pay rate headwind.","Fuel expenses increased by $1 million, driven by higher fuel consumption, partially offset by lower prices. Similar to first quarter, depreciation decreased by $3 million or 1% due to slightly lower depreciation rates, resulting from our equipment life study that offset the effect of a larger capital base. Then now that's a trend we expect to continue for the remainder of the year.","Turning to our non-operating items, other income was down $2 million or 6% due largely to the lower coal royalties driven by lower coal production. Interest expense was up by $6 million due to last year's third quarter debt issuance.","Income before income taxes decreased $106 million or 13% due to lower income for railway operations.","Income taxes totaled $272 million and the effective tax rate was 36.9% compared to 37.8% in 2012. The decrease was primarily related to tax law changes enacted earlier this year.","Net income from the quarter was $465 million, a decrease of $59 million or 11% compared to 2012. Diluted earnings per share were $1.46, down $0.14 per share or 9% compared to last year.","As shown on the next slide, cash from operations covered capital spending and produced $622 million in free cash flow. For the first 6 months of 2013, we distributed $315 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares totaling $314 million, with most of the share repurchases occurring in the second quarter. And our last year's results included higher share repurchases and borrowings.","We are confident in our ability to generate free cash flow and to access the debt markets. Our cash deployment strategy will continue to prioritize investment in our business, and as demonstrated in our dividend increase announced earlier this afternoon, we are committed to our dividend.","Consistent with our ongoing strategy, we'll apply incremental cash to repurchase shares as guided by our assessment of market conditions. Thank you for your attention, and I'll turn the program back to Wick.","Charles W. Moorman","Thanks, John. Well, as you've heard, the company delivered very solid results for the second quarter, given the combined headwinds of what we've seen in coal and the unfavorable comparison in the fuel surcharge revenue lag.","On the plus side, there were some real positives to take away from our second quarter results in terms of both our continued operating performance, as well as strength in our autos, chemicals and intermodal franchises. I will say that our overall carloads in the second quarter do not indicate that the pace of recovery in the U.S. economy had quickened. And in fact, the latest data would indicate that the economy actually slowed somewhat. Looking ahead, we see more of the same, with slow and uneven economic growth for at least the next couple of quarters.","It goes without saying that from a Norfolk Southern standpoint, coal remains a real question mark, although we are approaching more favorable comparisons as we lap the higher market-based export pricing that was in effect through most of the first 8 months of last year. With respect to the coal markets, as you've heard from Don, exports seem to be weakening while domestic utility coal shows signs of bottoming as excess stockpiles decline and natural gas seeks a reasonable price point.","Offsetting those uncertain coal markets, we do have a balanced franchise and expect that the strength we have seen in some other components of our business will continue as well. We'll stay focused on continuing the improvements in our service, product and cost structure. And our goals are, as always, to give our customers superior service with a superior value proposition and our shareholders a superior return. Our dividend increase is an indication of our commitment to provide those returns, and we are confident in our ability to do so for the long term.","Thanks, and I'll turn it back over to the operator to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt Troy from Susquehanna International.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I was interested in your commentary about export coal pricing and specifically, how we do, in fact, anniversary those higher levels, let's call it in another 2 months. If you look at any of the pricing indices internationally, obviously, you have compressions suggestive of some pretty material spot weakness, which should translate into export coal pricing compression into next year, at least in the current trajectory. Just wondering your thoughts in terms of where you see current transport spot rates for export coal? And should we expect another down year into next year just given where the markets are suggesting they will be today?","Donald W. Seale","This is Don. With respect to the spot coal market for export, we have seen the API 2 for steam coal, for thermal coal. And then Northern Europe, met [ph] dropped down to 79% at the current level, mid-80s for 2014 delivery, which is implying marginal improvement from where we are now but not much. And I would say that most of our production base, with the exception of Illinois Basin and some of Northern App is -- they're pushed with respect to margins at those levels of API 2. With respect to met coal, we know that the met coal settlements for the third quarter for the high-end met coal is in the 1 40s. That makes it problematic for a lot of U.S. coal production. And frankly, one of the impacts that we saw in our franchise in this quarter was that low-vol, more expensive met coal from the U.S. is not as competitive with hi-vol b, for example, a lower cost coal coming from the U.S. going into markets at a cheaper price.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Understood. And my follow-up would be just on the domestic side. Our sense, and we've heard from your competitor but also just speaking with utilities, is that stockpiles seem to be more historically consistent than your comments seemingly implied. Are you just being more conservative on the domestic outlook or stockpiles perhaps higher than some might think, remaining in your service regions like the Southeast? Or are you just trying to be a bit conservative after what has been admittedly a painful 2 years?","Donald W. Seale","No, it's really -- it's a story of 2 different market segments. In the North, we're seeing stockpiles normalize. In the South, we're still seeing stockpiles above normal. We're seeing heavier gas competition in the South as well. So -- but with the summer burn that we are seeing, we're seeing stockpiles begin to come down in the South, and they're at the normal level in the North.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Yagerman from Deutsche Bank.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So I was looking at the Intermodal side of the business, and you've got 5% volume growth but pricing was down. I'm just kind of curious in terms of market positioning, whether or not that was mainly the more competitive truckload market in the second quarter that you would kind of attribute that to? Or if there's been some market share out there that you've been looking to grab as there's a competitive dynamic within that business?","Donald W. Seale","The primary driver on the RPU for Intermodal is the negative year-over-year fuel revenue that we pointed out, it was $59 million lower. So Intermodal is wrapped up into that. The second is that our growth segment in Intermodal in the quarter was domestic highway conversion. And it is coming on. It will not have the same RPU characteristics of, say, transcon intermodal that has a higher revenue per unit.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it, that make sense. And just looking at the crude by rail business, obviously, good growth in the quarter and off of a low base. Curious if you guys are seeing the decreasing spreads between WTI and Brent impacting volumes, and really how that's factored into yield when I think about that business. I know you guys have commented in the past that crude by rail comes on at kind of a lower than average chemical RPU. Curious how dynamic that is with what the spreads are doing when you think about how the pricing is positioned on that business?","Donald W. Seale","We don't see the spread compression that we've seen very, very recently between Brent and WTI impacting our pricing at this point nor are we seeing that spread compression impacting volumes. I think it has happened rather quickly, and we will have to see whether or not that type of spread compression continues. But at this point, we haven't seen an impact in pricing or volume.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to ask you, and maybe this one's good for Wick or maybe Don, but as export markets feel like they're deteriorating a little bit more here in the back half of the year, is the network facing another dynamic where you could face compressed margins again as that high-revenue positive mix business comes off again like it did last third quarter? Or is there enough to offset at this point that we're lapping some of those resets that we had last year and you're getting the growth in Intermodal and these really good productivity metrics that the risk to margin compression from here is pretty much going to be contingent on maybe a worst macro outcome?","Charles W. Moorman","Well, I think you've kind of identified one of the issues we've been looking at. As we mentioned, we do see the comparisons changing, particularly as we get past the first 8 months or so of the year when we really, as a result of the deterioration in the export market, saw substantial compression in the margins which were necessary in order to keep U.S. coal competitive. As Don mentioned, there's still softness out there in the export market. We'll respond to it in the appropriate fashion, both from a productivity standpoint and Mark has a lot of initiatives underway on the productivity side. But also on the pricing and margin standpoint, it's necessary to keep U.S. coal competitive but to move the business at levels -- margin levels that we find attractive. Having said all of that, we saw a collapse, as Don outlined and as you all know, in benchmark export metallurgical coal pricing from $330 a ton down to $160 a ton. We don't see anything like an equivalent collapse out there. So we may see margins bounce around along around the level they are at now, but certainly not another big reset in what we're going to do in export pricing.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, and maybe if I can follow up on that. On the domestic front, Don, you did put on a few slides here talking about length of haul and how that impacts RPU, which is obviously helpful from a modeling perspective. But should we be thinking that higher RPU equals higher margin or is this going to be relatively consistent because that's what ultimately matters, right, for op earnings?","Donald W. Seale","No, our shorter-haul business is very profitable to us. It's attractive business with favorable margin characteristics. The reason that I'm providing that color with respect to the differences in market segments, it impacts revenue per unit, and it impacts the total revenue of the book of business for coal. But I certainly -- it certainly is profitable business, and we wouldn't be handling it otherwise.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter from Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess, one of the pillars of sort of rails really has been the pricing power. And I guess, I would just want to understand, Wick or Don, how you think your -- if you're being more aggressive on pricing versus your peer, and I think you tried to address this earlier. But if you look at your peer, they posted overall yields that were positive, yours are down 4.5%. And then particularly in Intermodal, they were up 1.5% -- or more than 1.5%, yours are down 0.5%. How shall we read that in terms of looking at competition within the market? I understand their mixed differences, but just want to understand if we're seeing a more competitive environment, particularly given what we're seeing on the yields from what we can see as analysts?","Charles W. Moorman","Well, and Ken, let me just say this. There's always been a competitive environment out there and there always will be. Our message to everyone has consistently been, we price to the market and respond to the markets, and that's what we'll continue to do. In terms of some of the comparisons that you've talked about, I think you put your finger on a very significant issue, which is mix matters. And we have a very dynamic coal franchise and a coal franchise that looks different from any other carriers' coal franchise. And as Don showed, we have had significant changes within the mix of that franchise that have an impact on our revenue per unit. In a similar way, we have a great Intermodal franchise, the business -- the volume continues to grow there. But there is some amount of that volume that grows that is shorter haul. And that can have an impact overall on revenue per unit as well. So we look upon it as we're competitive, but we think everyone else in the transportation marketplace that we see and come up against is equally competitive. We're going to continue to price the market, and we'll -- I think we'll do fine.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So if I could just follow up on that. I guess -- because looking at your volumes on Crescent were great at 9%, but it's half of Heartland's level. But yet given the investments in new terminals that launched, do you view that as disappointing? Is that something we should see ramp up or is it just a pace as new facilities are coming out or, I guess, fully ramped up, we could see that accelerate?","Charles W. Moorman","Well, let me go back to something I think we talked about in the last quarter. As we have brought these new facilities on, we're obviously committed to filling them up. We have a significant capital investment in them. We have new train service, we're outselling that train service. But we have made a commitment to everyone that we are going to fill those terminals up with business at margins that make good sense for us. And we'll continue to be deliberate about bringing that business on to make sure it's the kind of profitable business that we want. So do we view the acceleration there as disappointing? In no way, and we expect continued growth in that -- in all of those quarters.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","Can I just clarify something, Wick, there that you just said? Are you saying your pricing to market or are you still saying inflation plus pricing?","Charles W. Moorman","No, our long-term commitment as we have said before, and you have to kind of take the issues in the coal market for what they are, is that our long-term commitment is to price at inflation plus. And we're confident that over the long term, we'll do that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Schoonmaker from MorningStar.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Can you share average length of haul in Intermodal, and is this trending downwards as you're taking share in these shorter length of haul lengths?","Charles W. Moorman","Keith, the length-of-haul traffic that we're converting locally in the domestic market, I will tell you, is less than the length of haul that receive traffic that we generate in the transcon market. And also, International business moving from some of the East Coast ports, like Savannah to Atlanta, are in the 280-mile range. So it is a mix of different lengths of haul, and I can tell you that some are as low as 260, 280 miles.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Sure. And long run, that'll reduce RPU, I guess, as we're -- as you're growing in domestic, even if profitable. That's a lot of what we're seeing this quarter, I guess, with the 1% decline in RPU, is that correct?","Donald W. Seale","That is absolutely correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee from Citi.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Don, maybe I could follow up on the coal pricing side. I guess, when you think about the export market, as you mentioned, the settlements have come down for the third quarter. And typically, there has been some variation relative to settlements both on the API side for thermal and met coal, too. If you look out into the back half of the year, is it fair to assume that coal yields are likely to be slightly down from where we were in the second quarter all else equal like fuel surcharge? Or is there something else we should be thinking about? Obviously, kind of keeping mix relatively consistent with where we were in the second quarter?","Donald W. Seale","Chris, with mix held constant second quarter to third quarter, we see marginal decreases with respect to overall RPU as the second quarter versus the third quarter pricing reflects that market dynamic, the change between the 2 quarters.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, okay, that's helpful. And then just maybe bigger picture, you mentioned some of the clearing price or profitability on some of your coal customers into the export market with where the international settlement prices are now. Do you have a rough sense maybe of what percentage of your export business kind of is profitable at these levels for the producers? So I guess, trying to say it another way, as you start to roll out into the back half of the year and into '14, is there a set -- a kind of a number of tons we can kind of think about that has the potential to maybe come out because of not being economic at these levels?","Donald W. Seale","Well, we -- in general, Central App production is under the greatest pressure because of the cost of production. So met coal coming out of Central App, especially if it is low-vol, higher-priced coal, is under greater pressure because what we're seeing in the steel market is international and domestic. But primarily domestic, our international producers of steel taking a different approach to save cost of producing coke for steelmaking where they are taking a longer process in the coke ovens, which enables them to use lower quality coals like high-volume -- high-vol b coals. So we're seeing that dynamic. The Northern App coal is tight right now in terms of this overall availability. The domestic market is getting more robust, and we're seeing that compete for some of the Northern App coal that could go into the export market. And, of course, the Illinois Basin coal, while the cost structure is favorable, we're still facing an API 2 that's falling.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So it sounds like there's a lot of moving parts when you think about all the potential puts and takes of what can be going into the export market in the next, call it 2 to 4 quarters?","Donald W. Seale","Right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Walter Spracklin from RBC Capital Markets.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a quick follow-up where you mentioned that the coal revenue per unit would be down sequentially, if I understood that. Were you referring only to the export coal side or overall coal revenue per unit?","Donald W. Seale","On the export side but also the domestic utility side, to the extent that our northern utility coal continues to outpace our southern utility coal. The reason I'm saying that is our northern utility coal, based on length of haul, on average is about 50% of the RPU of our longer-haul southern utility coal.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Just switching gears now over to seasonality of your earnings profile historically has seen a third quarter that is typically stronger than your prior quarters. That took -- there was an impact last year due to some of the factors that you are mentioning around mix. As that normalizes itself, if we were to look on a seasonality adjusted basis, taking into consideration mix and any of the other moving parts like fuel surcharge, headwind and so on, do you see that historical pattern returning? Or are we in a period that seasonality, we would likely not see the same lift as we have in years prior to 2012?","Charles W. Moorman","That's certainly been a pattern in the past. But I would tell you that our crystal ball for the third quarter right now is not good enough to tell you if that's a pattern that's going to be sustained or not. We have a lot of uncertainties in our business as we've outlined, and we'll just have to see what the results are.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Depressed market, I don't know if you can talk a little bit about employee count and how you see headcount evolving through the rest of the year?","Donald W. Seale","Yes, Walter, so far this year, we've dropped -- in operations, we've dropped a little over 400 people. And that's pretty much across all the different operating groups. And as we continue to roll out various productivity initiatives, we will continue to see that same gradual trend, that same drop in headcount.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So overall, you're likely to end the year around 400, 500 people lower than last year this -- on an average basis?","Donald W. Seale","No, we dropped over 400 so far this year. So I think we'd be looking at something around the same run rate for the rest of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Wadewitz from JPMorgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to ask you, first, just kind of a follow-up to a prior question, I guess, on the crude by rail. You were hearing that there's not really an impact I think from yourselves and from others on crude by rail yet from this sharp compression in spreads. And I'm wondering if you could give a sense, do you think that that's primarily due to term commitments as your big customer, I guess, for crude by rail. Are they already committed to the volume and that's why you're not seeing the volume respond to the change in spreads? Or what the economics would point that they're being impact from those narrower spreads at some point in time? So I wonder if you could give us some thoughts on whether it's term or volume commitments or if that's not the case?","Donald W. Seale","Tom, it's all of what you just mentioned, the volume commitments, the commitment to rail cars to handle that volume but also the fact that at the wellhead, Bakken, as well as Canadian heavy crude, is being priced in a way that is competitive with Brent even with a compressed spread at this point.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, all right. On the -- I guess, switching topics to the Intermodal side, you also had some questions along those lines. But how do we think about the ramp-up of the Crescent Corridor? It seems like you've got a lot of the capacity in place and a lot of potential. I guess when you talked about this a number of years ago, you identified, I think, 1 million annual loads. And eventually, I don't know if your capacity is more like 500,000 or whatever. But is it -- is the issue that the truck market is not tight enough and fuel prices aren't high enough or if you're more gradual in your ramp-up? Or are you just really trying to be disciplined so you don't do this well in terms of service and that it's a matter of patience on offering new -- starting up new trains, or what is it? Because I would have just thought that this would be a pretty big impact at some point in terms of the volume side with the Crescent Corridor?","Donald W. Seale","Tom, as you'll recall, back in the fourth quarter and also in our January call, we talked about 34 new service lanes, but we were going to phase those lanes in over the course of 2013. So we're phasing the services in, we haven't launched them all simultaneously. And second, we are definitely watching margins closely to build the books of business as prudently as we can to optimize the attractiveness of that business that we bring to the new network.","Charles W. Moorman","Yes, let me -- to add to that, Don is exactly right. And one of the things that we're -- we know a lot of potential customers are doing is they're looking at our service patterns that we've now established. They want to see how well we're performing against them, what that service reliability is and what kind of commitment they want to make. And I can tell you the trains are running well, and we're very encouraged by everything that we see.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So it's reasonable to think that 9% accelerates looking forward?","Charles W. Moorman","I think -- yes, I think that's a reasonable assumption. Having said that, we are going to continue to be very measured and thoughtful about bringing this business on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Green of Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Wick, can I ask you for some longer-term thoughts here just on the margin? We talked a lot on this call about the mixed headwinds. And I'm sort of looking at Norfolk Southern's kind of historical performance, and you were industry-leading for so long. And so far this quarter, actually Norfork will have one of the higher ORs. And so at what point do you sort of say, \"You know what, we've got to take this more into our own hands and really start to work these costs out in a much more significant way?\" Because if the mix is going to be more of a permanent issue as it relates to coal, it would seem to me that Norfolk has some tools at its disposal to try to change that outcome. But I'm curious how you think about that.","Charles W. Moorman","Well, Bill, we look at this all of the time. And as Mark has outlined, we are always looking at our cost structure. We have implemented a lot of technology to help us reduce significant areas of our cost structure. We have done a lot of work and a lot of analysis to show that one of the best ways that we can do that is just continue to increase network velocity. We're committed to that. And the other piece of this, obviously, is that operating ratio and margin are extremely important as an indicator of how well we're doing, but we also want to go out there and grow business. And we think that it takes some thoughtfulness in terms of the best way to grow earnings, and thereby -- therefore, grow shareholder returns. So we'll confront the changing business mixes and we'll react accordingly, but we are focused all of the time on trying to squeeze cost out of the network to the very best of our ability.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, okay. Maybe you or Don could comment on this one. When we think about the service levels that you're showing here, and they're quite good, does service directly lead to kind of -- if you have industry-leading service, should you get industry-leading price? Is it that simple or is it more, I don't know, it's not quite so direct of a line?","Donald W. Seale","Bill, industry-leading price could be defined in terms of the definition of RPU, and we're looking at RPU with respect to the results for the quarter. And it reflects a lot of moving parts, as we have already discussed. So we do believe that superior service over time leads to superior pricing.","Charles W. Moorman","But, Bill, let me return to something I said earlier, which was we went through some rigorous analysis over the past year or so in terms of system velocity and network performance, trying to understand at what point you optimize your cost structure. We understand that higher system velocity leads to better service, which leads to more customer satisfaction and eventually, we think more business. But the driver that we found was that the faster we can drive the system, the more costs come out. So we view our initiatives around service and system velocity as much as a positive on the cost side, as we do just in terms of providing that superior service to our customers.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Is it correct to believe the industry-leading service has a higher cost component? I mean, I know you said the cost kind of come out with the fluidity. So is that the only piece of it or does it actually have an offset where the net is -- you're required to get better price effectively.","Charles W. Moorman","No, no. In fact, that's -- I think that's the point and that was one of the things that came out of our analysis and really what you have been seeing in Mark's presentations now for some time, and that is the faster we can run the network, it -- the fewer assets it requires, the fewer people it requires, the fewer locomotives it requires, fewer cars it requires to handle the same amount of business. So that's an important piece of cost reduction is continuing to take the network velocity up.","Mark D. Manion","And it also had the -- this is Mark jumping in here. It also had the effect, as you see, of reducing our equipment rents, it reduces our re-crews, it reduces our overtime costs. And so while all that is going on with the improvements we see with increased velocity, we have got productivity projects that are teed up around the railroad that are also helping to drive cost reduction. And one of the newest ones that we've got launched which will be more significant is a pretty intensive project that will work its way through our terminals, where we will be going terminal to terminal, finding a lot of efficiencies and productivity that will also lower our costs for our terminal expense.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Larkin from Stifel, Nicolaus.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Have there been any major adjustments to the capital spending program for 2013 in light of the, perhaps, more tepid outlook on traffic for the entirety of 2013 than you might have envisioned when you put the capital plan together in the first place?","Charles W. Moorman","No, John, there haven't -- we came in with, we think, a very good capital plan. We're -- the spending we're doing will enhance and maintain the network and our assets, add some new technology which we think is important. And as you saw, we continue to generate cash flow, which is more than adequate to cover that capital plan, cover our dividends, including the increased dividend, and help us repurchase shares. So we're comfortable with the capital level that we projected for this year.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then maybe a second one. There's been a lot written about how the shale revolution is generating kind of world-class energy costs in the U.S., and that could lead to a lot of industrial development. And I was just wondering if Don perhaps could give us an outlook on what projects might be out there over the next couple of years they could locate on your railroad that could perhaps offset some of the uncertainty in the coal business?","Donald W. Seale","John, that's a very good question, and we are seeing a very robust pipeline of potential industrial development projects that involve everything from DRI [ph], direct iron reduction plants to ethane crackers to new manufacturing facilities for all types of plastics, ethane conversion, as well as the ongoing activity of reshoring some of the manufacturing that departed the U.S. that went to Asia, that's beginning to make its way back to this country.","Charles W. Moorman","Our outlook is optimistic on industrial development.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Is that something that could have a meaningful impact in the next year or 2, or is it longer term than that?","Donald W. Seale","It's longer term than that. Although I will say, John, that in the auto sector, we are seeing decisions made to move more manufacturing, more production of autos to this country not only for the domestic market but for the export market as well to use U.S. as a platform for exports.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Long from Stephens.","Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Maybe just to follow up on the margin question earlier. You've talked about productivity gains this year of about $100 million. Now that we're through the first half, I was just wondering if there was any update to that expectation? And also, if you could just talk about how much of that is coming from cost initiatives versus any changes we're seeing in mix?","Donald W. Seale","Well, as far as that $100 million savings, we are well on track in order to meet that and, in fact, exceed that. And that is coming from the variety of productivity initiatives that I spoke of earlier. So we look forward to more of that same in the second half.","Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. now we're getting a little closer to peak season, I was just wondering if you had an early read on the potential pickup we could see in demand just based on what you're hearing from your customers today?","Donald W. Seale","Justin, with respect to the -- what we used to call peak season, we basically now see elongated supply chains that ordering starts much sooner in the summer. And I would describe our outlook for our fall peak to be more of a fall mount. It will be a gradual uptick to support retail sales, which are not that strong to start with. But we don't expect to see a peak. We do see -- we do expect to see increased volumes starting August, September, October to support the retail season.","Operator","Our next question comes from Allison Landry from Credit Suisse.","Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So in the past, you've had a pretty favorable long-term secular view on the role of the U.S. in export coal markets. But given the comments you made earlier in terms of efficiency gains at coke making facilities and steel mills and the fact that we are seeing a lot of this occur in China, and maybe even layering on top of that expectations for reduced steam coal burn in Europe due to some of the environmental legislation going on over there, has your view changed here? It seems like there's been some structural changes, so hoping to get an update there.","Charles W. Moorman","No, our view on the export market over time has not changed other than the fact that right now, we're seeing an oversupply of coal in the world market. The Australian exchange rates are helping their cost structure, their production is up. We're seeing Europe in terms of their economic recovery not doing very well. And Europe, Northern Europe in particular, is a natural market for U.S. export coal. So until we see the European economy begin to recover, we will continue to see exports from the U.S. be challenged. I do believe that thermal coal in the world market will continue -- the demand for that will continue to grow probably by as much as 50 million tons next year, just year 2014. So power plants are being built. Coal usage is being ramped up around the world. It's all a matter of who's going to supply it and who has the cost structure to be able to supply it at world prices.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Seidl from Cowen & Company.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","A couple of quick questions. Looking at the Intermodal business, we've been hearing some hours of service going through some of your truck-competitive lanes right now. You're obviously taking some market share off the highways. I was wondering what is your long-term view on some of the competitive trucking prices? I mean, it's been pretty muted for a while now. Is there going to be an opportunity coming up for you or, even more importantly, some of your partners to be able to raise some of these Intermodal rates?","Charles W. Moorman","The hours of service law that just went into effect July 1, we obviously are not seeing any impact yet. We've all seen the same type of projections out there of somewhere between 3% and 5% loss of productivity in -- over the road trucking as a result of the hours of service law. We expect that will continue -- that will show or manifest itself as time goes on, and the law is being monitored and enforced. So we do expect it to make trucking tighter, the capacity a little tighter, and we expect it to have a favorable increase or impact on Intermodal pricing.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay. My second question was a follow-up. You guys, I think, Wick, you're talking about running a faster network should equal fewer assets and employees. So as we look out longer term looking at your headcount, is this going to be something where the headcount just sort of hovers around this level as you improve the network fluidity and speed?","Charles W. Moorman","I would say, as Mark indicated, we've taken our headcount down some. We expect it to come down some more, it will be gradual. We've got a lot of initiatives underway in terms of productivity not only in the train and engine workforce but across all of the operating divisions. We expect them to -- they won't come to fruition in the next 2 months. But over the next year to 18 months, we'll see continue rent reductions there. And then the second piece of this is what's the volume? And we'll have to -- headcount will, to some extent, be determined by -- particularly on the train and engine side, by what are the volumes we're handling. I can tell you we think that we have plenty of capacity in the network today, certainly in the merchandise train network, to take on volumes without having to add a lot of trains or train crews. So we expect that we're going to be able to take headcount down more from here.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Group from Wolfe Research.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","So I wanted to just go back to pricing. All of the other rails get some form of same-store pricing metrics. And they're on that 3.5% to 4% range, if you exclude export coal. Given all the questions you're getting on pricing and yields and when you're talking about as mix and fuel, do you feel comfortable giving us a sense, are you in that 3.5% to 4% same-store pricing range, excluding the pressure you're seeing on export coal?","Donald W. Seale","Scott, we would prefer not to talk about the range of our pricing. We have made that decision based on the fact that there are multiple constituents on our earnings calls. We will tell you that we're confident that we continue to move forward with pricing that will exceed the rate of rail inflation over time, excluding coal at this point in time. We do think coal will bottom out. And at the time that it does, we will certainly convey that to everyone on these calls. But our commitment is to inflation plus pricing.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And then one other thought or just a question on fuel. It seems like fuel, the lag impact, is more volatile for you than some of the other rails. Is that something that you're thinking about trying to change or can change in the way you structure your fuel surcharges so it's less volatile going forward?","Donald W. Seale","Well, we look at that and we understand that it does add some volatility in terms of the surcharge and the lag as well. Every carrier has and always has had its own program. We have our own program. We look at it and monitor it all the time. It's not something that you necessarily change quickly because a lot of our fuel surcharge components are wrapped up in contracts of various durations. But we're going to do what we do in every instance. We're going to look at the effectiveness of the surcharge program, we're going to look at how it's viewed in the marketplace and respond accordingly.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","Are you trying to smooth out that volatility or is there an offsetting advantage you think you have with, yes, we have more volatility but on the offset we get this that maybe other rails don't get?","Charles W. Moorman","This -- we've watched this and looked at this, and while we understand that on a quarterly basis, it may add some volatility. At the end of the day, I think we seem to get to this -- to about the same place that most other folks do over a longer period of time, and we'll watch it. But the volatility in and of itself, we view as something that's just part of the program we have in place today.","Operator","Our last question comes from David Vernon from Bernstein.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Don, I wanted to talk a little bit about the utility pricing in the East. Your competitor has sort of introduced this idea of fixed and variable pricing for about 20% of its business. And I have 2 questions for you. The first is do you have any similar programs in the works? And the second is do you think, at some point, you might be forced to kind of price match at a marginal level to keep some of the plants that you serve competitive relative to those plants that might have a variable pricing structure?","Donald W. Seale","We have been having ongoing discussions with some of our utility clients regarding that pricing methodology on a quarterly basis. We'll continue to have those discussions and reviews. And where it makes sense for us in terms of profitability and margins and being competitive, we will certainly continue to have that dialogue and take definitive action accordingly.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Do you think that, that marginal pricing structure could influence dispatch curves and the competitiveness of various plants? I guess I'm just trying to figure out if you feel like you might get pushed that way by the market.","Donald W. Seale","That is very uncertain to us at this point.","Operator","At this time, we have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to our speakers for closing comments.","Charles W. Moorman","Well, thank you for your patience, everyone, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Katie Cook, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Katie U. Cook - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Christine, and good morning. Before we begin today's call, I would like to mention a few items. The slides of the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the Investor section, along with our non-GAAP reconciliations. Additionally, transcripts and downloads of today's call will be posted on our website.","During this call, we may make certain forward-looking statements which are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from our actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important.","Now it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman, President, and CEO, Jim Squires.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Katie, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's second quarter 2016 earnings call. With me today are NS's Chief Marketing Officer, Alan Shaw; our Chief Operating Officer, Mike Wheeler; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart.","Our results this quarter, as shown on slide four, underscore the flexibility built into our team's planning and execution. Volumes came in below expectations, so we quickly reigned in costs, pushing operating expenses down 11% in the face of a 10% decline in revenue. As a result, we posted a 68.6% operating ratio, 140 basis points or 2% below last year.","Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.36, just 4% lower than last year's $1.41. For the first six months of 2016, our 69.4% operating ratio set a record, while EPS increased 10% year-over-year. These results reflect an unwavering focus on cost control and steadfast commitment to customer service. Thus, even as we aggressively reduced spending, we drove significant improvements in network performance, as shown by the 13% uptick in the composite service metric in the quarter, an 18% increase in the first half.","Turning to slide five, even in the current challenging environment, we believe we can achieve at least $200 million of productivity savings for the full year, and an operating ratio below 70%. Longer-term, we will continue positioning for topline growth while targeting annual productivity savings of over $650 million by 2020 and an operating ratio below 65%. Given our strong start this year, we are well on our way.","Now, Alan will cover trends in revenue; Mike will provide more detail on how we're managing the operations; and Marta will summarize our financial results. Then we'll take your questions. But before I turn over the microphone, let me add a word of thanks to all our employees. Your intelligence and hard work are the keys to our success. Thank you.","And now I'll turn the program over to Alan and then return to take your questions.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Jim, and good morning to our audience. We appreciate your joining us today. Norfolk Southern continues to face economic headwinds, especially in regard to energy prices. Declining coal shipments and fuel surcharge revenue, coupled with the Triple Crown restructuring and reduced crude oil volume, lowered top line in the second quarter. Excluding Triple Crown and fuel surcharges, intermodal revenue increased slightly year-over-year.","In addition to decreased fuel surcharges, the mix associated with lower coal volume and increased intermodal reduced our second-quarter revenue per unit, despite accelerated pricing growth in the quarter. Within our merchandise market as shown on slide eight increased shipments of cement and steel benefited our metals and construction volume.","While second-quarter and expected full-year automotive volume growth is in line with North American vehicle production, second-half volumes will be influenced by competitive losses and plant-specific outages associated with decreased model demand, limiting year-over-year comparisons.","Chemicals market declines were driven by crude oil and by plant closures and consolidations that reduced industrial intermediates traffic. Our agriculture markets were impacted by increased competition from local corn moving via truck and weaker feed exports. Merchandise ARPU, excluding fuel, increased 2% due to positive pricing despite the negative mix associated with decreased industrial intermediates and frac sand.","As reflected on slide nine, international intermodal growth of 4% partially offset losses in both domestic and Triple Crown freight. Our alignment with the ports and shipping lines, adding capacity for growth, will benefit the international segment over the long term. Intermodal continues to be impacted by excess capacity in the truck market, a condition we expect to change next year.","Lastly, the Triple Crown restructure will affect our year-over-year volume comparisons until midway through the fourth quarter. Excluding Triple Crown and fuel surcharges, intermodal posted an increase of 1% in revenue, volume, and RPU. RPU benefited from strong pricing, despite the adverse mix associated with increased international freight.","Moving on to coal on slide 10, coal volumes declined as a result of sustained low natural gas prices, high stockpiles, and continued weak export conditions. RPU excluding fuel remained flat, with positive pricing neutralized by mix, increased volumes of thermal export coal and declines of metallurgical export coal lowered RPU, which was further affected by volume declines in certain long-haul utility lanes. Current weather conditions and natural gas prices are offering some support for the more efficient coal plants. However, we still have a significant utility stockpile overhang through which to work before volumes normalize.","On slide 11, continued mild weather early in the second quarter limited utility shipments and increased the stockpile overhang. Reported May stockpiles were at the highest point over the past few years. Although there was some improvement in June, it is expected that this inventory overhang will linger into 2017. With normal weather patterns, we expect to handle between 13 million and 15 million tons of utility coal per quarter until stockpiles reach target. However, recent hot weather and higher natural gas prices may push that upper boundary into third quarter.","Continuing with our outlook on slide 12, continuing economic challenges dampen our volume expectations for the third quarter, although we expect volume to slightly improve sequentially as compared to the second quarter. In the fourth quarter, we will have somewhat easier comparisons to last year, during which volumes were impacted by the Triple Crown restructuring, warm weather, commodity price declines, and higher inventories. These factors, plus positive volume trends in construction-related steel, agriculture, and intermodal markets, point to a modest increase in fourth-quarter volume.","Our 2016 pricing remains strong overall, though we do see some softness in truck-competitive sectors. We continue to focus on maintaining a service product that the market values, commanding a higher price and attracting service-sensitive business.","Lastly, as we monitor market conditions and changing volume expectations we will control all aspects of our business impacted by these shifts. Marketing is collaborating closely with operating and finance departments to correctly align our resources with current volume trends.","To further discuss our operations, I will now turn it over to Mike.","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer","Thank you Alan. I am pleased to announce we are continuing to operate at high service levels while achieving significant results in our cost-reduction initiatives. As Jim noted, thanks to the commitment and focus of our employees on executing these key drivers of our strategic plan. The following results are due to NS employees' hard work.","Let me begin with safety on slide 14. While our reportable injury ratio increased in the second quarter as compared to the same period last year we have seen an improvement sequentially this year, which is encouraging. We also maintained a low serious injury ratio.","Turning to service on slide 15, you see we further improved our already high service levels from the first quarter. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of improved service to our customers.","For the second quarter, our service composite improved 13%, which was driven by a 32% improvement in train performance and an 11% improvement in shipments making (10:58) connection.","So it is good to see all components of the service composite improving. What is equally encouraging is we have maintained and achieved this while aggressively and successfully pursuing cost-reduction initiatives as supported by our 68.6% operating ratio. We remain confident we can continue to keep service at a high level while we focus on continuing to identify and implement further cost reduction initiatives.","As you can see on slide 16, our train speed and terminal dwell improved 12% and 9% respectively compared to the same period last year. Overall velocity, as measured at the car level remains near our record levels and continues to aid our asset utilization and improve service for our customers. This has been a driver in being able to store 450 locomotives. We are also very pleased to see our service and velocity metrics remain very high even with the idling of Knoxville, a major hump terminal, on May 1st.","Now on slide 17, our ability to keep the railroad operating at a high level while implementing aggressive cost-cutting initiatives resulted in significant productivity savings. Our reduction in crew starts was in line with our drop in volume, and we have continued to improve our train length, re-crews, and overtime.","Together, this resulted in improved employee productivity. Also, our T&E head count was down 9%, which helped drive the reduction in our overall corporate head count.","I will now turn it over to Marta, who will highlight the effect of these improvements.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Let's take a look at the second quarter financials. Slide 19 summarizes the operating results and highlights the expense control focus that Jim discussed. While revenues declined by 10% on the 7% lower volume, our operating expenses were down 11%. This led to a much-improved operating ratio of 68.6%.","The next slide shows the expense reductions by category. As was the case in the first quarter, all categories except for depreciation were lower. Depreciation was up 4%, reflecting continued investment in our capital assets.","Now let's take a closer look at each of the other components. Slide 21 depicts the drop in fuel expense, totaling $81 million or 32% for the quarter. Lower oil prices resulted in a 25% decrease in the price per gallon, while consumption fell by 6%.","Turning to slide 22, compensation costs were down by $57 million or 8%. As shown on the lower left of the slide, our average head count for the quarter declined by about 2,000 employees versus last year and was flat sequentially. Since we did not see the normal historical rise in volumes from the first to the second quarter, we were able to hold employment levels lower than previously expected. This reduced head count, along with lower overtime and fewer re-crews, resulted in $50 million of year-over-year savings. The associated payroll taxes were favorable by $11 million, and we had $9 million in lower pension expense. These items were partially offset by $14 million in health and welfare rate increases associated with our agreement workforce.","For the remainder of the year, we expect head count to remain relatively flat. But we will face about a $30 million per-quarter headwind for incentive comp, since last year's third and fourth quarters included reversals of accruals. Of course, both of these expectations are based on our current volume projection.","Purchased services and rent is depicted on slide 23 and was down $54 million or 12%. Lower costs associated with the curtailed Triple Crown operations accounted for $38 million of the reduction, and expenses related to joint facilities and haulage declined by $8 million.","Slide 24 details our materials and other category, reflecting a decrease of $33 million or 14%. Reductions totaling $26 million were due to declines in materials usage for locomotives, freight cars, and roadway, with the largest drop related to locomotives as a result of the fewer units in service that Mike mentioned. For the remainder of the year, we continue to expect favorability in materials costs, but at a somewhat moderated level of about $15 million per quarter compared with the third and fourth quarters of last year.","Next, taking a look at non-operating income on slide 25, we had a large relative decrease of $15 million in this category, which was primarily related to three items: reduced income associated with our leased coal properties, fewer gains on property sales, and costs for external advisors.","Moving on to income taxes on slide 26, the effective rate for the second quarter was 36.3% versus 38.1% last year. The lower effective rate reflects a combination of small items including corporate-owned life insurance, tax credits, and state tax law change. For the full year, we continue to expect an effective income tax rate of roughly 37%.","Slide 27 shows our bottom-line results, with net income of $405 million, a decrease of 6% versus 2015, and diluted earnings per share of $1.36, down 4% compared with last year.","Wrapping up our financial overview on slide 28, cash from operations for the first six months was $1.4 billion, covering capital spending and producing $500 million in free cash flow. With respect to shareholder returns, we paid $350 million in dividends and repurchased $400 million of our shares. Going forward and in light of the still-soft volumes, we have trimmed capital spending for the full year by another $100 million, and now project $1.9 billion in total CapEx for the year. We remain on track for full-year share repurchases of $800 million.","Thank you for your attention, and I'll turn the program back to Jim.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Marta, and we'll now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great; good morning. Alan, you mentioned a lot of core pricing going up or even flat in some categories. Can you give us \u2013 it sounds like though, some competition pressuring some of the volumes in different instances as well. Can you talk about overall your thoughts on pricing, given what's going on in the truck market, going what's given on in different commodities on an aggregate basis?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Ken, good morning. Pricing is still moving up for us. We accelerated pricing year-over-year. We are facing some competition with respect to truck. Doesn't mean we're taking lower prices; it more, Ken, limits our upside potential in certain truck-competitive markets.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I'm sorry, just \u2013 so in aggregate, still kind of above inflation? I mean, can you give a parameter of how in aggregate you're thinking about pricing overall?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. We are taking a measured and disciplined approach to pricing. We're focused on competitive pricing above rail inflation. We continue to exceed that, and we are exceeding the pricing levels that we achieved last year.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, wonderful. And then a follow-up on a different subject. But just looking, Jim, talking about your long-term double-digit growth and sub 65% target. Great to see the progress with the $200 million. When you think about the $650 million, to get to that scale, is that new programs? Is that shutting additional yards? You mentioned one of the hump yards you shut down. Can you kind of give \u2013 maybe some parameters on other \u2013 as you've moved along in this development, your thoughts on how you're going to get there?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Sure. What we've previously outlined a goal of $650 million in annual productivity savings by 2020, and we are making good progress on that thus far. We're only six months into a five-year plan, so we still have a lot of ground to cover. But the big buckets of that $650 million, as you know, are in comp and benefits, fuel consumption, locomotive maintenance, and reduced equipment costs and fees. And we're making progress in all of those areas. We have plans in place to continue pushing productivity gains for the remainder of this year and a five-year plan period.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks for the time this morning. Appreciate the insight.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Yes, good morning. I wanted to ask you a little bit about how we might think about operating ratio in the second half. It sounds like you're having a little more constructive outlook for volumes, that there could be some improvement. I know you've got good operating leverage in your scheduled carload network, and presumably in intermodal as well. So I'm just wondering. I think you talked about some costs pressures from incentive comp and so forth. How would you think about operating ratio in second half, and maybe the impact of operating leverage if volume improved relative to what might be happening on the cost side?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Yes, Tom, thank you. Good morning. We still are guiding towards the below-70% operating ratio for the full year. You are correct that we had good movement on that in the second quarter. For the remainder of the year, the two items that I will point out \u2013 you mentioned one of them \u2013 that will cause the 68.4% to maybe go up a little bit but still stay below 70%, is the incentive comp and then also the rate of decline in the materials expenses. But we're comfortable with our, continuing our guidance of below-70% for the full year.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","And how do you think about volumes? Like, I mean, I guess if we see volumes develop a little bit better and you do see kind of less-worse third quarter and then improvement year-over-year in fourth quarter, is it fair to think that there'll be nice impact in terms of operating leverage and nice impact to the OR? Or should we be kind of cautious on how we anticipate that coming through?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Certainly volume growth represents upside. Volume growth beyond our expectations would represent upside, particularly if it occurs in lines of business with high operating leverage.","So, yes, that's certainly a possibility. We believe we have the capacity to take advantage of natural operating leverage in those businesses.","Now I'll turn it over to Alan to talk a little bit more about the volume outlook generally in the second half.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Tom, I spoke a little bit about it in the remarks as I walked through our different commodities. For us, it's going to be a coal and intermodal outlook, and merchandise ups and downs are going to be dependent upon energy prices. If you take a look at the forward curve for commodities and energy prices, the fourth quarter is higher than it stands today, although I'll note that just this month WTI has pulled back 12%.","So that creates some caution to our outlook. But generally, we see that sequential growth in the third quarter. Fourth-quarter comps should be much easier for us, because fourth quarter last year is when we saw the commodities downdraft and we saw the Triple Crown restructuring towards the middle of the quarter.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Right. Okay; great. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I just want to clarify a response to a previous question on pricing. Did you say that your year-on-year pricing is actually above what it was last year? Or just that you're getting higher price versus last year?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Ravi, I did say that our year-on-year pricing is higher than it stood at this point last year. We are taking a long-term approach, as are our customers. There is an expectation that the trucking market is going to tighten at some point next year. And we've started to see some sequential improvement in demand in the truck market just this month. And we're leveraging the benefit of our improved service product.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, got it. And not that anyone knows what the weather will do, but does your 4Q volume growth forecast assume a normal winter or a warm winter, just given that we're having record heat this year?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","We are assuming normal weather patterns. And certainly weather and natural gas prices will determine how quickly stockpiles return to normal within the coal network. In any case, we don't believe that that will occur until sometime next year.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. Thanks. I just wanted to follow up on the OR commentary for the back half. I just want to make sure I understand it correctly. So potentially a little bit worse sequentially in Q3, but then maybe with volume growth in Q4, the normal sequential deterioration that you'd see in the OR then; maybe the cadence is off. Is that the right way to think about it?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","I think the right direction, I think you're right, Allison. I think the right way to think about it is, it's very dependent on the volumes that come. So you all are familiar with our incremental margin hierarchy, which is when the volumes come back in merchandise that is the most positive incrementally and then coal and then intermodal, because of the specific costs that it has. So it's very dependent on the volume. You're not going to see a very \u2013 you're not going to see a huge change in any of these items.","I guided to the two specific items in expense going forward that will be slightly different in the third quarter and fourth quarters. But as Mike and the operating team continue to run the railroad very, very efficiently, you're mostly going to see a continuation operating expense-wise of what you saw in the second quarter.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, that's helpful, thanks. And, then thinking about CapEx and maybe if you could provide any initial thoughts on spending for 2017, considering what will likely be two consecutive down years for GTMs and then the percentage of the locomotive fleet that's in storage.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Sure, I'll take that one, Allison. So we have previously guided to CapEx at 19% of revenue through the completion of PTC. Thereafter, we expect to be able to reduce CapEx by several percentage points relative to sales.","And we've been aggressive this year on CapEx in light of volumes, revenue and cash flow that have not met initial expectations. We've reduced CapEx as Marta mentioned, fully $200 million relative to our original plan. And that's important because we're focused on making the investments we need to make. We will invest as required to operate safely, efficiently and provide a high level service product.","Beyond that, it's all about the returns. If they are there, we'll invest more; if they are not, we won't. We recognize the need to generate ample free cash flow for shareholders and that's all part of our strategy.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Then maybe just a follow-up on that. So, Marta, I think you had mentioned at some of the conferences in the last few months that you guys are still expecting to acquire, I think another 50 new locomotive units next year. Is that still the way that you guys are thinking about it?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","That's correct. We have 50 new locomotives coming in next year.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, great. Thank you for the time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great, thanks good morning. Just wanted to follow-up on that CapEx question and just sort of just conceptually thinking about maybe the cadence of volume growth as you look out over the course of the next year or so and the progress of locomotive that you need to take on.","I guess maybe the question comes up of why wouldn't we maybe see CapEx fall a little bit before PTC spending goes down? You do have lower incremental spending on equipment coming. I just want to make sure I get all of the moving parts when think about that, maybe for 2017 and 2018?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","I'd like to turn it over to Mike to talk about our locomotive strategy in particular. Since that's obviously a significant capital budget item. To reiterate what I said a minute ago, we will invest as necessary to provide a safe, efficient, high-service product.","After that we'll see. It just depends on the returns on the incremental dollar of investment. What I would love for investors to take away from this call is our commitment to disciplined capital spending in the here and now.","And as noted, we've tightened the reins on capital spending this year just as we have on expense to reflect lower than expected revenue and cash flow. And, that's really important in our business. It's an asset-intensive business; we've got to stay disciplined on CapEx as with expenses and that's part of our plan to drive free cash flow.","Mike, why don't you talk a little bit about the locomotive strategy specifically?","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer","Yes. Well, we still do have the 50 locomotives new next year. We continue to progress down the really innovative DC-to-AC rebuild strategy that we have in place, which over the next several years will allow us to bring the age of our fleet down and get good locomotives at a much lower capital cost than new.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, that's helpful. So it's productivity as well. That makes sense. Can I ask a question, just a follow-up on productivity, the $200 million or better I think for this year? Can you give us a sense of maybe how that might be portioned out into the back half of the year? Maybe where you are and how we should be thinking about for 3Q and 4Q.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","So we've outlined an annual productivity objective, and that's where we're going to stay in terms of our productivity goals. We have seen significant progress in productivity in the first half; obviously you see that in the numbers. We've said that we continue to believe we can do $200 million or better for the full year.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. So thinking about it, roughly, equal? Or any sense of what the progress has been toward that goal this year?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","We did say in the first quarter that we frontloaded some of the productivity. You saw that in the first quarter. And we continued on track during the second quarter. For the full year, we're still thinking we can do at least $200 million.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Right. And generally speaking, the front-end loading that Jim described is in the materials area. And, so the detail that we gave with regard to the $42 million materials reduction in the first quarter and then $26 million this quarter, you can see that front-end loading there because we expect $15 million going forward. So if you look at that difference, that's the area where we had the front-end loading.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's perfect. Thank you very much for the time; I appreciate it.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yeah. Thanks for taking my question here. The STB has promised a decision on the NIT League's competitive switching proposal by the end of this month, which is just a few days away. I was hoping you could shed some light on what your expectations are to both the timing and the content of that, when we receive it, based on your engagement with the agency.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","The STB had publicized a schedule for issuing rulings in that case and several others earlier this year. My understanding is that's not a deadline; it's not binding on the STB. It's their current expectation as to when they'll issue rulings.","So I don't have any further insight to shed on the timeline or what may come from the STB. We have certainly made our case for the status quo when it comes to competition in the industry, and we'll just have to wait and see how the STB rules there and in the other matters that are pending.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Understood. Maybe one more, the truck competition in your carload merchandise business, can you shed a little light on where you might be bleeding share to truck, or you seeing a bit more acute pressure on price in some of this carload business, as you alluded to earlier? And from a high level, do you have a sense of how much this has been a drag on your overall volumes?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Bascome, we talked about intermodal. Your question is specific to merchandise at carload, correct?","So I'll address that. I mentioned the fact that we are seeing additional competition within our Ag markets. That also has to do with the strength of the crop in the Southeast; it opens up local \u2013 local corn into our network, which can move via truck. We're seeing some truck competition in the paper market into the Southeast.","So it certainly has had an impact, as we know, on our domestic intermodal volumes and also on our carload business. Going forward, it's \u2013 we're going to be looking closely at energy prices, the impact they have on truck, on truck availability and on commodity prices and retail inventories.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you for the time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. I'm going to kind of circle back to Chris's question regarding productivity. You guys have done a good job extending train lengths. They were up a little bit in the quarter. However, if I'm looking at head count per carload that was essentially flat.","Can you walk me through some of the puts and takes and what it would take to get back to a little under 70 where you peaked out a couple years ago with regard to head count per carload? Is this a mix issue, or should we be thinking about a lot of operating leverage as volumes build, particularly in the merchandise and intermodal?","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer","Yes, there is a mix issue there. And as volumes are softening, we take train starts out of the network to build up other trains, and that's a balancing act. You don't want to do that real quickly, because you don't want to hurt the service on the network. So that's the challenge there. But the good news is going forward that gives you great operating leverage.","And for us, we've got capacity on the trains in all commodity groups, really. We've got capacity on the network and we've got capacity in our resources of locomotives and crews. So we've got a lot of leverage to the upside. But if volumes remain soft, we continue to whittle at the resources to make sure that all the productivity and efficiency is there.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Can you give us a sense of the \u2013 how much below you are the optimal train size opportunity in your merchandise and intermodal networks as I think about what that leverage could be?","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer","We've got a good ways to go both on the merchandise side and the intermodal side. We're very comfortable where that's at. Being able to add more units to both of those trains before we start train starts and then if we need to do train starts we'll add that on; that will be a good news story. But we feel very comfortable about capacity on both of those, particularly the intermodal. We have such a great double-stack network that gives us a lot of efficiency.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And any sense in terms of just the magnitude of delta versus optimal?","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer","No, because I think you get down to \u2013 get down to the lane level and the terminal level and a lot of details there. But we take every opportunity we can.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Understood. Appreciate the time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everybody. Two quick things from me. One following up on your commentary in the intermodal versus truck marketplace, I think you guys said that there's been some sequential improvement especially over the last month. I was wondering if you could elaborate on that and let us know, has it been an increase in truck spot pricing? Has there been a decrease in available trucks? Any color would be appreciated on that comment.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Jason, we have seen an increase in truck spot pricing. It's increasing sequentially; it's not increasing year-over-year.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. That's a good update. Also, maybe this one might be for Jim. Jim, I think when we came into this year in terms of the total restructuring plan at Norfolk you talked about 1,600 miles of track divestitures and that you would do 1,000 or at least let us know where the 1,000 was going by the end of this year. I think you've done just over 300 miles so far this year. Wondered if you can give us an update.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Sure. We're making good progress there, as in other areas of productivity and restructuring, and we're on track to hit or exceed that mileage goal for the full year. Mike, why don't you talk a little bit more specifically about some of the areas where we're working that?","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. So we've got a lot going on there. We've got two pieces to this: this is the \u2013 where we're doing some short-lining and we've got a short line of the West Virginia secondary that'll happen here, actually next week. So that's a piece of it. We're looking at other parts of the railroad as well.","But the other piece to it on the network rationalization is where we've spent a lot of time looking at where we can take resources out of the track structure without hurting service or safety. And that's been a good news story. We've got over 1,000 miles of that that's already happened on the railroad. And some of the benefits that we've seen in our cost reduction is related to that. More to come as we go forward. So we feel very comfortable about meeting or exceeding that.","And I think we're thinking about giving an update on the third quarter on the details of actually where these are at. But anyway, kind of a wrap-up is we're ahead of schedule on it and we're seeing good costs come out of the network. But more importantly, the safety and service has remained high on those areas.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC","That was a great update, guys. I appreciate the time as always.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, thanks. Morning, guys.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Morning.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Scott.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Marta, can you help clarify one thing? So I get the incentive comp's a year-over-year headwind in the third quarter. Is it a sequential headwind from 2Q to 3Q?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","It's a very small sequential headwind going forward. As you saw, it wasn't one of the year-over-year items that I needed to highlight, so that gives you an indication it's a smaller size.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","So if it's a small sequential headwind and you're expecting some volume improvement, I guess I'm a little confused why you think the operating ratio gets worse in the third quarter than the second quarter.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","We're really just talking very tiny basis points. I think in response to Allison's questions, I think the best thing when you're looking at the expense projection sequentially going forward, other than the two items that I mentioned, the incentive comp and the materials, we think you will see us at about the run rate that we had in the second quarter. So we're really talking degrees, very small degrees. And again, I'll emphasize it depends on the volume growth and the commodities that it comes in.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, that makes sense. Can you give an update just on the fuel surcharge side and how much of the business you've transitioned over?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, Scott, first and foremost, we are focused on price. And, so as we enter into any negotiation, that's our target initially. We have been successful and made some progress; and right now about 40% of our revenue is tied to WTI.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, and then just lastly, Alan, can you just give us an update? What's the mix of your coal business in terms of how much is App versus Illinois Basin and PRB today?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","So, the second quarter we saw a mix increase of Central App. So we had about 34% of our volume was Central App, about 30% was Northern App. Illinois basin was about 21%, and then PRB, Scott, fill in the rest.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks and good morning. So first, I was wondering if you could just comment on how you are thinking about the progression of your intermodal volumes in the back half of the year. And bigger picture, do you think this recent weakness in intermodal volumes that we've seen for the industry as a whole is a temporary headwind? Or do you have concern the consumer could be rolling over?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Justin, we think we're going to have continued improvement in our intermodal volumes. June was a good month for us. We see continued growth as we, and our customers see the benefit of our improved service product. Secondly, our customers are preparing for a tightness in truck capacity. And what you're seeing there is more growth with asset-based carriers. So, we do think it's a temporary headwind. As fuel prices go up, that will also benefit us. But certainly we're paying close attention to retail inventory levels.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Okay, but just to be clear, you think your intermodal volumes will be up in the back half? Is that what you said?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Okay, great.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Ex Triple Crown.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Ex Triple Crown? Okay, got you. Secondly, we've always heard about coal being the highest-margin business for the rails. But with your coal volumes down over 20% year-to-date and the pressure we've seen over the last couple of years, has this changed? Has the gap between coal margins and your consolidated margins closed?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","There continues to be pressure on our coal franchise. That market is dynamic, and so are we, and so we are focused on improving the profitability and the returns on all of our lines of business.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. But that gap between coal and everything else really hasn't changed?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","As I suggested, we're focused on improving the profitability on all lines of our business.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. I'll leave it at that. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. So, Jim, appreciate that you guys managed through a pretty difficult second quarter with a sub-70% OR. But we do have a lot of the industry that's running even sub-65% OR, if not even well below that, in the current volume environment. So, and as we've talked a lot about the OR progression kind of sequentially flattish, if not even up a little bit into the back half of the year, how much of your productivity savings are really just hoping for volume growth versus \u2013 what more can you do structurally? I mean we've seen Triple Crown, we've seen the hump yard closures, we've seen you go from two operating regions to three operating regions or three operating regions to two operating regions. So what structurally is left in the network that you can identify from a cost standpoint?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Well, the key to delivering on a plan is flexibility, and that's what we demonstrated in the second quarter. The plan is dynamic. It is flexible and able to address changing market conditions, as we've outlined. We will continue to evaluate efficiencies in all areas and ensure that we have the opportunity to adjust things going forward as necessary. Certainly there is a component of growth assumed in our longer-range plan, and we believe we'll see that. If we don't, we will make adjustments as necessary to achieve our goals.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. But as of now, then, there's nothing really structurally on the plate that you're looking at changing operationally for the company?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","We've made a number of changes that I would characterize as structural already, and we'll be on the lookout for further opportunities there. Cost-cutting is always a combination of short-term cost reductions in response to immediate business conditions and then a long-term outlook on structure. And we have initiatives in place in both areas, both short-term reductions as necessary and longer-term structural activities that will help to shape the cost structure of the company in the future.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for that. And just, real clarification on CapEx. I know we talked a little bit about the outlook heading into next year and the years beyond. But should we be thinking CapEx actually can come down?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Post-PTC, we have guided to CapEx below current levels relative to sales. So, yes, when we get to that point. As I've said, the keys are safety, efficiency, and customer service. That forms your baseline for capital spending. Beyond that baseline, it's all about the returns on the incremental investment. And we will look carefully at every additional dollar we spend. As I mentioned, what we would love investors to focus on out of this call is the way we have managed CapEx this year. In response to business conditions, we have been every bit as determined to modulate CapEx as we have expenses. And that's our commitment going forward as well.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Appreciate the time. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Alan, I just wanted to get your view on export coal trends. Clearly volatile, but you did a little bit better than the 3 million tons per quarter in 2Q. So you see the coking coal benchmark nearing $100 per ton; API 2 is close to $60 per ton. Do you think you can perhaps run closer to 3.6 million tons throughout the rest of the year if the pricing holds? Or was there something kind of one-off that helped boost volumes this quarter?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Brian, it is an extremely volatile market. We are impacted by the health of the producers and bankruptcies, and they are doing everything they can to produce coal and sell it overseas, but it's highly dependent upon global demand and seaborne trade. And right now those are fairly weak. So, our guidance has typically been 2.5 million tons to 3 million tons a quarter. We exceeded that, as you noted, last quarter. We're going to continue with that guidance for this quarter. But it's so volatile and there's a lot of pressures there that it would be difficult to call an upside or a downside to that.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, fair enough. And then I don't know if you've commented on it specifically, but if you could, in the context of a long-term strategic plan, what type of options do you think there are for Lambert's Point considering the way that the markets are now? China demand is down, and clearly the volatility remains. Have you thought through or is that built into the strategic plan at all?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","What is built into the strategic plan is our continuing focus on monitoring our markets and adjusting our resources accordingly. And, you saw that as we've idled Ashtabula and we've idled Knoxville yard, and we combined the Pocahontas division with the Virginia division, which was effectively a coal play.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. And, just one quick follow-up for Marta. In the past, you've given out the net fuel impact which was obviously quite significant in 2015. I think it was about $20 million unfavorable in the first quarter. Do you have the impact and what it was in the second quarter?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","If you look at our fuel surcharge revenue, it was $50 million in the quarter which was a $69 million reduction. So comparing that to the drop in fuel expense of $81 million, there was a little bit of a net, small tailwind in the quarter.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks for your time.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks good morning. You mentioned in your prepared remarks in the automotive sector some competitive losses and lesser demand impacting the back half. Could you just elaborate a little bit on what you're seeing and perhaps some feel for the magnitude of what that might be?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, Scott. We said that there are some specific models typically in passenger cars, in which the plants are undergoing retooling which are going to impact our volumes in the second half of the year.","We also as you'll recall on our first-quarter call pointed towards the fact that comps would get a lot more difficult towards the latter end of the year because the second half of 2015 service started to improve and we started to work through the backlog of shipments in the automotive network; that in and of itself will put pressure on year-over-year comps.","We still feel consistent with what we said on the first-quarter call that our overall volumes for the year in automotive are going to approximate the North American vehicle growth which Ward's right now puts at 1.1%.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Great, thanks. And then I don't know if I \u2013 you might have mentioned, I don't know if I caught it. The $100 million reduction in the CapEx this year, could you elaborate on maybe what the top two or three categories are that you're able to trim in the here and now? Thanks.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","All right. Yes, Scott. We've actually so far this year had $200 million in capital reductions. On the first-quarter call we lowered our CapEx forecast for the full year from $2.1 billion to $2 billion.","Today we've indicated as Jim has mentioned a couple of times that we are modulating our capital. We're being proactive as we see the volume softening and lowered another $100 million. So we're currently at $1.9 billion.","And the reductions have come in three general areas. The first area is in the unit costs; and that's a very good news story because what Mike and the operating team has been able to do is, in our maintenance of way area, they are reducing, because we have more track time and some other efficiencies that they have come up with, the self-constructed assets that we do on our right-of-way.","They've got less labor cost per unit. They have also got slightly lower pricing on some of the materials. So the reductions there are in the unit cost. So they are putting in the same number of units that we had planned but it costs less.","The next biggest grouping is in the locomotive area. Mike mentioned that we do a lot of our locomotive work in-house. We have rebuilds that we had in the capital plan. As the year went on and the volumes didn't come, we pulled out some of those rebuilds. So we have the flexibility to defer those and do them at a later year when we need the locomotives.","And the third area is spread around all the various parts of the capital budget. And that is where we've either been able to trim the costs, in some cases in the materials cost, or we've been able to defer it, because the volumes haven't come. An example of that would be parking at an intermodal terminal. So, we might say we were going to expand parking, but we'll do it next year.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","John Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes. Good morning everybody, and thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to focus in on intermodal a little bit, if that's okay. In your case, international freight looks a little better than domestic. That's kind of backwards relative to what we're seeing across the broader industry. Is there any particular reason why your intermodal is up? You've apparently grabbed some market share there, is that a service issue? Is that pricing, cost differential? Just geographic franchise advantage? What's really driving that? And then what's holding back the growth of domestic? Was it the service quality issues, which perhaps caused a bit of a market share loss? Are you gaining any of that market share loss back on the domestic side? Thanks.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","John, the international is a story of our network reach and it's a story of a shift, although moderate, but continual, from West Coast ports to East Coast ports. And certainly, our port partners on the East Coast feel that the widening of the Panama Canal will continue that progression.","With respect to our domestic intermodal franchise, that has clearly been limited by surplus dry van capacity in the truck market, and then high retail inventory levels. As both of those moderate, we'll start to see growth in that network. And our continued improvements in our service product are helping us convert from highway to rail.","John Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Thank you very much for that. And then on the labor side, are there any major labor contract negotiations forthcoming here? And what would you expect labor cost, fully loaded with fringes, to inflate at here over the next couple of years?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","I'll turn it over to Marta to comment on projected labor inflation. The entire industry, as you know, is engaged in collective bargaining over the terms of industry-wide agreements going forward, and we'll just have to see how that proceeds. Obviously, it's a protracted negotiation. It always is. Particularly in an election year, though you tend to see that even more protracted than usual.","Marta, what are you seeing in terms of labor inflation down the road?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","So for this year, 2016, we guided to overall comp and benefit inflation, labor inflation, of 3.5%. And that's a blend of wage inflation and medical inflation, which has been running quite high this year. For next year, it's still too soon to give a number. But we'll try to clarify that for you on the January call.","John Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Appreciate it. Thank you.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Marta and Jim, I just want to try to get a sense for what's between where we are today, at a $200 million annual run rate of productivity, and the $600 million that you've got in your longer-term plan. I think I'm hearing you say, Marta, that expenses are going to be kind of flat to maybe sequentially up a little bit here in the back half. I'm just trying to get an understanding of what is it that is between us and that higher productivity number. Is it capital investment, system investments, labor? And then maybe as a follow-up, are you thinking at all about maybe some more extensive co-production with CSX in some of the lower-density markets like coal, whether it's at the terminals or in the actual coal lines, up into the coal fields themselves?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","So, six months into a five-year plan, we've made substantial progress on productivity, and we're sticking to our $200 million projected annual savings this year, at least $200 million. So we're well on our way to the $650 million by 2020. As you know, the components of that $650 million are heavily weighted to compensation and benefits savings, and that's a variety of elements. We have additional room to run in terms of fuel consumption improvements, that's part of the longer-range plan. We'll continue to whittle away at locomotive maintenance costs. That's another component of the plan. And reduced equipment cost is a fourth element where we still have opportunity.","Now, in terms of co-production, anywhere it makes sense to for us to share assets with others operationally we will certainly be open to doing so. That's a way to improve asset utilization for both parties.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","But maybe just as a follow-up to that, like, as you think about going from that $200 million to, say, $400 million or whatever it's going to be on labor and compensation, how important is volume inflection to getting to that number? Is there something you're going to do operationally or investment-wise that's going to allow you to then run that much more productively in a year or two? Like, I'm just trying to get a sense for what the keys are to unlock that additional benefit. And I know it's an annual process where you're looking at ways to pull cost out, but is there anything you can point to that says: When we get here, this is going to help us run a lot more productively?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Well, certainly volume helps productivity. There's no doubt about it, because of the incremental operating leverage inherent in the business. But the key to the plan is flexibility. And we believe that we can achieve these levels of productivity going forward. We recognize the plan is dynamic, volume conditions are changeable, and we'll make the adjustments as necessary. If required, we'll go after deeper structural costs to achieve our goals.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","All right. Well, thanks a lot for the time, and good job so far as far as getting the cost out. Talk to you soon.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your question.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you very much. A lot of my questions have been asked, so let me just throw out a quick one. If I back out the fuel impact, it looks like revenue per unit was just a little bit less than flat. Can you break out the mix versus pricing component of that?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","It is all mix, Jeff. If you take a look at the mix effect within coal, our export volumes trended more towards thermal coal than metallurgical coal. You take a look at it within intermodal. And as we've talked about, domestic volumes were pressured. The TCS restructuring impacted RPU and international business has a lower RPU than us. And then take a deeper dive into our merchandise market, and you can see declines in frac sand and crude oil pressure in overall RPU. So it was slightly down ex fuel, but it was all a mix impact.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","All right, if I back out the mix, what does core pricing look like, say, this quarter and relative to last quarter?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","It's up this quarter over last quarter, and it's up over the same quarter last year, and it's up over rail inflation.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Hey, congratulations. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your question.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to touch on a little bit broader topic of new technology that you might have coming down the pipe. I know in the past technological innovation, like distributed power, has allowed you to increase train length; and some of the Trip Optimizer software has given you some pretty interesting fuel improvements.","I guess the first part of that question: Are we pretty much done now? I know you've talked a bit about train lengths and how there's still a little bit of opportunity, but it sounds like it's more product-driven rather than technologically driven. And just correct me if I'm wrong there.","And the second part, is there anything \u2013 and perhaps this is for Mike. Mike, when you look down the pipe, is there anything that gets you excited in terms of technological improvements that could lead to some further cost savings? I know within trucking we're going as far as talking about autonomous trucks. Could we eventually see one-person crews, that kind of thing? Just love to get your thoughts on that.","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. Well, on the run rate of the things you talked about, which is DP and the fuel efficiency technology we're using, we still have run rate to go there and we still continue to implement it across the railroad. So we still have some opportunities going forward. And, as Jim noted on the fuel efficiency as part of our plan, that's a part of it.","So yeah, we feel like opportunity there. On the technology side, I don't see that there's any one big thing that we're kind of hanging our hat on. But I will tell you that we have technology embedded throughout our organizations on making us better. Whether it's using alerts or using mobile platforms for the supervisors out in the field, things like that, we have just continued to utilize technology throughout our operational organization to make us safer and more efficient.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","And on one-person crews?","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer","That's a \u2013 that's a big industry initiative. And there's going to have to be a lot with the regulatory side there as well. Of course, you know we've got a lot of one-person crews at our railroad now, whether it's pusher, or whether it's remote control. But we work with the regulators on what are the opportunities there going forward in the industry.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Okay. All right.

It is my pleasure to welcome you to our third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With me today are several members of our senior team, including our President, Jim Squires; our Chief Marketing Officer, Don Seale; our Chief Operating Officer, Mark Manion; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart.","I am pleased to report that Norfolk Southern achieved another very good quarter as third quarter financial results set records across the board. Earnings for the quarter were $1.79 per share, up 17% compared with the $1.53 we earned during third quarter last year. These strong results reflect continued high demand in most of our business groups as overall volumes increased 8% driven by double-digit increases in merchandise and intermodal offset by a slight decline in coal. For the second consecutive quarter, revenue topped $3 billion, up $199 million or 7% versus last year. And Don will fill you in on the revenue and volume details in a few minutes.","Similar to our second quarter results, our expenses were up only 3% and our resulting 67.0% operating ratio set a third quarter record. Now, while our financial results were very strong much like in the second quarter, the railroads velocity and operating metrics were considerably reduced year-over-year as we continue to be challenged by demand in excess of our forecast for the year. This was particularly significant in terms of our crew base, which was sized for lower volumes. As all of you know, it takes from 7 to 9 months to hire and qualify new transportation employees. And we are just now starting to see newly qualified conductors marking up in our critical areas. We continue to actively hire and have taken steps to accelerate our training cycle.","In addition, we have temporarily transferred over 100 train and engine service personnel to our busy Dearborn division from other parts of the network. We have the other special initiatives in place as well to help increase crew availability and we have a number of important infrastructure projects and new locomotives coming online in the fourth quarter as well. Mark will go over our service metrics and our initiatives for improvement in more detail with you.","While we have demonstrated our ability to successfully manage overall expenses, the network slowdown and recovery efforts have translated to some additional operating costs and Marta will go over all of them as well as the rest of the financials. In spite of these operating challenges, we are excited about delivering another quarter of record results and we remain optimistic about our prospects going forward.","And on that note, I will turn the program over to Don, then Mark, and then finally Marta, and then I will return with some closing comments before we take your questions. Don?","Don Seale - Chief Marketing Officer","Thanks, Wick and good morning everyone. As Wick stated, we are pleased to report that the third quarter of 2014 was our second consecutive $3 billion quarter with record revenues in both our merchandise and intermodal sectors, which were partially offset by a weaker coal market. Revenue growth of $199 million, up 7% versus third quarter of last year was generated by our merchandise business, which generated a $152 million, up 10% followed by intermodal, which was up $62 million or 10% over last year. In coal, weak global market conditions in the export sector and milder summer weather, which impacted coal demand, resulted in a decline of $15 million or 2% compared to third quarter of last year.","Volume increases in intermodal and merchandise accounted for $219 million of revenue variance in the quarter. Also positive year-over-year fuel surcharge revenue partially offset the negative mix effects associated with higher intermodal volumes and lower coal shipments. Accordingly, total RPU was down 1% in the quarter as a result of this negative mix effect between and within our business groups, which I will discuss in more detail as I review each of the major business groups.","Now, turning to the components of growth, total volume increased 8% due to 10% gains in merchandise and intermodal shipments, which offset a 2% decline in coal. Across our merchandise business, very strong performance was led by increased chemicals, automotive and metals and construction volumes. In intermodal for the first time shipments exceeded 1 million units in the quarter, a gain of almost 92,000 units, up 10% compared with third quarter 2013 with strength in both domestic and international markets. And in coal, volume declined by 2% as export shipments weakened due to continued global oversupply and sluggish demand.","Now, moving to our individual market segments, starting with coal, coal revenue was down $15 million or 2% compared to third quarter last year. Coal revenue per unit was flat in the quarter as declines in higher yielding export traffic offset the positive effects of increased longer haul traffic to our Southern utilities. With respect to utility coal, overall volumes declined by 3% as a result of milder summer temperatures with July in particular posting the lowest average temperature since 2009. Lower natural gas prices also impacted coal burn during the quarter. This factor along with a competitive contract loss resulted in a 14% decline in shipments to our northern utility plants, while volume to southern plants was up 9%.","In the export market, third quarter volumes were down 16% as excess global supply and lower commodity pricing continued to impact the seaboard and coal market causing declines in both metallurgical and thermal coal volumes at our Lambert\u2019s Point terminal. Within our domestic metallurgical markets, volumes were up 8% led by gains in coke shipments to the steel industry, which more than offset weaker domestic met coal volumes. And finally, industrial coal volumes increased by 32% due to new business and organic growth with industrial customers as the economy continues to improve.","Turning to intermodal, intermodal revenue in the quarter increased by $62 million or 10% to $667 million, which is a new quarterly record. With respect to revenue per unit, positive pricing activity within the domestic intermodal segment was offset by higher volumes of lower revenue per unit international freight leading to overall flat yield per shipment. Domestic intermodal volume was up 8% driven by targeted highway conversions across all business segments as well as organic growth with large key accounts across our domestic book of business. On the international side, strong volume growth of 15% was generated through organic growth with our existing shipping partners, new contract business and from new terminal growth.","Moving to our merchandise markets, these five carload business groups also set a new quarterly record with $1.7 billion in revenue, an increase of $152 million or 10% versus third quarter of 2013. Our merchandise markets also faced negative mix effects as strong volume growth within our metals, construction, and bi-level automotive segments offset gains in higher revenue per unit, agricultural and chemical commodities. As a result, overall merchandise RPU declined by $7 and was flat for the quarter.","With respect to volumes, growth was led by strong increases in crude by rail and natural gas liquids, which increased our chemicals volume by 17%. Automotive volumes were up 12% versus last year propelled by significant increases as we took advantage of the auto manufacturers\u2019 summer shutdown period in July to reduce finished vehicle inventory backlogs that were a result of national car \u2013 railcar supply issues incurred earlier in the year. And growth in frac sand, aggregates and steel increased our metals and construction carloads by a strong 12%. And the excellent 2013 corn crop continue to provide growth opportunities in our agricultural market helping to generate a volume gain of 6% in the quarter. Finally, paper and forest products volumes were flat in the quarter with double-digit gains in lumber offsetting declines in kaolin clay and waste shipments.","Now, I will conclude with our business outlook. We see continued opportunity ahead to generate solid growth across most of our business units. The exception is coal. So far this year, our utility coal shipments have been higher than expected due to elevated natural gas prices and the need to replenish stock piles. But the impact of milder weather and lower natural gas prices are now reversing some of that positive trend. On the plus side, we estimate that stock piles at our utilities remain 19% below December 2013 levels going into the winter heating season. So the wildcard is what kind of winter demand lies ahead.","In our met and thermal export markets, we continued to see global oversupply and low commodity pricing. And the weaker Australian dollar which has declined another 6% since September 1 is making Australian coal even more competitive in the global marketplace.","Turning to intermodal, tightening capacity and rising cost in the trucking industry will drive continued volume growth in our domestic markets as we take advantage of opportunities the highway conversion and yield improvement. And we expect continued growth in our international intermodal business through organic growth and new services. In our merchandise markets, we anticipate continued opportunities in crude oil and natural gas related products as well as drilling material such as frac sand and pipe. We also anticipate higher steel volumes to support the energy and automotive sectors, while housing expansion will help boost volumes in aggregates, lumber and construction materials. In the automotive sector, volumes are expected to move higher with increased vehicle production and with new models coming online at several Norfolk Southern served assembly plants.","Last, in our agricultural markets, expectations for another record corn and soybean harvest in 2014 will lead to domestic growth, as well as potential export opportunities in the months ahead. Now, let me summarize, we expect revenue and volume growth in our intermodal and merchandise markets, while we continued to face challenging and uncertain conditions in the coal sector. As we move forward, we remain keenly focused on improving service to meet the expectations of our customers and to support our ability to price to market at levels that equal or exceed rail inflation. In turn, we will continue to invest in equipment, locomotives and our network to provide better service today and in the future for our customers.","Thanks for your attention. And I will now turn it over to Mark for our operating report. Mark?","Mark Manion - Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Don. Third quarter operations were heavily impacted by very positive traffic growth. While we continue to target overall operating efficiency, network velocity and service performance have slipped. Initiatives to balance and effectively apply resources to those segments of a network that are seeing the most growth are stabilizing the operation and customers should start to notice improvements in service and service consistency during the fourth quarter. More importantly, these efforts will position us for further growth going into 2015.","On Slide 2, our nine months injury ratio stands at 1.18, down slightly when compared to last year. But we have been seeing improving trends continuing into the third quarter, which had an injury ratio of 1.09. Train incidents for the first nine months are flat compared to the full year in 2013 at 2.4 per million train miles. Crossing accidents increased to 4.0 per million train miles for the first nine months compared to 3.6 for the full year 2013. As I noted on my opening slide, service levels have been impacted by volume increases and particularly traffic increases across the corridor from Chicago to Philadelphia. Consequently, as you see on Slide 3, our composite service performance dropped to 68.6% in the third quarter, well below customer expectations and the record service level of 2013.","Moving to Slide 4, as you would expect, train speed and terminal dwell data show the same trend as the service composite, reflecting slower network velocity. Train speed averaged 20.9 miles per hour in the third quarter and terminal dwell was 24.7 hours. Both were impacted by volume as we have discussed, but there were also a number of track works and PTC projects across parts of the Northern region. These will be completed ahead of seasonal peaks in grain and intermodal. We have and we will continue to take additional steps that will bring measurable improvements to network velocity and service delivery. Some of these initiatives are outlined on Slide 5.","Aligning and positioning T&E forces with volume growth is our immediate focus. To address crew availability in the short-term, we have offered various temporary incentives to our current T&E employees. 114 conductors and engineers agreed to transfer temporarily from various parts of the network to locations on the Northern region where volume growth has outpaced crew availability. In addition, over 680 employees participated in a vacation buyback program. And we have also offered incentives to T&E employees who were eligible to retire, but defer retirement until 2015. As discussed in my remarks regarding second quarter operating results, we stepped up hiring and training in order to bring T&E forces in line with expected volumes. Currently we have 1,453 new T&E employees in various stages of the hiring, training and qualification process. In the third quarter, 206 new conductors were qualified and most of those were placed in the high traffic growth areas along the Chicago to Philadelphia corridor. In the fourth quarter, we expect that 596 will be qualified. At the beginning of this year, we had 11,290 T&E employees in active or training status. By the end of this year that number is expected to increase to 12,006, which is a net increase of 716 T&E employees this year.","Several new infrastructure projects in the Chicago area and Upper Midwest have or shortly will be completed, adding more capacity and more flexibility in our operations in and around the Chicago area. Perhaps the most important of these is the expansion of the terminal in Bellevue, Ohio. This project which nearly doubles the capacity of the terminal will ramp up in December. We will then begin a phased-in operating plan with full operations at Bellevue online during the first quarter of 2015. In addition to more capacity, the Bellevue expansion will give us much more flexibility in routing of trains to and from Chicago and more bypass options during periods of bad weather.","Now while Bellevue is the largest infrastructure project, other infrastructure projects are certainly worthy of noting. The Englewood Flyover in Chicago completed just this month, separates NS operations from metro trains through Chicago and has significantly improved fluidity of our operation there. The new 51st Street connection near our intermodal facility at Chicago will be completed early next year. When completed, the new connection will improve train operations and reduce time and handling for trains moving in and out of that facility. Our new connection at Goshen, Indiana will also be completed after the 1st of the year. It provides a direct link from our terminal at Elkhart to the Mariana, Ohio branch for more fluid operations and greater flexibility of operations around one of the largest terminals. And six new receiving tracks at our convoy terminal in Pittsburgh will be in service by the end of the year. This new capacity will improve service in this rapidly growing corridor that includes new crude by rail volume.","Finally, in terms of locomotives, we will be taking delivery of 50 new EMVs, SD70ACe units beginning this month. In addition, we recently reached an agreement to purchase 100 SD90MAC units and start taking \u2013 started taking delivery of those units in September. We expect to take delivery of 40 of these units by the end of the year. With these, the number of units available for services reached historic highs in line with historically high volumes. Together with aligning our T&E forces for expected demand, these projects for additional capacity and growth in our locomotive fleet gave us a very strong position moving into the fourth quarter and 2015.","Moving to the next slide, with volume increase of 8% in the third quarter, crew starts, including re-crews, increased by 2%. This margin of difference is due in part to improving operating efficiencies, but also reflects efforts to conserve available crews through train combinations and train annulments. We would still see very positive margin even with a more robust crew base. Our current crew base continues to be stretched, which is reflected in higher overtime hours, up 32% for the third quarter compared with the same period last year.","With hiring and other steps I have outlined, network velocity is expected to improve as we move into the fourth quarter and we expect to see that reflected in further improvements in operating efficiencies, particularly reductions in overtime. That trend should continue into 2015 when we expect that our crew base will be fully aligned with expected volumes. A 1% improvement in carloads per locomotive reflects our ability to absorb higher volume with existing train operation. And fuel utilization was also favorable as gallons per 1,000 gross ton miles declined by 4% compared to the same period last year.","Thank you. And now, Marta, I will turn it over to you.","Marta Stewart - Chief Financial Officer","Alright. Thank you, Mark and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s get started with the summary of our operating results on Slide 2. Revenues exceeded $3 billion, up $199 million or 7% driven as Don mentioned by double-digit volume gains in intermodal and merchandise. Operating expenses increased only $50 million or 3% resulting in a third quarter record operating ratio of 67%.","Slide 3 shows the major components of the $50 million net increase in railway operating expenses, which you know were almost entirely concentrated in the materials and other category.","Now, let\u2019s take a closer look at each expense categories beginning with materials and other on Slide 4. This line item increased by $45 million or 23%. As in the second quarter, the largest reason was significantly higher usage of locomotive materials, which was up almost $20 million. As Mark discussed, we have all our surge fleet locomotives deployed and total units in service are near historical highs. Also contributing to the rise in this category were higher casualty claims accruals and higher loss and damage costs. The relative increase in claims accruals was a result of favorable adjustments last year. The increased lading damage costs were due to two derailments during this quarter, which damaged finished vehicles and totaled $10 million. For the fourth quarter, we continued to expect a high rate of locomotive material usage and we also faced an unfavorable comparison in casualty claims accruals relative to last year.","Turning to Slide 5, purchased services and rents were up $9 million or 2% largely due to higher volume-related activities, particularly in the areas of intermodal ops, equipment rents, and joint facilities. Next, depreciation expense for the quarter rose by $6 million or 3% reflective of our larger capital base. We expect a similar increase in the fourth quarter.","As shown on Slide 7, fuel expense decreased by a net of $3 million or 1%. The 2014 third quarter average diesel fuel price of $2.96 per gallon was the first sub $3 quarterly average in more than 3 years. This lower price accounted for a $21 million reduction, while higher consumption increased fuel expense by $16 million. As Mark noted, this is only a 4% consumption increase on an 8% rise in traffic.","Slide 8 details the $7 million or 1% decline in compensation and benefit cost. As discussed in prior quarters, continued favorability and post-retirement medical and pension accruals coupled with slightly lower health and welfare costs resulted in a $44 million reduction in expense. Partly offsetting this decline were increased pay rates of $16 million, higher incentive compensation of $12 million, and $10 million more in over time. With the exception of incentive comp, we expect these variances to continue at similar levels in the fourth quarter. Turning to our non-operating items, other income net was up $2 million on higher property sales and interest expense on debt was up $7 million related to last year\u2019s debt issuance.","Slide 10 depicts our income tax accruals and the effective rates. Total taxes were $333 million, up $67 million largely due to higher free tax earnings. The effective tax rate was 37.3% compared to 35.6% last year, which had the benefits from a state tax decrease and tax credit.","Slide 11 displays our net income and EPS comparisons, which were both third quarter records. Net income of $559 million was up $77 million or 16% and diluted earnings per share, was $1.79, up $0.26 or 17%.","Wrapping up our financial overview on Slide 12, cash from operations for the first nine months totaled $2.3 billion covering capital spending and producing nearly $1 billion in free cash flow. We distributed $511 million in dividends and $166 million in share repurchases.","Thank you. And I will now turn the program back to Wick.","Wick Moorman - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Marta. Well, as you have heard, it was another very good quarter for Norfolk Southern. However, as good as these results are, it\u2019s clear that they could have been even better, if we have been able to achieve the network velocities in line with our performance for the prior two years. And not only did these operating issues have an impact on our financial performance, more importantly, they kept us from delivering transportation services to our customers at the level that they have come to expect from our company. For that reason, we are very focused on getting back to the service metrics that we have posted in the prior two years as quickly as we can and then improving further from there. Mark outlined some of the steps that we are taking. And while it will take a little time to reach our 2012\/2013 velocities, we are very confident that we are on the right path and that the infrastructure and resources that we are adding will set the stage for us to grow volumes and provide even better service in the future. We have a great team at Norfolk Southern. And I have every confidence in our ability to continue to provide outstanding service to our customers and outstanding results for our shareholders.","Thanks for your attention. And I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Yes, hi there. Good morning. Wick or Mark, I wanted to talk a little bit further on the service issues, is it just as simple as adding locomotives and employees, is it really a resource constraint? I am sure you are aware of the other argument that M&A is a solution there. So, can you sort of talk about what leverage you can pull on? How you sort of see this?","Mark Manion","Yes. I am sure Wick will talk about the M&A side of it. In priority order for us, it\u2019s a crew issue. I mean, the reality is you need a sufficient number of crews in order to handling your volume. And our volume just outpaced the crew. So, as I have said, we are ramping those up and we start to turn those crews on Bill in a bigger way in November and December and that will be very helpful. But we are already seeing improvement from those temporary folks that I spoke of that went to our Northern region. Now, in addition to crews and as far as locomotives go, I mean the reality is we have got enough locomotives right now, but when you get into a lower velocity situation that eats up your locomotives, so you get to the point where you can\u2019t hardly have enough. So, it will be helpful to have these additional locomotives coming on and they already are coming on. So, that will be good.","Now, another important factor here is these infrastructure projects. As businesses ramped, these projects and I won\u2019t go through them again, I mentioned them they will be no one project by itself fixes it, but you combine those projects particularly with our Bellevue infrastructure project that just plant gives you more capacity. And that\u2019s the sort of thing that from a standpoint of being sustainable and allowing for more growth going forward, that\u2019s what those infrastructure projects get you. So, we are really looking forward to that.","And then the last thing I would mention is that we have been doing a lot to find some routes around Chicago. And just one, for example, as we have got aligned, it\u2019s immediately south of Chicago, we refer to it as our Streator line and we are taking a hard look at what we are actually starting to use that in a greater way for more interchange of traffic, but we are even looking at increasing our infrastructure on that route in the short-term. So, those are the kind of things that bulk you up to be able to handle more traffic and operate more effectively than we currently are. Wick?","Wick Moorman","Well, I will say too that the problems that we are experiencing are not unique to Norfolk Southern there are lot of issues across the industry, which are well documented and everyone is talking frankly about them. That does have some impact on us, certainly the Chicago Gateway has been congested and erratic over the past number of months, but all the carriers are trying to address that and I think that collectively we are all taking the right steps to address that. The simple fact about Chicago is that, there is an enormous amount of rail infrastructure from both the east and the west that just points that way. That\u2019s where a lot of railroad capacity meets. And we are always going to do a lot of business through Chicago. We \u2013 and there are lots of different opinions about it, but we are looking bilaterally and as Mark mentioned with other carriers in terms of thinking about alternative locations, when that\u2019s possible, but it\u2019s not always possible for a number of reasons.","And the other thing I will say is that we have seen very positive impact over the past two years in Chicago from CREATE. It has opened up a lot of real congestion points for us, former congestion points and not just CREATE but projects like the Englewood Flyover, which effectively gave us 6 to 8 hours more access to our mainline everyday are really important. So, every franchise is different, Bill, as you know, but when we look at the issues that we are facing \u2013 have been facing and we do the analysis and we have done a lot of analysis. It comes right back to what Mark would say.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Let me ask one follow-up to this and if I missed this in your prepared remarks, I apologize, but have you quantified what the service challenges have cost this year or maybe even include weather. Just so we have a sense for look there is this much embedded in the cost structure this year that if it goes according to plan won\u2019t be there next year?","Marta Stewart","Well, in the third quarter, it is difficult Bill. This is Marta. It is difficult, Bill to kind of tease it apart from the volumetric increase, but generally speaking, rough numbers you can assume that most of the increase in over time, which this quarter was $10 million and last quarter was a similar amount. Most of the increase in over time is related to that. And I say that the other biggest item would be the increased locomotive materials, because Mark\u2019s folks have had to fix the heavy bad order locomotives. And so I would estimate for this quarter you take all of the over time at $10 million somewhere between 0.5 to 3 quarters up to $20 million increased locomotive materials and that would be about the impact the service had on our expenses.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Okay, fair enough. Thank you for the time.","Wick Moorman","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, in spite of the service issues in the third quarter, you guys were able to post pretty strong incremental margins, but looking at and granted it\u2019s only three weeks, but if we look at the recent volume data, it suggests that there has been a pretty material slowdown in growth. Is this sort of a direct result of not having enough crews and obviously the outlook for coal isn\u2019t positive, but do you expect a return to growth in automotive and ag once you get some of these qualified employees in the network?","Don Seale","Good morning, Allison. This is Don. We are not seeing a slowdown in our business. What we are seeing is the lapping of very strong comps in the fourth quarter from last year. As you will recall, our merchandise volumes in 2013 in the fourth quarter were up 8% and our intermodal volumes were up 6%. So, we are beginning to face tougher comps year-over-year. The second thing I would add thereto is that we are seeing a deceleration in coal volume on the export side and we are seeing weaker utility volumes as I pointed out due to natural gas prices dropping and milder weather. We also saw our intermodal business peak fairly early toward the end of September. And that is predominantly on the international side with consumer goods coming in for the holiday season. So, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into the year-over-year volumes other than the comp and the fact that coal was decelerating somewhat and that we probably have seen our fall peak even though it was a small fall peak in intermodal.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Okay. And as a follow-up question, on the post-retirement and pension expense for this year, could you parse out the difference between the two ends, I know that you made some changes to the post-retirement plan? So, how do we think about what will persist in terms of a tailwind for next year and what are your initial expectations for pension expense in 2015?","Marta Stewart","Okay. Well, I will take that in two pieces. First of all, with respect to this quarter in the post-retirement and pension, the bulk of that is post-retirement $31 million and the pension was $8 million. So, both of those were decreased compared to last year. So \u2013 and we have had similar amounts in each quarter this year relative to the prior year. Going forwards into next year, of course that\u2019s going to be \u2013 we will be able to give you more visibility into that in January. That\u2019s going to be dependent on the interest rate as of the end of the year and where our pension assets stand. Thinking about it if we had to look at it as those items right now, we would probably have about even 2015 expenses in the areas compared to 2014. So, in other words, we are not going to have the big letdown that we had in 2014, but we think we are going to stay about even.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Okay. And is that basically because the changes that you made in the retiree medical plan could potentially offset any increase in pension expense?","Marta Stewart","Well, the change that we made is going forward. So, that\u2019s \u2013 so with regard to post-retirement medical, the change that we made is a go-forward change, so that would impact 2014 and 2015 the same way, that\u2019s why that\u2019s the same. And then the pension on its own, the asset plan, the assets have done very well and unless interest rates change markedly between now and the end of the year, that should stay flat to same.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Okay, great. Thank you so much for the clarification.","Wick Moorman","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead with your question.","Jason Seidl - Cowen & Company","Yes, good morning guys. Staying on the service a little bit, with all these new locomotives coming on, should we start seeing that locomotive increase expense from materials start abating in 4Q? So, should that be a little bit lower than it was in 3Q?","Wick Moorman","Jason, I wouldn\u2019t want to predict that it\u2019s going to come down much in the fourth quarter, because they really \u2013 we start to see most of this power in the November-December timeframe, but certainly as we bring these new locomotives in and as velocity improves as Mark says, we are going to have the ability then to take hopefully a good number of these older, higher maintenance, less efficient locomotives out and put them back into our surge fleet and also put them back into the queue where we got a lot of them for our rebuild program.","Marta Stewart","And right now, Mark\u2019s folks are estimating. They are going to do whatever it takes to fixing those locomotives. But as you know the locomotive material was up $10 million in the second quarter, $20 million in the third quarter and they think they will be somewhere between those two for the fourth quarter.","Jason Seidl - Cowen & Company","Fourth quarter. Okay. Thank you. And as it pertains towards all the merger talk we have and also all the talk about Chicago, Wick I think you mentioned that there is only so much you can do with the rails working together, but what can the railroads do short of a merger to sort of help improve some of the service levels through either joint projects or joint ventures?","Wick Moorman","Well, I think everyone is doing a lot of work on that Jason in line \u2013 along the lines of what we are doing. We are very \u2013 we work together in Chicago to try and manage the flows through there. We do that collectively as you know. Every railroad that I am aware of is looking at additional infrastructure, if it\u2019s required on their routes coming into Chicago. Certainly that\u2019s true in the West as you know. And I think that as we do that, as we make sure that we are resourced properly that we are going to be able to handle business and handle more business through Chicago successfully in the future. I think what we \u2013 this is my opinion, I think what we have seen this year is something of an anomaly and that we had as you know an extraordinarily tough winter. And then we had a really very unusual kind of volume growth through a single gateway driven by the energy business and at some point that returns to more normal growth levels and we can manage through that. So I am optimistic that as the great projects continue to come online and as we all work together that Chicago will always be a very, very busy place to operate. We will \u2013 it will occasionally be a tough place to operate. Collectively we can make Chicago work in the current industry configuration.","Jason Seidl - Cowen & Company","Thanks for the commentary Wick. And thanks for the time guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Wadewitz - UBS","Yes. Good morning. Wick I guess I apologize for asking you about this again, I don\u2019t know if you love talking about it, but just to be completely clear on this and you have probably said this in various ways. Do you think that it would be \u2013 are you essentially \u2013 do you have a position on rail combinations in terms of you think it\u2019s a bad idea and you think regulators wouldn\u2019t approve it or are you open to the idea and you think there are pluses and minuses or just what\u2019s your kind of clear position on the idea of rail combinations, I know obviously you have talked around it a bit today?","Wick Moorman","Well. Tom, this is something that I have said in a lot of forms and I will go ahead and say it briefly. And I will preface it by saying that different people in the industry have different opinions about this. And I will go ahead and say I have a very high regard and respect for the head of the CP, but this is just a place where I have a different opinion. I think that a major railroad merger is not a good idea. It\u2019s highly problematic for three reasons. The first is that our history is that putting these big companies together is very difficult and at least historically has led to significant service problems for some period of time.","The second reason is that while historically a lot of mergers were justified because of significant synergies. If you put two big carriers together there aren\u2019t that many overlapping routes. There aren\u2019t that many redundant facilities. You can save some money, yes, but it\u2019s not necessarily order of magnitude that it used to be. And then third and most important. I think it would go into the phase of a regulatory environment, which is not receptive in anyway to major combinations. And there are the new rules out there that it has to be pro-competitive, that is not defined. And it could be defined in ways, that are very onerous and in which you could give up, all of the potential benefits and more in a transaction. So, I just think that \u2013 I just think they don\u2019t make sense at this time. And as I say reasonable people can differ on that, but that\u2019s certainly my opinion.","Tom Wadewitz - UBS","Okay. Yes, that\u2019s very helpful. I appreciate you, giving a very clear response to that, that\u2019s very helpful. I have got a question for Don, the yields in third quarter were weaker than we would have expected, I know you gave us a lot of detail on why mix is a headwind in various respects, what is your visibility to pricing and to yields if we go into 2015, discussions with customers, contracts, you have already signed for 2015, do you \u2013 can you give us some flavor and a sense of how much confidence you might have in stronger pricing and stronger yields when you look to 2015?","Don Seale","Good morning Tom. As you well know the capacity factor in transportation in North America has tightened significantly. As we have said many times in the past, we price to the marketplace and we see increasing opportunities for price improvements ahead. We have about 15% \u2013 right at 15% of our remaining, pricing to do on the book for 2014 and we have about 50%, right at 50% of our book of business to be reprised in 2015. And we will be taking that tighter transportation capacity into our strategy and you will see that in the results of our price activity. So we price to the market, the market is tight for capacity that enables us to have a more optimistic outlook on pricing ahead.","Tom Wadewitz - UBS","Should we expect the yield is going to \u2013 mix is going to continue to be a headwind in 2015 or some of the mix pressures you saw in third quarter maybe they ease up a bit, so the pricing flow through a bit more to the revenue per unit?","Wick Moorman","Tom, we have so many moving parts with respect to the different business segments. I even mentioned this morning that in our automotive sector, which was very strong in the third quarter, up 12%. We had a much higher percentage growth in bi-level traffic, which is the cars \u2013 the railcars that transport SUVs and pickup trucks. The load factor is not as high for SUVs and pickup trucks on a railcar versus passenger cars. And there is a differential of about 15% in the revenue per unit \u2013 revenue per car for those bi-levels versus tri-levels. That\u2019s just an example of how the mix continues to play out in coal when our export market is down, that\u2019s our highest revenue per unit business. And when our Northern utility business goes up, for example, that\u2019s lower. So I don\u2019t know what all the combinations are going to be, in 2015 we will just have to see how it works out. But we will continue to see negative mix if nothing else as we grow intermodal at a much faster pace and coal continues to either be flat or modestly down, which is the ultimate mix effect.","Tom Wadewitz - UBS","Right. Okay. Thank you for the time. I appreciate it.","Wick Moorman","Thanks Tom.","Don Seale","Thanks Tom.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup","Thanks. Good morning. I want to talk a little bit about the service metrics and a little bit more about the timing I guess of potential improvements and maybe understanding a little bit better the sequential deterioration at least in the velocity metrics in the terminal Bellevue that we see publically, it seems like we are sort of ending the third quarter, beginning the fourth quarter at a low watermark, just want to get a rough sense. If you think Mark from your perspective that this is sort of November, December as you get those new crews onboard, you start to be able to turn those metrics a little bit more constructively and during the quarter if there was something specifically other than just a confluence of volumes that was causing that sequential deterioration?","Mark Manion","Yes. I think we have seen the trough on this and in fact the public metrics do lag a little bit and we are seeing improvement that\u2019s going on more recently and something that we track is specifically where our velocity is at very \u2013 in various parts of our system. And the reality is our Eastern region, our Western region that is two-thirds of our system has been operating rather well from a velocity standpoint. And the problems have been pretty localized to that East-West Gateway between Chicago and Jersey or really Philly. So, we see much better fluidity in that area at this point, still very heavy. I mean, we have still got \u2013 we have still got all the business up there, because as far as the volumes go, that area has continued to have a lot of traffic. And we see that \u2013 I think we see that sustained, but we will see improvement as we go forward in the quarter. And I think we said that last quarter that we will start to see our improvements in the fourth quarter, but as we said before, the people, the resources really come on more in the November-December timeframe, but we are already starting to see that tick up.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then switching gears down, if I could ask you about little bit about the coal side, just want to understand sort of the yield dynamic as we think about fourth quarter and going forward obviously, you have had some mix issues and export declining a little bit. You had a pop in the second quarter, which I think was driven by some of the longer haul utility moves, but as you think out to the fourth quarter with where the seaborne market is and where the utility demand is coming from, is this roughly the right way to be thinking about yield kind of what we saw in the third quarter? Just want to get a rough sense on the mix potential in the shorter term, if I could?","Don Seale","Yes, I think what we saw in the third quarter will be what we are seeing in the fourth quarter predominantly sequentially coming from the second to third quarter, you will recall that we had a $43 million increase in coal overall, which was driven predominantly by a 23% increase into our Southeastern utilities that tended to weaken as the summer wore on and we saw milder weather, lower gas prices. So, our Northern utility business was down, but Southern utility was only up about 9% in the third quarter. That did impact RPU. As far as expert goes, we pretty much see the same type of market condition, don\u2019t see a lot of significant change, it\u2019s weak on thermal and met coal and we don\u2019t expect that to improve in the fourth quarter nor do we see any driver for improvement in the first quarter for that.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup","Okay. So, this is sort of the run-rate in the next couple of quarters at least on the export market in your view?","Don Seale","We hope so.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup","Okay. Thanks very much for the time. I appreciate it.","Wick Moorman","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys.","Wick Moorman","Good morning.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","So, Don, that was helpful in terms of their coal mix and how you think about that going forward? I want to ask about intermodal mix with the peak you are saying kind of happening \u2013 happened already maybe international growth going to slow, does intermodal mix become more positive as domestic starts to grow faster?","Don Seale","We expect that mix to moderate that mix differential between domestic and international. International has been very strong this year, because of the West Coast ILWU negotiations that shifted business to East Coast ports. We have also had some organic growth with our international partners and some new businesses through new terminals and new contract arrangements. We will start to lap those events as we get into 2015 and we will see domestic growth outpace international growth in my opinion going forward. So, we will see that mix effect start to moderate.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","It should probably reverse and turn positive, is that fair?","Don Seale","It will start to turn positive, correct.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Okay. And then one for Mark, so you gave a lot of numbers around your planning with headcount, I am not sure what it means for net overall headcount the way we see it. What kind of headcount growth do you think we should be modeling in fourth quarter and 2015? And given the catch up in the headcount, you think we will have headcount up more or less than volume growth in 2015?","Marta Stewart","I will take the 2014 question and let Mark address the 2015 question. For 2014, we continue to think that we are going to end the year about even to where we were last year. So, that would be \u2013 last quarter, we talked about being 900 up from the second quarter. As Mark said, we are up about 400 this quarter. So, we couldn\u2019t be up another 500 in the fourth quarter.","Mark Manion","And going into next year partly in terms of continuing to build our crew base to keep up with today\u2019s business levels and then partly for more business opportunities that are coming up in \u201815 will add another net 500 to 600 people to what we have at the end of the year.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Okay. So, we should probably think about volume growth still outpacing headcount by a good amount next year?","Mark Manion","Oh, yes. For the first, it\u2019s going to take us well really \u2013 we will be working on it through the first half, but keeping in mind that once we end the year and turned the corner into \u201815, the additional people we have are going to be very helpful in terms of improving our service product. So, we won\u2019t be completely done until we get into the latter part of the second quarter.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Mark, can I just ask what\u2019s the difference in like the 1,900 people you talked about that you are training versus that 500 number, is that just attrition, is that the difference?","Mark Manion","Well, I want to make sure I understand the question. I am not sure about the 1,900...","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","I thought in your prepared comments and maybe it\u2019s not 1,900, but you gave some, a large number of people currently being trained and adding another 500 people from here. So, that \u2013 is the difference just attrition?","Mark Manion","No. I spoke of \u2013 since the beginning of the year, we have started in training or have produced a total of 1,700 plus people. And then I further defined what that \u2013 how that looks in the third quarter and what our net will be by the end of the year?","Wick Moorman","Yes. Scott, I think there are three things that go on there. One is, some of this we continue to have attrition in the T&E workforce. So, you \u2013 that\u2019s a number we have to take into account. We have some very modest attrition even in the training program, not much, but there is some there. And then the other thing is at any given time, you are trying to take a snapshot of qualified employees and trainees. So, when Mark talks about the total number of people in the pipeline, there are 500 people who come out, finish their training in the fourth quarter plus or minus. And then their additional people are in that bigger number you mentioned who are finishing their training later in the first quarter of next year. So, it\u2019s always hard to kind of pin down at any given moment what\u2019s going on, but I think the net \u2013 the important message here is that we have a lot of people in the pipeline. We start \u2013 we are seeing, starting to see significant increases, but going back to your original question, our T&E staffing, once we get it to the point where we need for it to be, we will still be growing at a rate that\u2019s less than our volume growth. We still expect continued efficiencies in terms of train length and train operations in the same way that you have seen us produce them over the past couple of years.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","That\u2019s helpful, Wick. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays","Yes, good morning everyone. I know it\u2019s been a long call, but I just, Wick, I want to follow-up on that commentary there, because it sounds like there is a lot of puts and takes as we look at 2015. I mean, if you are adding all these assets and people, you should get better productivity as you just mentioned. Does that suggest that the sustainability in incremental margins like we have seen this year should extend into 2015?","Wick Moorman","I will let Marta comment on that too. I do think that as we increase \u2013 there is no question as we increase network velocity even whereas we add these resources that it\u2019s a more efficient railroad, it\u2019s a more productive railroad. And in addition it augments our opportunities for volume growth because of the service component. So there is a lot of good news there. In terms of incremental margins, Marta I think our expectation is they will \u2013 they will remain very strong, whether they will continue quite at the pace that we have seen them this year, we are not sure, but we except to continue to produce strong incremental margins in the business.","Marta Stewart","I agree with you. The only thing I would add to that is just a reminder and publicly already had this, Brandon but just a reminder that this year\u2019s incremental margin is affected by the post-retirement medical and pension, which Allison asked about. So if you back that out, we would get more to a \u2013 more closer to a run rate incremental margin.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays","Well, completely understood. And I think that translates on a pretty bright outlook here for the company. And so if I can just ask one follow-up here, I mean you guys have well over $1 billion in cash right now and I know you have some debt maturities, but it seems like your share repurchase program has really slowed down, you have a big authorization out there. With that outlook and arguably one of the cheapest valuations within your sector right now and in the marketplace why not be more aggressive on the share repurchase?","Marta Stewart","Well, as you know Brandon, I mean, we believe in share repurchases. We have been a long time buyer of our shares, other than the recessionary year 2009 we bought back a significant number of shares since 2006. But over that time period and continuing into now, we moderate those share repurchases just based on overall market volatility. And so, all I can say is that we remain share repurchase, we expect to continue to remain that and we will just go into modulate it based on market conditions.","Wick Moorman","Brandon, let me add to that. As we always discuss, our first priority is capital expenditures to grow the company, we are in the middle of that process right now. Our second is dividends, we have a very strong dividend track record and we will continue to have a strong dividend policy. And then share repurchases, as Marta said we are \u2013 we stay in the market, but I will also say it\u2019s something that we constantly reevaluate. And we will continue to reevaluate it and certainly the factors that you mentioned are very legitimate factors. So going forward, we will continue to look at that. And if we see a point \u2013 see a certain point where we think we need to become more aggressive or change our policy we are certainly willing to do that and will.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna International. Please go ahead with your question.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna International","Thanks for the time. So the fuel surcharge program you introduced in 2008, I believe it kicks in at $90 WTI and oil has trended below that for most of this month, which would imply that at least fuel prices could fall further while at least some of your surcharge revenues are staying flat and I know that\u2019s not your only program in summer based at lower levels, but can you give us an update on the fuel surcharge mix and how it trends among your business groups and how you expect lower fuel prices to impact your revenues on that front going forward if energy prices were to trend around where they are today?","Don Seale","Good morning. This is Don. As you indicated, we have many different fuel surcharge formulas that have been negotiated with numerous customers in contracts and other instruments, so we do not have one fuel surcharge program. Our carload business generally is based off of West Texas Intermediate crude oil, while our intermodal business is based on highway diesel fuel. So we don\u2019t even have the same standards for all of the business because there are different characteristics of the business itself. So we have a 60-day lag generally on our carload business, a weekly lag on our intermodal business that will continue to move up and down with crude oil prices, diesel prices, crack spreads all of the things that impact fuel over time. So I can\u2019t give you a specific outlook for that, because frankly I can\u2019t tell you where the forward curve will windup for West Texas Intermediate crude or on highway diesel for next year.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna International","If oil were to stay in the low $80 range, is there a significant portion in your business where surcharges would be locked in at or not fall further?","Don Seale","I just can\u2019t give you color on that because we have so many different formulas that have been negotiated with customers.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna International","Alright. Well, thank you for the time.","Don Seale","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","John Larkin - Stifel","Thanks gentlemen for taking my questions.","Wick Moorman","Thank you, John.","John Larkin - Stifel","Just wanted to talk a little bit more about the application of incremental crews and incremental locomotives to solve the service issues that you have been grappling with here the last couple of quarters, it seems to me that as things play out here into 2015 that you are going to have enough resources to bring your velocity up, new terminals dwell down which effectively will create more capacity. Now, you said earlier that the new locomotives will be here and that will give you the opportunity the push to the more costly less efficient older units into the reserve fleet, how do you handle the crew situation at that point, if in fact you do rebound to previous velocity in terminal dwell numbers?","Mark Manion","Well, that would be a good thing. As far as the crew base goes, we are planning like I said on that 500 or 600 net add people next year. But as velocity comes \u2013 as velocity goes up, it lessens the need for crews. So we can always throttle that back some if we need to.","John Larkin - Stifel","Okay. And then Marta, you answered a question earlier regarding the cost of the congestion and I was just wondering if there was a revenue component to that also if in fact service had gotten to the point in some parts of the network where customers have gone a different direction with their transportation needs until you can get this service back up to where it needs to be?","Don Seale","This is Don. On the top line side of our business, car utilization and available capacity to move more volume is probably the larger concern with respect to current velocity. Obviously, we are having some pressure points with certain customers. We are working through those, but my larger concern is utilization of equipment and capacity of the fleet in general.","John Larkin - Stifel","Is it reasonable to assume that revenue growth might have been a point or two higher if you would not have those equipment availability problems?","Don Seale","We would have had some higher revenue in the automotive sector. Some areas like that, but I would like to maybe showcase that question and just point out that sequentially from the second quarter to the third quarter, the second quarter was our all time high top line revenue. We only missed that by $19 million in the third quarter with coal being the swing of $58 million between the second quarter and the third quarter. We were up $43 million in coal in the second quarter. We were down $15 million in the third quarter. So, sequentially we came close to meeting an all time record with coal swings of $58 million quarter-to-quarter.","John Larkin - Stifel","Got it. Thanks for the color.","Don Seale","Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Long - Stephens","Thanks. And I wanted to ask my first question on pricing, as you have implemented some of the rate increases in intermodal that you talked about last quarter, have shippers been pretty receptive given the tightness in capacity or are you getting any pushback on pricing up in this type of service environment?","Don Seale","We are always sensitive to the timing of pricing, but capacity and tight capacity are the two things that are driving price improvement in today\u2019s marketplace. So the price increases that we took in are domestic rail controlled containers. In June and September have stuck and we continue to assess that market going forward for additional price opportunity.","Justin Long - Stephens","Okay, great. And as a follow-up on coal, I wanted to ask about domestic coal into 2015 and I know it\u2019s tough, but let\u2019s just assume normal weather patterns and based on the stockpile levels that you referenced in recent conversations with customers, do you think domestic coal is flat or down again in 2015 or is there a chance you could see some improvement?","Don Seale","Let\u2019s segment the market with respect to export, with the Australian currency differential expanding and the benchmark met coal price of $119 a ton and a thermal index to Europe at about $72 a ton, if those two indices continue to be that low, U.S. producers will be very pressured to have any growth in export in 2015. The wildcard as I mentioned on our utility call will be what kind of weather we have during the winter. We are 19% below stockpiles as of December 2013 right now. And if we get anything like last year\u2019s winter, we will see some increase in demand for utility coal during the winter and coming out of the winter, because I suspect natural gas prices will rise as they did last year and electricity demand will increase. So, those are export, we don\u2019t see any significant driver in the near-term. Utility would be the upcoming winter and what kind of weather we get.","Justin Long - Stephens","Okay, fair enough. I will leave it at that. Thanks for the time.","Don Seale","Welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your question.","Walter Spracklin - RBC","Yes, thanks very much. Most of my questions have been answered. I am just going to follow-up on one and that is on your buyback. I know, Wick, you were saying about reevaluating constantly that buyback and certainly it\u2019s trended well below what we thought you would do when you announced your last program. So, I see $1.5 billion in cash on the balance sheet, but also about $550 million of debt repaid. In that reevaluation aspect, what has caused you a little bit of concern about buying back your shares at these levels and if you do reevaluate, do we go to \u2013 what is the flex up that we could see, is it incremental or could you see a significant increase in your buyback next year?","Wick Moorman","Well, I don\u2019t know that I would comment on what we would see in terms of any magnitude of the change. I would certainly think though that as we went into the year, we were looking at all of the factors around share price. And as they have moved \u2013 and as factors have changed, valuations have changed, we will take a look and see if our program needs to be evaluated again as I mentioned. I think the important message is that this is something obviously that we actively discuss and that we look at where markets are and we will come to an opinion on what we need to do go forward in 2015.","Walter Spracklin - RBC","Okay. Just to slip in another one I guess on the crude by rail, we have heard the other companies talk about the factors and spreads and drivers in their specific origination markets that might \u2013 that the current volatility in the energy prices would cause. Don, are you \u2013 what are you hearing from your customers in terms of their propensity to relax some of their shipments on crew that you either originate or carry by interchange, what\u2019s your thoughts going forward on that market?","Wick Moorman","We are not receiving any input from our customers that the short-term Brent crude spreads that have become very close or within $3 a barrel right now are impacting their plans to continue to take Bakken and Western Canadian crude. We are being told that most of them have arrangements that go beyond short-term fluctuations in the market and their expectations are that the Brent and WTI spread will increase over the next several months.","Walter Spracklin - RBC","And barring that increase then we might see some action?","Wick Moorman","We are not getting that indication. At this point, our crude oil for example in the third quarter was over 12,000 cars. Over the third quarter of 2013, we are now handling 30,000 cars a quarter, which is what the third quarter represented. So, we are seeing our crude oil business both from Western Canada and from the Bakken, the Williston Basin continue to show some robust dynamics.","Walter Spracklin - RBC","Okay, that\u2019s all my questions. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank","Hey, good morning. Mark, you did a really good job in terms of laying out the expectations with regard to overall locomotives and crew that are coming on and how that should play out with regard to service performance. If I could barrel in a little bit more in terms of your intermodal service performance, it looks like that\u2019s taken a little bit of a harsher leg down and kind of the start of the fourth quarter relative to where we have been in the third. Could you talk a little bit about the dynamics and how you see that side of this segment kind of improving throughout the fourth quarter? I realize a lot of this traffic is coming on that Chicago and to kind of the New England area, which is more heavily congested right now?","Mark Manion","Yes, I would be glad to. And that fits right up with the comment I made about the fluidity on that East West corridor opening up so nicely here more recently. And along with that while our intermodal terminals still have a lot of business, they are heavy. They are in a very \u2013 what I will call, a very orderly fashion. So, they are able to process well in the intermodal terminals and our mainlines which as I have said before is our heaviest capacity mainlines we have got on the system. They are open for business. So, I see that moving in a positive direction for our intermodal business as we go into the rest of the fourth quarter.","Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And I guess given the lower kind of overall fuel prices, obviously that does cage a little bit of the value proposition for the intermodal side of the business, Don. If the intermodal velocity improvements are constrained, would that cage it all your optimism for the growth outlook for intermodal as we look out into 2015 at kind of current WTI levels or are the trucking capacity constraints such that you think you will be able to materially outgrow GDP even if the velocity is constrained near-term?","Don Seale","The latter is the case trucking and motor carrier capacity will be tight in 2015. We don\u2019t foresee fuel prices at current levels changing that dynamic or changing the economic model. So, we expect our domestic intermodal business to continue to show significant growth.","Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank","Perfect. Thanks so much for the time guys.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs","Good morning. I just had a couple of questions on the coal side. In prior calls, you talked about export coal freight rates effectively bottoming out and I was wondering Don, if you could just give us a little bit of color around the third quarter export coal freight rates versus the second in the prior quarter and maybe year-on-year?","Don Seale","No change second to third quarter and we anticipate no change third to fourth quarter and for that matter based on what we are seeing first quarter as well.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs","Okay, thanks. And then just with regard to the utility coal mix, can you talk a little bit more about how the sourcing has shifted maybe Q-on-Q like could you give us a breakdown of how much coal is coming from the App versus Illinois Basin and so on?","Don Seale","Yes. We are still about 34% of our originated coal coming out of Central App, 28% coming out of Northern App, 19% from the Illinois Basin, and 16% from the PRB. The largest change as you know year-over-year that we described in the second quarter is the Illinois Basin now exceeding the originations that we handle from PRB.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs","Thank you.","Don Seale","Welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch","Great. Good afternoon I guess by now. Just wanted to follow-up on the efficiencies and I guess this might sound odd just given your operating ratio being at the 67, but looking at you talked about having more locomotives on the fleet now. If we go back a decade, you still haven\u2019t hit peak volume, so kind of surprising you have got more locomotives, I just want to understand over the past years have we lost some of those efficiency gains? Does it take a whole new operating plan or anything that has to shift in order to get the velocity and everything back up or is this just little bit by little bit just looking at with some of the other carriers we have seen making major changes to improve performance, I just want to understand, how we have gotten to this point of decreasing efficiency yet having more on the network, should we take some of that off in terms of locomotives, in crew and get that efficiency back up?","Don Seale","Well, obviously a big add on these locomotives these days is working our way out of a difficult situation with the velocity issue. So, we should see that improve as we go into next year like we have already talked about. But in addition to that we have got to keep in mind that there has been a significant mix change over time. And with the \u2013 with our intermodal business growing the way it has that adds locomotives to the fleet. And just looking at productivity in a little broader way also keep in mind that we are three years in a real concerted way working on various things from a productivity standpoint that has had the effect of lowering our overall cost structure and that\u2019s why we see a more modest expense increase with all these other things going on.","Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch","But just to understand that when they will be more I guess unit trains, if you are running more intermodal and especially given that Crescent and Heartland Corridor build outs, say you have got kind of more point to point, I guess I am just trying to understand have you put too much onto create too much congestion and that\u2019s causing that velocity, given the volumes, I am just trying to understand versus 10 years ago, where you had more volumes, and now you have got more locomotives and more infrastructure on the network today, I am just trying to understand is there something that needs to be overhauled in the operating plan or is it just continuing to add more assets?","Wick Moorman","Well, I think \u2013 let me add to what Mark said. If you go back 10 years, the railroad and the operations looked very different than they do today in terms of our mix of business. And we have added substantially more intermodal business. It\u2019s a big \u2013 much bigger part of our franchise and intermodal trains are dispatched with higher horsepower for trailing ton and that\u2019s had a significant impact on our locomotive requirements. The second thing that has happened to us is that our unit trains have grown significantly and particularly with the crude oil, but even before that with real emphasis on unit trains in Ag, automotive and grain. And all of that traffic is great traffic and it\u2019s very profitable and we won it. And that\u2019s the way the customers want to ship it. But it has in some ways also impacted our requirements for locomotives. Unit train movements in and of themselves require more locomotives for volume growth than just putting volume on the existing merchandise network. So we \u2013 listen, we tune our operating plan every year. We have a significant number as Mark mentioned of operating efficiencies and plans for even more. And we will continue to achieve even more. But as I think I said earlier, can every franchise \u2013 every railroad franchise is different and we do a lot of analysis on our franchise to ensure that we don\u2019t have too many locomotives but that we don\u2019t have too few.","Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch","Great. And Wick, if I can just revisit your answer to Tom\u2019s question on the M&A side, you talked about history of putting them together was difficult and the mergers didn\u2019t justify or might not have as many synergy opportunities and then the regulatory environment, what was your reaction though when you heard this news that you said no way, right away do you think, hey we have got to sit down with the Board and sit and look at opportunities because if CSX is taken off the board, do we need to think about how we lineup because yesterday obviously on Hunter\u2019s call you kind of went over why the regulatory issue might not be as big, but it\u2019s kind of finding a partner and gaining efficiency. So just trying to understand what was your and perhaps the Board\u2019s kind of view in terms if it does move forward, how do you think the industry changes or does it not and that\u2019s just a one-off?","Wick Moorman","Well, I think without going into specifics, listen we are always thinking and always have about the industry structure and ways that it might change and we review that with the Board every year. As we go forward, if there are changes in the structure and as I said earlier, people have different views of what the potential is, what the likelihood of a transaction being approved is, we will evaluate it with our Board and see if there are actions that we need to take and that\u2019s what we have always done. That\u2019s what we will always do. But I will say something I was \u2013 Jim Squires reminded me of and that is that we may not agree or may not agree with Hunter on everything, but there is something that Hunter and I agree on wholeheartedly as does everyone else in this business is that we don\u2019t really have to mergers to have a very bright future here at Norfolk Southern and as an industry.","Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch","Wonderful. Appreciate the time and insight. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein Investments. Please proceed with your question.","David Vernon - Bernstein Investments","Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question. Don, could you comment a little bit about how historically you have seen tighter truck capacity or looser truck capacity actually impact rates in the merchandise segment, obviously, excluding the coal and the intermodal business, just trying to think what percentage move in truck rates has turned into what type of base pricing kind of in your experience?","Don Seale","Well, certainly as the trucking market tightens, it has a positive halo effect on intermodal pricing opportunity, as well as the carload pricing opportunity. In our merchandised business, anything that moves in a box car from paper products to consumer products, to manufactured components, a lot of that business is directly competitive or driven by trucking capacity and that gives us an opportunity, so \u2013 and other components like automotive parts and vehicles, steel traffic, so there is a range of commodities that tighter truckload capacity. And when I say truckload capacity, I am talking about everything from dry van to flat beds, to covered bulk trucking that gives us an opportunity. And I would add not just trucking, when we look at the barge industry right now, it is essentially sold out and agricultural commodities and with the crop being as large as it is we expect barge to continue to face that type of capacity constraints. All of those are pointing to a market that\u2019s more favorable for improving yields in our book of business.","David Vernon - Bernstein Investments","But I guess, as you think about how to dimension that and how you have seen it kind of play out in the past, is there anything you can share as far as orders of magnitude in terms of how impactful the changes in the trucking market are?","Don Seale","I can\u2019t really put a number behind it or a past trend. I will just say that we see it as a positive opportunity in the marketplace.","David Vernon - Bernstein Investments","Okay. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up, you mentioned that the export rates had held in flat sort of sequentially, but it does look like the rate per ton is still down a little bit sequentially, is that just that mix in the underlying domestic because the overall length of haul doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s changing all that much. So I am just wondering is there any pressure on you guys to start thinking about pricing in that domestic market given the challenges and competition with lower price gas?","Don Seale","No, there are no pressure points that change from the second quarter to the third quarter. It\u2019s all relative to mix. We saw our Southern utility\u2019s long haul traffic start to moderate in terms of its year-over-year increase because of milder summer weather and lower natural gas prices. And also within the export market, we saw a relative larger decline in tonnage over our Lamberts Point pier versus our Baltimore tonnage which is shorter haul.","David Vernon - Bernstein Investments","Alright. Thanks for the time.","Don Seale","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research","Thank you very much and good evening everyone. Thank you for taking my question. Well, first of all, congratulations on a challenging quarter. I would like to ask about two items which I think are more temporary in terms of weighing on earnings. Marta, you hit the first regarding the cost of congestion, you talked about the $10 million and over time, you talked about the effect of locomotive maintenance. What you didn\u2019t discuss is maybe what the effect of this congestion at slower train speed might be having on insurance and claims. I know you did note the $15 million increase in personal injury reserve, what do you believe, Wick or Don, the impact of this congestion is having on your claims expense and do you believe this is more of a transitory thing and when fluidity gets better, we hopefully see that begin to come down? And how would you ballpark the impact of that financially?","Marta Stewart","Well, we don\u2019t believe that the service is having any impact on our claims expense. I think what I was talking about there was the year-over-year last year in the third and fourth quarters, we had favorable claims experience and so the comp this year. So, we have a comparative increase, but the cost themselves have not increased because of the service.","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research","But your personal injury rates up above the last couple of years level and it\u2019s up above the 9 months level, what would you attribute that to?","Marta Stewart","That isn\u2019t in a serious injury area that would be impacting expenses in any significant way, but I will have Mark elaborate.","Mark Manion","Yes. As far as our \u2013 the injury rates this year, we had some higher injuries, actually January, February, second quarter was improved and now third quarter is improved as well. And we have got a strong start on fourth quarter. So, that\u2019s actually going in the right direction.","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research","Alright. And then let me switch to Don, Don it seems like a lot of shorter term items are depressing the yield. I know you mentioned coal may stick around for a while, but others are more mix related, but your revenue per car was up almost a percent last quarter, is down almost a percent this quarter. What do you think the underlying rate of core price increases are relative to kind of what the reported rev per car we are seeing is? And when do you think we start to see a number that\u2019s a little closer to what your core pricing is actually doing?","Don Seale","We see our core pricing continuing to exceed rail inflation right now. We think it will continue to get better. The all-inclusive less fuel index, which is in a lot of our contracts in the third quarter only generated about 0.8% in terms of year-over-year increase, that is slated to increase in the fourth quarter up to about 1.8% and for 2015 is projected to be running about 2.5%, 2.6%. So, we will see the escalators in our base contracts and our re-pricing activity, which I have discussed relative to a much tighter transportation capacity market. Those two in combination you will continue to see improvement in our overall revenue per unit and also our core price.","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research","Okay, guys. Thanks a lot. I know it\u2019s been a long call.","Wick Moorman","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar. Please go ahead with your question.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","Yes, thanks. You can\u2019t knock the operating ratio, but long run are there strategic paths that would enable handling demand surges while maintaining high service or is this just inevitable nature of dealing with high demand? For example, changes to work rules or single man crews that might enable handling a little more adeptly?","Wick Moorman","I think that\u2019s a great question. One of the things that we certainly are doing right now as going back and looking through a lot of our processes and a lot of our practices to see \u2013 to take the lessons learned. And clearly, one thing that we are very \u2013 I think very thoughtful about is adding some more what I would describe as resiliency to our network. And that can come in the way, shape of a slightly different, not radically different way in terms of how we think about our crew base, particularly in critical areas. It can come in the form of making of having the somewhat bigger search fleet of locomotives. And it certainly comes in the form of doing something, which as many of you know we have systematically done. We just think about continuing to look at pinch points on the network. So, I think that we will take these learnings and we will make some changes that will give us that additional resiliency.","Certainly, work rules are something we are always focused on. There is another round of labor negotiations that kicks off here soon. And we will see if there are things that can be done there as well, but I think that we can do a lot in the shorter term to give ourselves the ability to handle situations a little better, but I will go back to what I said. I think we had a somewhat extraordinary set of circumstances this year with the very unusual weather followed immediately by significant surge in traffic beyond what we expected, but we will learn from that.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","Great. Thanks. And just as a quick follow-up on service issues, do you believe that highway conversions was constrained or slowed due to service issues or does trucking capacity offset most of these decisions?","Wick Moorman","I think the overall intermodal network we saw growth that we would have seen. I think equipment availability would have been a little higher in the third quarter, which could have generated on the margin higher volumes and higher revenue in intermodal and automotive. I will add automotive to that. I don\u2019t think it was material. Going forward, we don\u2019t see in the fourth quarter and into 2015, we do not see a lot of excess trucking capacity that can take any diverted traffic from rail, not that we expect that. So, as our service continues to improve that really shouldn\u2019t be a major concern going forward.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","Good. Thank you. High quality problem to have.","Wick Moorman","Yes, thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie","Good morning and thank you. Could you please comment a little more on same-store pricing trends in the quarter, perhaps put some detail into re-pricing for new business and how you see the balance of price and volume begin to shape for \u201815? Thank you.","Mark Manion","As we have indicated, we are seeing our core pricing coming in, in excess of rail inflation. We expect that to pick up as we continue to re-price into 2015. As I mentioned, we still have about 15% of our 2014 book to re-price at about 50% of our business next year in 2015 to re-price and our prices will reflect the tighter capacity in the transportation market as we complete that.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie","Thank you. And as my follow-up, we heard yesterday on the Canadian Pacific merger conference call, their view that the national network is about to hit some limits to capacity and efficiency, absent mergers which they see as the main solution. Would you agree that absent mergers, the national network is coming up with some significant challenges? And maybe as part of your response, if you could help us with some quantification of impact of your infrastructure projects into next year\u2019s results and into the longer term as much as you would like to comment? Thank you.","Wick Moorman","Well, I am not really of the opinion that we are in any imminent danger of hitting significant capacity problems across the industry that will impact our ability to grow for the longer term. I think if you just look at Norfolk Southern and the things that we are doing in terms of everything that Mark mentioned the Bellevue expansion, a lot of work in our Chicago, Philadelphia corridor and a lot of work in other places to streamline the network to add capacity in critical areas. I think that we have a very solid program as we have had for years and we will continue to have to strategically augment our capacity as we see volume growth. When we get into a period as I have said several times of unusual volume growth that was difficult for us to predict, we may get a little bit behind the curve as we have, but we are responding to that. We have a lot of work underway. And once that work is in place, we expect our velocities to go right back up as we have said. So, I think that \u2013 and I think every rail carrier looks at it that way. So, I think we have the ability to continue to invest, continue to add infrastructure and continue to grow the business without the need for our merger.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie","Thank you. So, to clarify, you do not see any structural thresholds or limits to growth for the industry given the current makeup of the players?","Wick Moorman","No, I don\u2019t. I think that we can all respond as individual carriers and working together to handle what we think is, as I said before, a very bright future in terms of increased volume on the railroads.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I will turn the floor back to management for closing comments.","Wick Moorman - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Well, thank you very much everyone for your patience and for the very good questions. We appreciate them and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference.

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Katie Cook, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Cook. You may begin.","Katie Cook","Thank you, Devon and good morning. Before we begin today's call, I would like to mention a few items. The slides of the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the Investor section, along with our non-GAAP reconciliations. Additionally, transcripts and downloads of today's call will be posted on our website.","During this call, we may make certain forward-looking statements which are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from our actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important.","Now, it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires.","James Squires","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's fourth quarter 2016 earnings call. With me today are NS's Chief Marketing Officer, Alan Shaw; and our Chief Operating Officer, Mike Wheeler; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart.","Our results summarized on slide four, are a testament to the dedication of our employees. ","In 2016 their efforts were instrumental in the achievement of a record operating ratio for Norfolk Southern, as well as in meeting and exceeding our other financial and operational goals even in a tough economic climate.","We have stayed focused on our core mission of safety, service and productivity while also driving positive changes throughout our organization. The significant progress we achieved in 2016 will power Norfolk Southern's success in delivering shareholder value both in the near and the long-term.","For the fourth quarter, our discipline cost focus and successful initiatives to enhance efficiency, drove a 69.4 operating ratio, yielding a 510 basis point or 7% improvement compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Even if you exclude last year's restructuring costs, the operating ratio improved by 310 basis points.","Earnings per share for the quarter increased to $1.42, up 18% compared to the prior year period, as operating expenses came in 8% lower relative to a 1% decline in revenue. For the full year, we achieved a record 68.9 operating ratio, which was 370 basis points or 5% better than 2015. Earnings per share increased 10% to $5.62.","In recognition of these results as well as the confidence we have in our strategy, the Board approved a $0.02 per share, or 3% dividend increase effective with our first quarter 2017 dividend payment.","Slide five highlights the important components of our success in 2016. Our measure of network performance, the composite service metric increased to above 80 for the year versus 72 in 2015.","We achieve this improved performance while accomplishing strategic network and organizational changes, such as the line and yard rationalizations that Mike described on our last call, as well as divisional and regional consolidations, the reorganization of our Pocahontas Land Corporation subsidiary and proactive management of capital spending.","Asset utilization improved as we rationalized our locomotive fleet, improve the efficiency of our freight cars and increased utilization of other roadway assets. Simultaneously, we reduced our average employee count for the year by 7%, exceeding the 3% decline in carloads, and we also reduced overtime by 38%.","In total, these initiatives generated 250 million of productivity savings for the year. We continue to invest in the health of the railroad, adapting to the economic environment by judiciously investing $1.9 billion in capital, well below our initial $2.1 billion plan.","Over year-ago, we anticipated that Norfolk Southern would achieve a sub 70 operating ratio for 2016 and our team delivered, producing a record 68.9 OR. Likewise, we are committed to delivering on our longer-term targets and I'll update you on our strategic plan after Alan, Mike and Marta fill you in on the fourth quarter results. Alan?","Alan Shaw","Thank you, Jim. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. On slide seven, I\u2019ll begin with an overview of our fourth quarter. Revenue of $2.5 billion was down 1% versus fourth quarter 2015.","Due to strong intermodal growth our year-over-year grew for the first time this year in the fourth quarter. Both intermodal and coal revenue and volume increased sequentially over the third quarter.","The Triple Crown restructuring continue to impact year-over-year comparisons, though to a lesser extent in the fourth quarter, an increase in export coal tonnage, softens the decline in coal volume and revenue. The utility volumes were negatively impacted by continued high stockpile levels.","Merchandise revenue was affected by the ongoing decline of crude oil volume. Overall revenue per unit declined 3% in the fourth quarter as positive pricing was offset by mix associated with increased intermodal and decreased coal volume. Revenue per unit, excluding fuel, increased for both merchandise and intermodal, excluding Triple Crown.","Our merchandise revenue on slide eight declined 1% to $1.5 billion as a result of a 3% decline in volume. Metals and construction volume benefited from increased steel shipments. Agriculture shipments grew due to increase soybean export and corn volumes. Declines in our chemicals market were driven by lower crude oil volume.","Automotive volume was negatively impacted by the previously announced market share loss and flat year-over-year U.S. vehicle production in the fourth quarter. Paper and forest products volumes decline as a result of increased truck competition. Merchandise revenue per unit increased 2%, excluding fuel, reflecting some pricing games.","Intermodal revenue as shown on slide nine increased 4% versus last year to $583 million, with a 7% increase in volume. Excluding the impact of the Triple Crown restructuring, intermodal volume and revenue were both up 10%. Improved service and increase consumer spending resulted in a 10% increase in our domestic intermodal volume versus a soft fourth quarter 2015.","Market share gains, an increase import, and export shipments via East Coast ports drove an 8% increase in international volume. Despite rate pressure from the trucking industry, intermodal revenue per unit excluding Triple Crown and fuel increased 1% in the fourth quarter.","Coal revenues declined 7% to $403 million in the fourth quarter with an overall 4% volume decline versus last year. Coal, revenue and volume increase sequentially for the second quarter in a row, primarily driven by fourth quarter export gains.","We handle 16.9 million utility tons in the fourth quarter inline with our recent guidance of slightly below 17 million tons, but 10% below fourth quarter 2015 volumes, due to continued stockpile overhang from the mild 2015 to 2016 winter. We handled 4.7 million export tons in the fourth quarter, as demand for U.S. coals improved a mid tightening international supply and greatly increased seaborne pricing. ","Coal revenue per unit, excluding fuel, declined 2% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year with positive price improvement offset by negative mix related to reduced volume to our longer haul southern utilities and increased export volume via Baltimore. Revenue per unit was up sequentially versus the third quarter.","On slide 11, our full year 2016 revenue of $9.9 billion was 6% -- was down 6% versus the prior year with a 3% decline in volume and a 3% decrease in revenue per unit. Utility coal volume and revenue decreased sharply due to the impacts of mild winter weather in late 2015 and early 2016, and low natural gas prices which contributed to the buildup of stockpiles. These factors, coupled with global oversupply and weak seaborne coal prices in the export market led to an 18% decline in coal revenue.","Fuel surcharge losses of $241 million were driven by the depressed oil prices. Quarterly declines lessen sequentially throughout the year as we left higher oil prices in 2015. And we anticipate that the recent rise in oil and diesel prices will lead to increased fuel surcharge revenues in 2017.","The mid-November 2015 restructuring of our Triple Crown subsidiary also reduced revenue while improving our efficiency and productivity. Our 2016 pricing gains were offset by the negative mix impact of decreased coal volume and increased international intermodal volume producing a 1% decline in revenue per unit less fuel.","Overall, 2016 was challenging for many of the markets we served with freight energy prices, weaker than anticipated economic growth, elevated inventory levels and increased truck capacity, all impacting our top-line performance. Although we saw stabilization as the second-half progressed leading to volume growth in the fourth quarter.","Recent improvements in manufacturing and consumer spending, as well as overall expectations for a stronger 2017 economic environment provide upside potential for the year ahead. Within intermodal, a strong service product will continue to enable highway conversions and drive organic growth. We expect intermodal volumes and RPU to benefit from tightening capacity within the trucking market due to improved demand and increased regulation, particularly, later in the year. ","We expect weather related normalization within utility coal as well as the market share gain to generate between 17 million and 19 million tons of utility coal per quarter in 2017. Our guidance is contingent upon normal weather conditions and natural gas prices consistent with the current forward curve.","Export coal tonnage growth will be driven by tightening international coal supply and improved seaborne pricing, which should support incremental production. We expect to handle 3.5 million to 4.5 million export tons on a quarterly basis with a significant amount of volatility as evidenced by the benchmark price. Merchandise volume is predicted to be relatively flat in 2017.","Pipeline development will negatively impact crude oil, natural gas liquids shipments. Automotive volume will be affected by extended retooling efforts at several NS served assembly plants and an expected 3% decline in U.S. vehicle production in 2017. Improving construction activity will benefit lumber, steel, cement and other housing related commodities.","As in 2016, we will focus intensely on our pricing efforts. A solid pricing improvement seen over the past year will benefit our 2017 revenue. We are confident in our ability to leverage the value of our service product to attain pricing in excess of rail inflation.","We are well-positioned for growth and have the flexibility to align resources and service capabilities with demand. We are steadfast in our commitment to meet evolving customer expectations which supports long-term growth and shareholder value. ","I will now turn the presentation over to Mike for discussion of our operational performance.","Michael Wheeler","Thank you, Alan. And good morning to our listeners. Our charge for 2016 was to provide a high level service product and aggressively pursue cost-cutting initiatives to drive productivity and efficiency. ","We accomplish this is evidenced by 2016 being the first year on record that we had both a service composite above 80 and an operating ratio below 70. And we believe we are well-positioned to leverage this momentum in 2017.","As shown on slide 14, there were significant milestones achieved in 2016 that were key drivers of our success. The efforts towards driving fuel efficiency, train length and locomotive productivity all helped to drive a record operating ratio. We accomplished this, thanks to the hard work of our employees in executing our strategic plan.","Moving to Safety on slide 15, while our entry ratio slightly increased in 2016, as compared to last year, our train accident rate improved 19% and as previously noted 2016 was our best year since the Conrail consolidation, even more encouraging, this improvement was across the board in transportation, engineering and mechanical.","Turning to Service on slide 16. You see, we continued to execute at a very high level as evidenced by our service composite, train speed and terminal dwell while dwell was higher in the fourth quarter as compared to the same period last year.","This was a result of an extended holiday shutdown due to the majority of our customers observing December 26 as a holiday. This allowed us to control costs without affecting customer service, which was a charge we successfully executed on for the entire year.","Now on slide 17, our productivity initiatives coupled with our ability to keep the railroad operating at a high level continued to result in significant productivity savings. For the fourth quarter, as compared to the same period last year, we achieved a reduction in crew starts even with an increase in volume, which was driven in part by leveraging the capacity on our current trains.","We also continued to improve on our overtime and train length although recruits were affected by an earlier start to winter weather. Together this resulted in continued improvement in employee productivity.","For the full year 2016, we achieved our highest average train length on record which also aided a record fuel efficiency. Even with this continuous improvement in train length, our velocity has been roughly as high as our record levels of 2012 and 2013.","In all, we had a very successful year and we are confident in our ability to continue this momentum in 2017.","I now will turn it over to Marta to cover the financials.","Marta Stewart","Thank you, Mike and good morning everyone. The fourth quarter results demonstrated our continued efforts on cost control and execution of strategic initiatives. Let\u2019s take a look at the financial details, starting with operating results on slide 19.","While revenues were down slightly, operating expenses declined by $147 million or 8%, resulting in a 69.4 operating ratio for the quarter, a 510-basis-point-improvement over last year's fourth quarter.","As you\u2019ll recall, the 2015 quarter included $49 million of restructuring costs, which added 200 basis points to OI. Slide 20 shows the expense reductions by income statement line-item, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year reductions in overall operating expenses.","Now let\u2019s take a closer look at the components. Slide 21 depicts Purchase, Services and Rents which was down $41 million, or 9% year-over-year. The largest reduction was attributable to $21 million in the lower Triple Crown costs associated with the curtailment of those operations in the fourth quarter of 2015.","Next were $12 million of lower Transportation and Engineering related purchase service cost. Finally, Equipment rents decreased by $3 million, notwithstanding the 2% increase in traffic volume.","Slide 22 highlights the major drivers of the variance in compensation and benefits, which overall declined by $40 million or 6%. Reduced employment levels down over 2300 employees versus 2015, along with lower overtime resulted in $42 million of year-over-year savings.","In addition, we lapped the lump sum payment of $13 million and $10 million of lower pension expense. These items were partially offset by increases in public accruals of $21 million, wage inflation $16 million and Health and Welfare rate increases of $12 million.","The bonus variance was due to the fact that we had reversals of accruals in last year's fourth quarter. The wage and health and welfare inflationary increases were similar to the run rates experienced in the third quarter.","As we look to 2017, we expect that total headcount will remain steady despite the anticipated increases in volumes that Alan described. However, higher health and welfare rates, particularly in our unionized programs, will result in approximately $65 million of additional expense and as a result, we expect all-in wage and medical cost inflation of about 5% versus the 3.5% we guided to and experienced in 2016.","Slide 23 details our materials and other category, which decreased $38 million or 15%. Lower usage of locomotive and engineering materials totaled $16 million and travel costs were down by $6 million.","Next is fuel expense as shown on slide 24. Mike described how we improved fuel efficiency and you can see that consumption declined by 6% despite the 2% increase in traffic volume. The improvement in efficiency completely offset the 8% increase in diesel fuel price versus the fourth quarter of 2015.","Moving onto income taxes on slide 25, the effective rate for the quarter was 35.1% versus 31.1% in the fourth quarter of 2015. The effective rate was slightly below the forecasted 36% due to the effects of stock-based compensation. For 2017, we expect an effective income tax rate of approximately 37%.","Summarizing our fourth quarter earnings on slide 26. Net income was $416 million, up 15% versus 2015 and diluted earnings per share were $1.42, up 18%. Restructuring costs affected 2015's net income by $31 million and EPS by $0.10.","Full-year results are shown on slide 27. While revenues were 6% lower than 2015, our focus on cost control and improving asset utilization allowed us to lower expenses by 11%.","The resulting income from railway operations of $3.1 billion was a 7% improvement, and as Jim noted, led to a record full year operating ratio of 68.9. Earnings per share were $5.62, an increase of 10% over the prior year.","Slide 28 depicts our full-year cash flows. Cash from operations totaled $3 billion, amply covering capital spending and generating $1.1 billion in free cash flow. Returns to shareholders in 2016 totaled $1.5 billion through $700 million of dividends and $800 million in share repurchases.","As Jim noted, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend to $0.61 a share, a 3% increase. On stock repurchases, we plan currently to continue at about a $200 million per-quarter run rate in 2017.","Moving on to this year's capital budget on slide 29, we project total spending of $1.9 billion, roughly even with 2016. This budget is supportive of the growth areas Alan described while continuing to invest in our core assets. We have expansions planned at various terminals and infrastructure targeted at increasing capacity on our network to provide high service levels to support long-term growth.","As you can see from the chart on the slide, the majority of our spending is on roadway and while at a dollar amount similar to the past few years, those dollars are stretching further in terms of units due to efficiency in our engineering forces. Locomotive capital includes new units, as well as the conversion of locomotives from DC to AC power.","Thanks for your attention and I'll turn the program back to Jim.","James Squires","Now, as promised, an update on our five-year strategic plan, which I conveyed in detail on last January's earnings call. You will recognize slide 31, which is the summary page of financial targets that I shared with you at that time. The employees of Norfolk Southern more than delivered on the 2016 targets.","Additionally, we are on track to reach our 2020 targets, including pricing above rail inflation, a sub-65% operating ratio and double-digit compound annual growth in earnings per share.","2016 demonstrated our flexibility as we adapted our approach to capital spending to the evolving business environment. The same proactive approach will allow us to manage our capital spending to 17% of revenue, post the 2018 positive train control installation.","Throughout, we will return significant capital to our shareholders by targeting a 33% dividend payout ratio, and will continue to imply share repurchases as a significant component of our capital allocation strategy.","Our management's adaptability illustrated by our capital program applies to all aspects of the railroad. Volumes for NS and the industry did not develop for 2016 as expected, particularly in the energy markets.","As a result, we were swift in taking actions to streamline operations and enhance service, bolstering our productivity and supporting growth in certain opportune markets. With this nimbleness and strong momentum, we are well-positioned to guide Norfolk Southern into the future. So with that in mind, I'll update you on key aspects of our long-range plan.","Slide 33 highlights our expectations for each of our major revenue groups. Overall merchandise is anticipated to track the economy generally in line with GDP. The forecast for intermodal growth is about 4% on a compound annual basis as our strong service product positions us for growth.","Coal is projected to increase in 2017 from our 2016 base as inventories and weather normalize, coupled with higher natural gas prices. It is then expected to decrease slightly from 2017 levels resulting in a modest 1% increase on a compound annual basis over the combined period.","Slide 34 highlights some of the strategies that we have in place to support key resource flexibility as volumes develop. We will continue to proactively manage our workforce to right size our resources as demand evolves.","We have established minimum employee levels at certain core locations where it has been more difficult to recruit new hires in the past. In addition, we have an active hiring model that we are continuing to enhance.","On the locomotive side, we continue to invest in the reliability of our fleet. We will take receipt of 50 new locomotives beginning in late February with the majority of them coming online in March and April. In addition, our DC-AC rebuild program significantly accelerates in 2017.","Now, moving on to slide 35 and expenses, we will build on 2016's productivity initiatives by for example, rationalizing our locomotive fleet by increasing our reliance on AC units. By increasing utilization and efficiency of our freight cars through a more homogeneous and flexible fleet composition and utilizing technology to optimize distribution of MTs, by continuing our line rationalization initiatives and by improving fuel efficiency.","Last year we provided a framework for our overall $650 million five-year plan productivity target, as reflected on slide 36. With $250 million of productivity savings achieved in 2016 and $100 million targeted for 2017, I remain fully confident in our ability to deliver on our longer productivity objectives.","At the beginning of our journey, we designed an approach that would be dynamic and flexible and 2016 certainly put that to the test. Our achievement of $250 million in productivity in 2016, clearly demonstrated that we would take the measures necessary to achieve that goal, creating new pass to savings when needed.","We will apply that same flexibility over the next four years in order to align resources with demand, achieved 650 million in productivity savings, provide quality service and drive shareholder value.","Wrapping up on Slide 37, at Norfolk Southern we know that the key to our success is world-class service that brings value to our customers, thereby supporting profitable growth that leverages our improving cost structure, culminating in exceptional returns to our shareholders.","Thank you for your attention, and with that we will now open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi Investment Research. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Wetherbee","Hey, great. Thanks and good morning. Wanted to touch base a little bit on the operating ratio as you look out for 2017, so Jim you just kind of ran through some of the productivity opportunities that you see going forward and what you think that you can achieve in 2017.","I just want to get a sense of maybe how that translates to an OR. You made nice progress this year. Should we expect similar type of stair-step progress in 2017 or any color would be helpful?","Michael Wheeler","Good morning, Chris and thank you for your question. Before I answer it, I want to again emphasize how much we appreciate the contributions of our employees in 2016 to our outstanding performance. We are the efforts of our employees and we certainly recognize that.","Now in 2016 we generated a record operating ratio. This morning, we outlined and reaffirmed our plan to achieve a sub-65 operating ratio by 2020. We expect to make progress toward that goal each year between now and then. And we expect to produce an operating ratio in 2017 below 2016s operating ratio. ","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. So improvement, but necessarily ready to quantify at this point?","Michael Wheeler","Correct.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. And if I could just ask a follow-up. Just when I think about, sort of, the competitive environment in the Eastern half of the United States, we've heard over the course of last couple of weeks, a couple of sort of contracts moving back and forth and I think there is some regular jockeying of market share within you know, between railroads and also you know with the trucks.","But wonder you get a sense or maybe how you view the competitive dynamic entering 2017? We haven't had a lot of volume growth. But volume is coming back. You see this changing or is this sort of normal or is it a little bit more hiked?","Michael Wheeler","Certainly, we operate in a competitive environment so we face modal competition across the spectrum of our volumes. Let me turn it over to Alan for some more specific commentary on the environment today","Alan Shaw","Yeah, Chris I would suggest that the in kind of the share shifted you\u2019ve seen recently are not unusual. Ultimately, our firm goal is to provide a service product that allows us to compete for business and one that our customer\u2019s value which will allow us to continue our efforts to move business from the highway to rail. As we saw markets stabilize in the second half of the year, we saw growth in the fourth quarter. And we expect that to continue in the 2017.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Malhotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Amit Malhotra","Yeah. Thanks so much. Just had quick question on some of the strategic discussions brewing in the Eastern rails over the last couple of weeks. I know you guys can\u2019t comment, you know, probably directly.","But if you look at what occurred at Canadian Pacific under the previous managed team, there are number of significant inefficiencies taken out of the system. Things like, you know, the number of crew changes on certain routes, reductions in the number of pump yards and terminals.","Just trying to understand you how much of an opportunity that is for Norfolk today, bearing in mind that you have already achieved so much in terms of productivity and whether there is maybe some scope to accelerate any of that to realize your OR targets even sooner? Thanks.","James Squires","Good morning. We don\u2019t comment on market rumors. We are single-mindedly focused on driving shareholder value through successful execution of our strategic plan, which as you know does include significant additional productivity improvements.","We view \u2013 having achieved 250 million in productivity in 2016, we've set a goal of 100 million in productivity for 2017. We believe that number is achievable, realistic and sustainable and will allow us to continue providing an excellent level of customer service. If we discover additional productivity opportunities we will certainly go after them.","Amit Malhotra","Okay. Well, I thought I tried to ask that question anyways, I appreciate the answer. Let me ask you one maybe, you can answer a little bit more directly as related to your comments about being more dynamic and flexible like.","I maybe wrong, but I feel like you're really talking about maybe making the cost structure a little bit more dynamic and flexible, so you can flex down and flex up as volumes change. First of all, is that correct?","And second of all, I guess with that imply that essentially your cost structure is in fact becoming more variable, which may impact you know perspective incremental margins and where do you think those incremental margins could go under this maybe new dynamic and flexible cost structure? Thank you.","James Squires","We certainly demonstrated our flexibility and adaptability in changing business conditions in 2016 by producing record results despite some headwinds from the economy. And we will continue to adhere to that very flexible and adaptable approach going forward, particularly in our use of our resources.","Let me turn it over to Mike to talk about some of the resource strategies we have in place for 2017 and then maybe Marta can comment on the incremental margin question.","Michael Wheeler","Sure, Jim. Well, we stay in close contact with marketing and they let us know what's going on out the marketplace and on our volumes. And we are quick to adapt to whether business is going up to make sure we handle that or we\u2019re seeing areas that are that are not coming online like we thought. We're going to take the cost out. We\u2019re very flexible on that.","On the resource side, two big drivers are locomotives. We continue to look at rationalizing our locomotive fleet. We\u2019ve got a lot of good plans in place. We still have some search units out there. So we\u2019re comfortable that we can handle any upside as well. But we continue to look at what we can take out and reduce costs on the locomotive fleet.","On the resource side of manpower, we have committed to making sure we protect the train crews to ensure that that we have the service product we need and again going back to our conversations with marketing, we're very flexible on what\u2019s happening with what they are telling us. On the rest of the railroad, we continue to look at every opportunity where we can take cost out but still protect safety and service.","James Squires","Marta, would you address the question about incremental margin?","Marta Stewart","Yes. Alan described how we expect some growth in 2017. We do expect to have very good incremental margins on all of that business. As you may know, our incremental margins depend on where, which segment of our business they come in. All of them, as I said, had good margin.","The hierarchy, though, as we had the highest incremental margins on merchandise because those travel largely on existing trends and don't have too many incremental variable cost. Next is coal and then intermodal as it has the highest proportion variable cost.","Amit Malhotra","But this is it safe to say that on a blended basis at least incremental margin should at least be $0.50 of every incremental revenue dollars you drop to the bottom line. Is that a good number on the blended basis?","Marta Stewart","We haven\u2019t guided to a specific number, but we do expect very good incremental margins on all of our business.","Amit Malhotra","Okay. Great, thanks for taking my question congrats on a good quarter.","Marta Stewart","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Danny Schuster","Hi good morning. This is Danny Schuster on for Allison. Thank you for taking our questions this morning. So we wanted to dig in a little bit to coal. You know you're now guiding to kind of a Cold growth CAGR of 1% over the next few years with a step up this year and a deceleration thereafter.","So we just wanted to get a sense. Are you \u2013 does this kind of imply that you are expecting something like a 4% or 5% step up this year and kind of benefit a decelerate - a decline from there. And then from there we\u2019d love to dig in a little bit to see if we can get a little bit more color on what the split across your different coal businesses are? Thank you.","James Squires","Sure. Alan provided some specific guidance with respect to our coal volumes as projected in 2017. Alan, why don\u2019t you go back over that and then provide a little bit of additional commentary.","Alan Shaw","Danny. We talked about utility coal volumes 17 to 19 million tons per quarter for the year dependent upon normalized weather patterns and natural gas prices following the forward curve.","And note that today natural gas prices are about a dollar per million BTU above where they were this time last year. And as you're aware, and from February to May of last year, natural gas was below $2 a million BTU. So that in and of itself will provide more support for our coal-fired utility customers and would provide year-over-year growth in our coal markets.","We've also talked about export coal volumes between 3.5 million to 4.5 million tons quarterly resulting from improved seaborne pricing and demand for US coals. There's a lot of volatility in that.","As you have seen, the benchmark pricing for hard coke and coal shift from $92.50 a metric ton in the third quarter up to $285 a metric ton in the first quarter and then the latest spot price was about $185 a metric ton. So that is going to be one that we are watching closely and we'll be sure to update our outlook for that on our next call.","Danny Schuster","Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And then within utility coal, how should we think about the mix between your Southern utility customer base and Northern utility customer base and is there a length-of-haul mix we should be thinking about associated with the growth within that line this year? Thank you.","Alan Shaw","In the fourth quarter, we saw a somewhat slight mix shift from our Southern utility base to our Northern utility base. We expect that to continue in 2017 as a result of stockpiles generally being lower in the North right now than they are in the South.","Danny Schuster","Okay. So would that infer kind of a negative RPU mix just from that phenomenon?","Alan Shaw","Danny, generally, our Southern utility shipments have a longer life of haul.","Danny Schuster","Great, great. That's very helpful. Well, thank you very much for my questions. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Ravi Shanker","Good morning. So you've said that you are expecting RPU of about 2.5% through 2020 versus CPI of 2.2%. That's closed a little bit from your prior guidance. And also just wanted to check if that is going to be a similar gap for 2017 just given some of Marta's comments on labor seemed like inflation could be a little higher for 2017.","James Squires","Let's talk about the rejected RPU trend in the five year plan going forward first. Alan, would you take that one?","Alan Shaw","Yes, absolutely. We are going to continue to price above rail inflation. We are committed to doing that. We are confident in our ability to leverage the value of our service product, so you will continue to hear us talk about that. We had a lot of negative mix shifts in 2016 as we talked about the declines in utility coal and the declines in crude oil and the declines in natural gas liquids and frac sand.","So we have started to see stabilization on that front; it's one of the reasons our volumes grew in the fourth quarter and we expect that stabilization and some improvement in truck and energy markets to manifest itself into growth in RPU in 2017.","Ravi Shanker","Got it. And as a follow-up, I apologize if I missed this, but did you give us your natural gas price assumptions for 2017 and through 2020? I just wanted to see where that is and how much that will help move the needle on coal for you.","Alan Shaw","Yes, we talked about paying very close attention to the forward curve; that's what we are looking at now. Right now, that's about $1.20 above gas prices that we experienced in the first and second quarters of last year. ","Ravi Shanker","Got it. Is there a breakeven level that you would like to see before your coal volumes start to really move? ","Alan Shaw","Well, we saw coal dispatch mix improve relative to natural gas in the fourth quarter, particularly in December as natural gas prices got up into $3.50. We started to see support for some of our more efficient plants at $3 natural gas and maybe even a little bit lower.","It's dependent upon sourcing patterns. It depends on weather patterns. The higher the better, obviously, but we are already seeing support for our coal franchise at $3.20 natural gas.","Ravi Shanker","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with the Susquehanna Financial Group. Please proceed with your question.","Bascome Majors","Yeah. Good morning. Can you update us on how much of your book of business is now including fuel surcharge mechanisms that are still below that recovery threshold and remind us how far those are from being in the money where you start to get rising revenues as fuel prices rise?","James Squires","Bascome, we are now at about 40% of our fuel surcharge revenue is tied to WTI. That is generally out of the money. The rest of it is generally tied to on-highway diesel or is in a tariff that doesn't have a fuel surcharge program and on-highway diesel has a strike price that is on average close to where we are now.","Bascome Majors","Okay. So maybe one time this to Marta, you know, how much of a bottom line or margin drag from diesel you begin in 2017 outlook as we see higher fuel prices on this portion of your business, but you aren\u2019t seeing your revenue offset?","Marta Stewart","Well, as you saw in our 2016 results, we had of course several going the other way, but in our 2016 result, you saw both in the fourth quarter and in the year that our few revenues were down. For the full year you could see that the reduction in fuel \u2013 the fuel expense line about equal the reduction of fuel surcharge revenue.","So looking forward to 2017, as Alan has already mentioning and you noted, the fuel curve is up and indeed through January, we are \u2013 oil prices are quite a bit higher than they were in the first quarter of last year.","So as long as we stay below $64 a barrel and be the curve even though now its projecting to be up, it\u2019s not expected to go currently above that. So we will expect to see increase, less of an increase in our fuel surcharge revenue than we have in fuel expense.","However, I would note that we do not expected to have a significant effect on our operating income where you will see it have more effect will be on the operating ratio simply because of the math because the numerator and the denominator will be moving by similar numbers.","James Squires","I\u2019ll add that generally higher energy prices are going to lift many of the markets we serve and expand the value proposition of rail relative to trucks. So it\u2019s not just the fuel surcharge discussion, it will drive volume growth and pricing ability for us.","Bascome Majors","I appreciate the comments you may answer. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Hoexter","Hey, great. Good morning, and congrats on a record OR and good to see that the progress continue, but I want to focus on that Jim if we can because, want to get your thoughts on the 100 million in savings and perhaps define what's in there and understand, kind of where you're focused on this year and see the ramp?","Last year you raise that target up to 250; see what the possibility of to improve on that? And is it as simple as taking that 100 million and saying that's 60 basis points of improvement, so you're really targeting something like a 68 OR this year or would you suggest there's more to it?","James Squires","So as I went through Ken, we produce 250 million in productivity savings in 2016 and a record operating ratio for the full year. Of that 250 was above our original projection of our productivity savings in 2016.","In 2017, we\u2019re targeting a $100 million in additional productivity savings. That number we view as realistic, achievable, and sustainable even while we run our network at a high service level.","Again, if we see additional opportunities for productivity savings, just as we did in 2016, we will go after them, and we could see them in all of the areas in which we achieve productivity savings in 2016.","Ken Hoexter","I got that but that wasn\u2019t \u2013 I understand that\u2019s what you said before. I just want to try and understand what\u2019s in there. Last year, you talked about the coal network shutting down some yards integrating divisions.","Can you talk to us about what's in the target so we can understand where upside leverage can come from like you saw last year?","James Squires","Sure. We\u2019re going to continue to push on all of those areas in which we achieved productivity savings in 2016. Mike, why don\u2019t you comment?","Mike Wheeler","Yeah. It\u2019s across the board like Jim notes. First of all, it\u2019s in our fleet rationalization, both the locomotives that we talked about continuing to make sure we are getting the most out of those assets and looking at ways to take locomotives out of the fleet even though we\u2019re handling greater volumes.","On the freight car fleet, while we are bringing some new freight cars online, overall net, we\u2019re planning on reducing the size of the fleet. That's a fleet rationalization still being able to protect our customer service. Continue to look at ways to take costs out of the branch lines without hurting service. Fuel efficiency, we\u2019ve got a big push on fuel efficiency, both from technology and the locomotive productivity that we talked about.","And the last thing is we continue to look at optimizing our training plan, whether it's to improve customer service or to get productivity in the network. We do that every day and all of those things are baked into that $100 million.","Ken Hoexter","Wonderful and just a cleanup to Alan, you mentioned on coal inventory, it came off a bit. Can you talked about where they are now?","Alan Shaw","Yeah, coal inventories are still elevated above target. They are at about 86 days at this point. I would say target is probably closer to 60 days. Importantly, they come down about 20 days since their high of last year.","The South is about at 82 days, North is about 90 days. The South has declined a little bit more as of recent. And importantly PJM power pricing is up about 15% or was up about 15% in December which has really supported coal burn and coal deliveries in that area.","Ken Hoexter","Okay. Appreciate the time. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Ossenbeck","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So Alan just going back to the mix impact for second, obviously it was negative for the year, if you just look at RPU less fuel when you talked about \u2013 also some of the reasons why the mix within export coal length of haul.","Just want to circle back to confirm why - might be positive or least improving into next year for the intermodal being one of the \u2013 the only three big segments to really grow. It sounds like you still have some more export coal to go? And maybe you can factor in how you see auto into that as well. I think you mentioned there was kind of track production which was we thought was a 3% decline or so?","Alan Shaw","Yeah, we do believe our automotive franchise will declines with the with U.S. automotive production declining 3% and then there are some specific plans that we serve that are taking some retooling.","Importantly, we are continuing to get price. We are pricing above real inflation that would benefit 2017. We're going to see growth in our coal network, which as you are aware put pressure on our RPU in 2016. And we're going to continue to price in our intermodal network reflecting the value of our service product. So we see growth in RPU.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay. Got it. So it sounds like some of the buckets are changing it mostly from -- from price. I guess the other factor just to follow-up on overall volume in for next to the outlook.","How do you see FX playing into the strength of the dollar and some of you markets it has some pretty good numbers in MetCon. The dollars off a bit, but I was wondering how much you think that needs to move and you sustainably moving before you\u2019d see some relief in some of those areas has been pressured for the last couple -- couple of years?","Alan Shaw","Well, our imports were out more than our exports and 2016 resulted in part from the foreign-exchange issues. You talked about our metals and construction. Our steel customers are feeling pretty positive, right now. And they're looking for growth. Steel prices are up year-over-year, capacity factors are up year-over-year.","Our exports we think are going to be supported, at least in the near-term by export coal volumes. So we're going to closely watch the dollar. It impacts trade and we\u2019re heavily tied to trade. There are some things going on that are going to support international volumes for us, at least in the near term.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay. Thanks for taking my call.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of time of Thomas Wadewitz with UBS Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Wadewitz","Yeah. Good morning. I wanted to ask you to Alan a little bit about price. I think you had some commentary on pricing. But what would you see the progression has been if you look at 2016 and say that you know, did you see much change in pricing through the year. I think some market share wins in the intermodal and coal, you know, beg the question of whether you are being a little more aggressive on certain pieces of business?","So you know, if you want to comment on that, but also just kind of the market dynamic overall, will you start change in pricing and what you think on '17, whether you just need to see truck market siding a bit that will be key driver or just how you look on the pricing overall and then, in particular related to some of the wins you had on intermodal and coal? Thanks.","James Squires","We are committed to price and above rail inflation. I\u2019m completely confident in the ability of our team to continue to deliver a strong service product and the ability of our team to price to the value of that service product. But there is anywhere we\u2019re aggressive in 2016 it was on our service product.","Our pricing throughout the year was consistently above rail inflation. We saw our trucking markets start to tighten in the fourth quarter, some of our other markets stabilize in energy prices moved up, which allowed us to grow in the fourth quarter. And we expect that momentum to continue into 2017.","Alan Shaw","Tom, I too would like to emphasize our commitment to pricing above rail inflation, based on an excellent service product.","Thomas Wadewitz","Okay. Yeah, great. What about this thought in terms of just 2017, 2018 kind of I guessed the pass on pricing, is it reasonable to say that this is just at the end of the day, you\u2019re primarily going to be driven by capacity and demand in the market?","So if we really see that you know truck spot market tightening and pricing rising, that that will help you accelerate pricing and if you do see some better volume overall on rail through '17, that is it reasonable defeated pricing accelerate along with that?","James Squires","The key to higher prices in our view is excellent service. And we operate in a competitive marketplace, we believe we provide an outstanding service and our goal is to obtain above rail inflation pricing going forward.","Thomas Wadewitz","All right. Okay Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Group","Hey, Thanks, morning everyone.","James Squires","Morning.","Scott Group","So I know you don't have earnings guidance for this year but you\u2019ve got multiyear guidance of double-digit earnings growth. If coal is going to be up high-single low-double-digits this year and then down in the subsequent years. Is there a reason why we shouldn't have double-digit earnings growth this year? Is there something that we need to consider?","And then just along those lines, Marta, you gave us last year just very helpful kind of margin commentary on the coming quarter, any thoughts on first quarter operating ratio just given the tough comp versus year ago.","James Squires","Let me go back over Scott first our overall outlook. We outlined and reaffirmed our plan to get to a sub-65 operating ratio by 2020. And we expect to make progress each year toward that goal. And therefore we expect to post an operating ratio in 2017 that is below 2016\u2019s full year operating ratio, and we do not give quarterly guidance.","Scott Group","But is there anything that you would want us to consider in our models if this is a normal year of productivity and it's the one year we expect coal volume growth and you have a multi-year double-digit earnings growth expectation.","It would seem that this should be year-over-year at least double-digit maybe even above trend. Is there something you want us to contemplate and why it might not be that way?","James Squires","Certainly coal volume above the range that we have projected would provide additional upside to our plan.","Scott Group","Okay. And then Alan just on the coal yields, so CSX reported a pretty meaningful sequential increase in coal yields in the fourth quarter and you guys have just a small increase.","Can you just walk us through how your export coal pricing works? Is there a reason why you're not going to see that bump or is it more that the way you guys price will see that bump more or so in the first quarter than what we saw in the fourth quarter?","Alan Shaw","Yes, Scott we talked on the third quarter call about how we felt like our growth in export volumes in the fourth quarter would come at the lower length of our Baltimore business as opposed to Lambert's Point and in fact, you know, that's exactly what happened.","Our growth in the fourth quarter in export volumes was associated with Baltimore, not Lambert's Point. And so as a result, we had a negative mix with our export coal RPUs. We looked at our pricing on export in the fourth quarter as we said we would.","We told you we would do it in the first quarter, which we did and then we are closely monitoring the benchmark price and the demand going forward.","Scott Group","Maybe a better way to ask it, do you think you'll see coal revenue per car sequentially higher or lower in the first quarter than the fourth?","Alan Shaw","I think ultimately that's going to depend upon mix. I talked a little bit about how our volumes in the North would probably increase at a higher rate than our volumes in the South, which will put pressure on our coal RPU, but offsetting that is going to be some strong pricing in our export volumes.","Scott Group","Okay. All right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays Capital. Please proceed with your questions.","Brandon Oglenski","Good morning, everyone and thanks for getting me in. So Jim, I just want to come back to the structural opportunity on the cost structure because you guys have been running consistently with let's call it a 27%, 28% OR on labor costs.","A lot of the rest of the industry is now closer to 20% on a labor OR. And when I look at your results for the past decade, you have run with headcount between 28,000 and 30,000 folks and your productivity, and sorry I am getting nerdy here, but I do like to quantify this stuff -- I think your productivity is about 13 million GTMs per head per year right now. CSX, which is a similar size network, arguably maybe little a bit bigger, running 15 million GTMs per head.","Can you talk about -- is there something structural on the network where you can let attrition take headcount down and grow volume and grow productivity on the labor line because, as we look at it and I think as a lot of investors look at it, that's a big opportunity for you guys going forward? ","James Squires","We certainly made progress on labor productivity in 2016. That was a key driver of our $250 million in productivity savings. In 2017, as we have been through, we are targeting an additional $100 million in productivity savings, a number that we view as sustainable and a component of that will be additional labor savings.","We have guided to basically flat headcount for the full-year 2017. We think that's a level of human resources that will allow us to continue driving productivity and serve as a foundation for growth as well.","Brandon Oglenski","But is there anything in the network, Jim, that you look at that you think going forward, hey, we need to restructure the way we are looking at the world because we used to be more coal-focused and commodity-focused and now we want to be a little bit more nimble around intermodal?","Is there something in the terminal infrastructure where you could see attrition rates, not necessarily layoffs or reductions, but really reducing the size of the employee base going forward relative to revenue?","James Squires","In 2016, we demonstrated our nimbleness and our agility in responding to business conditions with respect to the labor resource, as well as otherwise and we have additional opportunities going forward as well. Labor productivity, specifically, is the largest component of our overall $650 million by 2020 and we will continue to work on that.","Brandon Oglenski","Okay. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Long","Thanks. Good morning and I wanted to ask about intermodal. First, could you give us some sense for the level of intermodal volume growth you are expecting in 2017 and, second, I know you guided for consolidated pricing above inflation, but do you think above inflation pricing is achievable within intermodal this year?","James Squires","As we've been through our goal and our plan is to produce above rail inflation pricing for the duration of the plan period based on excellent customer service. Now let me ask Alan to comment specifically on the dynamics within the intermodal sector.","Alan Shaw","Sure. Hey, Justin, truck capacity, while it has tightened, is still relatively loose, particular compared to where we were in 2014. So we think that as truck capacity tightens, particularly towards the second half of the year, then we are going to start to see more and more intermodal growth.","So Jim had talked about 4% CAGR on intermodal growth over our next four years and we think that's within the ballpark of where we will be in 2017 and that's going to support that tightening truck market and reduced inventory levels will support more pricing in 2017.","Justin Long","Okay. That's helpful. But just to clarify, you do feel like intermodal pricing can be above rail inflation this year?","James Squires","For the planned period going forward, we will certainly strive for above rail inflation pricing based on our excellent service.","Justin Long","Okay. Secondly, sticking on intermodal, I wanted to ask about the progression of intermodal margins over the course of the longer-term strategic plan. Does that longer term outlook assume that intermodal margins improve to the point where they are inline with consolidated averages at some point before 2020? And if so, what's a realistic timeframe to think about when this can occur?","James Squires","Marta, why don\u2019t you go back over the basic incremental margin characteristics of each of the businesses and then address the question with regards to intermodal?","Marta Stewart","All right. Justin, intermodal, although I mentioned earlier that it is third in a hierarchy of incremental margins. It is still very good incremental margins and to answer your specific question, we definitely expect improving intermodal margins throughout the four year plan period that Jim described.","Justin Long","Okay. But you're not willing to say if those intermodal margins will be on par with consolidated margins at some point over the plan?","Marta Stewart","We\u2019ve never split our incremental margin numbers between the three.","Justin Long","Okay. I'll leave it at that. I appreciate the time today.","Marta Stewart","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Seidl","Thank you, operator. Hey Jim, hey team. Real quickly looking out at your expected CAGR on the intermodal side, you said international growth above GDP. Is there anything built-in for continued share shifts of the west coast ports and some of the build out to some the eastern ports?","James Squires","Alan, why don\u2019t you take that one?","Alan Shaw","Sure Jason that has been a support for our volumes over the last couple of years. It\u2019s been a continuing trend. We look for it to continue moving forward. But we\u2019re looking at GDP plus growth within the international space. There won't be a big hockey-stick there. We\u2019re looking for sustainable organic growth.","Jason Seidl","Okay. So there's a little bit built in there, but probably not too much that we\u2019ve seen like see in the past couple of years?","A - Alan Shaw","Correct.","Jason Seidl","Okay. That\u2019s all I have. Guys, appreciate the time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Ben Hartford","Thanks. I guess I\u2019ll just build on that last point Alan on the intermodal side \u2013 international intermodal side specifically. You had mentioned, you had emphasized organic. So when we think about some of the rhetoric around trade exiting TPP et cetera.","Perhaps if you could expound upon the opportunity from share shift in the context of perhaps trade \u2013 rising trade protectionism over that for your period and to what degree do you think that might present risk to your ability to grow international intermodal above GDP over the next four years? Thanks.","James Squires","Yes, if there were something that impacted international trade that would certainly have an impact on our business levels, and note that the impact on the headwinds that we faced in 2016 around inventory levels seem to be normalizing.","Trucking markets seeing to be firmament and as a result we saw growth in the fourth quarter. So there's going to be puts and takes, but clearly we\u2019re watching anything that would impact international trade.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","David Vernon","Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a Marta if you could talk a little bit about what we should expect about the cadence for the inflation, other step-up in inflation for next year. I think you got this from the closer to a 5% than the 3.5% we saw in the current year.","Marta Stewart","Yes, and that\u2019s 5% David is specifically just to the comp and benefit line. ","David Vernon","Yes.","Marta Stewart","For the remaining items in our income statement those lines increase inflationary, but just general economic inflation, so at a lower rate than 5%.","David Vernon","Okay. And then as far as kind of the cadence of how that should be coming in it, is there anything we should be thinking about in terms of incentive comp or specific timing of payments or things like that.","Marta Stewart","Yes. For generally speaking that\u2019s a good point for you to bring up. Generally speaking the comp line is weighted somewhat to the first quarter of the year and that is because the incentive comps as you mentioned.","So if you look at the cadence last year of the comp that should be a general guideline. With regard to the health and welfare inflation, those new rates for the industry did start on January 1.","David Vernon","Okay, thanks. And then Mike maybe just a question for you. The fuel productivity got like to the all-time high in the winter quarter, like a 5% jump. I'm just wondering like what is it that\u2019s driving that?","Is it some sort of change in locomotive fleet, I know you\u2019ve dozen things around, line rationalization and you mentioned also something about maybe holiday timing kind of running that a little lighter.","Is this a new run rate from which we should be building our expectations until productivity, was there and is there - can you talk a little bit about what\u2019s driving the significant improvement in that particular metric in terms of the fuel consumption?","Michael Wheeler","Sure. So the biggest driver is the fact that we continue to reduce the locomotive fleet that is a big push there. In addition, we've got a lot technologies, a fuel management technology that we put out there and really leveraging that.","And then additionally, we really focused on fuel shutdown compliance, other rules that we put on the operations to make sure that we are getting the best fuel efficiency. All those pieces go into our record, fuel efficiency and we see more opportunity going forward this year as well. ","David Vernon","So it just sounds like its a little bit execution in some of the prior investment around the fuel technology. Is there is nothing structural in terms of the change in mix of the fleet range with that?","Michael Wheeler","No, I don\u2019t think. Well structurally yeah, the reduced fleet, we told you last year about how much of yard and local fleets - yard and local engines that we pulled out of the fleet and still was able to protect service that was a big driver of that. We're continuing to look at that.","So that's the structural pieces is reducing our yard and local fleet and then being able to handle increasing gross tone miles with kind of the current fleet gives you even more productivity. So that's the structural piece, in addition to all the technology and execution that we focus on.","David Vernon","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Thanks very much and good morning. So the dividend increase was a bit of surprise to me anyway. Can you talk a little bit about your comfort level for being above your long-term target payout ratio for period of time and whether you think there might be room for that payout target to increase?","James Squires","Let me begin by saying that shareholder distributions including dividends and regular dividend increases are a major component of our capital allocation strategy. And I'll turn it over to Marta to discuss your payout ratio question","Marta Stewart","Absolutely. We definitely believe as Jim said that the shareholder should benefit as the company's profitability improved and board did raised the dividend by about 3%. As you mentioned, we have a long-term payout target of 33%.","The board believes that we can provide modest dividend increases as we managed that payout ratio to that one-third target. As you recall, last year had a 46% target, so even with this increase, we are moderating the payout in total.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Okay, but 33 remains the long-term target?","Marta Stewart","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Cherilyn Radbourne","That\u2019s all for me. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Walter Spracklin","Yeah. Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. So I just wanted to focus a little bit, perhaps its for Marta on the comp and benefit line, I know, Jim you mentioned that there was a 100 million in a normal year you would have most of that productivity savings coming from the comp and benefit or the labor line.","With the 5% increase, all in that you're pointing to and yes on flat headcount, I'm just wondering if the 100 million this year is factoring in perhaps a much lower component of labor productivity than in the years over your forecast period, am I right in saying that for this year?","Marta Stewart","Generally speaking, the ratios of reductions are similar to the full plan. So, Jim showed in the 650 million, roughly 65% of that is comp and benefits and that percentage holds true for the 100 million. So we do expect the lion share of the $100 million of productivity improvement to come in the comp line.","And one of the things we mentioned, I think Mike and I both mentioned with the \u2013 are keeping the headcount level but managing extra volumes there some productivity there. In addition to just looking at the headcount, we also have productivity in that line and overtime and recruit and extra boards, so there's other specific areas other than just account that also lead to productivity in the comp line.","Walter Spracklin","So when we look at that line, we should offset the 5% increase with changes in other components of that line item being like you said overtime and so on so it's not necessarily the last year's labor times 5% higher average, average comp, we should also reflected in for overtime another aspects and do you have any sense of order of magnitude?","If that's the case what impact that would be on the comp and benefit line in 2017, everything excluding the 5% and the flat labor account that you'd already mentioned?","Marta Stewart","How you describe it is just the right way to look at. You\u2019re going to look at within those components. You talked \u2013 look at the compensation benefits that we had last year. We do have the inflationary growth, which is one component and then separate from that we have the productivity which will then occur the other way.","Walter Spracklin","But order of magnitude not\u2026","Marta Stewart","Order of magnitude is about the same percentage in the year as we guided to for the entire five-year period. It is the lion share of the $100 of productivity.","Walter Spracklin","Okay. Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in and I\u2019ll just ask one. Could you please elaborate on slide 33, the long-term outlook the expected pipeline related headwinds in crude oil and natural gas liquids pertaining to the merchandise segment? And then if you could, kind of, hone in on your chemical segment view for 17 any additional color. Thanks.","James Squires","Scott, that is directly related to the Dakota Access pipeline and Mariner East 2 pipeline. Dakota Access will impact blocking crude to the East Coast, although will still participate in some heavy Canadian crude. And the Mariner East will impact our NGO shipments out of Utica and Marshallese.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks very much.","James Squires","You are welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Jeff Kauffman with Aegis Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Kauffman","Thank you very much and congratulations. Most of my questions have been answered. Marta, can I focus a little bit on the pension component of the labor cost increase? You mentioned pension to become a tailwind versus a headwind.","I know there was a sharp up-tick in rates post-election. When was your pension expense re-leveled and what does that look like in terms of the tailwind for 2017?","Marta Stewart","So our pension expense, we think for 2017, to answer your last question first, we think it\u2019s going to about flat with 2016. And you are correct that the interest rate change would push that up a little bit. However, we also had asset gain in the plan. So net-net for 2017 we see pension expense staying relatively even.","Jeff Kauffman","Okay. And just a quick follow-up, if I run the utility coal and export coal numbers that you provided for 2017. It looks like we are going to be up double-digit in both of those areas.","Number one, am I thinking through that right in terms of 2017 volume? And number two can I assume that\u2019s going to be more heavily weighted in the first two quarters of the year?","James Squires","I am not seeing the double-digit growth in export coal when the guidance that we provided.","Jeff Kauffman","Okay. But the utility side?","James Squires","The utility side, you know what we\u2019ve given you the guidance that\u2019s our best look right now.","Jeff Kauffman","Okay. All right, well, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rick Paterson with Loop Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Rick Paterson","Thank you. Good morning. Could you please update us on the number of furloughed train crews and stored locomotives? And with regard to crews, when you recall furloughed employees, what percentage typically come back? I would imagine that percentage also erodes over time as we move further away from furloughed dates. How should we think about that?","James Squires","Yes. So on the furlough, we still have right around 100 employees furloughed on the T&E side and it's primarily in the coalfields, though if there is continued upswing in coal, we could handle that, but it's down to about 100. We started recalling them in the middle of last year across the network to handle the sequential volume increase and protect service, so we did that.","And on the recalls, you are right. When we first start out, we get up into the high 90% recall rate when we recall furloughs and the longer it goes, it starts declining after that. Although with some of the things we've put in place with our extra boards over the last year, overall, we got a higher return rate, which we are real pleased with. On the locomotive side, we still have about 350 locomotives stored available to us.","Rick Paterson","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your questions.","Brian Konigsberg","Thank you. Appreciate you fitting me in. It's been a long call; a lot of questions have been answered. I have a couple small ones. Marta, actually you mentioned in response to the pension question asset gains. Is that asset gains within the pension plan, or are you expecting to have asset sales in '17 elsewhere within the network itself?","Marta Stewart","That was within the pension plan that I was describing.","Brian Konigsberg","Okay. With the productivity initiatives going on, you did have an asset sale in '16. Would you anticipate some assets to break loose as you work through rationalization of the network?","Marta Stewart","Our real estate department is always taking a look at where we have assets that we can sell. We especially described in the third quarter where we had a large operating asset sale.","In 2017, they will continue to look at it. As you know, looking over the last 3 years, that number can be somewhat variable, but 2 years before that, it was smaller, varying $10 million to $20 million and this year was a little bit higher, over $30 million. So that will depend on the properties that they come up with. Alan, do you have anything to add to that?","Alan Shaw","Yes. They are distinct transactions and as we all know with real estate, the closing date can move forward or move back. So it's an initiative of ours. It's been an initiative for several years. It provided benefit in 2016 and we expect that it's going to do even more so in 2017. ","Brian Konigsberg","But it's not explicitly in the plan, is that right?","Alan Shaw","We always do budget for a certain level of gain from sale of both operating and non-operating properties, so that's a standard item in our budgets.","Brian Konigsberg","Okay. If I could just add one more quick one maybe for Mike. So you had a good - I guess you did very well on lengthening or expanding the train lengths and actually keeping up the velocity.","Maybe just talk about what the opportunity is on lengthening more in '17 and how do you balance that with the velocity and the service metrics?","Michael Wheeler","Yeah. Sure. It's something we focus on a lot. We feel like we've got -- not feel -- we know we've got capacity on our trains, particularly on the intermodal and merchandise networks, so we will continue to see it grow, a lot of work going on there to make that happen.","But we are doing it very thoughtfully so that, one, we keep our terminals fluid and be able to keep the overall velocity of all the assets to the railroad flowing. And we also spend time with our customers on working with them on how we can increase train lengths as well and we both benefit. So a lot of initiative there and still opportunity going forward.","Brian Konigsberg","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Squires for closing comments. ","James Squires","Thank you very much for your time this morning. We will continue to push hard to drive shareholder value through successful execution of our strategic plan. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

And a question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Katie Cook. Thank you. Ms. Cook, you may now begin.","Katie U. Cook - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon. Before we begin today's call, I would like to mention a few items. First, the slides of the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors section. Additionally, transcripts and downloads of today's call will be posted on our website.","As noted in our disclosures found on slide two of our presentation, please be advised that during this call, we may make certain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially from those projected. Please refer to our Annual and Quarterly Reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important.","Additionally, keep in mind that all references to reported results, excluding certain adjustments, that is non-GAAP numbers, have been reconciled on our website in the Investors section.","Now, it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's, Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's first quarter of 2016 earnings call. With me today are NS's Chief Marketing Officer, Alan Shaw; our Chief Operating Officer, Mike Wheeler; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart. We'll share the details of our strong first quarter financial results with you momentarily. But let me begin by saying how proud I am of the men and women of Norfolk Southern who are so successfully executing our strategic plan their flexibility and initiative are driving shareholder value even in the midst of a challenging and ever-changing marketplace.","Turning to our results on slide four, our team delivered a record-setting first quarter operating ratio of 70.1%, 630 basis points lower than last year's first quarter. This performance was in the face of weak commodities, a strong dollar, and coal volumes down 23%. Norfolk Southern's earnings for the first quarter were $1.29 per share, 29% higher than last year's dollar per share. Marta will go over the details shortly.","We were able to generate these results; thanks in large part to improved network performance. Mike will follow with an update on operations. But let me highlight here that our team increased the composite service measure by 23%, increased train speeds by 15%, and reduced terminal dwell by 14%. These strong improvements helped us control costs, while enhancing the value of our product. Better service is, of course, a pre-requisite to growth and a foundation of our strategy. It is what allowed us to grow in the first quarter in markets like automotive and intermodal even within a challenging macroenvironment.","Furthermore, this focus on improved service helped to counterbalance weakness in commodities like coal and crude oil. Alan will share all the details of our top line results in a moment.","With respect to our strategic plan, and as noted on slide five, our focus on strengthening Norfolk Southern is yielding results. We are now on track to achieve productivity savings of about $200 million for the full-year, up from our previous target of $130 million, and we still expect to achieve a full-year operating ratio below 70%.","Last quarter, we showcased a number of initiatives to right-size our asset base. As this year progresses, we continue to explore and implement additional initiatives, including, as we announced yesterday, our reduced train operations at Knoxville yard. By 2020, we expect to achieve annual productivity savings of over $650 million through cost reductions in labor, materials, fuel, and purchased services. Our plan is dynamic, and our longer-term expectations include growth in both pricing and volumes.","As previously noted, we are targeting 2.5% compound annual growth in pricing, and a similar rate of growth in volumes over the five-year plan period. Our goal, as we have said, is a sub-65% operating ratio by 2020, accompanied by double-digit compound annual growth in EPS.","Based on our strong first quarter results, we are clearly moving in the right direction. Our plan also provides for significant return of capital to shareholders. Over the past 10 years, Norfolk Southern distributed nearly $15 billion through share repurchases and dividends. This year, we plan to distribute $800 million through share repurchases, while continuing a steadfast commitment to maintaining our dividend.","We have the right team in place. They have demonstrated their ability to perform. Delivering superior shareholder value is their abiding objective and mine. I have every confidence as shown by our strong start to 2016 that this team will go above and beyond to produce results.","I'll now turn the program over to Alan, Mike and Marta, who will provide more details on our 2016 results and outlook, and then, return with some closing comments before taking your questions. Alan?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon to our audience. We appreciate you're joining us today. On slide seven, you can see that our first quarter revenue declined 6% year-over-year to $2.4 billion. A majority of the decrease was attributable to lower on-highway diesel and WTI prices, which reduced fuel surcharge revenues compared to last year. Remaining decrease in revenue was due to a 23% decline in coal volume, driven by unseasonably warm weather and to the Triple Crown restructuring.","Coal now represents less than 15% of our revenue, down from 29% in 2010. Excluding the impact of Triple Crown, our volumes are relatively flat despite the declining commodity markets. Due to our diverse portfolio and improved service product, revenue per unit less fuel increased year-over-year for the third quarter in a row as a result of our pricing focus, which more than offset the negative mix impact from increased intermodal volumes and declines in higher rated commodities.","As you can see on slide eight, merchandise revenue increased 2% in the first quarter of 2016 with a 3% increase in volume. Volume grew in all business groups, except chemicals, which was impacted by decreased crude oil shipments. Automotive volume was up 18% in the quarter, exceeding North American vehicle production growth of 5% with relatively easy comparisons from last year. We do not anticipate year-over-year growth to continue at this level. Comparisons will become more difficult as the year progresses.","For the year, we anticipate growth to be better aligned with North American vehicle production, which is now projected at an annual growth rate of 1.4%. Coil steel and plastics benefited from automotive production, while housing and construction activity drove growth in aggregates, cement and lumber.","Turning to intermodal on slide nine. Overall volume was flat, notwithstanding the impact of the Triple Crown restructure. Excluding our Triple Crown subsidiary, intermodal volume increased 6% with a 15% increase in international business, resulting from our network reach and service. Domestic growth, excluding Triple Crown, was impacted by the inventory overhang that we discussed last quarter, though volumes improved sequentially each month as a result of service gains.","Lower volumes of higher rated Triple Crown freight and lower fuel surcharge revenue decreased intermodal RPU by 12%. However, excluding the impact of Triple Crown and fuel surcharges, intermodal RPU increased 1% as pricing initiatives offset the negative mix associated with increased international volume and truck capacity.","Moving to the coal market on slide 10, utility coal met our previous guidance of 15 million tons for the quarter, a decrease from last year due to warm weather and low natural gas prices. Exports slightly exceeded our guidance of 2.5 million tons to 3 million tons for the quarter, although challenges continue in an oversupplied global market. We maintain our previous export guidance through 2016. Excluding fuel, revenue per unit increased 3%; RPU was positively impacted by $10 million in liquidated damages in the first quarter, as rate increases were offset by unfavorable changes in the mix of business.","As referenced on slide 11, warm weather in our service territory continued through March, resulting in stockpiles well above average levels. We expect this impact to extend into at least the fourth quarter and anticipate utility volumes continuing at the first quarter pace until stockpiles return to target levels, assuming normal weather patterns.","Concluding with our outlook on slide 12, coal volumes in 2016 will be impacted as utilities work down the stockpile build-up resulting from the warm winter. Low oil and gas prices have significantly reduced rig counts and drilling activity, which will negatively impact our volume of crude by rail as well as natural gas drilling inputs, including frac sand and pipe.","The Triple Crown restructure will dampen intermodal volume for the rest of the year. Longer term, our improved service product, combined with increased regulation in the trucking industry, provides stronger growth opportunities for domestic intermodal. Additionally, international intermodal volume benefits from our alignment with shipping partners adding capacity to the East Coast. Our pricing outlook is favorable, reflecting the value of our service product. While lower on-highway diesel and WTI prices and associated fuel surcharges continue to affect top line growth, that impact has greatly subsided.","We focus on growth by providing a service product the market values, while negotiating market competitive prices. This quarter, our improved service levels, especially benefited intermodal and automotive and allowed Norfolk Southern to aggressively manage through the changing economic environment.","While executing against our strategic plan, we are enhancing shareholder return by successfully operating a network that efficiently and fluidly handles a diverse portfolio of business, and strategically, inserting NS as a valued component of our customers' supply chains, which will generate greater opportunities for growth even as individual markets fluctuate.","Next, Mike will describe operational improvements that have reduced our costs and enhanced the value of our products.","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Alan. I am pleased to announce that we are continuing to operate at high service levels, while also making significant strides in our cost reduction initiatives. Thanks to the commitment and focus of our employees on executing these key drivers of our strategic plan. The following results are a validation of NS employees' hard work.","Let me begin with one of our core principles on slide 14, which is safety. While our injury ratio saw a slight uptick in the first quarter, as compared to the same period last year, we've actually seen a 5% improvement in our injury count. However, this was more than offset by a reduction in hours worked. We also achieved a reduction in the number of serious injuries resulting in an improvement in our serious injury ratio.","Turning to service on slide 15. You can see we are maintaining the high service levels we delivered in the fourth quarter. We have achieved this while aggressively and successfully pursuing cost reduction initiatives, which is something we committed to on our last call. We remain confident we can continue to keep service at a high level, while we focus on identifying and implementing further cost reduction initiatives.","As you can see on slide 16, our speed has continued to improve, which has aided our asset utilization. We are continuing to operate at our historic highs on this key metric. Dwell increased from the fourth quarter due in part to seasonal impact, but we were significantly below first quarter 2015. We are encouraged that our overall velocity as measured at the car level is near our previous record levels.","Taking a look at our resources on slide 17, we continued right-sizing our workforce in the first quarter to match the business levels. These reductions occurred in all the operating departments. We had 1,300 T&E employees furloughed at the end of the quarter along with 450 non-T&E employees. We are in the process of recalling approximately 500 T&E employees to prepare for seasonal volume increases and to cover attrition, although for the full-year, we are ahead of our plan for head count reductions, which Marta will update you on later.","On the locomotive side, aided by our high velocity and the execution of our strategic plan to run a more efficient and profitable railroad, we continue to rationalize our locomotive fleet. In addition to currently storing high-adhesion road locomotives, we have right-sized our yard and local fleet, a total of a 150 units have been removed from this fleet, representing a 12% reduction. We accomplished this without negatively impacting customer service levels. In addition, we plan to add 50 new locomotives in the second quarter, which will allow us to remove less efficient road locomotives from the fleet.","Now, on slide 18, the cost reduction initiatives just discussed, coupled with our efforts to keep the railroad operating at a high level, have resulted in significant productivity savings. Through the first three months of the year, we've been able to realize significant improvements in key areas. Our 2.8% reduction in crew starts has outpaced our drop in volume, driven in part by our improvement in train length. That percentage is even higher when considering the sharp reduction in recrews, which along with the drop in overtime, is indicative of a very fluid railroad. All of these together are driving improved productivity as seen in the gross ton miles per T&E employee. So certainly some positive results.","As Jim stated, this is indicative we are ahead of our $130 million productivity savings and now expect $200 million in productivity savings for the full-year. Some of this was frontend-loaded due to the benefit of not having last year's weather and service costs in the first quarter.","On slide 19, I would like to update you on the status of our previously announced additional cost reduction initiatives. We have ceased road operations on the West Virginia Secondary, as well as completed the consolidation of the Pocahontas and Virginia divisions. We also continue to make progress with the idling of the Ashtabula coal terminal, which should be completed in the second quarter.","As seen on slide 20, we've also consolidated our operational alignment from three regions to two. In addition to reducing regional supervision across all departments within operations, this initiative further streamlines our network and improves communication and coordination across the railroads.","Lastly, on slide 21, we have also made significant progress with our yard rationalizations. We have been executing on this rationalization of our operation for several years, starting with the idling of Buckeye Yard in Columbus in 2009, continuing with Roanoke in 2013, and now Knoxville, Tennessee.","As recently announced, we are idling terminal operations at our hump yard in Knoxville, effective May 1. 130 positions will be impacted by this reduction in operations. The annual savings on this initiative is approximately $13 million. Our ability to realize these savings is due in large part to our expansion at our Bellevue hump yard and the capacity that has given us. In addition, we have curtailed activities at many of our smaller yards.","In all, we have reduced to rationalize yard operations at 25 locations across our system. We see a lot of positive signs from our operation and we will continue to execute our tactical and strategic cost control initiatives, and at the same time, ensure we continue to provide a great service product to our customers.","Thank you. And I will now turn it over to Marta, who will update you on the financials.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's take a look at our first quarter financials starting with operation.","Slide 23 summarizes our operating results compared to last year's first quarter, and as Jim already mentioned, reflects a record-setting 70.1% operating ratio. As you know, the first quarter historically has the highest OR of the year and so this result is very supportive of our anticipated full-year operating ratio below 70%.","Revenues, as Alan described, were down 6% in the quarter. However, this was offset by a larger decline of 13% or $264 million in expenses. The net result was an increase of $117 million or 19% in income from railway operation.","Taking a look at slide 24, the 13% decline in operating expenses reflects the aggressive efforts our team is taking to reduce expenses and control costs. Every cost category, except for depreciation, declined in the quarter.","Let's take a closer look at each of the components. Slide 25 depicts the significant drop in fuel costs. As you would expect, most of the decrease is price-related. In addition, consumption per unit improved as gallons of fuel use declined by 4% on the 2% reduction in traffic volume.","Turning to slide 26. Compensation costs were down by $60 million or 8%. As Mike discussed, our efforts to minimize overtime and recrews combined with a lower overall head count resulted in $45 million of lower payroll. Commensurate with the reduced compensation base was the lower level of payroll taxes, which were down $13 million. Additionally, we lacked the $11 million in cost related to last year's signing bonus and had $10 million in lower pension expense. These items were partially offset by health and welfare rate increases of $15 million.","As shown on the lower left of the slide, our average head count for the quarter declined by about 1,900 positions both for the year-over-year and the sequential comparison. As Mike described, some of this is seasonal and we now expect a full-year head count reduction of 1,500 versus the 1,200 from our previous forecast.","Slide 27 details our materials and other category showing a decrease of $52 million or 21%. Reductions totaling $42 million were due to a decline in all areas of material usage: in locomotives, freight cars and roadway. The largest drop was in locomotive materials as a result of the 7% decline in locomotives and service. In addition to the decreased number of locomotive, we greatly reduced locomotive overhauls and strategically utilized parts from the fleet of DC locomotives that are slated for AC conversion.","Additionally, fewer freight cars and the mild winter weather also contributed to lower material usage. For the remainder of the year, we expect the decline in materials to moderate to about a $10 million quarter-over-quarter favorable variance.","Moving on to slide 28. Purchased services and rents were down $44 million or 10%, largely due to $34 million and lower Triple Crown costs associated with its much smaller operation. Additionally, expenses related to engineering and transportation services declined by $10 million and equipment rents were down $3 million, notwithstanding the strong automotive volumes as velocity-related benefits offset these volume metric effects.","Turning to income taxes on slide 29. The effective rate for the first quarter was 35.5% versus 37.4% in 2015. A combination of small items including a state tax law change and corporate-owned life insurance proceeds slightly lowered the rate. For the remaining quarters of this year, we continue to expect a roughly 37% effective income tax rate.","Slide 30 shows our bottom line results with net income of $387 million, reflecting an increase of $77 million or 25% and diluted earnings per share of $1.29, up 29%, compared with last year. We're making solid progress and remain committed to continued improvement.","Wrapping up our financial overview on slide 31, cash from operations for the first three months was $879 million. Capital spending through the first quarter was approximately $400 million. Due to the reduction in traffic volume, we've re-visited our capital plan and have modestly reduced our full-year capital budget from $2.1 billion to $2 billion even.","Turning back to cash flows, the improved operating cash and level CapEx resulted in free cash flow of almost $0.5 billion. With respect to shareholder returns, we repurchased $200 million of stock and paid $176 million in dividends during the quarter.","And with that, I thank you for your attention and I'll turn the program back to Jim.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Marta. Norfolk Southern has adapted to a challenging environment and delivered strong first quarter results. The NS team remains focused on executing our plan to reduce costs, drive profitability and enhance value for all NS shareholders. We're on the right track and showing tangible results.","And with that, we will now open the line for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Jim. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from the line of Justin Long from Stephens. Please proceed with your question, sir.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks and congrats on the quarter. The first question I had was, I was wondering if you could provide any expectation for the sequential progression of the OR throughout the year. You mentioned in the prepared remarks that 1Q is usually the highest OR of the year. So I'm just curious if you think that typical seasonality will hold true in 2016?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","So, Justin, as you properly observed, the first quarter is traditionally the highest operating ratio quarter of the year. And so with our guidance for a sub-70% operating ratio for the full-year, we would expect to see declining operating ratios from here. And now with that said, we do certainly have some headwinds out there. The commodities landscape is anything but certain right now.","And we're heading into some tough comps in the second quarter; some of the highest volume weeks of the year last year, and a variety of other areas as well. The revenue outlook is somewhat uncertain, but we are confident that we can deliver. We're pulling out all the stops on costs as you saw in the first quarter. And we intend to deliver a sub-70% operating ratio for the full-year.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then, maybe as my follow-up on pricing, I know you don't give details on core price. But I was wondering first if you could talk about how much of your 2016 pricing is locked in as of today and then maybe just on a relative basis for that pricing that is locked in, how that stacks up to the level of increases you saw in 2015?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Justin, we've got about three-quarters of our business for 2016 locked up right now with pricing. And I would say at this point pricing is above the levels that we were seeing at this time last year.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Great. I'll leave it at that. Thanks so much for the time.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Matt Troy from Nomura Asset Management. Please proceed with your question.","Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my call. Just a quick one. I think a couple of quarters ago people had asked about your decision to maintain the WTI-based surcharges you've now said you're going to move in the last couple of quarters to on-highway diesel. Just wondering if you could frame for us roughly what percentage of your fuel surcharge programs are currently on the on-highway diesel framework and what's the opportunity over what timeframe to migrate that? Thanks.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Matt, we've gotten our WTI-based revenue from a little bit over 50% to somewhere between 40% to 45% depending upon traffic mix.","Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. And my follow-up would then be just on the \u2013 a simple question on pension. You said it was lower by $10 million in the quarter, I'm wondering if you could just dimensionalize for the year is that at good run rate? Should we expect pension expense to be about $10 million lower per quarter? Or do you have an annual forecast there? Thanks.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Yes, Matt. You're correct. That pension trend that set for the first quarter will continue for each of the quarters the rest of the year.","Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great. Thanks, everybody.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry from Credit Suisse Group. Please proceed with your question.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. So thinking about the improved free cash flow here in the first quarter, is there upside potential to the $800 million of share buybacks you alluded to? And then, in terms of CapEx, you did take it down about $100 million, but do you see further opportunities to take that down even lower?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Allison, I'll start. We are certainly working hard to adjust our CapEx as appropriate to keep it within limits to generate satisfactory returns. And that's why we have modulated our capital spending both this year and last year downward in the face of declining revenue relative to our original expectations for the year.","Marta, why don't you comment on the buybacks we've outlined today?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Okay. The buybacks are something that our board reviews continually. Each time we meet with our board, we look at that, we look at the free cash flow projection. And right now, we're comfortable with the guidance that we gave of $800 million for the full-year.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","You're welcome.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter from Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question, sir.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Jim and team, congrats on a great job. So stepping back from the active events around the M&A and you fought that back and a lot of weight on your shoulders to prove that you can achieve. So great job out of the gate now that you can just focus on actually running the business.","But earlier, Michael, you talked about recrews down about 51%. Just wondering operationally, what are you changing in order to achieve that and what structurally when you take a step back? Obviously, you're shutting down a bunch of the different local networks that you've talked about and combining systems, but what operationally do you need to change? And is there more room to improve from those changes?","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Ken, well, obviously, like we talked about last year getting the right resources in place, crews and locomotives and those are in place. And with that, we've been executing our operating play very well. That's allowed us to reduce the recrews and do all the productivity things we've seen as well as all the high service levels we provided. So that's the big driver of it.","We've got the resources, we've got the right operating plan and we're executing that operating plan. Now, going forward, we've always said that we're going to continue to take a look at what opportunities are out there. You saw what we've announced yesterday. We continue to look and we will, but we're always going to make sure that we protect the service products that we have and keep that at high levels, continue to reduce costs.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Jim, when you step back, is there a master plan of different buckets that when you look at the 65% OR target that you can tell us and walk us through at some point, whether it's train lengths, what you need to do on sidings, reduction on employees or locomotives that you feel need to be done to get there? Or is this piecemeal each time you improve, you just keep coming out with, oh, we can close this now? Or is there something master that you can set targets on a little more specifically?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Sure. And we have outlined some targets along those lines, Ken, to go with the annual productivity savings, totaling more than $650 million by 2020. For example, we have said that we intend to bring employment down significantly with associated compensation benefits expense savings by 2020. And that's a function of productivity \u2013 labor productivity initiatives across the board. We also have targets for our locomotive fleet and for various other resources that will drive those productivity savings.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Is that something you're going to share with us, kind of, targets and goals, so we can watch you along the way? Or are they just more internal target?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","We'll certainly update you as we move along. As we have today with regard to our labor targets and Mike also got into the locomotive fleet size and efforts there to rationalize that asset.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Great job. Thank you for the time.","Operator","Now our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Wanted to ask you about the productivity, the $200 million upsides from $130 million. Can you give a sense of how much was in the first quarter? It sounded like maybe some of it was a little bit pulled forward due to weather and some other favorable operating conditions. But just wanted to get a sense as to what was in 1Q and then maybe how we think about the cadence for the rest of the year?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. That's right, Chris. We entered the year with a running start, and we had some built-in favorability from the absence of weather and service-related spending in the first quarter of last year. And that boosted productivity in the first quarter. We were also benefiting from other initiatives that we kicked off last year that gave us a lot of momentum and energy entering 2016. And we're going to keep that going. We've revised upward as we've said the productivity target for the full-year to $200 million.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","So just trying to understand how much that $200 million might have been in 1Q and then what we can expect for the rest of the year?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","$200 million for the full-year is our new goal as I said. Again, that was bit front-loaded (36:48) in the first quarter and Marta went through, for example, the run rate on mechanical spending relative to last year will lessen somewhat in subsequent quarters. So, call it, fast start. We're going to stay at it, and for the full-year, $200 million.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. And then, just thinking about the head count as we go forward, obviously, you updated the target there. That would suggest roughly flattish maybe a little bit down \u2013 or maybe a little bit up a little bit over the course of the rest of the year. Just want to think is that right way to think about how that cadence plays out, see a (37:23) seasonal uptick generally in volume over the next couple of quarters, but found that you can handle that with the existing resources you have?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","So our guidance, Chris, was that for the full-year, we think we will be down 1,500. So I don't know if you're looking at it sequentially or year-over-year, but the way you think about it is, if you look at our last year average that we have in our financial data book, we think we're going to end the year 1,500 below that. Makes sense?","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. Appreciate it.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, thanks. Afternoon, guys. So outside of the \u2013 about $10 million or so of liquidated damages, is there anything else that you would call unusual in this quarter? And I guess, I'm trying to go back to that first question about the sequential margin trend because we typically see \u2013 I don't know \u2013 400 basis points or 500 basis points in margin improvement from 1Q to 2Q, and I don't know if that's a realistic expectation given the strength we saw in the first quarter.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Well, Scott, let me reference you to something that Jim said about the weather-related. If you recall last year, we had some weather and service-related costs in each of the first three quarters, but they were definitely weighted towards the first quarter. So that was $42 million that we called out last year. So that's the running start that he and Mike referred to. So that would tell you that we had more of a reduction in the first quarter than you would normally expect. That makes sense with the $42 million of the $82 million was incurred in the first quarter of last year.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So maybe we've got $40-so-million of lower-than-normal weather costs and then a little bit of a liquidated damages to think about for the first quarter of this year.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","That's right.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","And the third item would be the materials that we highlighted that we had a materials year-over-year reduction of $42 million in this first quarter, but we forecast that will be just a $10 million reduction in the second, third and fourth quarters.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","What's the change there?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","That's the materials. We had some items in the first quarter that that I called out in terms of locomotive overhauls that were greatly reduced and some specific things we did with freight cars and locomotives in terms of using parts that is a first quarter-only item. So part of the materials reduction will continue, but a large part that we had in the first quarter will not.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then, just in terms of head count, so you're already above the 1,500 people you're talking about for the year. And we're not really seeing the seasonal volume uptick, your service metrics are at great levels right now, and then, you just announced some additional closures yesterday or two days ago. So, I guess, I'm a little confused why we're not raising the head count target even more?","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer","Well, we do need to bring the folks back to cover attritions and we need those folks to make sure we continue to maintain the service levels that we have. That's a key point. And we historically do see higher seasonal volumes in the second quarter and third quarter than what we have in the first quarter. And that's expected to cover that as well.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","What are you assuming for volumes in the second quarter?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Well, we expect sequentially higher volumes in line with the usual seasonal pattern. Alan, why don't you break that down a little bit for Scott?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Scott, it will be down year-over-year, though, because, as Jim noted, some of our greatest volume comps were in the second quarter of last year. We're going to continue to have headwinds in our coal market, which I've outlined. We will not have the level of growth in our automotive franchise that we had in the first quarter due to the fact that we had some pretty easy comps in the first quarter of last year. And there are a couple of models that are built at plants served by NS, which are effectively being taken offline due to low demand.","So we are going to have some headwinds with respect to volume in the second quarter. But ultimately, service is driving more intermodal volumes for us. And Triple Crown will be a headwind for us into the fourth quarter of this year.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","You're welcome.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl from Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC","Yeah. Thank you, operator. Hey, guys. The old saying, you got to walk before you run, and it looks like at least you guys are starting to jog. Just a question, sort of your physical plan going forward, I know as one of the callers alluded to before that you guys made some recent streamlining announcements. What in terms of maybe some track sales or maybe some track divestitures might be left here in 2016 and when should we expect more color on them?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","We have previously announced a goal of short-lining, idling, or downgrading a 1,000 miles of track this year. That remains our goal in terms of the track structure. Mike, other thoughts on infrastructure-related right-sizing?","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer","We continue to look at it. We've got a lot of modeling that goes on to try and find where we can that and we take the opportunities. We will do that. We have some of those things you're talking about on the table going forward that will be announced later on in the year.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. That's fair enough. Also, how should we think about coal next year? I know it's very negative now and all the other railroads are talking about massively high stockpiles, warmest winter on record. How should we look at it next year if we get more normalized weather patterns?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Jason, if stockpiles return to target by the end of the year, then coal volumes will be close to where we were at a run rate last year, where we in our utility markets we were 17 million, 19 million tons is what we were looking at, and export's going to be highly depended upon what happens with the overseas market.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC","Right. I understand that. So where are we now with stockpiles in your region?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Jason, they're about 100 days right now. And target I would tell you is probably about 60 days depended upon the geography. So there is a lot of inventory overhang that needs to get worked through this summer in order for us to get back to target. So we're going to need a hot summer to support that coal franchise.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC","I'll keep my fingers crossed for you. Well, listen, guys, I appreciate the time as always.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, good afternoon, everyone. And thanks for taking the question. And, Jim, if you guys keep delivering, earnings up 29%, some of those critical stuff, I think, in past three months probably goes away pretty quickly. I just want to ask you, Marta, because you grouped in materials and other and I think purchased services and some other line items. So can you go over the guidance for those two broad categories again as they're supposed to trend throughout the year.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Okay, certainly. So in materials, we were down $42 million in the first quarter, but quarter-over-quarter for the remainder of the year, we think that's going to be down $10 million, okay. And then in purchased services...","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Sorry, Marta, I just want to clarify. So sequentially down $10 million or, meaning, year-over-year?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Quarter-over-quarter. Year-over-year. So second quarter of 2016 compared to second quarter of 2015 and so on, we think that will be down $10 million in materials. And then, with purchased services and rents, the predominant reason for the reduction there was the reduction in Triple Crown services. So that was $34 million of that decline. And that will continue at that level for the \u2013 at approximately that level for the second quarter and third quarter. In the fourth quarter, it will be about half of that because recall that we downsized Triple Crown in the middle of the fourth quarter of last year.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Got it. That's helpful. Thank you for clarifying. I guess, let me just slip one more question, if you guys don't mind. So, Jim, what can you leverage on the service side now that it appears you have your cost structure a little bit better than where it was last year. Service does appear to be improving for Norfolk. When markets come back, what's the plan on the marketing cycles? We've talked a lot here about the cost side.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Sure, absolutely. We are well-positioned to grow as commodities rebound and other markets recover from inventory overhang. And that's the great benefit of having service at the current level. It sheds cost and it positions us for growth. So we are very confident that we can grow into this level of service and will just as soon as business picks up.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Rob Salmon from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, good afternoon, guys. Marta, with the benefits from the Knoxville closing, it sounded like, if I heard you correct, it's about $13 million on an annualized basis. Are there any costs that we should be thinking about in terms of that will be incurred in Q2 in anticipation of the savings that we should be modeling in?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","No. No. You're good with that $13 million that Mike talked about. Again, it is going to be effective May 1 and the $13 million is annualized. So roughly, half of that we'll realize this year with mid-year implementation.","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer","Correct.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right. That's helpful. And then, with regard to the train length, I saw that increased about 2.5% on a year-over-year basis. Is that predominantly driven by the growth that we saw in terms of traffic in your merchandise network? Or was this more broad-based and that's not a fair apples-to-apples comparison?","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer","No, you're exactly right. Our intermodal and the unit trains stayed at very highly levels. But the growth was in the merchandise section. In fact, that section grew 6%.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And how should we think about the cadence looking out from here? Are there incremental initiatives that should allow further growth? Or is the growth going to come from volume eventually picking up?","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer","I would say both. We'll be able to handle the volume growth on to the train network. The other thing is we continue to have initiatives looking at where we can build big trains particularly between terminal and terminal, including more use of the distributed power technology. And we're doing more and more of that. And big trains terminal-to-terminal where it makes sense.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And are there any goals that you're willing to share in terms of targets for the back-half of the year at this point?","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer","No, not at this time.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the time.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Vernon from Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Just a question for you on some of the intermodal pricing and the outlook for intermodal rates both in the near term, it looks like the RPU ex-Triple Crown and fuel surcharge grew at about a percent. And I'm just wondering what your expectation is in the context of that pricing above inflation what we should be expecting in that core intermodal rate?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Well, David, recognize that that 1% growth had a negative mix component from flat domestic and a 15% increase in international, which tends to be a shorter haul that have a lower RPU, 40-foot (50:13). So I'll strip that mix and we had pricing in intermodal that exceeded rail inflation and pricing in intermodal that drives sufficient shareholder returns to allow it to compete for capital.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So you're not seeing any pressure there from any temporary looseness in the truck market on the intermodal rates?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","To be sure, truck capacity is limiting probably the level of increase that we could get, but it's not causing rate decreases.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, maybe just as a quick follow-up. Obviously, Jim, this is a pretty amazing inflection point in sequential productivity. And I guess, as you think about the outlook obviously, you're going to be delivering more, but should we be thinking this first quarter is the \u2013 like you said, a running start and is there is going to be the peak for the rate of change in productivity going forward or are you also holding some things back for later in the year?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Yes. No, I think that's a fair assumption. We front-loaded some of the productivity gains. As I said, we had a very fast start to the year with a lot of momentum and energy based on the plans that we made and the things that we did last year to position ourselves for it. So, yes, we have the pedal to the metal. And that's where it's going to stay.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","All right. Well, a 70% OR in the first quarter is truly impressive. And great results, guys. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Good afternoon. And I echo the other comments, very strong results obviously. Let's see. Can you comment a little on the look on markets where \u2013 I know you said that the second quarter comps are more difficult volume-wise. But as you look at things, I guess, macro variables changing and so forth, where might you be most optimistic that you could see some improvement in markets? Would it be in steel with some of the actions that might take place that might help the domestic producers? Where might you actually see a little more optimism looking beyond maybe the tough comps here in the near term?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Tom, we've talked about the coil steel, benefiting from the automotive market. As you alluded to, the recent tariff activity has improved steel pricing and steel capacity utilization. So there are some aspects of the steel market that are performing well within our metals and construction, of course, is frac sands. And we're going to have a pretty significant decline there due to the decline in drilling activity as is pipe.","I would tell you that once the retail and wholesale inventory levels normalize, we see a lot of opportunity in that consumer-based market because of our improved service product. And even with pressure on corporate profits now, shippers are looking to shift to intermodal because it still is a lower priced option than truck.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","So what's the reasonable timeframe to see the volumes look a little bit better? You think they can grow later in the year? Or is that just hard to tell?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","It's going to be wholly dependent upon what happens with commodity pricing, the pressures in crude oil, frac sand and coal, and then, what happens with the retail and wholesale inventory levels.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then just a short follow-up. On the comp and benefits, can you give me any sense of how to model that year-over-year looking forward, Marta? Does that change because incentive comp is more of a headwind or different? Or do you think it's down for year-over-year the next several quarters?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Yes, I think you keyed on the one thing that's going to be different in the second through fourth quarters. In my prepared remarks, I talked about three things and they're going to continue. Just to summarize those that head count is going to continue, but at a moderated levels we've already discussed. The inflation that we had guided to at 3.5% and you saw the $15 million in health and welfare, that's going to continue. The pension, as someone else asked a few minutes ago, that's going to continue.","But the one thing that is going to be different in the second, third and fourth quarters is the year-over-year headwind from incentive comp. Because, as you'll recall, last year in the first quarter, we had been accruing at a beginning of the year bonus accrual level, but as the year went along and we didn't meet expectations, we had reversals of those accruals, and so each of the quarter's last year had year-over-year incentive comp reductions. And so depending on how our performance is, the remainder of the year you will see headwinds from that item","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you for the time.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown from Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, good afternoon. Hey, Jim, I just wanted to ask you a little bit about the opening of the Bellevue hump yard and the Englewood flyover from last year. So first, are you guys seeing the returns on those projects that you expected? And then, two, I'm just curious if those projects have been instrumental in the ability to close Roanoke and Knoxville hump yards, even if they've been a key driver on productivity.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","No doubt about it. The Bellevue capacity and throughput has facilitated asset rationalization elsewhere on the network, including at the terminal level and elsewhere as well and certainly the other flyover has helped with our meets in and out of Chicago. So yes to both.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, great. And then, I am curious, at this point, has rationalizations impacted schedules or transit times at all on the intermodal side maybe positively or negatively?","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer","No, no. We are continuing to run at the high levels that we've had in the past, so it's all been good.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, great. Great quarter. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ben Hartford from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, thanks. Marta, can I circle back on the incentive comp discussion? Did you provide what the headwind was in the first quarter, if there was any in terms of IC?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","It was approximately flat in the first quarter. If you do look at the full-year of last year, it was a year-over-year $150 million, but it was all in the second, third and fourth quarters.","Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. So will there be catch-up in 2Q, 3Q, 4Q from the first quarter? Or was there just none for some reason even though \u2013 despite the quarter strength?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","It's more of a year-over-year thing, Ben. So the first quarter of last year, we had an incentive comp accrual and then this first quarter of this year, we had a roughly similar amount. As you move into the remainder of the year, the issue will be the year-over-year comparison.","Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Alan, I guess, maybe your view on international intermodal and SOLAS and the container weighting discussion, what is your take in terms of potential pull-forward of international intermodal ahead of the implementation midyear and what type of effect do you expect if and when that is implemented?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Ben, we've heard the theory that that could cause some volumes to be pulled forward. But as we've talked to our customers in the shipping lines, we haven't seen any activity to that regard.","Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I assume there are concerns, but any changes in behavior that you see from shippers preparing for that potential implementation?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","No, nothing meaningful.","Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.","James A.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Hostutler, Norfolk Southern Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Hostutler, you may begin.","Michael Hostutler ","Thank you, and good afternoon. Before we begin today's call, I would like to mention a few items. First, the slides of the presenters are available on our website at nscorp.com in the Investors section. Additionally, transcripts and MP3 downloads of today's call will be posted on our website for your convenience.","Please be advised that any forward-looking statements made during the course of the call represent our best good-faith judgment as to what may occur in the future. Statements that are forward looking can be identified by the use of words such as believe, expect, anticipate and project. Our actual results may differ materially from those projected and will be subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which may be outside of our control.","Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for discussions of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Additionally, keep in mind that all references to reported results, excluding certain adjustments, that is, non-GAAP numbers, have been reconciled on our website in the Investors section.","Now it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern Chairman, President and CEO, Wick Moorman.","Charles W. Moorman","Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. It is my pleasure to welcome you to our Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are several members of our senior team, including Don Seale, our Chief Marketing Officer; Mark Manion, our Chief Operating Officer; and John Rathbone, our Chief Financial Officer, all of whom you will hear from this afternoon.","In the third quarter, our company produced earnings per share of $1.24, which is 22% below last year. As we discussed in our earnings pre-release, these results were driven by the continuing weakness in coal volumes, which were exacerbated by further declines in export coal shipments and coupled with sequential declines in merchandise volumes.","Revenues for the third quarter were $2.7 billion, a decrease of nearly $200 million or 7% from last year. In addition to the 14% reduction in coal volumes, merchandise traffic declined 1% and fuel surcharge revenues were down 20%. Don will provide you a breakdown of the revenue details in a few minutes.","On the service front, our network performed at a very high level with our composite service index averaging above 83% for the quarter. As all of you know, a more fluid network is a more efficient network. For example, the trains we had to re-crew on line of road fell by 32% year-over-year. Mark will provide you with all of the operations details along with some other productivity numbers.","During the third quarter, we were able to hold expenses to just over 0.5% increase compared to last year. While productivity-related efficiency enabled us to do a good job of expense control as related to inflation, the decrease in these expenses, obviously, could not offset the revenue declines.","John will give you all of those financial details a little later. But at this point, I'll turn the program over to Don and then the rest of the team, and I'll return with some closing remarks before we take your questions. Don?","Donald W. Seale","Thank you, Wick, and good afternoon, everyone. As a result of weaker fundamentals in our merchandise and coal markets, coupled with negative year-over-year comparisons in fuel and mix, revenues for the third quarter was down $196 million or 7% versus third quarter last year. $84 million of the revenue variance was due to negative mix and price. And of this total, negative mix amounted to $69 million. Lower fuel surcharge revenue accounted for $72 million of the decline, and the remaining $40 million of the decrease was a result of weaker volumes.","Coal revenue decreased $198 million or 22% for the quarter. Merchandise revenue was down $14 million or 1%, and Intermodal revenue set an all-time quarterly record of $567 million, up $16 million or 3% versus 2011.","Revenue per unit in the quarter was $1,509, down $87 or 5%, and total volume declined by 25,000 units or 1%. In terms of yield, overall revenue per unit for the quarter fell $87 or 5% versus 2011.","Negative mix, fuel and pricing for export coal were the key drivers of this decline. Coal revenue per unit declined $205 or 9% from 1 year ago, due to material declines in the marketplace for export coal, combined with negative length of haul impacts in coal. Intermodal RPU decreased by $14 or 2% for the quarter, while merchandise RPU was up $14 or 1%.","Within the business groups, negative mix adversely impacted revenue per unit performance during the quarter. For example, coal volumes declined by 57,000 loads, with an average RPU of $2,000, while intermodal volume increased by 40,000 loads at an average revenue per unit of $630. Similar mix impacts were seen in metals and construction and agricultural commodities.","With respect to volume, total shipments for the quarter were down 1%; coal volume was down 14%; intermodal was up 5%; and merchandise declined 1% compared to last year.","On the plus side, intermodal volumes set a quarterly record high led by continued gains in highway conversions in our domestic intermodal segment. Within merchandise, volumes of metals and construction and paper traffic were down 7% and 5%, respectively, while agricultural volumes were flat compared to a year ago. Chemicals volume increased 4%, and automotive traffic was up 7%.","In total, the month of September accounted for over 90% of the entire third quarter volume decline, as both coal and merchandise volumes materially weakened at the beginning and through September. This is a data point that I will return to in my comments on the outlook for the fourth quarter, as we expect our volumes ahead will somewhat reflect those that we saw in September.","Drilling down into our major markets, starting with coal. Revenue for the quarter of $701 million was down $198 million or 22%; coal revenue per unit was $2,014, down 9%; and volume was 348,000 units, down 14%, as I previously mentioned.","As we've seen in the last few quarters, competition from natural gas and weaker demand for electricity, continued to impact our utility volumes. Third quarter utility shipments were down 15% versus last year, but up 10% sequentially from the second quarter. Export volume decreased 7% for the quarter compared with last year, driven by reduced volume through Baltimore and Lamberts Point, which were down 15% and 6%, respectively.","Export volumes fell 28% sequentially from the second quarter to the third quarter as the global met coal market weakened materially. Also, our participation in the export thermal coal market weakened during the third quarter as well, with export thermal shipments representing only 17% of our total export volume in the quarter, versus 29% of our export volume in the second quarter.","Total export volumes, which were up a combined 5% in July and August, fell by 28% in the month of September.","And finally, in our domestic met coal market, volume declined by 17% in the quarter due to reduced volumes of iron ore as a result of the bankruptcy-related closure of RG Steel at Warren, Ohio, as well as decelerating demand for domestic steel production.","Now turning next to our intermodal business. We achieved new quarterly records in this sector for both revenue and volume. Revenue of $567 million was up 3% over third quarter last year, and volume reached 867,000 units, up 5%.","In keeping with recent quarters, our domestic intermodal business again posted double-digit gains, up 11% over last year, due primarily to highway conversions. Within our international segment, volumes were down 1% as reductions associated with the Maersk contract comp were largely offset by growth in other international business. Excluding the negative comp, our comparison from last year, international volume was up 11% in the quarter.  Triple Crown volume declined 3%, and premium volume was up 3% in the quarter.","During the quarter, we opened our new Memphis intermodal terminal along our Crescent Corridor. This new terminal substantially increases our capacity to handle additional highway conversions over our Crescent Corridor and for East Coast import shipments.","In addition, we plan to open new terminals in Birmingham and Greencastle, Pennsylvania in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. These new Crescent Corridor terminals will set the stage to launch up to 34 new service lanes beginning in January and continuing through the first half of next year.","Now wrapping up with our merchandise business for the quarter, revenue reached $1.4 billion, down $14 million or 1% versus last year, due to a 1% volume decline and a 1% gain in revenue per unit.","Taking a look at the markets within merchandise, there were mixed results during the quarter. Starting with the largest segment, Metals & Construction experienced the 7% volume decline for the quarter as weaker highway and commercial construction activity brought down aggregates volumes by 12% in the quarter.","Steel car loadings declined 4% in part as a result of the RG Steel closure at Sparrows Point, Maryland, coupled with a 1% decline in domestic steel production. We also saw a 23% drop in volumes of materials to support natural gas drilling in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions during the quarter due to fewer drilling rig counts after realizing nearly a 50% gain in our volume in this material in the first half year-over-year.","As you can see in the next slide, active drilling rig counts within our service region declined by 27% in the third quarter, as low natural gas prices prompted operators to reduce dry gas production. The decline is most pronounced in Pennsylvania, which represents our largest market for Marcellus and Utica shale, where rig counts fell by over 40%, or 56 rigs, since the third quarter of 2011.","While this decline in activity is adversely impacting our sand and pipe business into this region, in the short run, it's a clear indicator of higher natural gas prices ahead, which we're beginning to see.","Third quarter volumes within our next largest merchandise segment, agriculture, were even with last year, as volume declines in ethanol and wheat were offset by higher shipments of soybeans and feed. Long haul corn shipments were also lower due to the drought in the Midwest and increased local sourcing in the Southeast, where the crop was better.","Chemicals traffic was up 4% for the quarter, due to new crude oil business from the Bakken and Canadian oilfields. We're now handling crude oil to 6 refineries in our service territory. And our automotive sector was up 7% for the quarter, despite model changes and retooling activity at 3 Norfolk Southern-served assembly plants.","As shown on the next slide, third quarter auto volumes were impacted by the transfer of the Ford Escape sports utility vehicle from Kansas City to Louisville, which was only partially offset by increased F150 pickup production at the Kansas City plant.","We also saw a retooling at General Motors plants at Wentzville, Missouri and Fort Wayne, Indiana. These 2 plants have now largely completed most of this transitional work, and we expect growing volumes at both, in addition to other NS-served automotive plants, albeit against tougher year-over-year comps as the year progresses.","And finally, traffic levels with our paper and forest product segment were down 5% for the quarter, due to lower volumes of pulp and municipal solid waste traffic. These decreases were only partially offset by lumber, which was up 10% in the quarter, as housing starts continue to improve in selected markets.","Now let's turn our attention to our business outlook. Looking ahead, we expect weaker overall fundamentals in most of our markets through the rest of the year and into the first half of 2013. Continued competition from natural gas and reduced demand for electricity will continue to impact our utility coal volumes. And dramatic changes in the export coal market, due to weaker demand for both met and steam coal into Europe and Asia, will continue to present a challenging environment for export volume and export pricing. We expect domestic met coal to show only moderate strength ahead as demand for steel to support automotive production continues in the fourth quarter, but will be partially offset by weaker pipe markets.","Growth in this segment will be further tempered due to the bankruptcy-related closure of RG Steel, which I've mentioned previously, and the unfavorable comp associated with that event.","The outlook for our domestic intermodal market remains positive, with a favorable environment for highway conversions. In particular, the launch of new Crescent Corridor lanes starting in January, will support higher volumes ahead.","We also expect continued expansion in our international and premium market segments. The outlook for our merchandise sector is mixed, as project growth in crude oil, along with continued growth in the automotive industry, should create favorable conditions throughout the rest of the year for chemicals and automotive. And declining materials associated with natural gas drilling, along with a difficult agricultural market due to the Midwest drought this summer, will moderate overall performance in our merchandise business segments.","In summary, as I stated earlier in my remarks, we expect that volume trends in the fourth quarter will be somewhat reflective of those we saw in September, as we work our way through material softening in several of our key markets.","With respect to pricing, our commitment remains to price at levels above the rate of rail inflation over the long run. Export coal markets made this a difficult task in the third quarter, and we expect those same headwinds over the next few quarters. But based on our internal analysis and excluding that negative effect of export coal, we met our objective of pricing above rail inflation in the third quarter, and we expect that positive trend to continue as we provide excellent service and value to our customers across our network.","Thank you, and with respect to our service product, I'll now turn it over to Mark to go over our safety and service report. Mark?","Mark D. Manion","Thanks, Don, and good afternoon, everyone. Starting with safety, we ended the quarter with an injury ratio of 0.77, a 1% improvement over the full third quarter ratio last year. Our employees continue to drive improvements and remain committed to safety and service and are on-track to reach another record in safety performance.","Moving onto service performance. Here, measured by our composite service metric, we continue to show consistent improvement. In fact, our network is operating at record velocity, helping to drive productivity improvements. As a reminder, our service composite combines metrics for key service drivers, including train performance, connection performance and plan adherence.","In the third quarter, the service composite was 83.3%, a 5.6% improvement over the same period last year. For the first 9 months of the year, the composite performance is 83%, a 9.6% improvement over the same period last year. The gains are led by train performance, which improved 24% over the first 9 months of last year. But all of the service components, train performance, connection performance and plan adherence, continue to improve. In fact, we set an all-time record in connection performance in the third quarter.","Train speed, one of the primary measures of network velocity, reflects a 2.7 mile an hour or 12.6% increase in the third quarter versus the same period last year. In fact, train speed in the third quarter was the highest average quarterly train speed we have ever reported.","Similar improvements are seen in terminal dwell, the other component of network velocity. For the third quarter, we achieved 21.3 hours, a reduction of 2.3 hours or 9.5% from the third quarter last year. This also matched our best-ever average quarterly terminal dwell.","As I mentioned earlier, operating performance and network velocity are critical to improving productivity, and these improvements are reflected in several key measures of asset productivity.","In the third quarter, we saw that train and engine service overtime was reduced 20%. Re-crews were reduced a sizable 32%. Both overtime and re-crew improvement was the result of higher velocity operations.","Equipment rents overall have been reduced. But importantly, the portion of equipment rents driven directly by velocity was reduced by 14%. Locomotives in service were reduced by 3%. Fuel consumption was reduced by 3%, despite headwinds of an unfavorable fuel efficiency traffic mix change. And finally, gross ton miles per train hour improved by 2%.","In terms of ongoing expense reductions, we'll continue to size our manpower and asset base to meet business levels, along with controlling costs across the business. We have furloughed 234 T&E employees, principally in our coal lanes. We have another 200 employees that work -- that are working at a lower level of activity. And on a minimum guarantee basis, instead of being furloughed, this is in order to help retain crews during this soft period, we have approximately 200 locomotives in storage due to business declines, but also because of increased velocity.","Additionally, since the third quarter of 2011, we have returned 160 lease locomotives that we have retained in 2010 and 2011. These were less fuel-efficient locomotives. We have approximately 17,500 cars in storage. While most are driven by volume declines, many are in storage because of velocity improvement. Regardless of the reasons for the locomotive and cars in storage, we are modulating the maintenance costs associated with these assets as well.","At the same time, we will continue to minimize the overtime and re-crews at the current significantly reduced levels. And of course, going forward, in concert with other initiatives, we will continue to concentrate on further improving velocity which, as I've explained, reduces costs.","And now I'll turn it over to John.","John P. Rathbone","Thank you, Mark. I'll now review our financial results for the third quarter. As anticipated, our results are down this quarter compared with last year, due primarily to the lower volumes in key markets as Don described. We also experienced revenue headwinds because of fuel. Let's take a closer look at our results.","Railway operating revenues for the third quarter were $2.7 billion, down $196 million or 7% compared to third quarter of last year. Depressed coal volumes were the principal driver of this decline. But in addition, fuel surcharge revenues were $72 million below last year, mostly due to a $73 million difference in fuel surcharge lag effect, $21 million unfavorable this year, compared to $52 million favorable last year.","Slide 3 shows our total operating expenses, which increased slightly for the quarter. Income from railway operations totaled $731 million, with a $207 million decrease almost totally driven by lower revenues. Our operating ratio was 72.9 or 8% higher than our third quarter 2011 results.","Turning to our expense detail, this slide presents the major components of the $11 million change. The materials and other and depreciation categories drove the overall increase, which largely reflects our continued focus on the quality of our assets through maintenance programs and capital spending. Materials and others also include the higher property taxes and some miscellaneous expenses.","Purchase services and rents were flat, benefiting from lower equipment rents, the elimination of certain equipment leases and reduced haulage expenses. These savings were offset by increases in professional and consulting fees, intermodal operating cost and freight car repairs.","Fuel decreased $6 million or 2%. As displayed on the following slide, reduced fuel consumption was partially offset by slightly higher prices.","Compensation and benefits, displayed next, reflects a $12 million decrease, down 2%.","The next slide details the components driving this change. First, lower incentive and stock compensation reflects our softer operating results. Second, volume-related payroll was down $13 million, $9 million of which was related to reduced T&E labor and fewer T&E trainees. Third, higher pay rates, largely July's increase for our contract employees, drove expenses up $13 million. And lastly, pension and other post-employment costs were up $6 million.","Turning to our nonoperating items. Majority of our $27 million decrease is due to lower gains on property sales and reduced coal royalties, which were partially offset by higher returns from company-owned life insurance. Interest expense on debt was up $10 million due to increased net borrowings.","As illustrated on this slide, income from (sic) [before] income tax decreased $244 million or 28%, primarily due to lower operating income. Income taxes totaled $238 million and the effective tax rate was 37.2%. Income taxes last year were $330 million with an effective tax rate of 37.3%.","Our bottom line results, presented on the following slide, reflect third quarter net income of $402 million, a decrease of $152 million or 27% compared with last year. Diluted earnings per share decreased $0.35, or 22%, to $1.24.","Turning to our year-to-date cash flows. Cash provided by operations cover property addition, free cash flow, combined with $1.2 billion of new notes issued supported our share repurchase activities, dividends and debt repayment. In the third quarter, we purchased 4.2 million shares, bringing the total repurchase for the year to 16.5 million shares, a cost of $1.2 billion.","Our objective remains the same with regard to the share repurchase program. Cash flow above property additions and dividends will be returned to shareholders, and we will use our balance sheet leverage to the extent we maintain our current bond rating.","We intend to go into the year end with a strong cash balance because of the uncertainties surrounding the upcoming fiscal cliff. Nonetheless, we will continue to repurchase shares in the fourth quarter, albeit at a moderating rate.","Thank you for your attention, and I'll turn the program back to Wick.","Charles W. Moorman","Thank you, John. As you heard, while we continue to operate at unprecedented levels of network velocity and efficiency, the combination of cheap natural gas, reduced demand for electricity and softening global economic conditions created significant headwinds for us in the third quarter.","As Don told you, while some of the weakness in our automotive business was short term in nature, in general, we look for these headwinds to continue largely unabated through the fourth quarter and into the first half of the year.","As Mark told you, we'll continue to remain very focused on cost control and making sure that we have the appropriate levels of resources employed to handle our business levels while maintaining a high level of network performance and efficiency, along with superior customer service.","Over the longer term, we remain very optimistic about our prospects. As Don described, we're now opening 2 major new intermodal terminals as part of our Crescent Corridor initiative, with 1 more to go this year. And we're excited about the new business that these will help bring to our franchise. We have strong franchises in automotive and metals, which will continue to drive growth as well, along with exciting new opportunities in energy-related projects.","Despite the current softness in our coal business, we have tremendous long-term strengths in terms of our access to major coal deposits, our strong metallurgical coal franchise and our export facility access, including our Lamberts Point terminal, the largest coal pier in North America.","In summary, while our outlook for the next few quarters is guarded, over the longer term, we feel confident that we can continue to deliver high levels of service to our customers and superior returns to our shareholders.","Thanks for your attention, and we'll now open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Maybe a question, just kind of on the scale of the business as we're looking at kind of the trend, from a volume standpoint. Obviously, outlook is a little bit uncertain and maybe potentially weaker. How do you think about measures, or what are the measures you can take, particularly in the fourth quarter, as you start to adapt to this? It sounds like the volume falloff was a later in the quarter. But, yes, how should we be thinking about kind of the resource allocation in the fourth quarter in particular, to try to offset some of this revenue decline?","Charles W. Moorman","Well, as Mark outlined to you, we are very actively looking right now at our asset base and our personnel in terms of making sure that we don't have any more people or assets employed than we absolutely need to, with the caveat that we are running the railroad at a very efficient level, and we are not going to do anything to slow down the network because we think that's going to cost us more money than it saves us. We, in the third quarter, for example, we initially had set out to do a little more asset maintenance than we had in the first 2 quarters. The numbers reflect that. We have throttled that back and will continue to take a very hard look at all of those expenses. And I can tell you also that as we look out into next year and do our projections, we're doing expense -- a hard look at expenses in every category that we can. So again, with the caveat that we're going to keep the railroad running at the velocity that it's currently running at, we're looking at every expense item and seeing what else we might be able to take out.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up. When you think about the pace of export coal volumes in particular, as you move into October, can you just give us a sense roughly of whether or not the September decline that we saw either has accelerated, remained roughly the same? Or just give us a little bit of parameters to how we should think about that for the fourth quarter, that would be great.","Donald W. Seale","Chris, this is Don. The export volume run rate that we're seeing right now is comparable to September. We expect the quarter to be in line with that type of volume decline.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Ceraso of Credit Suisse.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So I had a question about the expenses. And I understand that maybe the decline happened late in the quarter, so it was hard to adjust quick enough as volumes deteriorated. But do you think you'll be better able to match the decline in revenues with the decline in expenses in the fourth quarter?","Charles W. Moorman","Chris, we're going to do everything that we can to do -- can to help with that. We're not going to be able to make those kinds of offsets in totality, partially because the falloff that we're seeing, particularly on the export coal business, is a profitable piece of our business, obviously, and a business that really doesn't have a very high percentage of variable cost attached to it. So we'll do, obviously, all we can in terms of reducing crews, not -- obviously, not running trains, that will have some impact on fuel. Mark mentioned the furloughs, which we've already announced in the coal fields. So we'll pull every lever we have, but it's a very difficult thing to offset when you get into business like export coal.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up, you mentioned that you're starting to do a little bit more crude by rail. Can you just give us a little more quantification of how much you're doing now and what you think the growth trajectory is in that? Where will it be a year or 2 from now? How many cars a week or trains a week do you think you'll be moving?","Donald W. Seale","Chris, we have a substantial opportunity in crude by rail. As you probably know, we serve multiple refineries in the mid-Atlantic, up into the Northeast, as well as a few down into the Gulf as well. So as I mentioned in the remarks, we're already handling crude to 6 refineries that we serve. I would rather not get into the volumes that we're handling, but I will tell you that it's ramping up in a significant way.","Charles W. Moorman","We think it's a very exciting opportunity. And in particular, we think that the movements to East Coast refineries are very long-term rail plays. So we think it's a great opportunity.","Operator","The next question is from Peter Nesvold of Jefferies & Company.","H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess, if you could just elaborate a little bit for me, why is export coal such a high fixed-cost business relative to other businesses that you run? Because one thing that's been very pleasantly surprising about a lot of the Class 1 reports so far this year is the ability to reposition assets to counteract the downturn in volumes. If you could just elaborate a little bit more on that, that would be helpful.","Charles W. Moorman","Well, I'll contrast our coal business with our intermodal business, where, attached to every intermodal load, you have things like lifts, you have drayage charges. In many cases, you have a lot of variable cost attached to each load. When you run a unit coal train from point A to point B, you essentially have crew cost and fuel cost. Over the longer term, obviously, Mark -- as Mark described, you can make significant improvements in things like asset ownership, but those take a little bit longer to be reflected through the income statement unless you have something like locomotives to turn -- lease locomotives to turn in immediately. It's just the nature of the business. And as I also mentioned, as I think all of you know, export coal has been an important part of our business and a profitable part of our business for a long period of time. It's more difficult to offset those kinds of costs versus revenue. Mark just handed me a note. We currently, for example, we have about 5,700 coal cars stored. Over the long term, if this decline continues, we'll be buying fewer coal cars. And that reflects itself in depreciation and lower capital expense, but it doesn't show right up -- show up right away in the income statement.","H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And so -- and then as a follow-up, revenue was down about $200 million year-over-year. Operating costs, including fuels, this is admittedly very simplistic. But operating costs are kind of flat to slightly up. And $200 million kind of sounds like a productivity target for a year. I mean, does that suggest that without volume gains, that it could take us up to 3 to 4 quarters to sort of claw our way out of this?","Charles W. Moorman","Well, I think, how quickly it takes to plow our way out of this depends on, a lot on the revenue side, as well as the expense side. But as I mentioned earlier, we've taken action, significant action. We'll continue to take it on the expense side to ensure that we're managing those expenses as well as we can. And I point out that if you look at overall volumes for the quarter, they were down 1% sequentially. So if -- the impact was on the RPU side, as Don outlined, more so than on the volume side, and the volume side really reflects the train operation.","Operator","The next question is from William Greene of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Wick, I wanted to kind of think through the export coal issues, because it seems to me like the fact that coal is kind of weak, is it really much of a surprise? I feel like, for some time, people have looked at the export coal and said, \"Gosh, that's actually quite high.\" And even if we think it's a growth area, we could see a pretty big decline. And of course, the nat gas stuff has been understood for some time on the utility side. So I kind of look at this and say like it seems to me that Norfolk has historically been more agile in adjusting to these things. So did this really just sort of come out as a -- sort of out of left field for you? I just don't quite understand why there wasn't a faster reaction or maybe I'm missing a piece.","Donald W. Seale","Bill, this is Don. A key data point in the quarter, as I mentioned, was that July and August, in our export market, we were up 5% in volume, clearing August, and then we saw September fall by 28%. We have seen, both our met coal and thermal coal position, in Western Europe in particular, with the debt crisis there and the economic recession that they're seeing and the very softening that we're seeing in the Chinese economy, take a big hit on U.S.-origin coal. We've seen several of our met coal mines, over the last 30 to 45 days, shutter operations or cease operations or defer tonnage shipping. And the market is just not there, and September was a big decline for us. So it came rather quickly. All of this came to a head rather quickly.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Then if we sort of switched topics a little bit from coal. I do think, in spite of the coal challenges this year, you were declared revenue adequate. Does that at all change your ability to raise price as you look at the regulatory environment?","Charles W. Moorman","We have been revenue adequate a few times before, and as well as not revenue adequate in some years. We're going to continue to do what we always do, which is price to the market. And I will say, and I think this is an important point, that from the standpoint of customer satisfaction with our service levels, which is an important part in our pricing conversations, I have never seen our customers happier with the level of rail service we're providing. And I go out and meet a lot of customers, obviously, and Don meets more, and they are effusive in their praise for what we're doing right now. That's important. We're going to keep that up. And that will be a component of the pricing equation as well.","Operator","The next question is from Scott Group of Wolfe Trahan.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","So I just want to follow up on that last question, because I'm not sure if the message is that things happened really suddenly in September and we didn't have time to adjust, or that, \"Hey, this is export coal business and the pricing really fell off and there's not much we can do because it's a variable cost model. And until volume and pricing come back, there's not so much that we can do.\"","Charles W. Moorman","There is -- there are elements of both. It is certainly true that the export coal, because it's just one segment of our business, presents issues for us in terms of overall cost reduction, because you cannot go out and take significant cost out of a lot of the network. You take cost out of very isolated parts of the network to react, and that's exactly what we're doing, as Mark outlined. But it is also true, and Don emphasized this and I will emphasize it again, that while as someone pointed out earlier, coal has been soft all year, that comes as no surprise, we saw things happening in September that we, and I think some other folks out in the industry, did not anticipate in any way, shape or form. And it's not we don't have a clear line of sight as to when those conditions improve.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","That's fair, Wick. And if I think about the change didn't happen until September, if we're dealing with a full quarter of these kind of big declines in volume and pricing on the export side, even with some changes that you're doing in the network, could the overall revenue and margin or earnings impact be worse from export coal in fourth quarter and in third quarter?","Charles W. Moorman","That obviously remains to be seen, but -- and we don't predict, but that is certainly one thing that could happen. Don, you might comment on the, not only volume, but the pricing environment right now.","Donald W. Seale","Well, I think, as everybody is aware, we've seen metallurgical coal prices in the world market drop precipitously since last year, from a high of $330 per metric ton to a current range of $160 to $170. That has left U.S. met coal in a soft world market with very little headroom, with respect to marketing its coal in the world market today. We've also seen the thermal market drop in a similar fashion into Western Europe, as the API 2 index is running at about between $90 and $93, which just doesn't leave a lot of room for Central App coal or even Northern App coal to compete in the Western European market. So as those coal prices have dropped, we have seen our position in the market come down, and it has eroded pricing. We've mentioned in the previous quarters that we did not contract for a year this time because of the weak market conditions after April 1. So we have been pricing essentially on a spot basis. And on a spot basis, prices have materially declined, to the point that some U.S. producers just aren't in a position to compete in the world market. So until we can get prices turned around on coal prices worldwide and demand starting to come back up, we're going to see this condition continue. With respect to the question on the fourth quarter, I would just point to the fact that our export volume in the third quarter was down 7%, but I mentioned that our export volume in September was down 28%. And if we have comparable volumes in the fourth quarter, we will see degradation in that revenue level.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay, that's helpful. And just the last thing, just following up on that, Don. You talked about the price of coal, that's down significantly. Can you give us a sense on how much your export rates are down? And then if you're seeing, continuing to see utility coal pricing domestically above inflation or if that's starting to see some pressure?","Donald W. Seale","Well, in terms of our pricing, we had material price improvement last year. We've seen a lot of that reversed this year, in terms of the overall percentage. And I will tell you that it's somewhere, anywhere between 20% and 30%. And on the utility business, most of our utility business, which is about 68%, 69% of our booked coal, continues to be under contract. We have one major contract, utility contract, we're renegotiating for 2013 as we speak. But other than that, our book of business for domestic utilities continues to be under contract. I will tell you though, as the numbers show, when electricity generation rate is down and demand down for electricity and the coal share of electricity generation down from about 45% to about 35%, we've seen material declines year-over-year in utility coal, even though we did see a 10% improvement sequentially from the second quarter to the third quarter. So we are beginning to see utility coal actually start to improve a little bit coming off this summer.","Operator","The next question is from Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Surprisingly, I have a question for you on export coal. The -- I guess, it's probably hard to have much visibility looking very far forward. But Wick and Don, do you think that this is just going to be a -- we should look to the difficult periods that you've had in the past, where our export coal was running at, I don't know what the low was for you guys, it was 12 million or 15 million tons. Do you think it's maybe the case that when we look to 2013, we should just say, all right, it's a difficult timeframe and we ought to take out the earnings from export coal to kind of a historical trough level? Or do you have some kind of scenario that can be a much more optimistic look than that and say, well, maybe there is a really hard hit in second half of 2012, but you see it bounce back at least somewhat in 2013?","Donald W. Seale","This is Don. I think that when we look into our crystal ball, if we have an answer to the European debt crisis and a recovery in that economic scenario in Western Europe, and if we see the stimulus plan in China and in Brazil actually work and we see demand for world metallurgical coal go up as a result of those improvements, I would say that we're probably at a trough level on met coal and we could see met coal start to recover. But as you'll note, I'm giving you a lot of ifs, and I think most of us lack visibility on when those events are going to occur. That's what's going to have to happen to simulate the export met coal market. With respect to steam coal, the cost of production for a lot of steam coal in the U.S., exclusive of Northern App and Illinois basin and PRB, I'm talking about Central App, cost of producing thermal coal and shipping it into the Western European market right now, which is the traditional larger steam coal market, with China and India developing, those prices will have to go up beyond the current API 2 level to allow U.S. coals to compete. Does that get into your question?","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, I think.","Charles W. Moorman","You asked about an optimistic scenario and Don gave it to you, but not only did he give you ifs, he gave you big ifs. So [indiscernible]","Donald W. Seale","Right, right.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, sure. Well, look, it's a lot of moving parts in the export coal market, so it's hard to get your arms around that. One of the other things you mentioned that was a big headwind was this decline in merchandise, the manifest traffic that -- you show some significant operating leverage on that, run shorter trains and so forth. Would -- do you think there's opportunity to rework the train schedule? I mean, you guys have good IT systems and you've historically, I think, shown a good ability to do that. Is that something that if the weakness in metals and construction and paper and so forth continue, that you can kind of rework the train starts and bring that number down and bring the -- maybe bring the headcount number down in fourth quarter? Or is that kind of a tough thing to do?","Mark D. Manion","No, that's absolutely -- that is what we do. And fortunately, we've got the technology and the IT tools these days to do it. So sizing the operating plan and being able to respond to it pretty quickly works in our favor. And when you size that plan down, obviously, that has the effect on reducing crews. It has the effect on -- as you reduce the number of operations, you're reducing the number of locomotives you're operating, you're reducing your fuel spend. And as we do that, we're just really judicious about doing it in a way where we keep the velocity level up, because that in itself has a profound effect on reducing costs.","Charles W. Moorman","The other point I'd make there, too, is -- Mark is exactly right. But in the third quarter, year-over-year, our merchandise volume was only down 1.5%, which to some extent, it limits your ability to go in and make major structural changes in the network without slowing down velocity. And I'd also say that, while we're certainly not particularly buoyant about merchandise prospects, as you heard, we had some things that happened in the third quarter that were a little out of the ordinary in our auto network, we're seeing the frac sand and other related products slow down a little bit. But on the other hand, we're excited about the product, prospects for crude oil. So we're not necessarily thinking that the merchandise network per se is in for any kind of prolonged swoon. And so we've got to make sure that when we make any changes in the merchandise network, we can accommodate volumes that rise.","Operator","The next question is from Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Management, given the possibility of the fiscal cliff, I'm interested to know where do you anticipate the Norfolk franchise could realize the negative impacts if this proceeds unchecked into sort of a bare case outcome?","Charles W. Moorman","Everywhere.","Donald W. Seale","2% off GDP.","Charles W. Moorman","Well, yes, 2% off GDP would be -- we would see that impact, I would think, across almost all of our revenue base there. You can always pick out things that might happen, which would be outliers, but I cannot imagine that we're going to go over that cliff. But I think the impacts on us and everyone else would be profound.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. I guess one other quick one. Some impressive performance in train speed and terminal dwell. I don't think you shared train starts versus car loads or volume. Would you be willing to share train starts?","Charles W. Moorman","Yes. Train starts volume was down about 1%.","Mark D. Manion","1%. And train starts were down...","Charles W. Moorman","And train starts were down about the same.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. They moved in line?","Charles W. Moorman","Yes, yes.","Operator","The next question is from Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Was curious -- when I look at -- I mean, first of all, on the export side, I wanted to clarify something. It sounded like, not only on the met side, but on the thermal, your pricing is spot. And so I'm assuming that, that's all rolling quarterly right now. And then was trying to get a sense of the percent of the utility book that's rolling in 2013 as we think about coal?","Donald W. Seale","Justin, this is Don. On the utility coal, as I mentioned, we have one contract, which is about, maybe in the range of 5% of our utility business that we are addressing. Currently, that won't be completed, though, until January 1, 2013.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And is that it on the utility side for 2013?","Donald W. Seale","That is it.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then I was right on the thermal export, that's also pricing quarterly?","Donald W. Seale","We have started to price quarterly in the fourth quarter. And in the third quarter, we were pricing actually month-to-month.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, I guess, just conceptually thinking about the export coal business here. Obviously, it was a big drag and expected to be for the next few quarters. How do we think about -- you've got this business that's taking pricing down below rail inflation, if you include it in core pricing, but it's obviously economically profitable if you guys are continuing to do it. So when I think about the pricing and volume levers here, how much wiggle room do you guys have on pricing to actually either, a, spur more volumes? Or b, I mean, how bad do the volumes have to get before you find yourself in a situation where you say, \"Look, this just isn't a tenable business. It adds too much volatility to our network and we've got to think about a different way to approach this\"?","Donald W. Seale","Justin, you're making a good point. As the volatility increases, obviously, we continue to pursue this business, because it remains good business. But what we're finding is that we're only a component of the overall supply chain to market U.S. coals into the world market. And we are not the market maker per se. We're a participant in the supply chain, but we can't help stimulate volumes over and above a certain level. So while we would like to handle more volume, we're not -- we don't really have that capability to actually make the market.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right. And so I guess -- so the answer is, is that to the extent that you can't pull pricing, you just won't move the business? I mean, so we -- is that the right way to think about it?","Donald W. Seale","No, really, what I'm saying is that we will handle the business at a certain price if the total cost of -- the landing cost of U.S. coal into a given international market is viable. If it's not viable, then the coal is not sold.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it. And then just lastly, on the domestic intermodal, I was curious in terms of putting into context, you guys talked about those 34 service lanes that are opening up as a result of your terminal initiatives. How do I think about that relative to the size of the network? What is that 34 number as a percentage of service lanes that you guys offer?","Donald W. Seale","I don't have a percentage of the total lanes, Justin, off the top of my head. But I will tell you that these are substantial, significant new long-haul lanes, Memphis to Harrisburg, Memphis to Rutherford, for example, where it will increase our capability for highway conversion. And also, to and from Mexico, to and from the West over Birmingham into the Crescent Corridor, back up to Greencastle as well as Harrisburg. So I don't have a percentage to give you of the total, but it's an appreciable step forward in terms of our capability.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And just last one, following up on your comments on the export coal side. I mean, obviously, a little intriguing in that you obviously don't have the control in terms of how the pricing lever completely affects the demand for the absolute product. But you have more influence on the domestic utility side. As you guys look out at this year, I mean, is that something in the face of, obviously, continued low nat gas prices, that you consider? Or I mean, is that still a business where the absolute ultimatum is we need to continue to take pricing up?","Donald W. Seale","Justin, at this point, we have contracts in place with current prices, and we price to the market. And at the time that those contracts change, we will be looking at the market that is in place at that time. So it's not our intent to discount pricing for domestic utility coal.","Operator","The next question is from Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just first question here is for Mark. You mentioned -- you gave us the stats on the amount of furloughed workers and cars stored and so on. You mentioned that was mostly coal. Can you give us a sense of just how much of that, are we talking 50% or 60%? How much of all the furloughed stuff and storage that you've done is actually specifically coal-related?","Mark D. Manion","Yes, with regard to the furloughs, nearly all of those people are in the coal lanes. And that's the area where the business has changed enough that it's apparent that those people are not coming back to work any time soon. So we have done a more permanent thing, which is furlough those people. Now if you look across the rest of the system, the volumes just aren't down that badly. And where they are down, forecast may be that we'll see them coming back up within the next several months. So we've got another several hundred people out there right now that we have applied, what we call a guarantee to, a minimum guarantee. And this is similar to what the other railroads have done. We're just using a bit different model for it, where we're using these guaranteed extra boards to give them some level of compensation and keep them out there and avoid furloughing at this point. And if the volumes drop off to the point where we need to, we can always furlough those people. But right now, it is in our best interest to keep those people available. As you know, when you furlough people, you run the risk of those people leaving the railroad, then you're back into a cycle where you have to hire, you have to train, you run the risk of not having the people available when you need them. So that's the tack we're taking at this point.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Sure, it makes sense. And just curious, I know last time -- I know it's never easy to furlough anyone, but during the last cycle, the depth of the recession that we were in, I think made it more of an easy argument to make. Do you have any impediments right now, union or otherwise, that make it more difficult to furlough someone in this current environment compared to say, '08, '09?","Mark D. Manion","No, we do not.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Just a second question here now for Don. Outside of the coal market, when you look at perhaps your 2 -- if you could just characterize going in 2013 just roughly and broadly here, your 2 best segments going into 2013 and your 2 worst segments outside of the coal, how would you characterize those?","Donald W. Seale","Well, certainly, 2 of the best or 2 or 3 of the best, domestic intermodal and also international intermodal continues to grow, ex the Maersk comp. So they were both up 11% in the quarter if we take out Maersk and set it aside. So that looks good. Automotive production and sales continues to look positive. And we expect our franchise, we serve 26 assembly plants, we expect that franchise to produce growth. The metals and construction area, while we're seeing headwinds right now in the frac sand area, which was down 23%, as I mentioned in the third quarter, we've got a great steel franchise. And if automotive does well, as we think it will, we think the steel side of that business will do well.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And just to interrupt you for a moment, you don't see tough comps as playing in on your intermodal or auto business at all?","Donald W. Seale","Well, the tough comps, as I mentioned, we -- instead of being up 18% in autos, we will be up maybe single-digit, mid-single-digit to low double-digit, but the comps are getting tougher on automotive. There's no doubt about that, as we lap it. But we expect that to be positive. And then we mentioned in chemicals, natural gas prices are low. It is reenergizing our domestic chemical industry. So we think plastics will be fine. And also, the crude oil segment that we mentioned is ramping up at a fairly significant rate, and that should be okay. On the paper and forest product side, it's going to be mixed. Lumber up a little bit from a small base. Our paper traffic will continue to be fairly soft. And then the agricultural market, with the poor crop, both on corn and soybeans, it's going to be a very difficult market for that until the new crop comes in, in September of 2013.","Operator","The next question is from Jason Seidl of Dahlman Rose.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","If I can touch on the intermodal a little bit. I mean, it looks like if you remove the Maersk business, over 80% of your business is growing double digits. And if I'm reading sort of your commentary right on Triple Crown, it seems like you just got some retooling automotive plants and some soft retail, but retail seems to be picking up a bit. As we approach 2013, how should we think about sort of the growth in intermodal? Do you think high-single digits is, is that out of the question considering what we're seeing this year and also that you're lapping Maersk?","Donald W. Seale","Jason, I would say that the high-single digits would be a meaningful, realistic number.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. Guys, also looking at your utility contracts, now you said you only had really one that's coming up. Is there an ability to do something with price, maybe even revisit other contracts, for sort of potentially like guaranteed volumes? Is that something that's possible? Is it something that you guys at NSC have thought about?","Donald W. Seale","Well, we certainly have thought about that, and we're constantly talking to our utilities, who as you know, pay the transportation price for coal, for the delivery of coal. And we're exploring all options that we feel is -- that are realistic, that would actually stimulate the market. I think until we see economic activity pick up and improve domestically and see that demand for electricity, through improved housing and economic activity, we're not certain that we can stimulate a market that is weak to start with. And also, we're seeing natural gas prices continue to firm up in October sales. They're $3.50 per million BTU, and on the futures market, closer to $4 per million BTU. And if the rig counts, the drill rig counts continue to fall, as they have been for dry gas production in our shale gas fields, we're going to work down eventually the excess storage of gas and we'll see prices firm up even more.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Now you mentioned the firming of natural gas prices. Does that sort of curtail, sort of the rebound of the domestic chemicals market?","Donald W. Seale","Not on the crude oil side. The crude oil is where -- that's independent of natural gas. We think, as Wick mentioned, that's a longer-term growth play for rail transportation. We will be the pipeline for Bakken and, to a lesser extent, possibly Alberta crude oil coming back into the mid-Atlantic refineries. With respect to natural gas chemical feedstocks, if natural gas is at $5, coal dispatches fully. But yet, our chemical industry has a lower cost feedstock than they have had for the past decade.","Charles W. Moorman","Yes, I think that Don is exactly right. When you talk to the folks in the chemical business, as compared to where they were 5 or 6 years ago, when they were talking about closing plants and moving offshore, they were worried a lot about price, but they were also worried about supply, and in particular, the variability of the price. If we reach what most of the people we talk to believe we're going to reach, which is a very stable and ample supply of gas that trades in the $4 to $6 range, I think the chemical producers, the plastics people and folks like that are going to be -- continue to be very bullish on producing product in North America.","Operator","The next question is from Matt Troy of Susquehanna.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Instead of focusing on all the variables, which are essentially unknowable in the next year, I'd like to kind of drill down on some of the more academic things which can be forecast with some reliability. Specifically RCAF, if you just do the math on RCAF, obviously, the hurdle for rail inflation has come in by a lot of calculations cut in almost half. I'm just curious, as a percentage of your book of business, whether we're using RCAF, RCAF ex fuel, directly embedded in a contract or agreement or indirectly as kind of the look on inflation when you talk to customers. How much of your book of business is tied to that metric as the measure of rail inflation against which you price?","Donald W. Seale","Matt, this is Don. In our book of business, we have moved away significantly from RCAF as an escalator in our contracts. Most of our contracts today have all-inclusive less fuel.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Right. That's what I'm talking about.","Donald W. Seale","Yes. So RCAF is de minimis with respect to our escalator application. With respect to cost of rail inflation, as you know, if you look at RCAF this year, in fact, if you look at it this quarter, it's actually down about 1.9%. And then the all-inclusive less fuel escalator is about 2%. So the cost of rail inflation, we're looking at that in the range of 2% currently.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And when I say RCAF, that's just the CliffsNotes version for the all-inclusive ex fuel. I'm asking how much of the contract base is tied to that metric? I know RCAF, the legacy anachronistic metric is -- has been faded out. But in terms of that modified metric that emerged 5, 6 years ago, roughly, is it 1\/3, is it 1\/4, is it 1\/2? Just can you help me understand directionally where the look is?","Donald W. Seale","Yes, here's a couple of data points, Matt, that hopefully will help answer that question. About 70% of our revenue moves under contracts. And we have a mix of escalators in those contracts, some of which are fixed percentage. Then the balance would have the all-inclusive less fuel. Roughly in terms of the percentage, I cannot give that to you off the top of my head. But we've got those -- we've got a distribution of those 2 types of escalators, all-inclusive less fuel and then a series of fixed escalators with a fixed percentage increase.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, maybe I can follow up and triangulate. I guess my follow-up question would be simply the -- you've seen weakness in the truckload market, at least sequential softening in the truckload market, pretty much since midsummer. My understanding is most of the intermodal business is priced on a wholesale basis. It's not very sensitive, week to week or even month to month, to truckload spot pricing, or the majority of it anyway. Have you seen that decline in spot rate pricing that we've seen in the recent months at all chew into the intermodal pricing you've enjoyed in the market or even the discussions? Or are we really talking apples to oranges and it would take a much longer or sustained decline in truckload pricing to really impact that? That's all I got today.","Donald W. Seale","Matt, it's the latter. I think spot pricing has not -- in trucking, has not chewed into intermodal pricing at this point. In fact, over the road, truckload prices are still up for the year, up in the third quarter. What we're seeing is fuel impacts within our intermodal RPU for the quarter. But truckload pricing has continued to be positive throughout the year. Spot, some spot pricing is not positive. But it hasn't had the effect of eroding intermodal prices.","Operator","The next question is from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to ask, Don, on coal RPU, with export mix, I think you're saying that we're going to see the mix come off even more here in the fourth quarter. Does that mean that RPU sequentially is going to be challenged in the fourth quarter?","Donald W. Seale","Yes.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And I think this is where a lot of people are getting hung up. Maybe we've just miscalibrated on how much incremental contribution that export traffic carries. Is there any way you can help us understand domestic pricing versus export pricing and the differential between them?","Donald W. Seale","That is something that is contained in confidential contracts with our customers. And because of that, we just can't get into differentials of price in export met coal versus export thermal coal versus domestic utility coal or even domestic met coal.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","But I guess with coal only being down about 1% sequentially on a tonnage basis, there's quite a large differential in the export market then. Is that correct?","Donald W. Seale","There is a differential in the export market, but there's also mix effects that are reflected sequentially from the second quarter to the third quarter. 2.5 million tons less export coal from the second quarter to the third quarter. 2.5 million tons of export coal, which is longer haul, higher RPU and a good margin associated with it. Also, an increase in the third quarter, versus the second quarter sequentially, of shorter haul coal moving to the river for export out of the Illinois Basin, as well as some Central App export in domestic coal going to the river, domestic met.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And just a point of clarification. It sounded like you said domestic volumes could actually be improving sequentially, but obviously, down year-on-year. Is that the right read?","Donald W. Seale","The utility volume, sequentially from the second quarter to the third quarter, improved by about 2 million tons or 10%. We had a hot summer. We saw our coal at our utility plants come down to about 34 days of inventory versus 38 days previously. So we've seen some small uptick in utility coal sequentially, second quarter to third quarter.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","But do you expect that run rate to continue now or is there going to be incremental pressure looking ahead?","Donald W. Seale","I think if we see a normalized winter, which is a very hard thing, obviously, to forecast. But if we see winter weather that is unlike last year, we'll see some demand on utility coal and we'll see, most likely, natural gas prices continue to rise as well.","Operator","The next question is from Anthony Gallo of Wells Fargo.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of questions, if I can, and one in particular on housekeeping. I thought you said that most of the volume decline in the quarter happened in September, and September run rate might be a good proxy for the fourth quarter. Are you talking about overall carloads for September on a monthly basis representing what we could see in the fourth quarter? Because by my math, that would be a sequential decline of 8% to 9%. Is that what I heard, or am I mishearing that?","Donald W. Seale","What -- this is Don. What we were talking about was on coal, September certainly will be reflective, September volumes will be reflective of our fourth quarter expectations. With respect to the merchandise traffic, we do expect our auto traffic to come back up off the retooling effect that we had in the third quarter. And I will tell you the retooling effect was somewhere in the range of 5,000 cars.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. But it was primarily coal from a run rate that we were [indiscernible]","Donald W. Seale","Correct.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then a somewhat unrelated coal question. If I look at export coal tonnage this quarter versus the third quarter of 2010, it's up about 19%. Coal revenue in those comparable periods is about the same, but operating margin is about 300 basis points lower. So it's not just export coal, it has to be the other issues that you mentioned with respect to merchandise and maybe intermodal. Am I drawing the wrong conclusions?","Donald W. Seale","You're referring to the third quarter year-over-year or third quarter compared to previous years?","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes, so third quarter 2012 export tonnage versus third quarter of 2010. You're actually up about 19% over those 2 periods. Coal revenue in those 2 periods is about the same, $701 million versus $709 million, and yet you had about 300 basis points better margin in the third quarter of '10.","Donald W. Seale","Well, I think you have to put '11 in the middle of that. In our third quarter 2011, our coal revenues were up $190 million. And as we just discussed, our third quarter 2012 coal revenue numbers are down $198 million, with a 14% volume decline and also degradation in margins with respect to export pricing.","Charles W. Moorman","When you say margin, are you talking about -- you're not talking about coal margin, you're talking about operating ratio?","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes, correct.","Charles W. Moorman","We'd have to go back, look at the analysis. We'd have to understand the fuel impacts and...","Donald W. Seale","And mix.","Charles W. Moorman","And mix impacts to kind of have a better informed view of that. But we'll follow up on it.","Operator","The next question is from Kevin Crissey of UBS.","Kevin Crissey - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Your fuel surcharge program versus others, can you talk about why it shows more volatility and your thoughts on Q4 potential impact?","Charles W. Moorman","Well, we have a fuel surcharge program. It has a certain amount of volatility baked in. I will tell you, we don't really have any understanding at all of anyone else's fuel surcharge program. So I don't know that I can give you a comment on why theirs might be less volatile or more volatile or whatever the case is than ours.","Kevin Crissey - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And how about Q4. Your thoughts if things were to stay the way they are today?","Charles W. Moorman","Q4 on the fuel surcharge volume?","Kevin Crissey - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Sure, yes, on a year-over-year -- it was a headwind to you pretty significantly in Q3, and how would it look in Q4. You should get some of that back, I would imagine, right?","Charles W. Moorman","John?","John P. Rathbone","Yes, we should, on the fuel -- you're talking about the fuel lag?","Kevin Crissey - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Correct.","John P. Rathbone","That assumes -- let's assume a $90. No, it's lower than that today. We would expect probably a favorable lag of $10 million to $20 million, something in that range. Now granted, listen, if I say that, you got to remember that this is projecting it from right now and this changes. But that's making some assumptions about what the price is going to be.","Operator","The next question is from Jeff Kauffman of Sterne Agee.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just a clarification. You said earlier, that your export coal volume was down 28% year-over-year in September. Just trying to get a sense for what the progression through the quarter was? What was July and August? Did you provide that?","Donald W. Seale","We were up 5% in July and August combined, and then we were down 28% in September, for a decline of 7% for the quarter.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then in response to a question, I think you said that the coal, the September coal volumes, will be reflective of your overall 4Q coal volumes. Did I hear that right? Is that overall or just export?","Donald W. Seale","No, I think the September volumes that we're talking about for coal will be reflected in our fourth quarter coal, total coal volumes.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Right. What was total coal volume down in September, if you don't mind?","Donald W. Seale","I don't have that here in front of me, but let me see if I can get it. It was down 15%.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Down 15%. And then just one other question. On the -- if I look at your overall decline in revenue per carload in coal of 9.3%, if I try to isolate the utility coal -- or rather, I'm sorry, the export coal pricing there, the export coal pricing weakness, how many percentage points of that 9.3% is attributable to the export coal weakness?","Donald W. Seale","We don't break it out that way for the coal.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just -- I guess, if I ask you a different way, what was your, I guess, pricing down on a year-over-year basis, pure pricing, in your export coal?","Donald W. Seale","Again, we don't divulge that type of information in our calls.","Operator","The next question is from David Vernon of AllianceBernstein.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just to clarify, Don, in response to an earlier question, I think you had said that the rate on exports was down 20% to 30%. Did I hear that right, or was that not right?","Donald W. Seale","I was saying that, that could be a range, depending on what type of traffic we're talking about.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Yes, I understand the sensitivity here. I'm not pushing you on it. I just wanted to -- would that be a year-over-year range or a sequential range?","Donald W. Seale","Year-over-year.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Fantastic. And then for RG Steel, with that bankruptcy, how much volume will come out of the domestic met market with that?","Donald W. Seale","RG Steel, in combination, and we had iron ore, domestic met coal and metals, and for the third quarter of 2011, it represented 10,000 carloads. We will be facing that negative comp until the second quarter of 2013, not at 10,000 cars, because the run rate didn't average that in every quarter, but the third quarter 2011 was 10,000 loads.","Operator","The next question is from Wilson Chen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Wilson Chen","I think most of my questions have been answered. But if I could get a sense for where utilities stockpiles are among, I guess, your customers in your network, so we could get a sense for if there is some sequential strength, in kind of utility volumes, how -- where can they go in terms of the magnitude?","Donald W. Seale","The utilities that report to us, share with us their stockpile information. Their inventories are currently at 34 days in their stockpile, 34 days of burn, based on the burn capacity of their plants.","Wilson Chen","And how many days above normal would that typically be if you were to look at it on a normalized basis?","Donald W. Seale","The 34 days is a composite. So we have some plants that would be above norm in inventory, and some that are at target and some slightly below target. So the 34 is an overall average. I will tell you that that's come down from 38 days as recently as the second quarter. So I would term the 34 days in our utility network as being slightly above target, but not appreciably above target.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, the question-and-answer session has concluded. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Charles W. Moorman","Thanks for your patience, everyone, and your questions.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce Michael Hostutler, Norfolk Southern Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. Mr. Michael Hostutler, you may begin.","Michael Hostutler ","Thanks, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin today's call, I would like to mention a few items. First, the slides of the presenters are available on our website at nscorp.com in the Investors section. Additionally, transcripts and MP3 downloads of today's call will be posted on our website for your convenience.","Please be advised that any forward-looking statements made during the course of the call represent our best good-faith judgment as to what may occur in the future.

Additionally, keep in mind that all references to reported results, excluding certain adjustments, that is non-GAAP numbers, have been reconciled on our website in the Investors section.","Now, it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern Chairman and CEO, Wick Moorman.","Charles W. Moorman","Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. It's also my pleasure to welcome you to our third quarter 2013 earnings call. With me today are several members of our senior team, including Jim Squires, our President; Don Seale, our Chief Marketing Officer; Mark Manion, our Chief Operating Officer; John Rathbone, our Chief Financial Officer; and Marta Stewart, who will take over as CFO upon John's retirement on November 1. As per usual, Don, Mark and John will provide commentary in their respective areas, and then will be available for your questions.","Norfolk Southern's earnings for the quarter were $1.53 per share, an increase of 23% compared with last year. These strong results were led by growth in our merchandise and Intermodal businesses, combined with ongoing productivity improvements, and despite continuing weakness in the coal market.","Looking at our top line, revenues for the quarter were $2.8 billion, an increase of $131 million or 5%. Merchandise and Intermodal revenues rose $153 million and $38 million, respectively, while coal revenues declined by $60 million compared with last year. These results are, obviously, a continuation of the significant changes that we have been experiencing in the markets we serve, and I am proud of how our team continues to respond.","Through coordinated efforts between marketing and operations, we have been able to handle the growing merchandise volumes with fewer crew starts, thereby enhancing the strong operating leverage in our merchandise network. We achieved similar efficiencies in our Intermodal and coal networks with reduced crew starts, as Mark will show you.","Importantly, all of these efficiencies were achieved while maintaining strong service. In fact, this quarter represents the fifth consecutive quarter in which we have posted a service composite metric at 83% or better. Don will give you all of the revenue details and then Mark will discuss the execution of our operating plan.","On the expense side, the continued focus on productivity kept our costs in check. And railway operating expenses rose only 1% on the 4% increase in volume, resulting in an operating ratio of 69.9%. And John will review the financial results in detail with you in a few minutes.","Now, at this point, I'll turn the program over to Don and the rest of the team, and then I'll return with some closing remarks before we answer your questions. Don?","Donald W. Seale","Thank you, Wick, and good morning to everyone. During the third quarter, strong merchandise and Intermodal gains more than offset continuing declines in coal revenue to generate $2.8 billion in total revenue, up $131 million, or 5%, compared to third quarter of 2012. Merchandise increased by $153 million, or 11%, and Intermodal had a quarterly revenue record of $605 million, which was up $38 million, or 7%, over last year.","Our coal markets continue to be impacted by weaker market conditions, leading to a decline of $60 million in revenue, which was 9% below the third quarter of 2012. With respect to revenue variance for the quarter, total revenue increased by $131 million, primarily driven by 4% higher volume, coupled with increased revenue per unit in the merchandise and Intermodal sectors, which offset negative mix associated with higher intermodal shipments and lower coal volumes.","As shown on the next slide, revenue per unit for the quarter was up $12, or 1%, versus third quarter of last year. During the quarter, all of our merchandise commodities achieved yield growth with an average of $109 per unit increase, or 4%, led by Metals & Construction, which was up 9%; followed by Agriculture, which was up 4%; and Automotive, up 3%. Coal revenue per unit declined $129, or 6% year-over-year, due to pricing pressure in the export market and mix changes in our utility network.","Now turning to total volume for the quarter, shipments increased by 4% due to gains in Intermodal and merchandise, which offset a 2% decline in coal volume. Intermodal volume was up 5%, driven by strong Domestic market and road-to-rail conversions, while merchandise volume increased in all markets except Agriculture, which declined 3% due to the poor 2012 grain crop. As noted here, our Chemicals volume was up 14%; followed by Metals & Construction traffic, up 9%; Automotive, up 9%; and paper, up 4%.","Drilling down to our individual market segments on the next slide, starting with coal. Coal revenue was $641 million, down 9% or $60 million, compared to third quarter 2012. Continued weak demand across the domestic met and industrial sectors, pricing pressure in the export coal sector and negative mix and reduced demand in the utility sector, all contributed to this quarterly decline.","Stagnant economic conditions in Europe and excess coal supply in the global market continues to impact the U.S. seaboard market for both thermal and metallurgical coal. And the weaker Australian dollar, now down 11% against the U.S. dollar since January, has driven increased Australian coal production and exports.","Despite these headwinds, we continue to partner with our coal producers, which helped us generate a 3% increase in export volume in the quarter. In our utility markets continuing competition from natural gas, excess stockpiles at southern utilities and reduced demand for electricity, which was down 4% in our service region during the quarter, resulted in a 2% reduction in utility coal volume. And both domestic met and industrial coal shipments were off 8% and 5%, respectively, as soft demand and excess inventories impacted both market segments.","In our Intermodal business, revenue in the quarter reached an all-time high of $605 million, up $38 million, or 7% over third quarter of 2012, driven by 5% higher volume and a 2% increase in revenue per unit.","As depicted on Slide 6, the volume gains in Intermodal came from both our domestic and international markets. Domestic volume was up 7% due to continued highway conversions, while organic growth across our international accounts boosted international volume by 2%.","Much of our volume increase occurred over our expanded and enhanced Intermodal corridors. For example, the Heartland Corridor continues to generate double-digit growth, up 19% in the quarter, again reflecting the efficiency and productivity of double-stack service into the Ohio Valley and points beyond. And as you can see on this slide, our Crescent, Pan Am Southern and Meridian Speedway lanes continue to generate solid growth as well.","Concluding our review of third quarter growth drivers with our merchandise results, our merchandise services generated quarterly revenue of $1.6 billion, up 11%, with broad gains across all market groups with the exception of Agriculture, which was impacted by lower corn and soybean shipments.","In our Metals & Construction business, which was up 9%, higher volume was driven by increases in new aggregates business and new terminals for sand and gravel, as well as miscellaneous construction materials.","Crude oil continue to drive our growth in the Chemical sector during the quarter with an 11,000-car increase over third quarter 2012, but was down 2,000 carloads, sequentially, due primarily to maintenance at a major refinery. Increased shipments of natural gas liquids, plastics and industrial intermediates also boosted growth in this group.","Our Automotive volumes were up 9%, almost double the projected North American vehicle production for the quarter, as a result of new business and increased production at NS-served plants. And the rebound in the housing and consumer products markets helped us increase both lumber and pulpboard volumes by 7%, which partially offset a 13% decline in graphic paper.","Now concluding with our outlook, we see ongoing growth opportunity in Intermodal and merchandise, while the coal market continues to face pricing mix and global oversupply challenges. In this regard, thermal coal in Europe continues to be challenged, as the API 2 index continues to hover in the low $80 per ton range. This is a price point at which U.S. producers are generally at a clear cost disadvantage.","With respect to domestic met and met coal exports, both face excess supply challenges. And in the export sector, the weaker Australian dollar and the possible repeal of the Australian carbon tax could place added pressure on U.S. suppliers.","Finally, sluggish electricity demand and excess stockpiles in the South, coupled with pressure from natural gas, will challenge volumes into our utility plants. On the upside, our outlook for Intermodal remains bright, as we complete new facilities and launch new services, such as the South Carolina Inland Port project at Greer, South Carolina, which will convert highway shipments from the port of Charleston to Greer for BMW and other customers. This new service begins this quarter and represents our latest road-to-rail conversion initiative.","Highway conversion and international growth both represent continued opportunity ahead for our Intermodal network. And we will remain laser-focused on delivering superior Intermodal service, more productively and more efficiently, across our double-stack network.","Wrapping up with our merchandise markets, we continue to see growth ahead in crude by rail, as well as plastics and shale-related liquid petroleum gases. And frac sand shipments, into the shale production region, should increase as hydraulic fracturing technology evolves and requires higher volumes of sand.","In our Metals markets, domestic steel production is projected to expand by 4% during 2014. Automotive production will also continue to see solid growth as North American vehicle production is projected to increase 6% in the fourth quarter and 3% next year.","In Agriculture, the larger corn crop this year will change sourcing from the drought-driven patterns, where corn was being sourced in Iowa and Nebraska moving to our Midwest processors. Reverting back to traditional patterns of shorter-haul shuttle trains from online elevators located in Illinois, Indiana and Ohio. We also expect more export grain shipments as a result of this robust harvest. And lastly, our Paper and Lumber market should continue to rise with the housing market, offsetting weaknesses in graphic and printing paper.","Now, I'll summarize. We expect our merchandise and Intermodal markets to generate overall volume and revenue growth ahead despite continuing headwinds in the coal sector. With respect to yield management, we remain committed to providing strong service to our customers that supports our ability to price to the market at levels that equal or exceed the rate of rail inflation. However, the negative mix effect of lower coal volumes and higher intermodal shipments will continue to be seen in overall revenue per unit trends.","Thanks for your attention, and I'll now turn it over to Mark for our operations report. Mark?","Mark D. Manion","Thank you, Don. Starting with safety. For the first 9 months of the year, our personal injury performance stands at 1.08. While we've seen an increase in our safety ratio, we're confident we're doing the right things to reduce injuries in our workplace. Our workforce is more engaged than ever before in safety. This is a direct result of our continuing implementation of behavior-based safety training and processes.","Our operations management team has concluded their training, and our 24,000-person workforce will conclude training by year end. While implementing behavior-based safety training, we do closely monitor our serious injuries, and they have not increased year-over-year.","Looking at our train incidents, you see a pretty good trend with a slight uptick this year in incidents related to switching and storm-related occurrences. Train incidents after 9 months is at 2.3 per million train miles. Crossing accidents for the first 9 months is down slightly from the prior year at 3.5 per million train miles.","Moving on to service performance. Our composite service metric remains at a very high level and continues to show year-over-year improvement. For the third quarter, composite performance stands at 83.6%. Consistent with recent performance, the gain was led by improvements in train performance. Consistently high service performance drives network velocity and improves the efficiency of our operation, primarily through improved asset and resource utilization.","Turning to the next slide. Train speed, a primary component of network velocity, continues at high levels, consistent with the performance we've seen for a number of consecutive quarters.","And moving on to Terminal Dwell, the other major component of network velocity, we continue to see quarter-over-quarter improvements. In the third quarter, average Terminal Dwell was 21.2 hours, a modest improvement over the third quarter last year.","Moving to the next slide. We've provided a comparison of changes in volume by business type and the corresponding change in crew starts. As this shows, we're seeing consistent improvements in operating efficiencies across all business areas.","In general merchandise, we saw a 6% increase in volume, with a 2% reduction in crew starts. While volumes in Intermodal increased 5% for the quarter, we managed a 2% reduction in crew starts. This was due in part to a 4 percentage point improvement over 2012 to reach 95% of all containers moving in double-stack service. The improvement in loading efficiency allows trains to carry a higher volume with reduced crew starts. Similarly, coal volume was down 2%; the crew starts were reduced 8%. Overall volumes grew 4%, while total crew starts were reduced 3%.","As you can see on the next slide, these improvements are not limited to crew starts. Higher network velocity, along with other productivity initiatives, continue to drive operating improvements in a number of areas. Against the volume increase of 4% in the third quarter and concurrent with the crew start reductions that you saw in the previous slide, we also reduced T&E overtime hours by 11%, and saw a re-crew reduction of 12% over the same period last year.","Velocity-driven equipment rents were essentially flat, increasing less than 1%, with high velocity levels now sustained for 7 quarters. And taking advantage of existing train capacity, carloads per locomotive have improved 7%. We continue to make improvements in fuel efficiency, with gross ton-miles per gallon improving 2% over the same period last year.","Taking these trends back even further, on the next slide, you can see that these are sustained improving trends in operating efficiency. The 2 graphs across the top show the longer-term declining trends in crew starts and re-crews against an increasing volume trend, down 6% and 51%, respectively, from their peak in the first quarter of 2011. On the bottom left, the reduction in T&E overtime hours, down 40% from the peak in the first quarter of 2011. And on the bottom right, the increase in units per locomotive, up 17% since first quarter 2011.","These and other productivity improvements have come about through improved network velocity, technology applications, strategic investments in infrastructure, better use of existing train capacity through improved network planning and a number of individual projects implemented by employee teams across our network. We expect to see ongoing benefits, and are on target to exceed our $100 million in productivity gains this year alone. And these and other initiatives will continue to drive further productivity gains as we move into next year.","Thank you. And now, I'll turn it over to you, John.","John P. Rathbone","Thank you, Mark. I'll now review our financial results for the third quarter. Starting with our operating results, as Tom described, revenues for the quarter totaled $2.8 billion, up $131 million, or 5%, as merchandise gains and Intermodal volume growth outpaced coal declines. For the quarter, railway operating expenses increased $13 million, or 1%, a rate well below our 4% growth in volume. Income from railway operations totaled $849 million, up $118 million, or 16%. And our operating ratio improved 300 basis points to 69.9%.","Turning to our expenses, the next slide shows the major components of the $13 million increase. Now let's take a closer look at each of these changes by expense category.","Purchased services and rents increased $17 million, or 4%, largely reflecting increased volume-related activities. These increases were partially offset by lower roadway repair cost. Fuel expenses increased $11 million, due largely to slightly higher diesel fuel consumption.","Turning to compensation and benefits expenses. Performance-based compensation and pay rate headwinds were partly offset by productivity improvements and lower payroll taxes. Recall, our compensation is performance-based. Last year included a favorable variance of $19 million for incentive and stock-based compensation.","Materials and others decreased $26 million, or 12%, driven by favorable personal injury claims development and reduced materials and supplies, and was partially offset by higher environmental expenses. Third quarter's personal injury costs were $18 million favorable compared to last year.","As I mentioned last quarter, our casualty and other expenses could face moderate headwinds in the fourth quarter, as last year's results included a $17 million reduction in personal injury-related expenses.","Turning to our nonoperating items. Other income is down $3 million, or 9%, due largely to lower coal royalties driven by lower coal production. Interest expense on debt was up $7 million, primarily due to new debt issuances, including $500 million issued in August of this year and $600 million issued last year in September.","Income before income taxes increased $108 million, or 17%, primarily due to higher operating income. Income taxes totaled $266 million. And the effective tax rate was 35.6%, compared to 37.2% in 2012. The decrease was largely related to an $8 million benefit from state tax law changes enacted in the third quarter of 2013, as well as tax credits from legislation enacted at the beginning of this year. We expect our effective tax rate for the full year to approximate 36%.","Net income from the quarter was $482 million, an increase of $80 million, or 20%, compared to 2012. Diluted earnings per share were $1.53, up $0.29 per share or 23% compared to last year. Overall, a very solid quarter.","As shown on the next slide, cash from operation covered capital spending and produced $934 million in free cash flow. In the first 9 months of 2013, we distributed $476 million in dividends and repurchased $564 million in shares, $250 million of that activity was in the third quarter.","In total, we have repurchased 7.5 million shares this year, approximately $3.3 million in the third quarter. Share repurchases and proceeds from borrowings were both lower compared to the same period last year.","Our balance sheet is strong and we remain -- paying full confidence in our ability to generate liquidity through free cash flow and access the debt markets.","Thank you for your attention. I'll now turn the program back to Wick.","Charles W. Moorman","Thank you, John. Well, as you've heard, we had a very good third quarter in terms of operating performance and bottom-line results. As I've said at the outset, we, along with the rest of the industry, are in a period of significant transition with respect to our market as our traditional coal business continues to be challenged; while merchandise, including new energy-related businesses, and Intermodal continues to expand.","To underscore the magnitude of that transition, if you look at our results this quarter, as compared to the third quarter of 2011, 2 years ago, our coal revenues are down almost $260 million, and yet our total revenues are down only some $65 million. To make up for the loss of so much revenue and operating income in what is one of our most profitable business segments, we have remained intent on a strategy of growing volume and pricing in our other markets, coupled with driving productivity and velocity in our operations.","While the changes in our markets are far from complete, our 2013 third quarter results, including our operating ratio, are a clear indication that we are on the right strategic path, and we will continue to focus on execution of all aspects of our plan.","The keys to our success remain the people of Norfolk Southern, they're the best in the business, and I'm confident in their ability to continue to drive even better results for our customers and our shareholders.","And speaking of people, let me close by both personally and on behalf of all of the Norfolk Southern team, thanking John Rathbone for all of his years of service to our company. John has served 32 years with NS and he has been a terrific employee and corporate officer, as well as a great friend to all of us. John, thanks. And on behalf of all of us, will you please just stop smiling so much.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to the operator to field your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt Troy with Susquehanna International.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I had a question on pricing specifically. We watched the rails narrative on pricing go from market-based to inflation plus to now, you've said, equal or exceed rail inflation. I'm just curious, in what instances do you decide that equaling rail inflation is an okay hurdle or bogey to set? I'm just trying to understand the criteria. Is it business where the margins are at acceptable level to go forward? Or how do you just make that decision as you're parsing new business bids and deciding what is rail inflation plus versus what is rail inflation equal?","Donald W. Seale","Good morning, Matt, this is Don. First up, I'd emphasize that we have reiterated in past calls that our own going goal is to equal or exceed rail inflation. And also, we have not veered off of our strategy of pricing to the market. That is what drives our pricing, it is market-based. But with that said, we look at rail inflation ahead. And for -- next year, for example, the RCAF unadjusted is likely to come in slightly higher than 1%, and the all-inclusive less fuel is likely to come in around 2%, and our pricing targets are above both of those.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Got it. So no change, essentially, is what I'm hearing. I guess the second question or follow-up would be related to pricing. It's certainly been chatter, some real, some manufactured, in the market about intermodal pricing behavior. Just wanted you, again, to reiterate or frame your views there, that you continue to price that business for acceptable margin level. But essentially, what are the hurdles or the metrics when you're pricing new Intermodal business on an organic basis, versus highway and versus maybe competitive wins? What do you need to see or what is the discipline you have that we know that the margins in that business, x operational improvement, should hold the line or get better over time?","Donald W. Seale","In fact intermodal continues to be a competitive market, and we're competing with the highway predominantly. We were pleased with the 2% improvement in revenue per unit we saw in Intermodal in this quarter. We will continue to price in a marketplace where we can be competitive, generate a sufficient margin for reinvestment in our assets and our network, and continue to provide the type of service that our customers expect.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I wanted to ask about fuel during the quarter and if there was any lag impact benefit or negative?","John P. Rathbone","The net -- there was a $41 million negative lag impact for the quarter. That compares with last year's quarter of $21 million lag impact.","Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, so it's a year-over-year negative of about $20 million?","John P. Rathbone","Right. Correct.","Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then just following up on the casualty line, it looked a little bit low relative to what we were modeling. What's a good run rate to use for that category going forward?","John P. Rathbone","I would say what you should model in on that -- and because of that, that line does have some variability associated with our actuarial studies, and it's one that's difficult to get a -- because of all the safety improvements that we've had, we have a lot of benefits associated with that. I'd say, if you look at about $35 million run rate on that, plus or minus, that should give you a good handle on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Don, I think in the past, maybe on the last call, you talked a little bit about coal RPU slowing sequentially, so I guess a sequential decline. But it actually went up. Can you tell us, was there anything with liquidated damages or anything in there that made that unusual? Or was it just all mix?","Donald W. Seale","Bill, it was mix related. We had no material or liquidated damages amounts in the quarter. It's a reflection of increased export shipments over the Port of Norfolk. We had a decline in export shipments over the Port of Baltimore. We had increased shipments of northern utility coal and decreases in the south. So that's, in a nutshell, the mix effects.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then the follow-up is just on the seasonality. So a lot of mix changes going on in the business as you guys have mentioned, how do we think about how that should affect how margins change sort of quarter-over-quarter? Is the fact that coal is now a smaller piece of the business, and Intermodal bigger, should that mean bigger seasonal swings between things like fourth quarter and third quarter on margins? How do we think about how that should affect the margins?","Donald W. Seale","Bill, I don't see that as being a seasonal or cyclical impact. What we are seeing is that coal in the quarter was 18% of our shipments and about 23% of our revenue. We're seeing our participation in other energy activities, obviously, continue to ramp up. And we see that as a sustainable source of volume and revenue ahead. So I think instead of cyclicality or seasonality, we're just seeing some substitution and replacement of commodities that were transported.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So the mix, on a margin basis, isn't really that different, given what you've been able to do on the cost?","Donald W. Seale","It is comparable. I will tell you that it's not quite as good as coal was, but it is very attractive business for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Maybe a question, Mark, on the cost initiative side. You said that you're kind of trending ahead of the $100 million target that you'd had for the year. I just want to get a sense, when you take a step back and think about maybe the longer-term perspective, as you go through the initiatives, it appear that you have sort of equal opportunities as you move into 2014 i.e. are you going to be able to get sort of the same type of magnitude of changes and improvement in productivity as you move forward here? Or are there any limiting factors from mix or otherwise?","Mark D. Manion","Chris, we are looking for the same trend in productivity improvement, and it just comes from the fact that we have got a pipeline of -- a multitude of productivity projects that are lined up. Think about things like LEADER, that is less than halfway rolled out, we'll be working on that through all of 2014. Movement Planner falls into the same camp. And then on top of that, we've got yard initiative projects, we've got local operating plant projects, these are things that we'll be working on the rest of this year and next year.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And just a follow-up on the headcount -- and I apologize if you missed it, could you give us a rough sense of how you expect headcount to trend over the next quarter or 2?","Mark D. Manion","Well, we have been methodically reducing our headcount. And as you see, year-over-year, just on the operations side, we've reduced about 4% in the last 12 months, 4.1% to be exact. And as we go into 2014, we're going to continue to make reductions. And again, it will be incremental, but we're looking at a reduction of at least several hundred people through attrition throughout the course of next year.","Operator","Our next question comes of the line of Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, I guess, I think a follow-up for you, Mark, and I've got to say, it's impressive performance on the reduction in crew starts with the volume growth. How do you think about the constraints on that? I know you touched on this a little bit with headcount next year. But if volumes are up another 4% next year, can you reduce crew starts another couple of percent? That's a pretty wide and impressive gap. Or do you start to hit some train length considerations or other factors?","Mark D. Manion","Well, if volumes are up, that will be great. We'll operate as many crews as we have to in order to handle the volume, obviously. But with the type of projects we have going on, we will continue to see improvement in -- some improvement even in velocity, we think. Just do the projects, such as what's going on in our yards, where we're doing better and better jobs getting trains out on time, not having the delays and the re-crews that would otherwise take place. We've got our Bellevue project that is going to be coming into its own. That builds in efficiency. So we're continually taking time out of schedules that has an effect of more efficiencies. So when you put all that together, we think we will continue to be favorable on the crew start size -- side. But again, it has everything to do with volume, and we'll take as much volume as we can get.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. I appreciate that. And then a question on coal. What -- I don't think that you specified it. Maybe I missed it, but how big was the impact from liquidated damages in third quarter, absolute level of damages and the year-over-year? And is that something that kind of goes away fourth quarter or next year? Or does that persist?","Donald W. Seale","Tom, but we -- as we stated previously, there was no material liquidated damages accrual in the third quarter.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Nothing this year, nothing meaningful last year?","Donald W. Seale","No.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","Don, you talked in one of your earlier questions about how you think pricing is going to be above that kind of the imminent inflation numbers that you see out there. But you also talked earlier about negative mix with coal and merchandise and Intermodal. When you factor in mix, do you think that your overall yield should stay above that inflation number you talked about in that 1% range?","Donald W. Seale","We believe we're trending in that direction, and we also believe that coal is most likely at the trough in terms of where we will see it stabilize. And hopefully, we'll start to see it improve.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","And are you talking about from a pricing perspective or a total revenue perspective when you say coal at the trough?","Donald W. Seale","The total revenue perspective and a revenue per unit perspective.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay, great. And just second question on the Crescent Corridor, so I'm just wondering, what percent you -- when you first laid that out for us, there were some pretty big opportunities to take share. What percent of that corridor do you think you've utilized so far? And you have any views on kind of how much additional you're planning for in terms of growth next year?","Donald W. Seale","We're in the first inning of our growth plans for the Crescent Corridor, and we identified well over 1 million loads in the initial approach for Crescent. And we're on track, but we're in the first inning of that.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","Why do you think we're only seeing single-digit growth on that corridor if it's kind of brand new?","Donald W. Seale","We are being judicious with respect to the business that we're seeking and gaining. We've made investments in that corridor, and our objective is to generate sufficient returns on those investments.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Wanted to dig in a little bit on the outlook for coal here and get a sense -- your competitors moved a decent chunk of business or will have by the end of this year to fixed variable when they look at their coal business. And wanted to get your thoughts on how you think about that. And then when you look ahead to 2014, how much of your utility business is going to be repricing where you'd have an opportunity to relook at guaranteed minimums and pricing?","Donald W. Seale","With respect to the first part of the question, fixed and variable, we continue to have dialogue with our major utility customers regarding the concept. But I will tell you that we do not have any of that type of formula in place today. And also, we're finding our utilities to be interested but not overwhelmingly interested in the concept. So we're having dialogue, but I will tell you that we do not have any of that price structure in place as of now. The second part of the question, we have to have -- we have about 5% of our current utility book that we're still having some discussions and negotiations with. That will be concluded by the end of the fourth quarter, and we will give you a report out on the results of that in the January call.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then looking out to 2014, what was that?","Donald W. Seale","2014, that includes that 5% that we're negotiating on now, and we have no material utility contracts that are up for renewal next year. We will have escalators in the contracts apply as we have for the contractual terms.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. Just a point of clarification on the coal, I think you said that when you looked at mix at Northern utilities, we're seeing stronger improvement versus Southern, which jives of what -- I would've thought, but maybe not in terms of how that played out in RPU. Is that a positive mix for you guys? Or is that a negative mix, Northern...","Donald W. Seale","That's a negative mix. As we've talked in the past, our Northern utility business stockpiles are at target. Southern utility stockpiles are in excess of target, and our Southern utility coal is about 50% greater RPU than our Northern utility coal. And in this most recent quarter, I will tell you that the split of Utility North to Utility South, which generally runs 50-50, was 54% North and 46% South. So we had a negative mix effect within that utility market.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So the sequential RPU and a favorable mix that would've driven that, in response to an earlier question, was pretty much solid[ph] than the export side? Or was there something else? Because you guys...","Donald W. Seale","That is correct. The favorable Lamberts Point export traffic, which was up, and Baltimore traffic shorter-haul export down, we had a positive mix effect on export business, which was up 3% in total.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","All right. That's very helpful on a clarification basis. The last question, and I'll turn it over, on the Intermodal side, just piggy-backing on what Scott was asking about before, we saw a decent volume numbers compared to past quarters out of your competitors. Are things more competitive on the domestic Intermodal side in the east than we've seen in a while as they've gotten up to a 90% on the double stack and maybe starting to challenge you guys where you've been more dominant in many of these lanes?","Donald W. Seale","We see no real change. We're focused on the highway. That's where the freight is moving. And the highway, the motor carriers are facing hours of service changes, continuing changes with respect to driver availability. So we still see the overall value proposition for Intermodal and the competitive situation essentially the same.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","My question is kind of a follow-up on the Intermodal pricing. I believe it was you, Wick, or perhaps Don that mentioned you were trending negative 1% in Q2 and then switched to positive 2% into Q3. And just throwing it back to you, there was the view that perhaps you had been using price as a mechanism to fill some of your lanes on the backdrop of a weaker economic environment, and what have you, or to drive truck volume over into -- onto your rail network. Is the shift in -- from negative 1 to plus 2 a change in pricing philosophy? Or -- and was that an accurate assessment back in Q2, and that's changed now? Or was there something else at play that we should be considering?","Donald W. Seale","I wouldn't read too much into sequential quarter-to-quarter revenue per unit changes. We don't price a large portion of our Intermodal business on 90-day increments. We price it in longer-term increments than that. So fuel changes, mixed changes, lane changes, all of that are predominant quarter-to-quarter, but yield is not going to change in a major way quarter-to-quarter.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just to confirm here, John, did I hear you say there was an $8 million onetime tax benefit in the quarter, in third quarter 2013?","John P. Rathbone","Yes, and that's related to North Carolina reduced our tax from 6.9% to 6% to 5% over a 2-year period. And that's the reduction related to deferred taxes on the recognition in the balance sheet of those deferred tax benefits that we picked up.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And, Don, could you -- I don't know if you mentioned the split between met and utility on your export side in the quarter roughly.","Donald W. Seale","It was 79% met, 21% thermal.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. Can you just jump into that mix shift a little bit, and was there anything that caused that shift over to Lamberts? And on the same vein, any thoughts on the export market into 2014?","Donald W. Seale","Our Lamberts Point port of Norfolk coal was strong in terms of the quarter for export, predominantly based on metallurgical coal plowing to Dyna. As you probably recall, we had a couple of press releases in the quarter. We loaded one vessel with 168,000 metric tons of export metallurgical coal destined to China, which was the largest coal cargo ship loaded in the Northern Hemisphere. So we saw met coal out of Central App continuing to be in demand in China during the quarter.","Unknown Executive","Fourth quarter mix.","Donald W. Seale","What was the second part of the question?","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Oh, It's just your thoughts on the export market into '14. I guess now you've seen this, it's got 79%...","Donald W. Seale","Well, it's a mixed bag. It's very murky. The thermal coal, as I've mentioned, is subject to world forces. With the API 2 in the Europe, that's too low versus the cost structure for U.S. producers. On the met coal, we see continuing opportunity, but we don't see a robust market. The Australian currency that I mentioned in my prepared remarks continues to make Australian coal more competitive. And should the new Prime Minister and government in Australia remove the carbon tax, Australian exports will become even more competitive. So we have an outlook on coal that's less than encouraging.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And if I can get my follow-up on Intermodal, Wick or Don, I guess it was an impressive answer before on the yield side and Intermodal. And kind of you're restrained. You're showing on the new lanes that you're opening in order to get that return that you want on your investment. So what -- when do you unleash that if that's just J. B. Hunt going in or your large customers going in and selling that? Or are you doing something to more actively market those lanes to convert that highway traffic? Just so we can understand the growth dynamics on those opening up.","Donald W. Seale","We're working with all of our Intermodal partners as well as directly having dialogue with beneficial cargo owners as we normally do. So what we're -- we have a high service value in that quarter, and it has great demand and great promise and potential. And what we're doing is just being prudent in the way we launch it and ramp it up.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","If I could follow up from Ken's question there on the new lanes for Intermodal and along the lines of the efficiency gains, maybe this one's for Mark. But are you running at ideal densities right now in those new Intermodal segments? And is that some of the upside on the efficiency story for 2014?","Mark D. Manion","We got plenty of room to grow, if that's the question in those Intermodal segments, all of them.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well -- when you first start up those lanes, are you getting ideal densities overnight? Or is this something that builds up and the profitability builds up as you get market share?","Mark D. Manion","This is something that continues to ramp over time, and there's really 2 pieces to it. One is filling up the train size, and then as it necessitates, we'll add actual trains to those corridors.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And from a capacity perspective right now, where would you put available capacity in your network on the Intermodal?","Mark D. Manion","A lot. I don't have a percentage for you, but we've got a lot of room to grow. And you've got to think in terms of the fact that over the last -- really, I guess we're going on almost 10 years now where we have every year methodically, surgically been adding infrastructure improvement to what in the past was chokepoints or potential chokepoints. So we're staying ahead of that, and so between our pretty robust infrastructure to start with as well as improvements throughout the years, there's a lot of room out there.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","All right. And, John, real quick on grain, how is the shifting of sourcing of corn and grain in your area going to impact point of haul in yields?","John P. Rathbone","That's a good question. I'm glad you asked it. As I pointed out, the drought of this past year forced us to source a lot of grain in Nebraska and Iowa coming over Chicago, coming to our processors in the Midwest and even some going into the Southeast. That will revert to more traditional origins with this new robust crop where we will source a lot of that corn and -- the corn for processing in Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, which will result in a shorter-haul lower RPU going in to points like Decatur, Illinois, for example, or Lafayette, Indiana. So still good business, just going back to the patterns that are normal.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens.","Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division","On CapEx, I was wondering if you had any early read on what we could expect in 2014. And also, if you could provide any breakdown in terms of the need for infrastructure, equipment, PTC, et cetera, that would be helpful as well.","Donald W. Seale","Well, we haven't taken a capital budget to our board yet, so we haven't announced any kinds of numbers. The capital budget, I think we have talked before, will be roughly order of magnitude of where we are today. We clearly have a big PTC nut out there in front of us, and then we have our typical ongoing needs. We've talked in the past about we are slowly replacing our coal car fleet, which is becoming license-expired [ph] over a period of about 10 years. So we'll see projects like that. But we don't have a good number for you yet, and we'll obviously be talking a lot about that in January when we talk with you again.","Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And maybe for my second question, there's clearly been a lot of uncertainty about the direction in the U.S. export coal market recently, and I realize it will be volatile with weather, exchange rates, et cetera. But longer term, just based on what you're hearing from your customers, do you have a best guess on a normalized range for the U.S. export market? Do you think it's an 80 million, 90 million, 100 million ton market on an annual basis?","John P. Rathbone","You know, we wish we did. We really just don't have a crystal ball that's good enough right now to predict what's coming down the path. We have a lot of confidence over the long term in the strength of our export metallurgical coal franchise. We serve a lot of high-quality metallurgical coal producers, and that coal -- that's coal over the long term that we think will always be in demand. I think -- but in terms of some kind of ratable number for years, we just don't know, and we certainly don't have very good insight into the long-term prospects for U.S. export thermal coals. We and a lot of people would hope that that's a very bullish proposition, but we just don't know yet.","Operator","Our next question comes on the line of Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","With regard to Intermodal, can you just give us an idea where you think a more normalized growth rate might be for the Heartland Corridor? And then also, what will be an update on the year-end outlook for the Meridian Speedway and, again, the longer-term opportunity in that particular quarter?","Donald W. Seale","Well, the Heartland Corridor continues to be robust. We don't expect quarter-to-quarter to quarter-to-quarter increases of 19%. That would a compounding phenomenon. But I guess it's going to continue to be a robust growth corridor for us. We have a suite of services to and from the Port of Virginia that is in great demand around the world, with double-stack service to Columbus, Detroit, back to Chicago. So that corridor will continue to grow. I don't think we'll project that type of growth that we're seeing in the third quarter, but it will be substantial. The other corridors will continue to grow, again, as we compete in the highway -- with highway carriers and partner with our Intermodal partners and beneficial cargo receivers, to the extent that the prices that we put in and the volumes we gain are attractive and generate appropriate returns.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","With regard to the Meridian Speedway and more specifically, I mean, do you see potential for this somewhat relative underperformance to change? And what maybe strategically you're being sort of focused on to accelerate the growth?","Donald W. Seale","I would remind you that the Meridian Speedway is focused more on a developing suite of services to and from Mexico. The Transcon business associated with Meridian Speedway, too, is a more mature intermodal market. We're seeing a much higher growth rate on local eastern intermodal as opposed to the more mature transcontinental intermodal market. And Mexico has great potential, but it's just beginning to ramp up, tying into our new Birmingham hub that we finished at McCalla, Alabama near Birmingham.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if I can just squeeze in one last question with regard to your general preference between international versus domestic intermodal, is there one or a point end like a -- the difference in pricing? And then if you had a choice between international versus domestic, would you prefer one over the other?","Donald W. Seale","We prefer both. The revenue per unit on the international, because it's a private container, marine container, is lower revenue per unit, but it's attractive business. And since we're supplying a lot of the domestic boxes for the domestic intermodal world, it generates a higher revenue per unit. But both are attractive sectors for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","John, good luck in retirement, sir. If I could go back to the question in terms of yields expected for 4Q, on the ag side, you said it should revert more back to normal. Are you talking sort of back to that $2,100-a-carload level that we've seen in the past? Or am I going a little bit too low for the conversion to more shuttle trends?","Donald W. Seale","Well, I don't want to guide you on the revenue per unit per se, but there will be some other moving parts that will impact the changes to normal patterns for domestic grain. As I mentioned in the comments, we see export grain ramping up because of the large crop this year. And as you know, the export market last year was nonexistent because of the lack of grain supplies. So generally, our export trains will generate a higher RPU that will be blended in to mute some of the return to normalized patterns on the domestic grain. So we'll just have to see how that comes together because if we run more export trains than we have planned, which we could, that would have an impact on any number that I would give you.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay. What percent is export versus the shuttle, of the business?","Donald W. Seale","Well, last year, we had very little export grain at all. This year, we will have a fairly substantial export program. I can't give you the percentage of the total.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","Because you're predicting the export market, but I understand that. If I could jump for my follow-up question, in terms of the personal injury rates, obviously, it cropped up a little bit, and there's a negative comparison in 4Q that you mentioned. When is the next actuarial study on the personal injury rate?","Donald W. Seale","We have -- we do this quarterly. And so each quarter, we evaluate those personal injuries. And as Mark said, when we look at the creep of the injury rate going up slightly, but as Mark mentioned in his comments, the severity has not crept up. The serious injuries have not changed, so that gives us comfort, but -- about our accruals.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Larkin with Stifel.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I had a question about the stockpiles in the southeast of the utilities, which have been above normal for a number of years now. Would've thought that by now, they would be getting close to normal. What is it that's preventing them from moving in that direction? Is it fear of liquidated damages? And when do you think that we might expect that they would be brought down to normal levels, so that your movements into that area would be more of what you would expect to see over the long term?","Donald W. Seale","The southern utility stockpiles are being impacted by 2 broad factors. First, natural gas competition. Even with natural gas prices increasing on a moderate -- from a moderate perspective to about $3.60 per million BTU, natural gas is still competing in the South at a higher rate than it is in the North, in our view. Second is electricity demand just hasn't recovered from the recession. It's down 4% in our service territory. So you put those 2 things together, and then also, the summer weather was just not as warm as it was forecasted to be. It was a cooler summer. So those 3 factors combined, we saw the utility stockpiles at utilities we serve in the South tick up by about a day coming off the second quarter into the third quarter.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then maybe as the follow-on, over in March operating area, great improvements have been made there with respect to more productive train starts. I gather from some of the data that your train speed is reaching sort of steady state and Terminal Dwell maybe reaching steady state. Is there much room for improvement there? If not, is all of the productivity really going to come from increased train length going forward?","Donald W. Seale","We think there is continued improvement yet, and it has to do with -- we've got a number of productivity projects out there. But projects, such as things that depart our trains, out of terminals on time, keep them from having to be re-crewed, taking time out of our schedules, just various things that increase the overall efficiency of the train, the train network. We think that will have an impact on our overall velocity. So we think there is still some upside in the velocity. And still some improvement yet to be had in our dwell in terminal. Because you got -- you have to remember, even though right now, we've got our dwell down at really what our operating plan is -- as our operating plan is something that we change, we tweak as we go forward. And as we reduce our -- the -- as we tighten up our train schedules, we change our train plan, we change our operating plan, and that has an effect of reducing the overall dwell that's taking place in terminal. So we still see upside in it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Kauffman with Buckingham Research.","Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I just wanted to follow up a little on Allison's question earlier. We were talking about some of the changes to materials and others line. I think you mentioned the casualties, $23 million, probably $35 million, some more sustainable level. Can you talk about the other elements that drove that down about $26 million year-to-year? How sustainable are those?","John P. Rathbone","Most of that came from the reduction, as we said, reduction in favorable personal injury claim reserves, offset by the -- our environmental expense, which were slightly higher for the quarter. But I think a $35 million quarter run rate on those casualties looks fine on a go forward basis, if that's -- but if you're talking about materials and other, that -- if you look at backwards on that, you'll -- if you take an average over 1 year or 2, and about $100 million is about what the quarterly run rate is on that, $100 million, $102 million, something of that nature is what we guided to in the past on those kinds of line items.","Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And then a tax rate question. You mentioned the $8 million related to the change in the North Carolina rates, but it seems like the tax rate guidance going forward is about 100 basis points below what we were thinking 37% going to 36%. Should we think of 36% as kind of the tax rate that we should use going forward? Or is there a reason that would be a different number?","John P. Rathbone","I think it will rebate [ph] back to a more normalized rate because this year, we did have those unique items. And you'll remember that beginning of the year, we did have some tax benefits from the research and development credits that came in, and then you have the short line credits that will likely expire.","Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","So when we say normalize, are we thinking 37% to 38%, or more 36.5%...","John P. Rathbone","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Don, with the export coal rates through Lamberts to met, are you seeing continued pressure on that due to the changes in the market? Or is that rate sort of holding firm as we kind of move through the quarter?","Donald W. Seale","Sequentially, second quarter to third quarter stable. We still see year-over-year compression that we've talked about in the past. It's not the same market as it was in 2011 or even early 2012.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","But holding -- but sort of holding in?","Donald W. Seale","Holding in is a good way to put it.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","That is great. And then just as a second follow-up question, is it like, I think, the second year now where we haven't had many utility contracts coming up? And I guess I wanted to get an understanding, what's the average duration on the utility customers that you guys have as far as their contract terms?","Donald W. Seale","They range from 3 to 5 years, but I will tell you our larger utilities are 5 years.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Larger utilities are 5 years?","Donald W. Seale","Right.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. So does that imply that we'll see a pickup in the rate of renewals coming up next year or...","Donald W. Seale","Not in 2014.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Not in 2014?","Donald W. Seale","No.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Yes. Would you please share the proportion of coal volume as hauled from each geographic region like you did in the last call?","Donald W. Seale","Yes. If we -- Illinois Basin is growing at the fastest pace, it, in the quarter, was 16% of our tonnage, PRB is still around 18% of our tonnage, Central App is still about 38%, and Northern App is the balance.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And one other question, a mix question. Can you comment on how changes in mix over the past few years are affecting the ratio of loaded to total miles? It seems like it's been pretty flat in the last 3 years. But would you expect a mix that is leaner in coal and richer in intermodal to perhaps present opportunities to increase this ratio?","Donald W. Seale","Well, as we transport more crude oil and more ethanol and that type of product that moves in a private tank car, as you know, all of those movements are 100% empty returned. We price that accordingly. Because it's a private asset, to return that car set back to the origin. So when you look at loaded to empty miles in our network, you will have to take into account the growth of that type of traffic over time.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. So some of those tank car moves are dominating the increase in Intermodal in this ratio?","Donald W. Seale","Well, the empty to loaded miles as a total. Now if you look at Intermodal and drill just into that segment, obviously, we monitor that very closely, and generally, our loaded-to-empty mile ratio is improving.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Mark, I may have missed it, but can you give us an update of where you are exactly on the Movement Planner rollout specifically? And has that technology been a driver of the productivity improvements recently? Or is that more of something we'd see in '14, '15?","Mark D. Manion","Movement Planner has been implemented now on 4 of our 11 divisions, and we are ramping it pretty quickly now. We will get it fully implemented in 2014, optimistically midway through the year, but certainly by the end of the year. And so at this point, we are -- I think we're seeing some of the benefits even though it's pretty early on in the game. We're seeing some of the benefits of Movement Planner. We think we're seeing some of our velocity improvement on account of that technology, but more to come.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, perfect. And then, Don, jut changing gears real quick, do you, by chance, have the size of the EMP fleet? And do you have any expectations on whether that pool is going to expand or shrink next year?","Donald W. Seale","As Wick indicated, we haven't announced our capital budget. We will be reviewing that with our board in November. The EMP fleet overall is in the range of 30,000 units. We do expect it to expand.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, perfect. And then just real quick, is there a big difference in ARPU between a private box and a public pool box?","Donald W. Seale","If it's a private box, obviously, that's taken into account where we don't have the asset cost associated with it, so there would be a delta. But I wouldn't say that it's a significant differential in the domestic market. It's more pronounced on the marine containers, which are 40-foot to use versus 53s in the domestic market.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we've come to the end of our Q&A session. Mr. Moorman, I'd like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.","Charles W. Moorman","Well, thanks, everyone, for the questions and for being with us this morning.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Michael Hostutler, Norfolk Southern Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. Mr. Hostutler, you may begin.","Michael Hostutler ","Thank you, and good afternoon. Before we begin today's call, I would like to mention a few items. First, the slides of the presenters are available on our website at nscorp.com in the Investors section.

Moorman","Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. It is my pleasure to welcome you to our Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are several members of our senior team, including Don Seale, our Chief Marketing Officer; Mark Manion, our Chief Operating Officer; Jim Squires, our CFO; and Deb Butler, our Chief Information Officer.","As we typically do in January, Deb will be presenting our 2012 capital budget. And in order to allow enough time for that presentation, I will include a brief operations update in my remarks on Mark's behalf. Mark will be available to answer any questions later.","I am very pleased to announce another record-breaking quarter for Norfolk Southern. We achieved fourth quarter highs in revenues, net income and earnings per share. As you know, these fourth quarter results capped an already-outstanding 2011 performance, and led to across-the-board record results for the full year, which include all-time highs for revenues, income from operations, net income and earnings per share.","Looking at our top line, revenues for the fourth quarter increased 17%. Volumes rose 6%, led by double-digit growth in Intermodal, Automotive and Metals & Construction. Revenue per unit rose 11%, led by our Coal franchise. For the full year, revenues reached $11.2 billion, 17% more than 2010 on 5% higher volume. Don will provide you with all of the revenue details in a couple of minutes.","Net income for the quarter of $480 million was up 19%, and diluted earnings per share rose 30% to $1.42. For the full year, net income and earnings per share rose 28% and 36%, respectively. And Jim will provide you with all of the financial details.","These record results resulted in strong operating cash flow, which for the first time in Norfolk Southern's history exceeded $3 billion. In recognition of this performance, as well as their confidence in Norfolk Southern's strategic direction, our board this morning increased the quarterly dividend by $0.04, or 9%, and this return to shareholders follows the $2.6 billion in share repurchases and dividends paid out during 2011.","These outstanding results were driven by a solid operating performance, which improved as the quarter progressed. While handling an additional 6% in volumes, we improved terminal dwell [ph] and maintained our average network velocity. Moreover, the increased volumes were handled with only a 5% rise in crew starts. ","Our operating performance improvement is continuing into the first quarter, and we're seeing significant improvements year-over-year in network velocity in terminal dwell [ph]. The fourth quarter also saw improvements in our fuel efficiency, driven by milder weather conditions and the turnback of less fuel-efficient leased locomotive.","I will be remiss if I also didn't say something about our safety performance for the year. We finished 2011 with a projected safety ratio of 0.73, which is an absolutely remarkable number and a full 18% below our previous best. We have a great team at Norfolk Southern, and they're doing a terrific job on safety and service.","In 2012, we'll continue to focus on improving service delivery and operating efficiency while positioning our franchise for continued volume growth. Part of that plan is continued strong capital investment, and Deb will give you some details of our planned $2.4 billion capital program for this year. ","I'll have more to say about our 2012 outlook in a few minutes. But now, I'll turn the program over to Don.","Donald W. Seale","Thank you, Wick, and good afternoon, everyone. For today's call, I'll recap our fourth quarter and year-end performance, including the key drivers of our results, and then I'll conclude with our outlook going forward. ","The environment during the fourth quarter was marked by overall economic improvement and tightening truck capacity. These factors, combined with our ongoing business development activity, produced the strongest fourth quarter revenue on record.","In total, revenue for the quarter reached $2.8 billion, up $405 million or 17% over fourth quarter 2010. Yield improvement across the board, up 11% and volumes grew by 6%, led by gains of 21% in Automotive, 12% in Metals & Construction, 11% in Intermodal and 3% up in Coal. ","Of the $405 million in revenue growth during the quarter, approximately 2\/3 came as a result of higher revenue per unit, including pricing gains and fuel surcharge revenue. Higher volume accounted for the remainder of the revenue increase.","Slide 3 summarizes our full year performance, which was our best revenue year ever at $11.2 billion, up $1.66 billion or 17% versus last year. Coal, Intermodal, Agriculture and Chemicals posted revenue records for the full year. ","Higher revenue per unit contributed $1.16 billion or 70% of the revenue gain, while volume growth of 5% accounted for the remaining $493 million.","With respect to yield, as shown on the next slide, revenue per unit reached a record $1,548 for the quarter and $1,570 for the year with increases of 11% and 12%, respectively. We posted across-the-board gains for both the quarter and the year as a result of market-based pricing and increased fuel surcharge revenue. ","We remain committed to market-based pricing that equals or exceeds rail inflation, and we will maintain this focus going forward. The demand for rail transportation remains high and truck and barge capacity remain tight, both of which point to a favorable pricing environment for 2012.","As I mentioned previously, volume for the quarter was up 6%. Turning our discussion to the full year, as shown on Slide 5, volume was up a solid 5% over 2010, a 15% improvement in domestic Intermodal, coupled with a 5% gain in international volumes, led to a 10% year-over-year growth within Intermodal. ","In our Coal market, significant gains in export volume, up 24% versus 2010 and a 1% increase in utility volume despite mild weather and low gas prices helped drive our coal volumes up 4% for the full year.","In our Merchandise sector, volume was relatively flat for the year. Solid increases in Automotive and Metals & Construction traffic offset declines in Chemicals, Agriculture and Paper. As I've mentioned in previous calls, negative comps from 2010 within the Chemical and Agriculture groups contributed significantly to the declines in both businesses.","Now turning to our major business sectors in the fourth quarter, starting with Coal. Revenue of $850 million was up $165 million or 24%, due to a 21% improvement in revenue per unit and a 3% gain in volume.  As depicted on the next slide, the overall 3% volume increase in Coal came from a 27% increase in export. ","Fourth quarter volume at Lamberts Point was up over 37% and volume through Baltimore was up 6%, driven by increased global demand for steel production, which was up 3% during the first 2 months of the fourth quarter. These gains more than offset lower utility volume, which was down 3% versus fourth quarter 2010, but up 1% sequentially over the third quarter of 2011.","Reduced demand for electricity due to mild weather as well as competition from gas impacted coal burn across our network.","We also saw improvement in the quarter within our domestic Metallurgical Coal network, which was up 8% in response to greater coking demand associated with domestic steel production. ","And on a more recent note, as shown on Slide 8, we completed our largest single coal loading ever at Pier 6 2 weeks ago. The M\/V Cape Dover shown here on the left was loaded with nearly 160,000 tons of metallurgical coal destined for China.","The coal, which arrived in over 1,500 railcars to our terminal was loaded on the Cape Dover in less than 48 hours. This event truly highlights the service and capacity that have become the hallmark of Lamberts Point.","Now let's turn to our Intermodal network. Revenue in the Intermodal network in the quarter reached $554 million, up $83 million or 18% over fourth quarter 2010, driven by 11% higher volume and a 6% increase in revenue per unit.","Slide 10 shows that the volume gains in Intermodal came mainly from our domestic market, up 15% or 54,000 loads for the quarter, due primarily to high weight conversion. ","Our international segment also posted a gain for the quarter, up 9% due to improved retail demand. ","In the fourth quarter, we completed clearance work between Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio, which was the last remaining link in our Intermodal network to realizing a fully double-stacked capable network. And 4 or 5 terminals are scheduled for completion this year, ranging from Memphis and Birmingham in the South to Greencastle, Pennsylvania and Mechanicville, New York in the Northeast. ","In fact, I'll point out that we ran our first Intermodal train through the new Mechanicville terminal just last week as we began to ramp up operations there.","Now turning to our Merchandise markets. Revenue for the quarter of $1.4 billion was up $157 million or 13%, due primarily to an 11% gain in revenue per unit. Volume of 566,000 units was up 1%. ","As you know, our Merchandise network includes a large base of manufacturing companies, and we see positive signs in this sector. ","The ISM Manufacturing Index had a 6-month high in December of 53.9, marking the 29th consecutive month of expansion. And we're seeing improved demand for manufactured products, both domestically and for export.","As we drill down on the next slide into the 5 groups that comprise Merchandise, you will note strong quarterly volume gains in Metals & Construction and Automotive, at 12% and 21%, respectively. Miscellaneous construction materials, which includes frac sand, was the primary driver in the Metals & Construction volume growth, which was up 24% for the quarter due to increasing demand for products related to natural gas drilling. New business opportunities within this market have been leading the way for growth throughout the year, and we expect that to continue.","Steel and Automotive manufacturing both saw increased activity levels for the quarter, which was favorable for our Metals and Automotive businesses. Steel volume for the quarter was up 13%, as we saw domestic raw steel production grow by 12% during the quarter. And North American vehicle production for the quarter was up nearly 400,000 units or 13%. ","Three of our Merchandise sectors experienced volume declines for the quarter. Agriculture was down 7%, due to the negative comp within fertilizer and lower corn shipments to short-haul Midwest destinations, while Chemicals volume was down 10%, due primarily to the comp effect resulting from the completion of the Tennessee Valley Authority fly ash project we handled in 2010. We cleared this negative comp on December 1, 2011.","Now before concluding with our business outlook, I want to highlight our industrial development results in 2011, which certainly reflect the resurgence of U.S. manufacturing that I mentioned a moment ago. ","2011 was a record year as we brought on new and expanded projects worth $335 million revenue and more than 152,000 new carloads of business for our system. As you may have seen in our announcement this month, NS facilitated $9.5 billion of investment by our customers in 2011. ","These new plants and expansions are expected to create 6,800 jobs across our service region, and nearly half of the revenues secured in 2011 through our industrial development activity included foreign direct investment in such projects as steel and automobile manufacturing.","The energy sector was also a major contributor to these results, accounting for 27 locations and expansions across 15 states. The gains included new coal business as well as projects related to Marcellus Shale gas exploration, which we see as an area for continued growth. Obviously, these new projects will support further growth in 2012, but more importantly, growth for years to come.","Now concluding with our outlook. We see a variety of new business opportunities ahead in a gradually recovering economy. For our Coal business, port capacity improvements, new metallurgical coal production coming online and new steam coal business support opportunities for growth in the export market. ","With respect to our utility network, we see new opportunities for Illinois Basin coal, which will partially mitigate the effects of a mild winter and competition from natural gas.","On the Intermodal front, we anticipate continued opportunities for highway conversions, as tightening truck capacity and favorable international trade patterns continue. ","And finally with Merchandise, Merchandise volumes are expected to improve in the crude oil and waste product sectors, along with continued growth in ethanol at new and existing terminals. Also increased demand for materials associated with natural gas drilling, along with higher projections for North American vehicle production, bode well for both our Steel and Automotive businesses.","In summary, we expect our volumes ahead to continue to exceed both low-tech industrial production as well as GDP and market-based pricing [indiscernible] rate of rail inflation will remain a cornerstone of our plan going forward. ","Thank you for your time this afternoon, and we'll now turn it over to Jim for our financial report. Jim?","James A. Squires","Thank you, Don. I'll now review our fourth quarter financial results, which round out a year of record performance. I'll close with an overview of our financial highlights for the year.","Let's start with our fourth quarter operating results. As Don described, railway operating revenues were a fourth quarter record of $2.8 billion, up $405 million or 17% compared to 2010. ","Fuel revenues increased $100 million, and this quarter's lag effect was $46 million unfavorable.","The following slide displays our total operating expenses, which increased by $247 million or 14% for the quarter. ","Income generated from railway operations was $800 million, up 25% reflecting the sizable increase in revenues. The resulting operating ratio was 71.4%, a 2% improvement compared to 73.2% in the fourth quarter 2010. Both measures reflect fourth quarter post Conrail results, exceeded only by our fourth quarter 2008.","Removing the $46 million unfavorable fuel revenue lag, our operating ratio would have been 70.2%. This translates to a 3% improvement compared to 2010's 72.3% operating ratio, adjusted for a $29 million unfavorable fuel lag.","Turning to our expenses. The next slide shows the major components of the $247 million increase. Fuel and compensation and benefits expenses accounted for over 2\/3 of the variance.","As displayed on the following slide, nearly all of the $95 million increase in fuel expense was due to higher prices. Our average diesel fuel price per gallon was $3.11, a 27% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2010.","Consumption increased 4% relative to a 6% increase in gross ton miles, a reflection of milder 2011 weather and returning many older leased locomotives.","Next, compensation and benefits increased by $75 million or 11%. Looking at the major components of this increase on the following slide: First, higher incentive compensation reflects our strong year-over-year results of $37 million; second, higher health and welfare benefits added $13 million, a little over 1\/2 of which related to increased premiums; third, activity levels due to increased volumes added $9 million primarily for train and engine employees; fourth, wage rates drove expenses up $5 million. Pension expenses and payroll taxes increased $5 million and $4 million, respectively.","Materials and other expenses, presented next, increased $35 million or 19% reflecting higher volume-related equipment maintenance activities, reliability initiatives for our locomotive fleet and increased environmental remediation expense.","Purchase services and rents increased $28 million or 7%, primarily reflecting volume-related operating activities.","Turning to our nonoperating items. Increases in corporate-owned life insurance and coal royalties were partly offset by the absence of favorable interest on uncertain tax positions that benefited 2010.","As illustrated in this comparison, income before income taxes increased $161 million or 29% due to higher operating income. Income taxes totaled $243 million and the effective tax rate was 33.6%. The lower-than-expected effective tax rate reflects $11 million in deferred tax benefits resulting from state tax law changes.  Income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2010 were $160 million with an effective rate of 28.5%, and were favorably impacted by a change in estimate for deferred taxes that resulted in a nonrecurring reduction of $34 million.","Net income and EPS comparisons are displayed on the following slide, both measures set fourth quarter records. Net income was $480 million, an increase of $78 million or 19% compared to 2010. Diluted earnings per share were $1.42, exceeding fourth quarter 2010 results by $0.33 per share or 30%.","Turning our focus to the full year. Record revenues of $11.2 billion, up 17% versus 2010 contributed to record income from railway operations of $3.2 billion, up 20% compared to $2.7 billion in 2010. These results generated a 70-basis-point improvement in our operating ratio, which was 71.2% for the year, a close second to our 71.1% post-Conrail record set in 2008.","Net income for the year reached $1.9 billion compared to $1.5 billion in 2010 and diluted earnings per share increased from $4 to $5.45 per share. These results reflect a 28% increase in net income and a 36% increase in diluted earnings per share, both measures set new records.","As shown on Slide 16, strong 2011 net income drove a 19% increase in cash from operations, which covered most of the increase in our capital spending and produced $1.1 billion in free cash flow. ","In addition to increased capital spending, the lower 2011 free cash flow reflects accelerated accounts payable activity in late December, planned as part of our January 1 ERP implementation. This temporary decline in our year-end cash balance has since rebuilt to normal levels.","From free cash flow, we distributed over $0.5 billion in dividends. The remainder combined with net proceeds from borrowings and cash on hand supported over $2 billion of share repurchases.","As we move forward, we expect continued capacity to generate free cash flow, coupled with reliable access to debt markets that will position us to support future capital deployment initiatives, as evidenced by our board's action earlier today, increasing our quarterly dividend by $0.04 to $0.47 a share. ","Debt repayments in 2012 are relatively low at about $150 million and dividends, as always, will remain an important means for distributions.","Next, Deb Butler will share our 2012 capital investment plans. Thank you for your attention.","Deborah H. Butler","Thank you, Jim. As Wick noted, we plan another strong capital investment program in 2012. Slide 2 depicts our 2012 capital program compared with prior years' programs. At $2.4 billion, our 2012 plan is budgeted to be 12% higher than 2011 capital expenditures, and reflects our continuing confidence in and commitment to the growth and productivity of our franchise.","As in prior years, the majority of our capital spending is targeted towards strengthening the franchise. Replacement and core spending represent about $1.6 billion or 67% of our total capital budget. If we include in the core spending category, $247 million budgeted for the continued implementation of positive train control, the total is in line with our historical average of about 75% core and 25% growth spending. ","The growth portion of the budget, shown here in green, and totaling $545 million is for track and terminal expansions and for projects to improve asset utilization, workforce productivity and fuel efficiency.","As always, the largest percentage of our spending is targeted at keeping our right of way and the condition needed to move our customers' business safely and efficiently. ","Roadway spending in 2012 is budgeted to be $840 million or 35% of the total budget. Our roadway budget funds the replacement of rail, ties and ballasts as well as the improvement or replacement of bridges and culvert.","Investments in infrastructure are budgeted to be $134 million or 6% of capital expenditures. Our infrastructure investments are specifically designed to relieve congested lines and improve capacity and velocity on Atlanta roads. New projects for 2012 will focus on the Birmingham Atlanta corner and our north-south line between Chattanooga and Cincinnati. As in prior years, we'll also continue to invest in public-private partnerships such as those associated with and Crescent Corridor and CREATE.","On Slide 8, investments in facilities and terminals throughout our network will total $322 million or 13% of our planned 2012 capital expenditures. About half of the spending in this category is associated with investments in intermodal facility, including continued work at 3 Crescent Corridor terminals in Tennessee, Alabama and Pennsylvania, each of which also has a public funding component. ","The photo on the slide is an aerial view of the massive intermodal terminal project at Rossville, Tennessee near Memphis. The remaining funding in the facilities and terminals category will be used to support new business opportunities, as well as to continue a multiyear initiative to expand and update our locomotive servicing facility.","And speaking of locomotives, spending in this category will total $242 million in 2012 or 10% of the total budget. Locomotive spending planned for 2012 includes the purchase of 35 new units, as well as continued investments in alternative power programs. Also included in this category is funding to rebuild and upgrade existing locomotives and full installation of emissions kits to meet government requirements.","Freight car spending in 2012 will total $346 million or 14% of the total 2012 capital budget. We're continuing a multiyear investment in new coal cars as our existing fleet ages out. And in addition, we're ramping up the coal car re-body program in 2012. Freight car funding will also be used to purchase equipment to support our Intermodal, Automotive, Metals and Scrubber Stone businesses.","Not including positive train control, investment in system technology will total $92 million or 4% of total investments in 2012. We've broken out spending on positive train control into a separate technology category, totaling $247 million or 10% of total spending in 2012. This compares with a budget of $146 million in 2011, and is in line with our plans to ramp up spending as the 2015 deadline approaches.","Our investments in technology were highlighted at last year's Investors' Day, and included a comprehensive suite of projects that enhance safety, improve operational efficiency and equipment utilization and provide our workforce the tools to better plan and manage our network and processes. Included in this spending are projects such as LEADER, an energy management system that improves fuel efficiency and UTCS movement plan, a system designed to optimize train dispatching and increase network velocity.","And as noted, we are facing a significant increase in spending in 2012 to comply with the federally mandated positive train control project. Funding will be used to upgrade communication and signals, to purchase and install on-board network devices on locomotives and to continue the complex process of integrating PTC with our other operating systems. Even with recent changes in the regulations, we still anticipate the total spending on PTC will exceed $1 billion.","I'll close with another shot of Crescent Corridor construction at river [ph]. As our capital spending plan for 2012 clearly demonstrates, we remain committed to investing in the safety, growth and productivity of our franchise. ","And now, I'll turn the program back over to Wick.","Charles W. Moorman","Thanks, Deb. Well as you've heard, our fourth quarter kept an outstanding year for Norfolk Southern and a year in which our results were matched by the returns to our shareholders. Looking forward, we share in what seems to be the consensus view that the economy will continue to grow albeit at a fairly slow pace, assuming that the global economic climate remains reasonably stable. We remain optimistic, as you've heard that Norfolk Southern can continue to grow overall volumes at a pace faster than the economy as we have done for the past couple of years.","As Don mentioned, the fact that many people in our service area have enjoyed an unusual amount of short sleeve weather so far this winter, coupled with a low natural gas prices, may pressure our first quarter utility coal volumes to some extent, but we remain confident in the longer term strength of our Coal franchise.","2012 will also see us continue to focus on our service product and the efficiency of our operations. In addition to the strengthening of our operations, 2012 will also, as you've heard, include the completion of several new major intermodal terminals, which will result in additional capacity and service improvements.","As I've said many times before, increasing asset velocity on our property improves both our customer service and our operating cost structure, and we have a number of initiatives and investments underway that are focused on velocity. As I said earlier, we're off to a good start so far this year, and looking to build on that momentum. I'm confident that we can and that the end result will be continued high quality, high value service for our customers and superior returns for our shareholders.","Thanks. And we'll now open the mic up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  Our first question is from Jason Seidl with Dahlman Rose.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","First, I'm going to concentrate on coal. You sound fairly optimistic on the export market, if we just put utilities aside for the moment. Can you give us some color, what gives you the optimism on net exports and also thermal exports for you guys?","Charles W. Moorman","With respect to the metallurgical coal, which is the predominant share of our business, as you know, going to Europe, Asia and South America, we're fortunate that we have a lot of very high quality, low-vol metallurgical coal that's in great demand around the world. And we're confident that, that demand will continue. We are supplementing that metallurgical flow. I will tell you that we have executed a couple of deals for steam coal. And we see an increased opportunity ahead for higher steam coal exports. And so, you put those 2 together, and we still feel optimistic about the export market.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, fantastic. My follow-up question is going to be in the intermodal side. You guys have been creating a network where you should be able to increase your productivity. Yet in the same sense, you also lost a contract beginning this year, so you're going to lap that. Can you talk to us about what's left in the network in terms of how much excess capacity your Intermodal network is currently running at?","Charles W. Moorman","Well we have capacity, it's to some extent, lane specific, but we still have a fair amount of capacity on a lot of our train starts. There are terminals where we're very, very busy right now. And part of our terminal expansion strategy is to give us additional growth, head room in those locations. So Pennsylvania, being an example. Mark, anything else you'd like to add?","Mark D. Manion","The only other thing I'd add to that is our average train length for intermodal is still under 6,000 feet. And of course that's an average. We've got some trains that are smaller than that and a lot of trains that are larger than that. But suffice to say, that for the most part, our intermodal trains can operate at 8,000 feet, sometimes more than that. So a lot of room to grow there.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess the first question is on coal mix on the utility side. It looks like ARPU is down sequentially. I'm assuming that's with the preponderant of Northern utility contracts that you guys have a little bit of unfavorable mix in the year. Maybe, if you could just talk a little bit about how we should expect that to look as we head into 2012? And then obviously there are a bit of secular headwinds facing that sector, what do you guys think volumes will look like on the utility side, if we could see things positive or if flat is kind of a best case scenario in 2012?","Mark D. Manion","Justin, as I mentioned, our utility volume for the full year 2011 was up 1%, and it was also up 1% sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, so those are pretty good numbers. And the current environment with historically low natural gas prices and a very mild winter. But in terms of the mix effect, we're constantly seeing some changes in the flow of our coal going to Northern utilities versus Southern utilities. I will tell you that our Southern utilities now are generally on target with respect to stockpiles, while we have a couple of Northern plants that are still below target that are taking coal that they're catching up on.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, I wanted to follow up on the comment that I think is a big accomplishment that you guys kind of talked about quickly in the prepared remarks, which is the 100% double stack ability in your Intermodal network. How does that change the way you go to market now, and if it does at all? And does it open up new capabilities in terms of getting into shippers that haven't been willing to look at you guys? How does that change the way you think about your Intermodal network and the kind of -- does it affect the domestic growth rate that we should be expecting at all?","Donald W. Seale","Well certainly we've had the plans to clear the entire network. The last link was Cincinnati to Columbus. We completed that in the fourth quarter in early December. And just to put a little more color to that, that saves almost 2 days between the port of Virginia Hampton roads, and Detroit for example. So it shortens the route. It makes it more efficient, and we have been getting word out to our domestic and international customers about that improvement for quite some time. So it does not change our posture on our plans to go to market, but it certainly offers another arrow in the quiver for quality efficient service over our Intermodal network.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can we just talk on the -- you talked on the export coal side, maybe on the utility domestic side. You are down just a touch, a couple percentage points. Your peer in the region was down double digits. Why do we see such a difference? And then maybe within that same conversation, you can talk about your expectations for -- with CSAPR and MACT rules coming in, what your expectations are for continued reduction on the utility coal side.","Donald W. Seale","Well our outlook for utility, as Wick mentioned, we are optimistic about our utility network. Certainly we have crosswinds and some headwinds with environmental issues. The weather is probably the biggest concern we have right now. And then of course natural gas at $2.50 per million BTU is another concern. We don't think that gas will stay at that level over the long run. We think coal generation will be fine. With respect to Boiler MACT and as well as CSAPR. As you know, both of those EPA proposals are being delayed due to court challenge. And I will tell you that with respect to CSAPR and the older smaller coal-fired plants in our universe, we don't expect a significant impact anyway with CSAPR. A 50-year-old plant that is a 300-megawatt plant, a reinvestment is not going to take place there to install scrubbers. And we expect those plants to fade away anyway. So looking ahead, we still feel good about the utility network. I can only comment about our network, and I can't really comment about the others. But we've got slightly over 100 plants, utility plants in our utility fleet. I will tell you that 70% of those already have scrubbers, and that number is going up. Our largest single plant that we serve will have scrubbers installed by the end of 2013, and we will see that plant at that point start to take Illinois Basin coal, Powder River Basin coal for blending at that plant. It's a whole PRB coal take at that plant today. So a lot of moving parts, but we have a good network and we see opportunities ahead.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sounds great, Donald. If I can just get the -- a follow-up on a different commodity, on Ag. Obviously we had the weather impact last year with the floods, and inability gets the fertilizer down. When do you start to see that anniversaried and maybe easier comps from a new planting season?","Donald W. Seale","We will clear a comp in our fertilizer sector March 1 in our Ag business, as we cleared a negative comp for TVA December 1 in our chemical business. And I think you're making a very good point in your question. We are expecting to see fertilizer usage increase in the 2012 crop year to enhance yield, so we see further opportunities in terms of phosphate fertilizers as well as potash. And also we had some very unusual weather patterns this past year with the corn crop. We saw regions get rain in Illinois that had good yield, and then we saw other regions in Illinois, Ohio and Indiana that didn't get rained, and the yields were not quite so good. So that impacted our overall business. But when we look at our Ag business in terms of the ethanol business, as well as the poultry and animal feed mill plants and the cycling trains that we have in place, we think 2012 is going to be a good year for Ag.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Don, in your experience in the past, when you look at kind of the volatility that we see in the export coal markets or even over time, maybe some volatility in the domestic markets, do you think pricing changes can stimulate coal demand in any way? Or is it just there's bigger forces beyond what rails can do on price?","Donald W. Seale","Bill, my view is that obviously we're part of the supply chain, but there are much larger factors that determine world markets for coal usage and coal demand. We constantly monitor that. And right now, we see ongoing opportunity in the export market for growth. I will tell you that we will have some additional metallurgical coal coming online in 2012, expansions in Southwest Virginia as well as West Virginia. And as I mentioned, these are high-quality met coals that can compete anywhere in the world, and they will continue to be in demand. So I think obviously, we are attuned to the fact that we're part of an overall supply chain, and we're always going to be sensitive to that. But we're not the driving factor in worldwide demand for coal.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And how do we reconcile these comments that are pre-bullish in export coal on what seem to be production cuts from a number of coal companies out there. Is it just because of this unique attributes of the coal? Is that really possible?","Donald W. Seale","Bill, I think it could come down to cost of production and unique attributes of the coal being mined at those given locations. You've probably seen that one of our major suppliers in their capital budget that they have announced, they are actually expanding their capability of producing high-quality low-vol metallurgical coal in Southwest Virginia. So while you have some folks pulling back, you have others that are planning to move ahead, and it all depends on cost of production and the quality of the coal.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And if the volatility exists, is there a way that you can reduce resources in coal? Or is it such a high, if you will, fixed costs sort of unit train business that you do get decremental margins or you don't get them because of the way the cost structure works. How does that work?","Donald W. Seale","Well, Bill, certainly we can manage crew starts and the number of crews, but we -- I will tell you, we don't expect a cut back in our coal.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Actually, first question for Deb here. When I look at the CapEx plan that you have and I sort of cross it with what you and your peers, I guess, have told us about a general sort of run rate of 16% to 18%, call it, revenue. I nevertheless note that all of the rails seemed to be bumping up above their 20% of revenue. And just curious, is that purely a PTC phenomenon? And will we start to see that 2.4% sort of come off even as your revenue grows? Or is this something that continues to trend higher given the PTC spend that goes up to, call it, 2015, 2016?","Deborah H. Butler","I think large part of it clearly is PTC spend. That's why we break that out when we talk about our capital spending. Beyond that though, and you'll recall we have spoken for a number of years about that need to replace our coal car fleet. And we talked about it again for 2012 spending. That's another big driver that you probably didn't see quite as much of in previous years. You're going to see it for the next couple of years as well. And so, we are replacing our coal car fleet. And as we did last year, to the extent that we identify opportunities to replace leased equipment and replace equipment with equipment that we can purchase that's also, again, nothing specific planned, but that's something that we will look at as the opportunities present themselves. So PTC is not, call it, the biggest driver for us. The freight car replacement is also another big driver.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So it sounds like its long-enough tail that we should continue to model in this kind of magnitude of CapEx for the next few years?","Charles W. Moorman","I think that's fair. One other component is that it's been out there and will continue to do. As you know, we discussed we're making some major facility investments right now. So we have some long-tail things, but they will eventually end.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Second question here, Don. You gave us a pretty good outlook. I guess, can you talk about sort of the areas where you're a little concerned, where we might see some weakness? And what areas do you really get excited about and sort of stand alone among the top of your business segments in terms of growth?","Donald W. Seale","Well, not surprisingly, the recovery in housing and the implications for the larger economy that, that would have. That continues to be a concern. We've seen recently some -- at least some indications of hope and optimism that housing is getting a little better. We're seeing our business start to pick up in lumber for example. But that area -- Paper and forest products continues to be one that is not robust for us. Only very plus side, as I mentioned, the crude oil coming from Bakken, as well as the Tarzan's crude oil opportunity, in addition to all of the materials that we're transporting into the Marcellus Shale region to support the activity there. That business has ramped up significantly. I will tell you that it was north of 40,000 carloads for 2011. And our plans called for a significant increase over and above that for 2012. So that area is very positive and encouraging. And of course, the Automotive market, I have to say, has made a remarkable recovery with respect to sales and production to support sales. And I'm sure you've seen the recent reports that the age of the U.S. fleet of automobiles on the highway is now approaching 11 years, 10.8 years. I was in Detroit a couple weeks ago, and the sense of optimism was very high with respect to continued auto sales growth and production. So that's another sector, which feeds steel and domestic coke and coal demand, which is -- they're all encouraging.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just a housekeeping, if I might, for your, Jim. The low tax rate, I think you mentioned was it $11 million in deferred tax benefit was the main driver? And I put in $11 million, I'm still getting a fairly low tax rate that brings it up to 35% but still trending below what you typically get.","James A. Squires","Right. Fair enough. We did have other benefits and income taxes in the quarter, but not benefits that we view as unusual or nonrecurring. And so, match the $11 million up against $34 million of favorability in income taxes and a 28.5% effective rate in the fourth quarter of last year for example. So the $11 million we did flag is something unusual due to state law changes as we mentioned.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Peter Nesvold with Jefferies & Company.","Peter Nesvold","Did I miss it or did you say what core pricing was for the quarter?","James A. Squires","You didn't miss it. We don't reveal that. We talk about revenue per unit.","Peter Nesvold","Got you, okay. Comp and benefit, as percent of revenue, looks like it improved about 130 basis points year-over-year in the quarter. That was actually the narrowest improvement that we've seen since third quarter 2010. And I'm just curious, is there -- are there staffing actions that are being taken there? Is there something that might explain the tightening there via the margin improvement year-over-year?","James A. Squires","Well, you did see the hiring rate taper off some in the fourth quarter relative to volumes. And I think that provided some benefit and comp benefits relative to overall results. But nothing beyond that we can really point to. The incentive comp was the significant component of the increase. And then, down the line from their all familiar components of increases from quarter's past.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Matt Troy with Susquehanna Financial.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I know that the coal year on the export side rolls every spring. But I was just wondering, as we all grasp, or trying to grasp what the export coal look like -- outlook will look like. What is the process in terms of negotiation? When do they begin? When do you get a sense of a minimum committed tonnage? Can you just help us provide kind of the window on the front and back end that late spring date when the contracts get rolled out. Don, that would be helpful.","Donald W. Seale","Matt, between now and April 1 will be the period where most of the detailed negotiation and discussion takes place. Obviously, we've been having discussions leading up to this time, but that will intensify between now and April 1, and we'll have most of that done by April 1.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Pricing included in those discussions?","Donald W. Seale","Correct.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. The second question just more on the domestic side, the 15% growth in containers is industry-leading. I'm wondering if you could point to, and I'm afraid the answer is going to be a lot of little things. But are there 1 or 2 things that are driving your domestic share performance Intermodal. It is so far ahead of what we're seeing elsewhere competitively in the region but just across the industry? Is it 1 or 2 of the projects? In the last couple of quarters, if you can just help me maybe separate into buckets what's driving that higher?","Donald W. Seale","That is you're recalling in the third quarter, and I did not show the stats of the fourth quarter. We are showing double-digit increases in our corridors, as we work on speed enhancements, as we roll out features of those quarters. Crescent Corridor, Heartland Corridor, Pan Am Southern, the Heartland Corridor. And so that's certainly helping us in that regard. And I will also say that we've got some very strong partners in the domestic Intermodal market that are working closely with us to convert highway freight in the East, which has been untapped in the past. So it's a target-rich environment, East of the Mississippi in terms of truckloads. And it's a combination of network and partners working with us to market that.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to ask on the Intermodal side. You mentioned, I think, 4 new terminals coming online in 2012. Can you give us a sense of what that increase in terminal capacity is, perhaps in terms of lift relative to the total Intermodal network?","Donald W. Seale","Tom, in terms of the increase lift capacity in Memphis, Birmingham, Greencastle and Mechanicville right out of 0.5 million lifts on incremental capacity.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So what is that relative to the prior Intermodal terminal network capacity?","Donald W. Seale","In terms of a percentage improvement or increase?","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, if we can have total lifts of the network prior to that capacity or percent increase.","Donald W. Seale","It's in the range of 15% to 18%.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And how long, I'm sure you've got Mike Mcquillan [ph] out there working hard to market this and drive volume growth and so forth. I'm confident that you'll have success over time. How long does it take your partners to ramp that up? Some of these will probably be new markets that they could access. Is that something that you can pretty quickly see volumes coming in to those new terminals? Or is it something where you kind of have a fairly gradual ramp up period in terms of actually getting traction out where the new capacity is in the new markets?","Donald W. Seale","Tom to answer that question, I'm going to use a horse analogy. They're chomping at the bit. They're ready to go when we are. And seriously, the capacity at some of these terminals, we've grown so quickly that our partners and ourselves, we know where the next tranche of growth is. And it will be turned on fairly quickly once we open the new terminals.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. If I can have one -- I guess one additional one on the coal. I know you talked about the call, but given that we haven't seen apparent switching or impact from low natural gas on your Utility Coal business in 2011, is it -- do you think maybe some of that happened a couple years ago? I guess there was a step down in your utility volumes probably 2 or 3 years ago. So is it partly that your older capacity that would have been affected by low natural gas already was affected a couple years ago? I guess it still seems kind the perplexing why you're not seeing an impact from that whereas CSX are seeing a pretty big impact.","Donald W. Seale","Tom, I will tell you that we did see an impact from low natural gas prices in our network in 2011. And we think that most of that impact has been realized at this point in terms of the plants that can actually burn gas and compete with coal. But we did see an impact in 2011.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Maybe sticking on coal, just kind of revisiting the discussion on coal yields. I'm just trying to get a sense of the volatility in the average revenue per car relative to the Northern versus Southern utilities. Was there any other moving parts in there? I mean, is there anything that we can tease out from the export perspective? Was price volatile at all on the quarter? And how should we think about that as we roll forward into kind of April 1 renewals just given the outlook that you guys have for export coal?","Donald W. Seale","No volatility in the export coal price but you will notice in the charts that I provided that our domestic, metallurgical coal market was up 8% in the quarter. And sequentially, from the third quarter to fourth quarter, we were flat on domestic metallurgical coal in the third quarter. It's profitable business, but it's shorter haul business for us with lower revenue per unit. So as domestic metallurgical coal goes higher, as domestic steel production goes higher, we will have some impact on RPU, but don't read anything into that other than mix.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So nothing from a profitability perspective, only simply from a mix perspective?","Donald W. Seale","Correct.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then if I could just switch gears with the follow-up over to the headcount side for 2012, Jim maybe if you could give us a sense of kind of what your thoughts are as far as growth in the fourth as we look at 2012 and then maybe what the cost inflation kind of aspect might look like?","James A. Squires","Sure. I'll take a shot at it and then I'll let Mark or Wick chime in as well. But I think we are at a point where we think we've leveled off in terms of T&E hiring. And we're at or close to where we want to be in terms of our T&E workforce. We do expect, however, to see increased hiring in engineering and mechanical ranks in 2012. And there, we are in a sense paralleling what we have done with our T&E workforce in 2011 and the latter part 2010 where we took it up an expectation of reaching a level that we think is sustainable. And we're going to repeat something like that pattern in 2012 for our mechanical and engineering workforces.","Charles W. Moorman","Yes, that's our plan right now. We tied some of that to even further service improvement initiatives. We'll clearly watch the headcount carefully. Another thing that we will be doing is making sure that we are hiring ahead of attrition. We have some demographics in the workforce. Those 2 workforces, in particular, that we need to manage through. So you look at all of that, we would expect some additional headcount growth, as Jim said. On the operating craft side, T&E looks pretty good right now. We think we're well positioned for volume growth this year and for actually for a ways beyond this year in T&E, and then everything else should be about what it is today.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, and the cost inflation, kind of exclusive. Do you have any stock-based compensation?","Charles W. Moorman","Go ahead, Jim.","James A. Squires","Sure. In the health and welfare cost arena, we are expecting a significant increase again for the full year. Now the premium is sort of up in the air. But we'll have an activity-based component increase in health and welfare costs of probably around $30 million or so for the full year. Our pay rates we're going to add, that's the agreement component by the way. Pay rates we're going to add something on the order of $50 million or so to comp and benefit expense for the full year. Our pension cost increases and other post-employment benefit cost increases are going to be a much more modest we think this year than they have in the last few years.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Gary Chase with Barclays Capital.","Garrett L. Chase - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wondered if I could just asked Don a couple of quick ones here. First, on the utility mix on the Northern utilities versus the Southern utilities. It sounded like the way you were describing things, you hadn't really seen a material change yet. I'm wondering if you think we should expect or could see during the course of 2012 a more substantial mix shift that would sort of alter the revenue dynamics and maybe revert back to where we were, say, in 2010 before you had that big change in the first quarter of last year.","Donald W. Seale","Gary, I would say that it all dependent upon the weather. What really happens with the rest of the winter, the shoulder months and then, of course, the cooling degree days that we have throughout the summer. And we just don't know how that's going to work out. As I mentioned earlier, we have reached close to target for most of our utilities in the South and most in the North with the exception of 2 locations.","Garrett L. Chase - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Give a sense of why this just seems to have been more volatile in the last, let's say, 12 to 18 months than at least I remember?","Donald W. Seale","Gary, volatility in what sense?","Garrett L. Chase - Barclays Capital, Research Division","It feels like the mix is shifting to a greater extent than at least I recall. Maybe that's not accurate.","Donald W. Seale","Well, we have a large utility network at 70% of our Coal business and we have a large domestic metallurgical coal franchise that goes to domestic coking. That's directly related to steel manufacturing. And of course, we've seen economic dislocations over the last 2 to 3 years that impacted steel production, automotive manufacturing, et cetera. So I don't think there's any fundamental shifts in the network itself. It's just the market dynamics have created different supply chain requirements at different times.","Garrett L. Chase - Barclays Capital, Research Division","It sounds like we should expect that to continue given the backdrop outlook most people have, right?","Donald W. Seale","Well, certainly we think the economy in North America in the U.S. is recovering slowly. We're seeing very encouraging signs across the board, even with housing, as I mentioned earlier. Some glimpse of improvement there. And everything considered, we think the economy looks better for 2012.","Charles W. Moorman","I think one answer to your question is, yes, there is going to always be some volatility. And unfortunately, it's not volatility that we can predict the timing of or the magnitude of. It's just part of our service franchise. And so, we'll see these swings from time to time. We're confident over the long term and the strength of the entire franchise.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Trahan.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","So obviously been a bunch of questions on coal and they've kind of been separate on export and utility. When you add it all together and you take export, the domestic utility and the domestic met, it sounds like the expectation is very positive volumes in 2012. And assuming that's -- I'm reading that correctly. When we have all the moving parts, how do you think about the overall mix impact within coal for 2012?","Donald W. Seale","Well again, we can't predict the weather. So on utility, we can't really give you any additional insight on that. The export market looks good based on world demand for high-quality coal. And as I mentioned, we're adding some steam coal to our mix for 2012 that will help with that overall volume number. And then, steel production in the U.S. looks better. It's tracking improved automobile production. So we think that, that will be better, so all 3 of those areas. And I'd also mentioned that in terms of the new coal production that is ramping up in 2012 across our network, in total, that could amount to as much as 6 million tons of additional production that's coming online. We don't know if all of that will come on line or not, but it has the potential for that.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","And is the new Illinois Basin coal, is that longer haul that the traditional App coal?","Donald W. Seale","When we take Illinois Basin Coal to the Southeast for utility, it is longer haul than Central App.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay, great. And then just lastly, just a high-level question for you, Don or for Wick. It seems like entering 2011, there is an opportunity to price the overall business a bit more aggressively to catch up with the market, and wondering where you think you stand today relative to the market. Is there another year or so, if you want to call it catch up where you can price aggressively? Or you think you're now more in line with the market and overall pricing increases maybe moderate a bit?","Donald W. Seale","We price to the market. And the truckload market based on some of the forecast for 2012 projects that, that industry will be running at 98% of capacity. If that projection is true, and we think it is, we have every reason to believe that pricing, as a result of the marketplace with truck will be robust, continuing to be a good opportunity for us. Barge capacity is also very tight, and we think that between those 2 modes, if both are tight, transportation demand is such that the capability of pricing above the weight of our real inflation will be there.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Ceraso with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A couple of items. It seems like the change in your operating ratio from Q3 to Q4, it increased a little bit more than it typically does. And I know there's a lot of noise in any given year. But do you recognize that things were a little bit weaker than typical? Was is the incentive that you mentioned? Was it a change in mix? Was there some slowdown in your pricing growth? Anything that we should note?","James A. Squires","I think, Chris, the headwind in the operating ratio to the extent there was one in the fourth quarter was really fuel driven. We mentioned the negative fuel surcharge lag effect. That held back operating ratio improvement to a meaningful degree. But you look at incremental margin in the quarter on a reported basis, 39% versus third quarter's 44%, again, thinking about the negative lag effect in the fourth quarter and a positive lag effect in the third quarter, pretty comparable really. So...","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Is that something that you get back towards 50 as we go forward?","James A. Squires","Well, it will be affected to some degree by trending fuel, and fuel -- WTI has moved up. So we've got a higher basis at least, thus far, into the first quarter. That will be a factor. And we'll just have to see as far as other elements and the results are concerned.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just a quick one. You mentioned an increase in export thermal coal. What's the profit profile of that compared to export met?","Donald W. Seale","We really -- as you know, we just don't get into the profitability of any particular component of our traffic.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Is it longer haul, shorter haul?","Donald W. Seale","It would be comparable in terms of length of haul.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I think this question is for Deb. At this point, it looks like about $240 million or so of PTC spend. I'm just wondering what is that purchasing at this point?","Deborah H. Butler","It's actually purchasing a lot of communications and signals work. We're getting on the right of way and installing some of the equipment that we need. We're also purchasing and installing equipment for our locomotives. And we are working not only internally and with vendors but with the rest of the rail industry on a very, very complex technological project. And that this to ensure the interoperability and to ensure that we have the technology and the communications in place to make PTC work. That is a time-consuming and expensive proposition. So really, it's a lot of roads, it's systems and it's locomotives for us for this year.","Donald W. Seale","Let me add one of the host of disturbing things about this whole initiative is that the cost, we have the 2015 mandate and we did this absolutely enormous project in just in terms of infrastructure we have to build out. We have started to build out PTC infrastructure today that we won't turn on for several years, but we have no alternative.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I see. And secondly, I guess, can you speak to the deployment and maybe performance year-to-date compared to your expectations of the throttle positions inflection guidance software that you've shown us in the past?","Donald W. Seale","LEADER has been rolled out most heavily during 2011 on our northern region between Chicago and New York, New Jersey. And we've got an increasing number of our operations. We have implemented most heavily on the Intermodal side, but now we've also gotten into Merchandise trains in that sector, as well as beginning to run unit trains, loaded and empty. And we'll continue rolling out in that area. And then about midway this year, we'll also start rolling that technology out toward Atlanta to our Crescent Corridor door, so we're looking forward to that.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And has the performance met your expectations?","Donald W. Seale","It really has. And the thing that -- one of the things that we've been concentrating on is getting our locomotive engineers comfortable with the technology. And as we go forward, we are seeing better and better utilization of that LEADER equipment.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Larkin with Stifel, Nicolaus.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I had a question on the labor situation. It's been kind of a complex negotiation, I guess, with 13 total unions. Is that right? I understand that at least 10 of them have ratified the new contracts and a couple of others are putting their contracts out to vote. But The Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Workers is still in negotiation. Is there any reason to believe that, that negotiation won't be wrapped up here before the end of the so called cooling-off period?","Charles W. Moorman","Well, we have -- first, your numbers are correct in terms of numbers of organization ratification. Each property has a separate negotiations going on with BMWE on issues that are specific to those properties that's wrapped around the BMWE's wish to have additional compensation in the form of travel expenses. I know that the negotiations are underway on every property they're certainly underway on ours, as to the likelihood that all of the carriers will reach agreement with BMWE. Prior to February 8, I really don't know that, that can happen. If it doesn't, then we'll clearly be back in the position of having to decide what further action is, and probably even talking with Congress about what might be done to avoid a work stoppage.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. And then your board approved another increase in the dividend, which is very nice, 9% I think you said. Looks to me like your yield is somewhere around 2.5% at the current level of the stock price, which leads the rail industry. Is it your strategy to continue to, more or less, be the dividend yield leader in the rail industry? Does that give you an advantage in some way at the capital markets? What's the general thinking there?","James A. Squires","John, we really don't think about the objective in terms of the yield. It's more of a target payout ratio of about 1\/3. That's really been our guiding play as far as dividend policies are concerned.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Anthony Gallo with Wells Fargo.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Questions for Jim and then a clarification for Jim as well. Question, materials expense, if I look at it on a gross ton-mile basis, it has continued to move higher over the last couple of years, particularly in 2011. Could you speak to that please, am I looking at it correctly?","James A. Squires","Yes, just addressing the materials and other expense increase as a category in the fourth quarters, as I mentioned. That increase was $35 million or 19%. Now the increase did reflect the higher equipment maintenance activities, and that was really one of the main drivers of the increase and we have been working hard to get our equipment fleet up to a point that we think that will sustain higher volumes going forward and better serves going forward. That's been an emphasis this year, and that will be -- and we'll be continuing with that next year. We're still coming off of a base that was pretty low in 2009 when we reduced expenses significantly. So through the course of 2010 and 2011, we're ramping up materials and related spending at a faster than activity base rate. We have some other things going on in materials and other expenses in the quarter, environmental remediation costs were 5 unfavorable in comparison. And a lot of little things going on there as well that made up the remainder of the 19% increase.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Is that some of the neat stuff you showed us at Altoona and if so does that mean that there's less spend elsewhere down the road?","James A. Squires","Well, certainly, having some of that material spending will be productivity generating down the road, for sure. So we are investing with some of that, and some of it is catch up of the 2009 low base as I mentioned.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, and then if I can. Clarification on the Chris Wetherbee question about wage and benefit inflation. I think the 2 numbers combined you gave was about $80 million through some additional, on top of that, is it right to think that wage and benefit growth year-over-year will be less than $100 million?","James A. Squires","I mentioned that the health and welfare cost number I cited was the activity component only and does not include a premium increase, which we do believe we will sustain. But at this point, we're not quite sure what it's going to be.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kaufman with Sterne Agee.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Jim, just quickly, you guys bought back a lot of stock this year, good purchase prices, but that is up. You've got increased spend on CapEx. You got increased spend on the dividend. When I think about share repurchase plans going forward, is there a certain level of debt, whether you think about it in terms of debt to EBITDA or however you think about it, that you just really don't want to go beyond right now, even if the share price were opportunistically attractive?","James A. Squires","Sure, sure. It is true that our debt is up but our debt to total capitalization ratio has been very stable and similarly other credit metrics, which actually improves some in 2011 notwithstanding a pretty high volume shareholder distributions. And our strategy with respect to buybacks going forward would be similar to what we've done in past years, and that is to dedicate incremental free cash flow, excess cash on hand, and incremental borrowing capacity within our target credit profile. So we will borrow to fund distributions as well as other uses of cash, if appropriate. But keeping in mind, our target credit metrics, which are similar to what we have today in summary of a strong Baa1, BBB+ credit profile.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with the Sanford Bernstein.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","If I could refocus the conversation a little bit on CapEx I think you've said we're to be -- you're expecting sort of bumping around that 20% of revenue number for the next couple of years. Is that correct?","Deborah H. Butler","Well, we didn't specify a percent of revenue. It's just that the question was had to do with the continued spending on PTC and some other things that had driven ethanol in the last couple of years. And we do think that to continue to spend on freight cars on facilities on PTC. But we aren't predicting or calibrating those expenses against as a percentage of revenue at this point.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Well, I mean, do you think the number will be coming down materially in the next couple of years?","Deborah H. Butler","No.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Is there -- is some amount of, I guess, I don't know clarity or applications you can set around what type of margin gains we could get off of that higher level of CapEx?","James A. Squires","Well, as Deb outlined, we don't expect any margin enhancement on PTC. We are really in the process of replacing our coal car fleet. Now we will see productivity improvements as the result because the new cars are higher capacity than our existing fleet. So you'll see some productivity enhancements there. As we continue to invest in new Intermodal terminals, as Don has outlined, that creates more market opportunity for us, which we're comfortable we'll realize. And then, as he made some investments in things like technology and infrastructure, we would expect to see that lead to increased network velocity and service improvements.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And to the extent that there's some expectations around what that margin gain could be, I'm just trying to think if I step back and I look at the numbers over the last 5 years or so, CapEx is up about 85% volumes off by 10%, and the margins have gained by about 170 bps. So to the extent that the CapEx number keeps going up a lot every year, would you see some point where you'll see an inflection in the margin improvement relative to the capital spend or...","James A. Squires","I don't think we have analyzed it quite that way. We do expect to drive additional efficiencies and some margin improvement. But as to quantifying it, I don't think we can do that.","Donald W. Seale","David, we wouldn't be investing the money if we didn't think we could generate higher profits and better margin from it. Now PTC is a bit of a exception to that statement. But otherwise, the capital spending is going toward projects which we think will generate higher profits and better margin.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Neal Deaton with BB&T Capital Markets.","Edward Neal Deaton - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Just really quick, going back to the health and welfare inflation figures. Jim, I know you mentioned the $30 million figure and the $50 million figure. I think that's where Jeff is getting $80 million. I wanted to see would you mind just clarifying again, if you would, what those 2 components were?","James A. Squires","Sure. The $30 million I mentioned is the activity component or the employment, the additional employment component of the health and welfare benefit costs increase we're expecting. And that's for the agreement workforce, which is the preponderance of our additional workforce that we're expecting in 2012. And then there's another component of that, which is the premium that we've had and that's somewhat uncertain right now. The second figure I mentioned was pay rates, a total of $50 million approximately year-over-year increase. The majority of which will be for agreement pursuant to the collective bargaining agreements with negotiator.","Operator","We have no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing remarks.","Charles W.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Michael Hostutler, Director of Investor Relations for Norfolk Southern. Thank you. You may now begin.","Michael Hostutler ","Thank you, and good morning. Before we begin today's call, I would like to mention a few items. First, the slides of the presenters are available on our website in the Investors section. Additionally, transcripts and MP3 downloads of today's call will be posted on our website for your convenience.","Please be advised that any forward-looking statements made during the course of the call represent our best good-faith judgment as to what may occur in the future. Statements that are forward-looking can be identified by the use of words such as believe, expect, anticipate and project. Our actual results may differ materially from those projected and will be subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which may be outside of our control.","Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for discussions of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Additionally, keep in mind that all references to reported results, excluding certain adjustments, that is non-GAAP numbers, have been reconciled on our website in the Investors section.","Now, it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern Chairman and CEO, Wick Moorman.","Charles W. Moorman","Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. It is my pleasure to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are several members of our senior team, including our President, Jim Squires; our Chief Marketing Officer, Don Seale; our Chief Operating Officer, Mark Manion; and Marta Stewart, our Chief Financial Officer. I am pleased to announce that Norfolk Southern had an excellent fourth quarter. We achieved fourth quarter record highs in revenues, income from operations, net income and earnings per share. As you know, these fourth quarter results capped an outstanding 2013 performance and led to record results for the full year including all-time highs for revenues, operating ratio, income from operations and earnings per share.","Looking at our top line. Revenues for the fourth quarter were $2.9 billion, an increase of $197 million or 7%. Overall volumes rose 4% as a decline in coal volumes was more than offset by growth in merchandise and Intermodal traffic.","For the full year revenues were $11.2 billion, a 2% increase over 2012 despite a 12% decline in coal revenue. And as usual, Don will provide you with all of the revenue details in a few minutes.","The combination of volume increases coupled with our continued focus on expense control resulted in net income for the quarter of $513 million, up 24% year-over-year and diluted earnings per share of $1.64, up 26%.","For the full year net income and earnings per share increased 9% and 12%, respectively. Marta will provide you with all of the financial details.","The railroad ran extremely well in the fourth quarter. This was a continuation of the superior service levels we maintained for all of 2013 with sustained high metrics in network velocity and terminal dwell throughout the year. These metrics were, in turn, were important drivers in our ability to maintain a high average composite service index. And as we have said many times before, an efficiently run network helps in our efforts to keep expenses under control. Mark will give you all of the fourth quarter operating results.","In 2014, we will continue our focus on improving customer service and running our network efficiently. Part of that plan is strong capital investment and Marta will provide you some details of our planned $2.2 billion capital program.","At this point, I'll turn the program over to Don and the rest of the team, and I'll return with some closing remarks before we take questions. Don?","Donald W. Seale","Thank you, Wick, and good morning. Revenue during the fourth quarter was $2.9 billion, up $197 million or 7% versus 2012. We set new quarterly records in Intermodal of $618 million, up 6%, and merchandise with $1.6 billion, up 12%. These favorable results were partially offset by a 2% decline in Coal revenue due to lower volumes of utility and domestic metallurgical coal. With respect to the components of revenue growth, higher volumes across the business accounted for increased revenue of $105 million. Favorable price and mix accounted for $41 million of the overall gain, while higher fuel surcharge revenue accounted for $51 million year-over-year. Total volume for the quarter increased by nearly 70,000 units or 4%, with revenue per unit of $1,547, up $49 or 3%.","Turning to revenue per unit on the next slide. Coal RPU in the quarter was up 7%, driven primarily by favorable export coal mix and a $15 million volume shortfall settlement with one of our utility customers.","Merchandise RPU was up 4%, and Intermodal RPU was down 1% as compared to last year. Total revenue per unit was up 3% based on improved pricing, increased fuel surcharge revenue and a favorable mix and contract settlement that I just mentioned in our utility coal market.","Turning to the next slide in volume. With respect to volume as shown on Slide 4, total shipments for the quarter were up 4% with robust growth in Intermodal and Merchandise, offsetting an 8% decline in coal volume. Strong volume growth within Merchandise during the quarter was driven by gains in all 5 commodity groups.","Drilling down into our major markets, starting with Coal. Revenue for the quarter was $641 million, down $16 million or 2% for the quarter. Weaker demand across nearly all markets resulted in an overall volume decline of 8%. Utility coal, which was the largest driver of the decline, was down nearly 20,000 carloads or 9%. Volumes in the North were up an estimated 1% versus last year, while Southern Utility volumes were down 18%. That was driven by continuing competition from natural gas and excess stockpiles at Southern Utilities.","Export shipments were down 8%, largely due to declines in steam coal at the Port of Baltimore, partially offset by higher fourth quarter volumes at Lamberts Point in Norfolk, which increased by 13%.","In the Domestic Metallurgical Coal segment, volume was down 14% for the quarter as a result of reduced demand from our steel customers. But on a positive note, industrial coal increased 11% due to business gains.","Turning to our Intermodal business. Revenue in the quarter reached an all-time high of $618 million, up $34 million or 6% over fourth quarter 2012, driven by 6% higher volumes. Revenue per unit declined by 1% due to positive pricing being offset by decreases in the fuel surcharge. Volume gains in Intermodal came from both our domestic and international markets. Domestic volume was up 7% due to continued highway conversions, while organic growth across our international accounts boosted international volume by 6%. Much of this growth moved in our expanded and enhanced Intermodal corridors, running an efficient double-stack train service.","Our highest performing sector in the fourth quarter was our merchandise group, which set a new revenue record of $1.6 billion, up $179 million or 12% over the last year driven by an 8% increase in volume combined with a 4% higher revenue per unit.","Metals & Construction, our largest market segment, experienced a 1% increase in volume due primarily to increased shipments of iron, steel, and higher shipments of frac sand and miscellaneous construction materials. These gains were somewhat tempered by lower aggregates volumes.","Moving to the agriculture market, which was up 6% in volume, increased corn and soybean volumes offset declines in our feed markets. Corn shipments were up 23% driven by increases in short haul movements to Midwestern processors, and longer haul volume to ethanol producers. A favorable export market also drove increased shipments of soybeans over Gulf and Atlantic ports.","Our Chemicals volume was up 22% for the quarter, continuing the benefit from strong growth in crude oil. Increased shipments of natural gas liquids, industrial intermediates and plastics also boosted growth in this group.","Turning to Automotive. Volume was up 10%, more than double the projected North American vehicle production increase for the quarter as a result of new business and increased production at plants we serve.","And finally, Paper volumes were up 2% with a 16% increase in lumber and a 13% increase in pulp volumes offset by declines in waste and scrap materials.","Now concluding with our outlook for 2014. We see growth opportunities ahead in our Intermodal and Merchandise markets, while the Coal market continues to present challenges and headwinds. While demand for electricity was up 2% in the fourth quarter, 2014 demand is still expected to be sluggish, particularly in the South. In the export market, we continue to expect a challenging environment with strong competition in the Atlantic metallurgical coal market and soft demand and oversupply of thermal coal.","On the upside, our outlook for Intermodal remains bright as we continue to add attractive freight to our new Corridors and Terminals. The South Carolina Inland Port opened in the fourth quarter, and our new Charlotte Terminal officially opened December 9. Highway conversions and growth with our international shipping partners represent ongoing opportunities, and we will remain strongly focused on delivering superior Intermodal service and efficiencies across our double stack network.","In our Merchandise markets, we anticipate continued strength in crude by rail, as well as shale related liquid petroleum gases. Frac sand shipments into the shale production regions should continue to grow as hydraulic fracturing technology evolves and requires higher volumes of sand.","Within our Metals markets, U.S. steel production is projected to expand by 5% during 2014 due to increased steel usage in the auto sector and the recovery in construction market. Automotive production will continue to see solid growth as North American light vehicle production is projected to increase 3% in 2014. And we expect growth opportunities ahead in both agriculture and forest products as the larger crop in housing recoveries spur increased shipping activity throughout the year.","In summary, our market-based diversity, high-quality service and ongoing network investments continued to support steady growth despite headwinds in the coal market. With respect to the overall value of our service product, we will continue to employ market-based pricing that equals or exceed rail inflation to support ongoing investment both in our infrastructure and service delivery capabilities. We'll also continue to focus on developing new markets and providing the safest and most cost-efficient service possible to all of our customers.","Thank you for your attention, and I'll turn it over to Mark.","Mark D. Manion","Thank you, Don. Starting with safety performance, our personal injury performance for the fourth quarter stands at 1.28, and for the full year, 1.15. 2013 marked an important shift in our approach to safety improvements at Norfolk Southern. Our operations, managers and workforce have all attended behavior-based leadership training and we've implemented a new approach in behavior-based safety. We like the fact that we are seeing a more engaged workforce and while we haven't reduced the number of overall injuries, we've seen an 11% drop in serious injuries.","Looking at our train accidents, we've seen a slight uptick in incidents to 2.4 per million train miles. These have been related primarily to switching and storm-related occurrences earlier in the year. Crossing accidents for 2013 was down slightly from the prior year at 3.5 per million train miles.","Moving on to service performance. Our composite service metric reflects a consistently high performance through the year. For 2013, the service composite was a best ever 83.3%. In the fourth quarter, our service composite was 82.4% and reflects typical seasonal patterns with operations around the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, as well as strong Intermodal and unit train volumes. We continue to see very solid performance in fluid operations through the period.","Turning to the next slide. Continued high service performance is also reflected in train speed, a primary component of network velocity. Train speed over the last couple of years, has remained consistently at historically high levels. In the fourth quarter, train speed averaged 23.8 miles an hour, and for the full year, 23.9 miles an hour.","Moving on to Terminal Dwell, the second major component of network velocity, there again we've sustained have very high levels of performance over the last couple of years. Terminal Dwell in 2013 averaged 21.6 hours. The fourth quarter was 21.9 hours reflecting the normal seasonal variation due to curtailment of operations around the Christmas holiday period.","In the fourth quarter, we saw efficiency gains in many of the same areas where we saw improvement throughout the year. With volume increases, we were still able to reduce crew starts by 1% in the fourth quarter and 3% for the full year. In the fourth quarter, merchandise shipments increased 8% while crew starts increased only 2%.","In Intermodal, shipments increased 7% while crew starts increased only 1%. In coal, both shipments and crew starts declined 8%.","T&E overtime hours increased only 1% against a volume increase of 4% in the fourth quarter and for the full year, where the volume increase of 3%, we were able to reduce overtime hours by 10%. We continued to reduce re-crews by 5% in the fourth quarter versus the same time period last year, and we saw a reduction of 9% for the full year.","Taking advantage of existing train capacity for new volume growth, carloads per locomotive improved 4% in the fourth quarter consistent with the patterns we've seen most of the year. Fuel efficiency in the fourth quarter was negatively impacted by a colder December, but the general trend has been improving as reflected in the 1% improvement for the full year. That's a trend we expect to continue going forward. With strong network performance, combined with a number of ongoing productivity initiatives, we fully expect to see in excess of $100 million in productivity and leverage gains in 2014.","Thank you. And now, Marta, I'll turn it over to you.","Marta R. Stewart","All right. Thank you, Mark. I'll now review our fourth quarter financial results, which as Wick mentioned rammed out a year of record performance. I'll close with an overview of the full year financials and discuss our capital spending plan for 2014.","Slide 2 summarizes our quarterly operating results. Don reviewed the 7% revenue increase in detail and recall that it was largely driven by a 4% improvement in volume. On the 4% unit growth, expenses rose only $30 million or 2%. That leverage translated into record fourth quarter income from operations of $881 million, up 23%. The resulting 69.4 operating ratio improved 400 basis points.","The next slide shows the major components of the $30 million net increase in expenses. Compensation and benefits drove most of the increase and fuel costs were also higher. However, lower expenses for purchase services partly offset the increases.","Now let's take a closer look at each of these categories. Compensation costs rose by $35 million or 5%. The first couple of items continued the trends seen in the prior 3 quarters of the year. Higher pay rates increased expenses by $14 million, while reduced employee activity levels lowered cost by $10 million. Much of this is directly related to the crew start to volume relationship that Mark discussed with you.","The third item, higher incentive compensation reflects a $22 million increase in the bonus accrual driven by the strong fourth quarter results. For 2014, we expect the wage rate and labor hour trends to continue. Additionally, we expect lower accruals for pension and postretirement medical liability. This is largely due to a combination of strong equity returns, which increased the planned assets; and a higher discount rate, which reduced the plan liabilities. This will result in approximately $25 million of lower quarterly accruals in 2014 versus 2013.","Moving on to fuel expense. It rose by a net of $8 million or 2%. As Mark mentioned, the increase in consumption exceeded our traffic volume increase and was largely due to the colder weather. Offsetting the unfavorable consumption was a lower price. The average price paid per gallon was $3.02 this fourth quarter versus $3.24 in the fourth quarter of 2012. Depreciation expense was flat for the quarter as lower equipment rates resulting from our depreciation study completed in 2013 offset the effects of a higher capital base.","Going forward, we expect depreciation in 2014 to return to a more normalized increase of about $10 million a quarter.","Side 7 addresses the $12 million or 3% decline in purchased services and rent. Most of the reduction was due to last year's $15 million charge for an accident that occurred on Conrail in November of 2012. The remaining variances in this category were small with increases in volume related costs, but decreases in roadway repair costs and legal and consulting fees.","The materials and other categories shown on the next slide was basically flat. Higher mechanical materials expenses and smaller miscellaneous expenses were more than offset by $22 million of favorable development in the accruals for prior year injury claims. As you know, we have experienced a net favorable development in recent quarters in our actuarially determined casualty claims expenses. While we may see additional favorable development in the coming quarters, we do not expect it to the extent seen in the past several quarters. As a result, total expenses for casualties and other claims in 2014 will likely be closer to the levels we saw in 2012.","Turning to our non-operating items. Increased returns from corporate-owned life insurance were largely offset by reduced coal royalties, a result of lower coal production. Interest expense on debt was up $8 million due to the increased borrowings.","Next, income taxes totaled $270 million and the effective tax rate was 34.5%, compared to 33.5% in 2012. 2012 included a $6 million benefit related to the completion of an IRS examination. Additionally, both periods benefited from state tax adjustments that we do not expect to recur. Therefore, looking forward, the effective rate in 2014 will likely be close to the combined federal and state statutory rates of about 37.5%.","Wrapping up our quarterly overview, net income and EPS comparisons are displayed on Slide 11. Both measures set fourth quarter records. Net income was $513 million, an increase of $100 million or 24%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.64, up $0.34 per share or 26%.","Focusing next on the full year results. Revenues were up 2%, while operating expenses rose only 1%. This resulted in income from railway operations of $3.3 billion, a 4% increase, which generated a 70-basis-point improvement in the operating ratio to an all-time annual record of 71.0%.","Net income for the year, shown on Slide 13, was $1.91 billion. Excluding the large land sale in the first quarter, net income would have been about $1.85 billion, up 6%, and earnings per share would have been $5.85, an increase of 9%.","As shown on the next slide, cash from operations covered capital spending and produced $1.1 billion in free cash flow. We distributed $637 million in dividends and applied $627 million towards the repurchase of 8.3 million shares. Cash and short-term investments totaled $1.6 billion at year end. We have concluded a record year with a strong balance sheet and full confidence in our outlook, which is a great segue into our 2014 capital spending highlights. Here we show historical and budgeted capital expenditures. The 2014 total of $2.2 billion is a 12% increase over 2013, and about even with 2012 and 2011.","As reflected on the following slide, and similar to previous years, the majority of our capital expenditures, roughly 2\/3, will be invested in replacement and core projects. This includes improving the condition of the ride away, rebuilding locomotive, and replacing freight cars and other equipment. A quarter of the budget reflected here in green, supports traffic growth or productivity projects, including additional locomotive, as well as the yard and siding expansion. The remaining 10% of the budget will be spent on positive train control.","A more detailed listing of the categories is shown on Slide 17. Our capital plan was constructed to maintain the safety and quality of the network to improve service and operational efficiency and to support business growth. Thank you, and I'll now turn the program back to Wick.","Charles W. Moorman","Thanks, Marta. As you've heard, Norfolk Southern punctuated 2013 with an excellent fourth quarter, with strong volume and revenue increases even in the face of continuing declines in our coal franchise. So real story of 2013 was the ability of our team to run the railroad at a sustained high velocity, providing superior service for our customers, and at the same time delivering continued operating efficiencies. While the extreme weather conditions we've seen in January have slowed the entire North American rail network, we are confident in our ability to drive further productivity and service improvements in the months ahead.","Looking ahead, it certainly seems like the economy may be improving at a somewhat faster pace than we saw in 2013. As Don told you, the outlook for most of our business segments is good, but coal still remains the wildcard.","Regardless of the near term forecast for any of the markets we serve, we do remain very confident that the strength of our franchise and our long-term strategy of providing excellent service at rates that enable us to reinvest in the business and provide excellent returns for our shareholders. Marta described one part of that strategy in terms of our 2014 capital budgets, where we're investing to grow the business, as well as maintain all of our assets in top class condition. Another part of that strategy was illustrated yesterday with the announcement that we're raising our dividend by $0.02 per share, a strong indication of the confidence that we and our board have in our ability to execute our plans for growth. That confidence springs from our belief in the strength of the Norfolk Southern team who are the best in the business, and we believe that our fourth quarter and full year 2013 results are just one more indication of why they're the best. Thanks, and we'll open it up now for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of William Greene of Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Don, can I ask you to sort of offer a little bit more clarity on your comments as you look forward because we had a good fourth quarter trends and we've had some weather here starting out in the first quarter. And so, when we look at the January trends, do you feel like the underlying improvements are consistent with the kind of strength we saw in the fourth quarter? I'm just curious, kind of how to think about some of these calendar effects and weather, and what the underlying outlook really is?","Donald W. Seale","The first 2 weeks of January have been weaker because of the weather. We've seen about a 22% jump in our volumes in the next week after those first 2 weeks, the third week. So we think volumes are going to be fine. We will make up most of the business or all of the business that was deferred because of the first 2 weeks of bad weather. So I feel pretty good about the ongoing volumes in the Merchandise and Intermodal business. As I indicated, I'm not so robust or optimistic with respect to coal.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then on that point, as we start to renegotiate utility contracts, the rail industry generally has been very disciplined on price there. Do we feel like these next round of negotiations given where natural prices are given the concerns longer-term, and regulation or what not, do the utilities have a lot more leverage here, such that we need to be thinking about there may have to be some givebacks, if you will, so to speak, on price, i.e., not as much upside left there?","Donald W. Seale","Well, Bill, the market continues to evolve and certainly, gas is competing with coal more effectively. We'll take that into account as we address our contract renegotiations. We have only about 16% of our utility book this year under renegotiation to complete by the end of the year. We are engaged with those discussions now and as we did -- as we always do, we take into account current market factors and market conditions as we reprice.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Actually, I wanted to ask a question about crude by rail and the concerns surrounding the composition of Bakken crude and it's low flashpoint characteristics. And given that Norfolk is a connecting carrier, what is really in your control in terms of taking some extra safety precautions in order to avoid an accident? And are you in active discussions or working with the originating carriers to implement any additional procedures?","Donald W. Seale","Well, Alison, the entire industry, quite clearly, is focused on this. So we're in very active discussions across the North American railroad industry as to how best to manage this growing business. And we're also very clearly in discussions with the producers and with the regulators, and so there are really 3, I think, central issues that we are talking about. The first is, of course, the safety of rail operations. The railroads have a great safety story. Our numbers have consistently gotten better over the past 20 years now. There's always more we can do and we're looking at different operating practices, possibly doing some things on speed and routing, and we'll continue to work hard on making it a safer operation, not only for Norfolk Southern, but for all of the carriers. The second thing that I think there's a lot of discussion about is what you mentioned, and that is what exactly are the characteristics of the crude that's coming out of the Bakken. It's certainly more volatile than we originally thought, than any of us originally thought. And I know that the regulators are very concerned with that and taking a hard look at it. And then the third issue is the tank car issue and what is the appropriate safety standard for the tank cars that will be transporting, not only the crude oil, but ethanol and other substances. In addition, there's a new standard. The industry voluntarily adopted in 2011 and the cars that have been built since that time are to this newer safer standard, but there's clearly going to be an evolution there in terms of what's the ultimate tank car design for these kinds of materials. And there is a lot of work underway on the part of, not only the rails, but the car owners, our customers, and the leasing companies as well to come up with that new standard and to understand exactly what we'll do with the cars that are out there now.","Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. That's very comprehensive answer. Just as they -- my follow-up question. How much of latent volume upside do you believe that Norfolk has related to the housing recovery and some expected improvement in non-resi construction market?","Donald W. Seale","The housing market is a bright spot for '14. We expect starts to be up in the range of 23%, 24%. There's a strong multiplier effect to that market as it expands. Obviously, I mentioned our lumber traffic was up 16% in the fourth quarter. But we also receive plastics, polyvinyl chloride on the chemical side, PVC pipe going into housing, roofing granules for roofing. There's a range of commodities that we transport that are favorably impacted by that increase in housing starts.","Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Any volume, sort of magnitude that you could place on that?","Charles W. Moorman","We'll have to wait to see how it shakes out, but we feel good about the prospects.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Maybe just a question on the coal side, if I could. When your eastern competitor mentioned roughly a 20% decline in their outlook for export coal. Obviously, they're a little bit more heavier in the thermal market. I just wanted to get a rough sense of how you think, Don, about the outlook for 2014, specifically on the export side of coal.","Donald W. Seale","We completed the year with about 29 million -- right at 29 million tons of export coal of which, 80% was metallurgical and 20% roughly was thermal coal. We all watched the API 2 index with respect to export thermal coal. We know it's not strong. We know U.S. producers face cost production -- cost of production challenges participating in that lower-priced market. And also, we're seeing some challenges with respect to the met coal exports from U.S. as well because of the low settled price that U.S. producers are facing. So we don't expect our export market to be as strong in '14 as it was in '13.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And order of magnitude, does that sound like that's -- yes, I guess it's a little bit more weighted toward the thermal side, so that would make sense. I guess maybe my follow-up question would just be on understanding sort of the dynamic within coal yields, specifically. So obviously, if you add back the liquidated damages benefit you got in the quarter, it seems like yields were roughly flat from the third quarter to the fourth quarter? Is that right way to think about it? Doesn't sound like you have a lot of exposure on the utility side in '14. And I guess exports are going to be what they are. Just a little curious on how should we be thinking about that?","Donald W. Seale","Yes, in the quarter itself, the $15 million liquidated damage accrual, if we deducted that instead of a 7% increase in revenue per unit, we would had a 4% increase in revenue per unit. And that was driven off favorable export, longer haul export volumes to the port of Norfolk that I mentioned.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And going forward, I guess we'll have to see how the mix persists. But I guess with the way utility contracts are working, there's nothing that should change materially on that as we roll into '14 at least.","Donald W. Seale","That's true.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A question for Wick. At the end of that prepared remarks, you talked about the economy gaining steam. I just wanted to potentially get a little bit more color from you on what that was predicated on. Obviously, we've seen strong numbers from the ISM. Housing starts are supposed to be up this year, but I think we all know that just because the economic data looks good doesn't necessarily mean it will be good. So I'm curious if you're getting it as from customer conversations that you're expecting CapEx across the board to be up or if this is more based on just kind of a same dashboard stuff that we're all looking at so any color would be really helpful.","Charles W. Moorman","Well, I think it's a couple of things, Justin. I think, one is we all do look at the same dashboards and there, we certainly see, as Don mentioned all of these things, some continued strength in autos. I think the steel manufacturers feel a little better about next year. Certainly, housing, it's going to get better, the pace is still to be determined. So all of those factors weigh into it. I think the other thing that just kind of makes us feel a little better about the direction of the economy is as we look at our second half volumes and really our, to some extent, our fourth quarter volumes as compared to the first half of 2013. I would tell you in the first half of 2013, we were less sure about the economy. And as the year went on, we felt better about a lot of our business segments. And we don't see anything on the horizon right now, simply because it does seem to be not going on little quieter in Washington that might provide a serious threat for that.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","All right that's fair. One question, just as a follow-up on the Intermodal markets really haven't talked about much. Our RPU is actually down year-over-year for you guys. Curious, it looks like your competitor is starting to see a little bit of a resurgence in their Domestic business with on-highway conversions being better. Curious how you guys think about Eastern Intermodal market share and how you'd rate the fourth quarter performance from your standpoint. And when you think about the competitive dynamic in 2014, do you think it's getting tougher? Or are you guys still confident that with all the investments you've made, you'll still have the premier domestic network?","Donald W. Seale","It's the latter. We remain confident with the investments, the network that we have developed, the new terminals, the services and products that we've launched. And also, the capability of providing a high-quality product, service product that's truly competitive with the Highway. Our growth is going to come from the Highway. It's coming from the Highway. That will continue. And with respect to the revenue per unit, as I mentioned in the quarter, the fuel surcharge actually was the largest driver of the 1% decline. Revenue was up 6%. We still believe that the trucking industry will face some capacity constraints in the face of hours-of-service regulation's, as well as the economy wraps up in demand increases. That capacity won't be as available as it is today. So the outlook for Intermodal, in our view, in terms of coordinated conversion from the Highway into a highly efficient network that we've invested and remains very bright.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So you think -- I mean, obviously, I don't want you to speak for them, but do you think their surge in traffic was probably more driven by more loads getting converted to the real? Or did you guys feel like you had any high-profile losses on the margin in the quarter from customers' standpoint?","Donald W. Seale","In every quarter, you have to look at the comps from the previous year and the Sandy effect. And it all the impacted volumes and increases throughout the Easter network in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted -- so I wanted to just follow up briefly on just the part of Justin's last question. Your Crescent Corridor, maybe could you just tell me how much Crescent Corridor volumes grew in fourth quarter? And then I guess in terms of the pace that we had seen in the last couple of quarters, maybe it hadn't been quite a strong a contributor to overall Intermodal volume growth as we had anticipated, given the capacity investment. Is that something when you look at 2014 that you would say \u201cCrescent Corridor is going to be a bigger driver of your overall Intermodal volume growth?\u201d","Donald W. Seale","Tom, this is Don. With respect to your first part of your question, question in the quarter, Crescent was up 6%. For the year, it was up 8%. Hartland was up 9% in the fourth quarter. For the year, it was up 16%. So you can see that gives you a flavor of the percentage increases. And as we have pointed out, as we've invested in high-efficiency service competitive with the highway, we're being very focused with respect to the business we're bringing on in these corridors to ensure that this business pays for itself and generates the type of return that we're seeking with the investments that we've made. So we're not looking to load up the network in 1 to 2 or 3 quarters. What we are looking for is good high-quality freight that we will continue to handle over time. Does that makes sense?","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, sure. That's great. That's very helpful. And I guess my follow-up would also probably be for you, Don. Your yield performance revenue per car can often be affected by mix. I think of the 2013 yields, there was probably some mix effect in coal and short-haul growth and things like that and maybe some other mix effects, and also export. How would you want us to think about the mix effect? And also the impact from export coal pricing as we forecast yields in 2014?","Donald W. Seale","Tom, as I pointed out earlier, we expect lower export volumes in 2014 with respect to overall exports. We think the thermal component will be weaker. We also think the met coal component will be weaker as well. And the market, hopefully, is at the bottom with respect to world prices in that $135 to $140 range, actually a lower than that right now on met coal. The API 2 is $85 or less, it's bouncing around $85 a ton. So with those dynamics, we think export will continue -- we are where we are on pricing, I would tell you that. We're not planning to make any adjustments this quarter in export pricing. But with respect to overall demand, we see a softer outlook there. Hopefully, with the weather that we are seeing, stockpiles in the South on our utility network, will normalize. And we think that's underway. Not there yet, but it's underway. That is longer haul, higher RPU traffic. So if we get some replenishment of stockpiles in the South, that would be a favorable mix impact as export is softer.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So mix on export would be -- or I guess, export impact on yield would be negative, maybe on utility as positive. And then, I guess, overall mix effect, do you want to comment on that?","Donald W. Seale","The overall mix effect, we think, in merchandise, will continue to be comparable to what we're seeing right now. No significant changes. We will continue to see our non-coal energy component of our business increase, and that includes everything from crude oil to natural gas liquids to ethanol, to frac sand. Things that we're putting into that bucket, which I will tell you, Tom, in the fourth quarter and for the year is close to 10% of our merchandise business of our volume now.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Anthony Gallo with Wells Fargo.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to go back to crude by rail. Maybe if you could speak to what you see as your capacity to expand that. Could you double the business, for example, based on current resources? And then I have a follow-up question on your potential regional railroad partners with crude by rail.","Donald W. Seale","Well, in terms of capacity, the vast majority of this crude moves across our northern region, which is, for the most part, double or triple track. It's a very high capacity railroad so we certainly have the infrastructure to expand. We can accommodate it with a crew base that we have, so we have a lot of room to grow. The ultimate limitation on crude by rail for -- in the East, really, is just purely the number of refineries. And there are, as you know, a number of refineries from Delaware up to Coast, all the way to Nova Scotia, I guess, and a lot of them are already taking crude by rail. There are others that are preparing to, in terms of infrastructure. But that's the limitation. And that will be the cap on the total crude by rail if it moves in across Norfolk Southern, or for that matter, moves across the Eastern part of the U.S..","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Certainly. And then as a follow up. Do you do any business with regional railroads and I am thinking about in the context of some of these regulatory changes that may ultimately change the liability aspect of that and to the extent, some of these smaller regional railroads might not be able to handle it because of that. Is there any interaction with regional railroads that you have, where we should worry about maybe they are liability risk if the regulatory environment does change?","Charles W. Moorman","And you're talking about interaction in terms of the crude business?","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Exactly.","Charles W. Moorman","The answer is not really. The crude by rail that we handle, as far as I'm aware, I'm looking at Mark, we don't hand it off to -- really don't hand it off to anyone. It moves Norfolk Southern direct or moves into the shared assets area.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a quick question, just a follow-up on Intermodal. It looks like -- I know you pointed toward an improvement in economy, you pointed toward the trucking capacity constraints. All of that is suggestive that things in the environment should get better in 2014, particularly from a competitive environment with truck. But am I right in assuming that you haven't seen that yet, the impact of that tighter capacity on truck and the better economy playing itself out in contract repricing that you're doing in the Intermodal today?","Charles W. Moorman","Walter, on spot pricing, yes. On our contract pricing that tends to run year-to-year, no. We are in that period in the first 90 days of this year, so we will see some of that playing out in our current negotiations. As you know on spot, we see that fairly immediately. But with a lot of our Intermodal business being run at commitments for at least 1 year, this is a -- an active time of replacing of that into Intermodal business in the first quarter.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","But it's safe to say that the spot trend is a good leading indicator to how your contracts are going to develop?","Charles W. Moorman","Certainly, the spot trend is positive. I cannot tell you that it's going to translate into contracts because we're facing motor carrier competition. And before we convert it, they attempt to hold onto it.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Second question here, I don't know if it's for Mark or for Marta. Mark, the employee count, I'm looking back at my notes what you were kind of indicating toward the end of the year when we spoke at third quarter. It looks like it came in a little bit better than what you would kind of indicated it. As we go into 2014, how do you see the seasonality? And accounting for all the seasonality, how do you see the employee count kind of evolving as we go through 2014?","Mark D. Manion","Well, we have had a pretty good reduction during 2013. And as we go forward, I think we'll stay relatively flat. The -- we've got a couple of areas where we will, just because of -- there are various efficiencies and productivity initiatives that are going on, we'll continue to see some reduction. But of course, particularly with respect to our T&E forces, all that is very dependent on what the volumes are. So relatively flat.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And on the wage inflation side, Marta you'd indicated that we should still see the same level of trends although perhaps not as much on the kind of incentive compensation. And so for -- in other words, are we looking at just base wage inflation now as we project in the 2014? Or there are other factors that we should consider?","Marta R. Stewart","Yes. The wage inflation should be about the same. There'll be a union wage increase in the middle of the year as there was this year. And the portion I spoke to was a reduction in pension and postretirement, medical cost. We think those will be down as a result of our plans being in a better funded position this year.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, but offsetting some of these stock-based compensation lift that we might not see the same kind of growth next year?","Marta R. Stewart","Well we really think the incentive compensation in the quarter was heavy, but year-over-year annualized should be about the same.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen and Company.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I want to go back to your commentary on your crew starts. It looks like they were down 1%, I think, you said in 4Q, but 3% for the year. So should we expect that 1% level to continue? Or is that going to be challenging as we see volumes grow?","Mark D. Manion","Well, we certainly have got more of a challenge just because we've got a real winter this year, so that will have an effect in the short term. Beyond that, I don't know that we'll see the -- some of the steep rate of reduction that we saw in 2013. But again, with some of the various improvements we've got going on into 2014, I think we'll still continue to see a positive trend.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And following up on some of the Intermodal questions. You mentioned that you're seeing, Don, some improvement, I think, on the spot. I don't think I caught it. Could you remind us what percent you guys have that's more spot or transactional in nature? And how quickly do you think you could react to sort of a tightening truckload market to bring in your existing spot rates up.","Donald W. Seale","Most of our business is committed. I would say the spot is in the range of 15% of the book.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And you can change that spot pretty quickly?","Donald W. Seale","Well, not really. That's -- that percentage continues in a fairly stable way. It's not changeable because we have commitments and change of price.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","No, what I'm saying is the spot price that you have is very fluid in terms of the current marketplace?","Donald W. Seale","That's correct.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens.","Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Mark, first question for you. I was wondering if you could provide an update on where things stand on the implementation of both LEADER and Movement Planner? And also, as you think about your $100 million plus productivity target for 2014, how much of that amount is coming from those 2 items?","Donald W. Seale","Well. As far as both LEADER and Movement Planner, Movement Planner is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2014. So we'll see a pretty rapid rollout of, essentially, the last half of our system this year. That will be very good. LEADER, we will get most of the system, as the core part of the system covered with LEADER in 2014, and then once we get it covered, we will continue to see and it's going to take as well beyond 2014. We will continue to see benefits from LEADER as we get better and better at turning on the benefits from that technology. As far as the amount of benefit we're getting out of that, we've got so many things in play, and I would be taking -- I would really be taking a wild guess at that, which I would rather not do, but substantial benefits from both of those.","Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. That's fair. And as a follow-up, I was just wondering, if you strip out the lower level of rail inflation, that it sounds like we're seeing -- have you've seen any changes in the overall core pricing environment in the past 3 to 6 months? And could you just talk about your expectation for pricing headed into 2014?","Donald W. Seale","This is Don. No, no changes in the pricing environment. I will say that if the economy continues to gain traction, we believe that, that environment will become more favorable. And obviously, we'll participate in the market and price to the market as we always do.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This question is for Marta. Your cash balance has been steadily increasing, obviously, you had announced an increased dividend yesterday. But it would certainly seem that you\u2019re potential to do a lot more on the capital front. And do -- we'd just appreciate your thoughts about how you're thinking about free cash flow allocation during the year?","Marta R. Stewart","Well. We really haven't changed our overall push to free cash flow allocation. We always -- we invested in the business, we talked about our capital program, and after that, we return to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. And so, really, part of the reason for our increased in cash balance is that, at the end of the year is, we did an opportunistic debt issuance in November. We wanted to go ahead and take advantage of the -- of the low rates, so that's a partly why you see a little bit higher than the run in the past.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's fair. But the net debt level was actually still decreasing. And I guess, another way of me that, a sort of inquiry, is just the minimum cash flow -- do you have a minimum cash level that you would like to maintain? Or a minimum sort of debt ratio that you're sort of targeting?","Marta R. Stewart","Yes. We target to stay within our credit rating spend, and that's one of the reasons why we went ahead and issued the debt, and so we just try to modulate mixture. We've got plenty of cash to invest in the business and still stay within there. You're right that net -- if you take our debt minus our cash right now, we are running a little bit of lower. It's not intentional de-leveraging, it's just the offshoot of the fact that we have very strong free cash flow during the year.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And Don, can I just ask you about the comment on new business gains within the industrial side for your Coal business?","Donald W. Seale","Could you repeat the question? I didn't quite catch it.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sorry, let me ask one more clearly. Earlier, you'd mentioned that you had won some new business within the coal segment, and it related to industrial. I'm just wondering if you could elaborate on that. Was is it a share shift or were there something else going on? New development, new plants or what not?","Donald W. Seale","No. This is coal increases with some of our industrial accounts like the Paper industry, like the Cement industry, where they are using more coal, and coal is more competitive now with natural gas. And also, they're seeing increased production and usage of coal.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","They're not new customers coming on? It's just an organic growth with this -- with existing customers?","Donald W. Seale","Organic growth that we've been able to displace gas with in some cases.","Operator","Our next question is from line of John Larkin with Stifel.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","First question was to ask Don, perhaps to take a little deeper into the Southeastern Utility coal situation. First of all, do you have any timetable as to when those stockpiles might be normalized? Is that a 2014 event? Or do you see that happening more in the '15 or beyond time period? And then once they are normalized, will the replenishment come from Central App mines, or more likely from the Illinois Basin mines? And if from the Illinois Basin mines, what type of a favorable mix impact would that have on RPU?","Donald W. Seale","Now your first part of your question with respect to Southern Utility stockpiles, our best estimate is that, that normalization of stockpiles will take most of the first half into the third quarter depending upon, obviously, continued weather patterns that we're getting which are favorable. The second thing, with respect to the basins, that's a good question, we see more coal flowing to the South from Illinois Basin sourcing, and some Northern App sourcing flowing to the South as well. Central App will continue to be pressured, in our view, with respect to sourcing into the South. Just from a cost of production perspective and being competitive. Now I will say that with gas still being in the range of $4 to $4.50 right now, even though we're having a real winter, as Mark pointed out, gas continues to be competitive in the southern utilities, and the North as well. But our volumes down 18% in the fourth quarter tells you that gas is still very, very much a factor in the southern network.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","With the shift from, say, Central App more towards Illinois Basin or Northern App, presumably, when things do ramp-up to replenish those ultimately reduced stockpiles, that should have a positive impact on your yield in the coal business?","Donald W. Seale","John, that's correct. It will be longer hauls. Most likely, higher revenue per unit coal, flowing from those new origination points. It all depends on how much coal they actually take from those new sources.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then as a follow on, we -- normally, on these, the calls don't talk about what's happening down at the STB except with respect to maybe the reciprocal switching proposal. But there are a couple of rate cases there that currently that involve Norfolk, Southern one is the DuPont case, and there's a smaller one, the Sunbelt case. How long do you think it'll be before those cases are resolved? And how do you characterize the risk associated with those cases?","Charles W. Moorman","This is Wick. We don't normally comment a lot on anything that's up at the STB. We clearly feel that we have a strong position for the rates that we charge. I think the timetable is such that those cases, both should be resolved in 2014. So we'll just see how that comes out.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird.","Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","A quick question on the EMT fleet. I'm wondering if you can give us a size of the fleet to end 2013, and provide any context to what the expansion plans would be a for 2014, specifically, the number of container net adds in 2014?","Donald W. Seale","The approximate size of the fleet were around 29,000 containers in the combined fleet, and we expect that to expand by about 2,500 boxes.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","So first one for Don, just on coal. The rise in gas prices we've seen and, obviously, the cold start to weather. Do you think that's having more of an impact on northern or southern utilities as we think about mix there going forward?","Donald W. Seale","Well, certainly, the temperatures in the North have been pretty intense, but they have in the South, as well, and they are as we speak this morning. But I would have to say that the stockpile impact in the North is greater at this point than the South. If we continue to see this weather pattern for the balance of the winter and have a favorable shoulder period through April on into May, I would say that the South will have their turn in it as well.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","Right. But it sounds like we should think about northern coal -- coal on the northern utilities better, at least for now, for at least for next couple of quarters going into the South?","Donald W. Seale","That's a correct statement. The northern utilities that we serve, the stockpiles are at normal. They're normalized now, so they're facing this increased generation demand, so they will have to replenish fuel supplies. In the South, we still have the excess stockpile overhang. So even with some increased demand, the overall fuel supply inventory is better.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then just one for, I guess, either Mark or Marta. So the PTC budget for 2014 is pretty similar with '13? Once we get through '14, how much is left? And are you planning -- are you on track to have your stuff finished by 2015?","Mark D. Manion","We are going to have, as far as the hardware that's installed, we're going to have everything pretty well in place by 2018. And then, we'll have continuing training efforts in those type things that I expect will take us out to 2020. And then I think it's fair to say for everybody it remains to be seen what the reliability of these really complex systems are going out beyond 2020.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","Do -- so you are expecting the mandate to get pushed up by 3 years?","Mark D. Manion","Well. It's hard to know just what's going to happen in Washington, but I can tell you that from the standpoint of what is possible, we're not going to be ready in 2015. That's -- I think that's pretty clear to everybody.","Charles W. Moorman","The laws of physics prevail in things like this, so -- and even the FRA has acknowledged that there is going to have to be a several year extension.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","And you think that sort of -- do you think that's still likely to get a full 3 years, even given some of the safety issues we've seen over the summer and winter?","Charles W. Moorman","Well, it is, as I said, there is just the simple fact that we, and not only we, the North American rail industry is not going to complete this project by the end of 2015, and it will take several years after that to conclude it. The -- there are still substantial parts of this technology that are not tested. We will have a lot of issues to deal with even with -- after we get the software completed, which it's not, and the hardware all installed, which obviously, it's not. We're also dealing, as you know, with an issue right now within the government where we can't get the FCC to give us permission to put the antennas up that we require. There are tens of thousands of those. So it's just a situation where the facts are the facts, and it's going to take some substantial amount of time beyond 2015 to get this system up. And more importantly, as Mark said, to get it working at a level of reliability where the industry could continue to function.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham Research.","Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","A quick question for Marta, and then a follow-up on coal. Marta, is cash flow -- free cash flow probably going to be about neutral this year versus next year when I take into account any earnings gains, higher depreciation and lower pension offset by the higher CapEx? Or is there something on the noncash side I should be thinking of?","Marta R. Stewart","Well. We never know about our -- about some of the non-operating items, but with regard to free cash flow, I think, the most significant difference is what we described today, is that we think we're going to have about $200 million higher of CapEx. And that's -- other than that, just normal operations.","Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Right, but your earnings should grow. Your depreciation, which is noncash or noncash expenses higher, and your pension should be lower or the contribution is not going to track with the lower expense you're talking about.","Marta R. Stewart","The pension is -- we don't have a -- and we haven't had in the last -- required contribution, and so the pension is a noncash item also. That doesn't flow through.","Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Quick question on follow-up on the coal. Just given where the heating degree days are in your North and Midwest regions, I understand your trepidation on the export side, but I'm a little surprised you're not a little more optimistic on domestic coal. Can you differentiate, and I know, we focused a lot on the southern region where the utilities are still an issue and there's more gas competition, but could you talk a little bit more about your expectations for domestic thermal volumes next year versus maybe pricing or customer discussions? Because it would seem to me, given what I'm seeing, that the domestic coal story would be a little bit better than you seem to be implying.","Donald W. Seale","It's a good question. Let me put a little bit more color around thermal coal. If you look sequentially, in our tonnage, from the third toward to the fourth quarter, we're down about 2 million tons in Utility coal. And year-over-year, for the entire year, our Utility business was off almost 5 million tons, a little more than 4 million tons. So we are at 97 million tons of Utility coal. We do not see a dynamic out far enough in 2014 to indicate that, that will stabilize or that it's going to be equal to that 97 million tons at this point. Even with the weather we're having right now, we're only seeing this as a snapshot in the first 3 weeks of the year. There are a lot of question marks, obviously, about what we will see for the balance of the year. But the dynamics, the competitive dynamics between coal and natural gas are such that we're not comfortable providing any outlook that says that Utility book at 97 million tons will stay at 97 million tons. We just don't think it will.","Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","So you're not saying necessarily less bad, you're just saying, not necessarily better. Is that a fair way to read it?","Donald W. Seale","I think, yes. I don't see it -- the degradation that we've seen getting worse. I'm only saying that we think the market itself will not support growth.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Mark, just a question on the plan that you talked about rolling out the last few quarters. The renewed -- is this a renewed attack on safety and service that you're addressing with new programs? And then just as in the side, you saw Dwell climb a touch, but crew starts and re-crew and cars per unit all improving. Is that a mix issue in terms of seeing the Dwell decline a bit?","Mark D. Manion","As far as our safety process goes, we are about really 3 years into this, 2 in a big way where we have to workforce engaged. And like I said, we've had a lot of work that went on in 2013, just as far as education in the process, both on the management side and our 224,000 workforce population. It is really -- the core of it is all about engagement of our people. Our people understanding how important they are to the business, creating an environment where they want to come forward with their ideas, participate in problem solving, improving the business, finding ways to be safer. So it is definitely geared toward our safety process but it really touches on all aspects of the business. So we're kind of in the beginning throws of this, but it is a -- this will be ongoing forever. And we hope to see just a lot of good things, not only from a safety standpoint, but for the business in general, as our people get more and more engaged.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And thoughts on the Dwell time? Is that a mix or related to it?","Mark D. Manion","As far as Terminal Dwell, we saw good improvement during 2013, and we have got a pretty large project relative to improvement in our terminals. And so far, we've only been through a pretty small number of those terminals with this project. Of course, we're starting with our biggest terminals, but we've been through maybe 20% of our terminals so far. And as we continue to see overall improvement and efficiencies in the terminals, we think that it will have an effect on lowering the Dwell time. And again, this is hooked up with our behavioral leadership project and engagement of people, it all works together. So we think we'll see improvement in that area. It's hard to know how much though, Ken.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then, Don, for a follow-up on the Ag business, just given the bumper crop, do you look for volumes to accelerate into '14? Or are inventory levels being replenished and this is a good run rate for the fourth quarter?","Donald W. Seale","You know, in the Ag market, there are puts and takes in it. There was a strong crop, obviously, a corn and soybeans, but that's a good news. The not so good news, as it was a strong crop in close proximity to the southeastern feed mills. And a lot of that corn and soybean product will be trucked to those local mills, displacing longer haul corn and soybeans that would've moved from the Midwest had the southeastern crop not been as strong. So we'll have to work through that supply, and we will as the year progresses. And then we'll see Midwestern grain start moving at a higher volume. So if you put it all together, it should be a much better market than it was last year, but it won't be as robust as one would think, just based on the overall production numbers.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Marta, concerning use of cash, I see you budgeted about 10% of total 2014 investment for PTC, and about the same per facilities and terminals. I want to ask what part of PTC investment you're most excited about. But could you highlight a couple of the major facilities investments you think will bear the most fruit?","Marta R. Stewart","Well. And Mark can maybe talk about this a little bit more than me, but we are having major expansion underway our Bellevue yard, which is really got a help with the flow of operations in the northeast and that's one of the portions that, that I'm most excited about. Mark?","Mark D. Manion","No. That's absolutely right. And we're going to pretty much conclude that project by the end of this year. Ever since we were fortunate enough to get the Conrail portion of our network integrated with the rest of the old Norfolk Southern, that is just an area where our business wants to go. It wants to go into that upper Ohio area. And so this will allow for a lot of efficiencies just being able to handle that business in that area in a more productive way.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And the second question, I noticed that your quarterly 10% growth in Auto related volume was substantially better than market growth, in fact, it's about double light vehicle production growth. Could you have some details to the sources of that growth?","Donald W. Seale","Number one, we had production at the plants that we serve growing ahead of the market. And obviously, Ford Motor Company would be 1 of those customers. Toyota, another 1 of those customers. Honda being another 1 of those customers, et cetera. So that's #1. And #2, we've had some market share gains, as well as we compete with Holloway in terms of over-the-road movement of vehicles in that network as well.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Vernon of Sanford Bernstein.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Don, the 97 million tons of coal that you guys have -- utility coals that you guys have done for 2013, what percentage of that would be Utility North versus South?","Donald W. Seale","It's a fairly balanced portfolio with about 1\/2 of the business in the North, on a tonnage basis and about 1\/2 the South. Although I will tell you that our percentage declines in the South are eroding that balance to where the north now is a little bit heavier than the South. I can't give you the actual percentages off the top of my head, but traditionally, it has been about an equal portfolio, but with the type of -- with Northern Utility, for example, being flat, essentially for the fourth quarter and the year. And the South being down in the fourth quarter as much as 18%. That balance has changed.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So the mix is now at -- more heavily in Northern then, right?","Donald W. Seale","Slightly.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And then -- and Marta, perhaps, could you help us out with some guidance for what we should be a good effective tax rate for 2014? And also a cash tax rate for 2014?","Marta R. Stewart","Yes. We think we'll have about a 37.5% effective tax rate for 2014. And on cash taxes, we don't have bonus depreciation coming up, and so we think the cash taxes will be higher in 2014.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Any dollar value or percentage number higher that you could help us out with?","Marta R. Stewart","About $200 million.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I'm just going to ask one, and it's probably for Wick or Marta, but you've had 2 quarters now, pretty solid year-on-year operating ratio improvement. And when you talk about $100 million of productivity gains targeted this year, plus Marta, I think, if I heard you right, you said $25 million less pension expense per quarter. That's another $100 million of pension reduction. Is the OR improvements sustainable in '14, what are some of the offsets that investors should be thinking about?","Marta R. Stewart","I'll let Wick handle the general question, but I did want to point out, we do have that $25 million reduction, and that's pension and postretirement together. And then we have a $10 million of depreciation per quarter that we think is going to be higher. I did want to mention that. And I also mentioned on the casualties and other expenses that we think run rate, year-over-year those will be higher, so about $10 million a quarter. So the 3 of those that I mentioned somewhat wash, and I'll let Wick handle the overall question about our OR.","Charles W. Moorman","Well. Clearly, as we've always been, we are focused on trying to take the OR down further. We think that -- we are optimistic that with a better business climate in 2014, and with -- even with what we do expect, as Don has said, to be some continued pressure on our coal volumes, even over '13, that we'll be able to produce better business results. We're very happy with the productivity improvements that Mark and his team have outlined. And so our goal every year is to drive the operating ratio down further. And that certainly our goal for 20,000 -- or for 2014. And we'll just have to see where we end up, but we think that there are a lot of positives looking at the year that we'll be able to take advantage of.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And those positives are more robust in 2014 than we've seen in the last couple of years when you've had effectively flat OR outcomes, right?","Charles W. Moorman","Well. I'd certainly would point first at the fact that we do believe, as does everyone else, that economic growth in this country is picking up. We're starting to see housing rebound as we talked about, which is a critical part of GDP. And Norfolk Southern, a lot of our business is driven directly by the U.S. economy. And as the U.S. economy improves, our results should improve with it.","Operator","Mr. Moorman, there are no further questions at this time. Would you like to make any closing remarks?","Charles W. Moorman","Well. Let me just say thanks to everyone on the call for your patience.

For the full year net income increased 15% to $1.9 billion and earnings per share increased 18% to $661 billion.","We achieved a record 67.4 operating ratio, which was 150 basis point improvements over 2016, demonstrating our focus on productivity, cost control and growth as we move forward under our strategic plan.","Each of these achievements is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our employees, whose determination has powered our successes of the past several years and who I'm confident will make Norfolk Southern even stronger in 2018.","Moving to Slide 5. We remain committed to investing in our business as capital expenditures totaled over $1.7 billion in 2017, representing investment in our rail infrastructure and projects that grow our business, like the recently completed Portageville Bridge that will support economic vitality and jobs across New York's Southern Tier region.","We also realized new business in 2017 from 75 industries, we had assisted in locating or expanding along our lines, representing over $1 billion invested by our customers. Our portfolio of active industrial development projects is as a strong as it's been since the Great Recession reflecting optimism in the economy and in doing business with Norfolk Southern for the long-term.","That optimism is mirrored in our continued commitment to a balanced capital allocation strategy, that invest in our network's health and growth opportunities for our business, maintains a solid dividend targeting a 1\/3rd payout ratio over the long-term and returns capital to our shareholders through ongoing share repurchases.","Our board has underscored this commitment by authorizing a $1.8 billion capital budget in 2018, an 18% increase in the dividend or $0.72 per share and the continuation of our share repurchase program.","Slide 6 illustrates our unrelenting focus on productivity gains, which have enhanced resource utilization while accommodating growth. The results can be seen throughout all areas in our organization. In terms of labor productivity, our full year volumes increased by 5%, yet we were able to lower our average headcount by 3% versus last year's levels.","2017 was also a record for fuel efficiency as fuel consumption was lower than the prior year despite the increase in traffic. These measures highlight our ability to deliver results through cost saving efforts, efficiencies and asset utilization. In total, we generated $150 million in productivity savings in 2017, on top of $250 million in 2016.","Moving to service. Our annual composite service metric declined compared to 2016. Our service levels last year were lower than we would have liked. As we recover from challenging operating conditions, we are focused on improving network stability and resilience, while continuing to drive productivity.","We are fully committed to delivering on our long-term targets through a combination of growth and efficiency, and I'll update you on these targets after Alan, Mike and Cindy provide further details on our fourth quarter results and outlook as we head into 2018.","I'll now turn the program over to Alan.","Alan Shaw","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Beginning on Slide 8. 2017 finished strong with tightening truck capacity in increased export coal. Total revenue for the quarter improved 7% versus the same period in 2016, driven by volume gains and pricing improvement.","Merchandise revenue of $1.6 billion was up 5% as compared to last year, with the ISM Purchasing Managers Index near a 14-year high, strength and industrial production drove volume gains in both the steel and plastics, while increased drilling activity benefited our frac sand market.","Export of soybeans decline primarily due to the difficult comps related to the 2016 South American crop. Merchandise revenue per unit was up, reflecting pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue.","Intermodal had record volumes for the third consecutive quarter and we delivered record intermodal revenue in the fourth quarter, due to our market focus, tighten truck capacity and high demand for consumer goods. Higher fuel surcharges, positive mix and improved pricing increased RPU 8%.","Our coal business benefited from high seaborne prices, supporting export demand, which offset volume declines in the utility markets, resulting from low natural gas prices and mild temperatures.","Revenue per unit decreased 1% as declines in our longer haul southern utility franchise negatively impacted mix. Our fourth quarter results continue to demonstrate our market approach as winning business and delivering shareholder value.","As we turn to our full year results on Slide 9, the trends we experienced in the fourth quarter are reflective of our 2017 annual results. We achieve total revenues of $10.6 billion, representing a 7% increase. This growth was driven by a 5% increase in volume and a 2% increase in revenue per unit.","Merchandise volume for the year was flat compared to 2016, and per steel production and drilling activity drove a 6% increase in metals and construction shipments, while declines in U.S. light vehicle production and pipeline activity negatively impacted our automotive and chemicals businesses, respectively.","Revenue per unit less fuel improved 1% as positive pricing was partially offset by an unfavorable - changes in traffic mix. Growth in e-commerce and tightening capacity in the trucking industry led to a 5% increase in intermodal shipments.","Export coal volume rose 81% versus 2016 due to increased overseas demand for U.S. coals. As markets evolve, we have capitalized unfavorable conditions and delivered improved bottom line results, due to our inherence to our strategic plan.","Since the introduction of our strategic plan two years ago, we have consistently articulated the benefit of our superior customer touch, the continuity of our team in our approach, working with our customers, developing innovative service solutions and delivering value to the marketplace. Our 2017 results demonstrate the merits of this approach.","Moving to Slide 10. The strength of our fourth quarter has heightened our outlook for 2018, a prospective share buy of our customers and top economists, who continued to upwardly revise their expectations for this year. For the full year, we expect opportunities for growth in our intermodal and merchandise markets, while coal is expected to decline.","In merchandise, strength in industrial production and construction activity provide support for increased business primarily in aggregates, coil, steel and plastics. In our energy markets, higher oil prices and drilling activity will drive greater volumes in crude oil and frac sands. Natural gas liquids are expected to decline in the second half of 2018 as the Mariner East 2 pipeline becomes fully operational. We expect automotive volume to slightly trail U.S. vehicle production with slower manufacturing at specific NS-served plants.","Our intermodal business will likely be positively impacted by capacity constraints in the trucking industry, as the ELD mandate is fully implemented, along with increasing consumer demand and continued shifts to e-commerce.","The export coal market is anticipated to be strong, although lower than year ago levels as we expect first quarter volumes to be in the 5 million to 6 ton range with an opportunity to push the higher end of that boundary.","Benchmark pricing is backward dated, given some uncertainty to the length of these elevated volumes. In the utility market, impacts from the mild temperatures last summer and low natural gas prices are expected to produce volumes in the 15 million to 17 million-ton range in the first quarter.","Turning to the overall pricing environment, we remain focused on price and with continued strength in truck rates, we expect higher pricing in our truck competitive business. Pricing will be challenged in our export coal market, as benchmark prices are expected to decline.","The extent of our pricing gains in 2018 will be limited by our contract structure, with approximately 45% of our business remaining to be renegotiated this year. Revenue per unit will also benefit from an expected increase in on-highway diesel and WTI prices that will raise our fuel surcharge revenue. We now have approximately 65% of our revenue tied to an on-highway diesel base fuel surcharge program.","We continue our initiatives to enhance our value proposition through collaboration with our customers and industry partners. We are developing more customer tools to give them the greater ability to manage their business with us and improve the efficiency and transparency of their supply chain.","We are confident that our 2018 plan in the marketplace is highly achievable. Our approach balances productivity and cost control will service providing the foundation to lean and to growth opportunities.","As we have demonstrated at Norfolk Southern, we are analytical and deliberative in how and where we invest. We will not allow businesses that yield shareholder value to pass us bye. We will stay close to our customers, hear what they're saying and proactively manage market opportunities. We look forward to a prosperous 2018.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike for an update on operations.","Michael Joseph Wheeler","Thank you, Alan, and good morning. Our operational leverage generated in 2017 allowed us to grow our business by providing a competitive service product to our customers, while simultaneously driving productivity initiatives.","As shown on Slide 12, we achieved significant milestones in 2017. Our reduction in train accidents, combined with our improvement in key productivity initiatives helped to drive our record operating ratio.","Turning to the key drivers of our success on Slide 13. The safety of our employees and the communities we serve continues to be our top priority. Our reportable and serious injury ratios are stable, although, we are not satisfied without continuous improvement in this area.","We achieved our lowest train accident frequency on record meeting last year's record low. For service, we experienced a macro challenges in the fourth quarter that began with the last 3 hurricanes in October and ended with a historic snow storm in North Georgia, which shut down one of our most critical routes for 2 days as over 350 trees were removed. We work through these challenges as we handle record volumes by temporarily deploying our service fleet of locomotives.","With respect to our overall service product, we are still working toward where we need to be for our customers. We fully recognize the expectations of our customers for a quality, consistent and competitive service product. As Jim has mentioned, network stability and resiliency are our objectives.","Moving to some of our key productivity initiatives on Slide 14, we are continuing to drive improvement in all areas. Our rationalization of our locomotive fleet resulted in a record locomotive productivity for the year, beating the prior year's record.","These locomotives flow into our search fleet, which has the added benefit of improving that fleet's reliability. Not only do these improvements result in lower maintenance cost, they also enhance our fuel efficiency, which was an annual record as well, again beating the prior year's record.","These measures have been driven by optimizing our train plan and our improvements in train length, which resulted in a quarterly record and for the full year. But we must balance these initiatives with the good service.","In closing, we are confident we will continue to provide a competitive service product to our customers that will grow our business, while at the same time driving sustainable productivity savings and superior returns for shareholders.","We are proud of our accomplishments and continue to identify opportunities to drive additional efficiencies for the benefit of NS shareholders.","I will now turn it over to Cindy, who will cover our financial achievements.","Cynthia Earhart","Thank you, Mike, and good morning. Turning to Slide 16. Our fourth quarter results show a continuation of the benefits from the sustained and successful execution of our strategic plan.","The fourth quarter and annual comparisons exclude the effects of tax reform, which I will detail on the next slide. As you can see, each quarter, we delivered revenue growth, while improving our operating efficiency.","This drove our operating ratio lower and more importantly, delivered impressive gains in operating income that fell to the bottom line, producing record diluted earnings per share for the year.","Let's take a closer look at the fourth quarter on the next slide. On Slide 17, you'll see our summarized operating results. The adjusted 2017 amounts in this presentation represent our GAAP results, less the adjustment for the enactment of income tax reform. For a detailed reconciliation, refer to our non-GAAP reconciliation posted on our website.","Today, I will focus on these adjusted results. Our fourth quarter reflects the revenue growth Alan described, which when coupled with our continued focus on operating efficiency and cost control, resulted in a 170 basis point improvement in OR and 13% growth in operating income.","Turning to Slide 18, let's take a closer look at the component changes in operating expenses. In total, adjusted operating expenses were higher by $77 million, reflecting both inflationary and volume related expense increases.","Compensation and benefits rose by $52 million or 8%. The primary driver of the increase is higher incentive compensation due to our strong operating results.","As in prior quarters, the large increase in premiums on union medical plans contribute an additional $16 million this quarter. We also experienced increased overtime during the fourth quarter of $9 million.","Partially offsetting these items will reduced employee levels, which saved $24 million. Headcount was approximately 1100 employees less than the fourth quarter of 2016, and down about 250 sequentially.","As we look ahead, we expect all in wage and medical cost inflation of about 1% in 2018 versus the 4% we experienced in 2017. We expect that 2018 stock compensation expense will be consistent with 2017.","However, due to planned changes, these amounts will be more evenly recognized throughout the first three quarters of 2018, as compared to the prior year.","Finally, for incentive compensation. As you would expect, our Board raised the bar on expected performance for 2018 compensation. As you saw in 2017, the incentive accrual for the first and second quarter typically reflects a targeted payout. As we move into the back half of the year, the accrual will adjust based on forecasted corporate performance compared to targets for the year.","Fuel expense rose by $45 million, primarily due to higher prices, which added $41 million. The average price per gallon for locomotive fuel was a $1.95 this year versus $1.60 in fourth quarter 2016.","Consumption was up only slightly over last year, which added $2 million in the phase of a 5% increase in shipments. As Mike mentioned, we have continued to achieve record fuel efficiency metrics and we expect our ongoing initiatives to continue to support improvement.","Purchase services and rents increased $20 million or 5% due to higher volume related costs of $12 million and other miscellaneous expense increases, none of which were significant.","The materials and other category decreased $48 million or 22%. This quarter included $25 million more from gains on the sale of operating properties than fourth quarter 2016. Casualties and claims expenses including both environmental and personal injury were $18 million lower. Finally, reduce equipment and road way material usage also saved $7 million.","Moving to Slide 19. You can see the strong operating results fell to the bottom line, producing adjusted net income of $486 million, up 17% compared to 2016. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.69, a 19% improvement.","Full year results are shown on Slide 20. We set records in both operating ratio and diluted earnings per share for the year. Adjusted for the impact of tax reform, we delivered a record operating ratio of 67.4%, and record diluted earnings per share of $6.61, an 18% improvement on our 2016 results.","Our full year effective tax rate excluding the impact of tax reform was 35.4%. We expect our effective tax rate to be around 24% on a go-forward basis.","Slide 21 depicts our full year cash flow. Cash from operations totaled $3.3 billion, covering capital spending and generating $1.5 billion in free cash flow. Free cash flow increased by 33% over 2016, driven by our strong operating results and discipline capital spending. Looking ahead, we expect cash taxes in 2018 to be approximately 25% lower than 2017 levels.","This is less than the drop in the effective rate, largely because cash taxes in 2017 benefited from the accelerated deduction of interest expense generated from our two debt exchanges.","Now turning back to 2017 results. Return to shareholders totaled $1.7 billion through $703 million of dividends and $1 billion in share repurchases. As Jim noted, our Board of Directors remains committed to returning capital to shareholders and approved an increase in our quarterly dividends to $0.72 per share, reflecting a $0.11 or 18% increase over the previous quarter's dividend.","Our capital allocation strategy remains the same. First, reinvest in the business and our network with adequate returns. Second, pay a solid dividend, targeting a payout ratio of 1\/3rd of net income over the longer term. And third, return capital to shareholders through buyback.","Moving to the shares capital budget on Slide 22. We project total spending of $1.8 billion, higher than 2017. This year's budget supports growth and the continuation of investment in our core assets.","We're investing in the expansion of various terminals and infrastructure to ease capacity constraints, and we're acquiring freight cars and support our volume growth. Similar to the prior years, the roadway category represents our programs to replace track, bridges and communication systems.","In 2018, locomotive capital will be focused on the rebuild and conversion of locomotives from DC to AC power. To improve customer service and further enhance the productivity of our employees and the reliability of our assets, we have also increased our technology spend.","Thank you for your attention, and I'll turn it back to Jim.","James Squires","Thank you, Cindy. And now let me provide you an update on our 5-year strategic plan. Slide 24 shows the financial targets that we committed to by 2020, and outlined as part of our strategic plan a little over 2 years ago.","As you may recall, our plan was a comprehensive one, built on disciplined cost control and asset utilization, while balancing revenue growth through a combination of volume growth in pricing.","As the economic environment has evolved, we have been dynamic in our response to changing market conditions and remained a well-positioned to achieve our financial goals. So let's take a look at the results so far.","Through 2017, we've made substantial progress that has translated into shareholder value and Slide 25 shows some of our accomplishments. Achieving pricing gains over rail inflation, a focus that we'll continue in our approach to the market.","Improving our operating ratio on a year-over-year basis for eight consecutive quarters and to an annual record for 2017, with a plan to achieve a sub- 65 OR by 2020 or sooner.","Achieving double-digit earnings per share growth in each of the last 2 years, a trend we expect to continue. Making substantial capital investments each year to maintain the safety of our rail network, enhance service, improve operational efficiency and support growth. With a plan to invest 16% to 18% of revenue going forward.","And we're awarding shareholders by returning capital in a balanced, disciplined way through both dividends and share repurchase. Much has been accomplished by Norfolk Southern and its employees since the inception of its plan and remained determined to deliver upon our commitments.","Slide 26 highlights our path forward as we balance productivity with top line growth. Our overall outlook on volume in the current economic environment is for a 2% growth on a compound annual basis.","Volume growth in our intermodal and merchandise commodity groups offset a softer demand for coal. We expect that revenue per unit will grow about 2% on a compound annual basis through 2020.","We are open for opportunities to grow and we will be unwavering in our commitment to productivity and efficiency. We will continue to build on our initiatives to date as we look for further improvements in fuel efficiency and leverage investments in technology to make our organization leaner.","We will continue the effective stewardship of our resources ensuring we have the appropriate workforce as demand evolves and continue to invest in the reliability of our locomotive fleet.","Wrapping up on Slide 2017. At Norfolk Southern, we know we can deliver upon our strategic plan, focus on the core principles of safety, service, productivity and growth. As we head into 2018, we are optimistic about the current economic environment and I remain fully confident in our ability to deliver an operating ratio of sub-65 by 2020 or sooner, while delivering over $650 million in productivity savings.","With that, thank you for your attention, and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt Reustle with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Matt Reustle","Thanks for taking my question here. Just in terms of putting it all together, it sounds like the 2018 outlook includes lot of varying trends between the truck competitive business, contract, remaining mix.","Can you talk about the expectations for '18 regarding further OR improvements and should we expect another year where the OR improves or is it - you know, is there possibility where there is a short-term stall in the longer-term story?","James Squires","We do expect a lower operating ratio for the full year 2018, and that will be driven on by a combination of productivity initiatives and growth. Alan, why don't you talk a little bit about the truck environment and the opportunities we see for growth on the top line?","Alan Shaw","Matt, we are increasingly optimistic about the macro environment in which we're operating in the competitive environment that we're facing. You know, truck expectations have continued to tighten over the last 45 to 60 days. The economists are revising upwards their economic outlook for many of the markets that are important to us.","So as we head into 2018, we're very confident in our ability to price into those market and secure growth. The one cause that we have, which I tried to outline is, particularly within our coal network, and the coal indices were export or backward-dated, although they too have risen in the first half of this month.","So there's some uncertainty in the export coal market. And then natural gas prices, although they are relatively high for February delivery, the forward curve drops off pretty sharply after that. So that could put added pressure on our utility coal market.","Matt Reustle","Understood. So if I isolate merchandise and intermodal and just look at the RPU growth there x fuel, should we think about that business rolling over at rates that are higher than 3% to 4% range that you're shelling or is it a small percentage of the business rolling over those rates that are much higher? Or is it something to do with longer haul business or anything in mix that's there can you discuss that?","Alan Shaw","Well, Matt, we will get some strong rate increases in business that is truck competitive. And certainly, that will include intermodal, but there's also a lot of merchandise business that's truck competitive.","That's one of the great things about our franchise and our strategic plan is - we have a great geographic footprint. Our strategic plan to pull business off the highway is underscored within this economic environment.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Allison Landry","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to talk about the service metrics, you know, they've deteriorated basically the 2014 levels and I think just 6 weeks ago, you guys talked about either sort of turning the corner with respect to that.","So I just wanted to sort of understand what drove the deterioration in December? And then sort of from a broader perspective, thinking about the 2014 levels and absolute terms, we know that was a difficult period of time for the network and obviously, the productivity results currently don't reflect any sort of melt down.","So if you could help to walk through the differences between then and now and how that translates into the train speed, as well as metrics that we're currently in.","James Squires","Sure. Let me start and I'll turn it over to Mike to turn a little bit more about the specifics. But in general, I want to begin by emphasizing that we remain steadfast in our coming to deliver a quality service that our customers value. So that's our goal.","Last year - late last year, the composite service metrics did decline, and we did not live up to all of our customer's expectations, but the commitment to do so is there and ever presence at Norfolk Southern. We believe we have the resources in place necessary to meet demand, now and in the future.","So whether its cruise or locomotives or other resources, we believe that we have no systemic shortages and adequate resources on hand. And as the network recovers and service recovers, we will be able to continue driving both growth and productivity.","Michael Joseph Wheeler","That's exactly right, Jim. From the service, I will say, Allison, our terminals and the line of a road are fluid. However, the customer-facing metrics and our network metrics lag these and its taking longer to get those metrics and back to where we had been, but we're going to do it.","And Jim is correct, we are confident, we got the right resources. We don't have any resources used both from TNE standpoint and from the locomotives and freight cars. So we feel comfortable about where we're going and that's - that is our charge this year and we're all over it, we're confident about where we're going.","Allison Landry","Okay. And then in terms of the 2% yields CAGR through 2020, could you talk about the components that are embedded within that, I assume it includes fuel, props and negative mix from the outside growth and intermodal. So if we think about the different components within this, should we assume core price is around the 3% mark? Any sort of color in the different buckets that would make up to 2% would be helpful.","James Squires","Alan, why don't you take that one?","Alan Shaw","Happy too. Allison, good question and I'm glad you brought that up. The 2% RPU growth is not analogous to the 2% pricing growth. You noted some of the negative mix that we've got in terms of strength in the intermodal market, declines within export.","And frankly, our export volumes for 2020 and look at them now is very similar to the export volumes for 2020 that we had, last year what we updated the plan. The difference is we had a huge run up in export coal this year which as you know at least average point as higher than average RPU.","So as that pulls back and the industry's pullback, that creates some negative mix for us. We are lean in to price. This is a great opportunity to price for us. We've got a very strong truck market and we're going to price according to the market.","Allison Landry","Okay. Great. Thank you for the time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Seidl","Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to focus a little bit on the comments on coal. It sounds like you're concern is going to be more for the back half of the year because it seems the industry as you pointed out are still looking favorable at least in the near term. Am I reading the tea leaves right on my own?","James Squires","Yes, Jason, I think we have continued strength within our export market. I've guided to 5 million to 6 million tons for export in the first quarter with an opportunity to exceed that. Last year we had 6.3 million tons in the first quarter and then as the year progressed, it moved up a little bit of 7 million tons in the fourth quarter.","So I think there's continued strength in our export market. I am concerned about the natural gas prices and the dispatch and the utility market. So we've guided a 15 million to 17 million tons in utility for the quarter.","Jason Seidl","That sounds fair enough. Can we focus a little bit about some of the business that you picked up late last year, your Eastern counterpart sort of confirm that a lot of the business that they've lost has gone too at least one year contract. When should we see the bulk of those roll over and how confident are you in retaining that business that you took?","James Squires","Jason, let me take that one first and then I'll turn it over to Alan again. I want to emphasize that we're focused on enhancing our value proposition and creating value at NSC. And we're confident that we can do that by providing that competitive service product to our customers that will grow our business.","So it's all about the product, the service that we can provide to our customers. And we also view our primary form of competition truck. And so our goal is to provide truck like service. And that means that the customer who is perhaps is trucking today will find our value proposition more attractive and will go by rail. Alan?","Alan Shaw","Yes. Jason, we were pretty clear and we continue to be clear that, the business that we're looking to bring into our network last year would be ones those customers who valued service and weren't buying capacity from us. And we're looking for customers who are long-term growth opportunities.","So long term is the key word in there. We're looking for a long-term relationship. And as Jim noted, our primary gains in our primary growth in 2017 is reflective of the market and the strengthening truck economy, and our customer approach and our ability to pull business off the Highway. And we think that will continue and are confident that will continue as we move into 2018.","Jason Seidl","Appreciate the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Ravi Shanker","Thanks. Just a follow-up on something that was may be touched on earlier, looking at the 2020 targets. How do you offset the mix drag from the growing intermodal versus coal? And does that make it harder to get to the long-term OR targets?","James Squires","So let's start here, the plan is dynamic and flexible. And that plan with its dynamism and flexibility has consistently delivered strong performance for the last 2 years. As I went through 8 straight quarters of lower operating ratios year-over-year, double-digit EPS growth.","So the plan is clearly working. And we're going to continue to push. We've got a balanced approach to the market. We're definitely trying to grow where we can. We are emphasizing productivity as well. With that balance of drivers, OR and earnings drivers, we're confident that we can get into a sub-65 operating ratio by 2020 or sooner.","Ravi Shanker","Okay, got it. And just a follow-up for intermodal side for 2018. You clearly highlighted the tightness in trucking as a catalyst. When do you expect to start to see the benefits?","You said that you have about 45% of contract left and negotiated for the year. Is that something that shows up in the first half or do you wait for the second half to see that benefit start to flow in?","Alan Shaw","It will continue to move through the year. We started to see pricing improvement in that market of August of last year. It accelerated as we move through the fourth quarter. And as we have an opportunity to move into bid season, which is in March-April this year, that will offer continued support.","Ravi Shanker","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Amit Mehrotra","Hey, thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody. So I just wanted to ask one question on the CapEx budget for 2018. If I look up a year ago in terms of the initial CapEx were, you know, the increase is really not that significant. It looks like 75 million or so excluding the PTC spends and within that, there's actually spending declines even in infrastructure.","So can you help us think about that, specifically why 2018 CapEx doesn't need to be even higher given the declines in service metrics and may be what's the risk is there that may be some revisions higher? Thanks a lot.","James Squires","So Cindy went through the 2018 plan. $1.8 billion spread across a variety of categories, basic infrastructure, locomotives, technology and so on. We're open for growth. If our customers are investing in this economy, we will invest as well.","So in the past, we've shown flexibility with the capital budget. We cut where business conditions did not meet our expectations, we would be prepared to spend additional amounts if the returns were there and in a growing economy as well.","Amit Mehrotra","Okay. Let me just ask 1 follow-up if I could on tax reform, I guess. I mean, we've obviously seen a lot of companies talk about passing some of that on to employees in the form of may be onetime bonuses.","If you can just help us think about how much of the increase in cash flow or earnings will drop to the bottom line from tax reform through any changes some of you inflation expectations with wages or something like that, that we should be thinking about this year.","And then just related to that, what are the uses of the proceeds from the cash flow that will actually accrued in the earnings over above I guess the dividend announcement. Should we expect any acceleration in the share repurchase activity? Thank you.","James Squires","So let me talk about our capital allocation priorities in general, and then I'll turn it over to Cindy, maybe you go through some of the specifics, which she covered in her presentation. But ours is a balance capital allocation plan. We're going to start of the year with capital spending above what we spent - plan to spend above what we spent in 2017 and we're open for growth investments.","We are reflecting their confidence in our company and our future, our Board of Directors increased our dividend significantly. And we will have a robust share repurchase program in 2018 as well. Cindy, why don't you go through some of the specifics of tax reform and its impact on our bottom line?","Cynthia Earhart","Sure. Yes, as I've said, we expect that our effective tax rate going forward will be about 24%. I also mentioned that for 2018, that you should expect the cash taxes should be about 25% less than they were in 2016 - sorry, 2017, which may not seem like quite enough and there were some things going on in 2017 that will have a positive impact on cash flow and that was primarily around the debt exchanges. So moving the...","Amit Mehrotra","I understand the rates, but the question was really related to the absolute dollar amounts, will some of those dollars amount savings, I mean, I understand the rates. But are their absolute dollar amount savings going to 100% drop to the bottom line or do you expect some of that will be completed the way or actually accrued to the employee base as well, that is really the question?","Cynthia Earhart","We don't necessarily expect that we'll see wage changes as a result of this, that's your question.","James Squires","We're always interested in attracting and retaining the best and the brightest. We constantly looking at our benefit plans, at our compensation scales, to enable us to stay competitive in the market, and that will be our approach in the future as well.","Amit Mehrotra","Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. Congrats on a good quarter, I appreciate it.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Wadewitz","Yes, good morning. I wanted to - and congratulations on a strong year as well. I wanted to ask you a little bit about, may be for Cindy or Jim, on some of the moving parts on the expenses in 2018. I know you don't give specific guidance on these things, but just kind of a directionally.","So the incentive comp, $55 million rise year-over-year in fourth quarter, obviously, that's bit of a cost pressure. On a full year basis, would you think that incentive comp is likely down in '18 and potentially a tailwind or would you think of that as flat.","Operating property sales will be a benefit in 2017, I just wanted to see if that's also something that we should think as kind of flat when we model next year or it potentially a headwind. I guess, those 2 in terms of modeling - broader modeling questions?","James Squires","Go ahead Cindy.","Cynthia Earhart","Okay, yes. In terms of incentive comp and I mentioned this in my comments. Certainly, 2017, we had higher than probably average incentive comp that we've had over the last few years. I mean, talk about 2016, it was a lower. In 2015, obviously, it was zero.","So when you think about incentive comp, I said, our board has raise the bar in performance, and you'll see us in the first two quarters, we'll be accruing to target as we look at what operating results are actually doing throughout the year.","The back half of the year will really depend on our operating results. And if we are exceeding the targets that have been set, you'll see incentive comp accruals growing. And if not, they won't be growing. So that's hard to predict. But it will very much depend on our operating results.","Tom Wadewitz","Outlook for wage inflation.","Cynthia Earhart","I also guided to overall all in wage and health [ph] inflation of 1% in 2018. Now in terms of the sales and operating property, we have been looking very, very hard at our properties. And we're going to continue to do that and you did see that in the fourth quarter, we had an additional $25 million of gains in operating sales.","And we also had increases the last quarter. Those are really the very hard to predict. If we have properties that we're not using in operations and we're not getting good returns for, we're going to look to get rid of it.","And I can't really give you guidance necessarily into next year and certainly not quarter by quarter. But I will tell you that we're going continue - we've been on for the last year or so.","James Squires","Monetizing excess real state is part of our strategy. Long-term, we will drive lower operating ratios and higher incomes through improvements in rail revenue and productivity and expenses.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay. For the second question, Jim, you very clearly focused that - indicated your focus on truck competition that the way you're looking at the business, truck markets tighter. How would I think about that translation to your pricing?","I mean truck market, if you look at spot rates up 25%, 30% year-over-year is not a little tight, it's dramatically tight, right? And so truck contract rate potentially could be up 10%, for brokers they could be up 15%.","So it seems unusual in the trucking market in terms of the magnitude of rate increases, given your truck comments about how your truck focused you are, could you see unusually strong increases and may be versus historical and intermodal. Is that a reason way to look at it?","Or would you say, maybe you'd see unusually strong volume growth. Or - how do you think about that dynamic because it does seem that the truck market is unusually tight and rate increase could be bigger than what we've seen for quite a while?","James Squires","Well, let me start by saying that ours is balanced approach to revenue growth combining price increases with volume growth, where that make sense for the bottom line. So Alan we'll talk tomorrow about the conditions out there and the opportunity for rate increases on truck and competitive business.","Alan Shaw","Tom, we're really encouraged about the opportunities the pricing into this market. And frankly, a lot of our channel partners are similarly encouraged about their opportunity to price. But it doesn't just stop at intermodal. We had RPU growth of 2% to 7% in all of our growths in the fourth quarter except for coal, reflecting broad strength.","And as I noted earlier, pricing accelerated as we move into the fourth quarter and through the first quarter. So we're encouraged about the opportunities that are in front of us, both from a macro standpoint and from a competitive standpoint.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay, great. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your questions.","Chris Wetherbee","Hey, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about productivity in 2018, just how we think about that relative to 150 in 2017. And Jim, maybe you can step back and thinking about sort of where we are towards this 2020 targets, how do you feel the progress is being made, are you ahead of schedule, behind of schedule, where you thought you might? Just trying to get a perspective on to the progress?","James Squires","Okay. Well, productivity performance has been great for the first 2 years of this 5-year plan. $250 million right out of the gate in 2016 demonstrating the flexibility of our plan and our intense focus on productivity as a driver of improvement.","Another $150 million in 2017, so we're $400 million toward our goal of $650 million in the next couple of years. We're confident we can get that additional $250 million through a combination of productivity drivers that we had seen thus far, labor, materials, fuel and so forth.","So we're going to stay focus on at that. That's a key part of our plan. We've demonstrated the results thus far and we're confident that we can get the full $650 million over the next couple of years, that's a big enabler along growth of our sub-65 operating ratio by 2020 or sooner.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. But no specific number for '18, is what you're saying right now.","James Squires","As I've said, we're very confident we're going to get the additional $250 million on the way to that sub-65 operating ratio by 2020 or sooner.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay, that's helpful. And may be a follow-up, just on the intermodal business. So obviously a tight market and so there seems like there's a lot of opportunity there. I guess, just may be to want to understand how you think about the capacity allocation of the network.","So we've seen some service issues - you have search probably above and beyond expectations. As you look out into 2018, is there a way to think about how much capacity you actually do want to allocate in that truck competitive business. Do you put a cap on that because you don't want to go too far and spend too much money in shorter term appeared and have cycle into consideration? How do you think about that?","James Squires","I can, - I go back into the balance of the plan. We are working hard to drive shareholder returns through a combination of growth and productivity. That makes - that means making smart targeted investments, where those investments make sense on the network. In order to capture both productivity and growth going forward, and so that's what's the capital budget is all about this year.","As I've said, we're open for growth and you could see additional investments if the returns are there, we'll take our time, we'll do it right, we'll make sure that we maximize the returns from each and every dollar we put into the network going forward.","Chris Wetherbee","All right. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Barry Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Barry Oglenski","Hey, good morning, everyone and thanks for taking my questions. So I just wanted to circle back, did we get any guidance on land sale or expected to land sale gains in 2018? And I only asked because that does swing the model and I think, Tom might have alluded to that. And then also can we get some expectations on headcount looking forward?","James Squires","Sure, Cindy, you want to go back over the guidance with respect to land sales and then talk about headcount for 2018?","Cynthia Earhart","Sure, Brandon. In terms of land sales, as we've said before, we are looking very, very closely at our properties and trying to make sure that there's a business use for them where they're getting returns on them and we're going to continue our program to monetize where we need to, and where we do no longer need them in operations. So in terms of quarter-to-quarter, annual rate, it's very difficult to predict that, but I will say that, we're going to continue the strong program that we had.","In terms of headcount, we expect headcount to be stable going into 2018 compared to 2017. Obviously, we expect to continue to get productivity out of our workforce and we will do that. You may see the headcount vary from quarter-to-quarter because we will be hiring T&E employees ahead of peak like season. But overall, in terms of the entire year, you should see the headcount remain stable.","James Squires","So slight headcount, growing volumes equals labor productivity and human resources platform for growth.","Barry Oglenski","Okay. That's actually quite helpful. And then Jim, I guess, maybe are we just all looking at the wrong service metrics, because we're all focused on dwell and velocity. I think it came up earlier on this call. Are things on the ground may be not quite as bad as they would - or at least says we would perceive from those metrics?","James Squires","Look there's no question in there our work has slowed down and when it slows in the South, itself, people can't get to work, schools closed and there is no doubt about it. The network slows down and we did not deliver the velocity or terminal dwell that we were our customers expect late in the fourth quarter because of those winter conditions.","We are very focused on network stability and resilience. That is our goal, as we move through the first quarter, restoring to that, so that we'll have the service platform for growth for our customers and for ourselves.","We don't believe we have any systemic resource ripples and that means we have enough people. Cindy just went through our headcount outlook for the year, flat headcount. And we think we have enough other resources as well once we get the networks pulled back up.","Barry Oglenski","Got it. Sounds like a good year. Thanks, Jim.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter, Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Hoexter","Hey, great. Good morning. So Jim, just may be following on a lot of discussions focus on the yield side of your 2020 targets. But if you look at the volume CAGR, may be for Alan as well, your volume CAGR of 2%, you did 6% growth in intermodal. Given the tight market, merchandise is only 2% outlook as well, I guess, intermodal at 4%.","But Alan talking about accelerating economy, I guess, how do you think about the cost may be falling behind a bit? I guess, Chris was focused before on the intermodal side. But looking at the merchandise target and given the accelerated economic targets, how do you even ramp up in the near term on that cost like to counter that?","James Squires","I don't think there's any big ramp up in cost involved. We are going to the need to focus on productivity. And as I've said, we believe you have the resources in place to handle volume growth, foreseeable volume growth in the merchandise network.","We're also constantly working on business process at ground level. We are working on some things that we think will improve the consistency and efficiency of local customer service going forward.","That's going to take a while. We are doing it in collaboration with our customers. But your roll it out - all up, and we did we have the capacity to grow. Alan, do you want to add anything on the intermodal yield side of that?","Alan Shaw","Ken, that's a good opportunity for us. We will continue to push price that will play out over a period of time, starting with transactional business in mid-third quarter. It will ramp up with bid season in the second quarter or early - late first quarter. And I'll remind you that, truck pricing decline overall in 2017, and yet, our yields moved up.","Ken Hoexter","I have no doubt about the pricing side and what you've given us, I was more focused on the volume. Just if you looking at 2% CAGR volume and yet you're talking about accelerating volumes in the near term, your ability to handle that. That was the focus more on the merchandise given your 2% target in an accelerating economy?","Alan Shaw","Ken, what we've talked about in the past is we're focused adding business that fits into our network. And as you add business into the intermodal network and into the merchandise network, generally, you're running - you're putting it on to the tail end of scheduled trains. So that creates a lot of leverage for us. And it gives us the opportunity to add business without adding compensatory expenses.","James Squires","It works very well.","Ken Hoexter","Yes. So just a follow-up question, the shift of pension accounting obviously a much bigger for the Canadians. But Cindy, any impact to top rating ratio as you go forward especially given that your OR targets?","Cynthia Earhart","Yes, good question, Ken. If you look at 2017. The impact that the change in the pension geography would make. Obviously, now we'll be able to keep service cost in the pension expense - or in the compensation benefits line.","So for 2017 that would have had a $64 million unfavorable impact on compensation and benefits and favorable down another net. So that gives you kind of a feel for that.","Ken Hoexter","Perfect. Appreciate it. That's all from me. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephen's. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Long","Thanks and good morning. So I wanted to start with a question on PTC. It seems like the western rails are a little bit further along in the implementation. So I was wondering if you could just update us on your plans to roll out that technology. And as this plays out over the next few years, do you see risk to service and train speeds during this rollout?","Michael Joseph Wheeler","Yes, this is Mike. We are on track to have all the equipment - signal-type equipment installed in the ground as well as our locomotives equipped by the end of 2018. And also be running on over 50% of our railroad. We're at 44% today, so we feel very confident of meeting that goal.","That will give us the legislated extension to 2020, which we've always said we were going to do. So we're on track with that. You know what are the impacts to the operation?","Obviously, they are. Some of these signals cut over and there is thousands of these things to do, take several 6 to 8 hour of the time that we shut down the railroad and do the cut over and all that. So there is some impact. Long-term, once we get it all installed, working reliably, we don't see any significant service issues related to that.","Justin Long","Okay, great. And secondly, you gave first quarter guidance for coal, but is there anything you'd be willing to share as it relates to the quarterly cadence you're expecting over the remainder of the year?","Alan, I think you mentioned concerns with natural gas competition and export coal. So just wanted to potentially put some numbers around the moderation and tonnage that we could see over the course of the year.","Alan Shaw","Good morning, Justin. With the first quarter, we're looking at 15 million to 17 million tons of utility coal compared to 17.6 million tons compared to first quarter of last year.","How we move forward is going to be highly dependent upon weather patterns and natural gas. So that's - we're looking at that very closely, similarly with export coal. There's a lot of strength both in met and in thermal export coal.","And in fact, our split between met and thermal export was 50-50 in the fourth quarter of last year. As you're aware, typically, it's more heavily weighted towards metallurgical coal.","Now the indices are backward dated for those but they've been for a while and we are continuing to have conversations with our customers, to ensure that we got the resources in place, to handle that business. It has legs. All I can do is point you to the same market factors that we're looking at.","Justin Long","Okay. Thanks, Alan. Appreciate the time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of a Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Group","Hey, thanks. Morning. So just a couple of a follow ups on the labor line. Cindy, I think you said, for your incentive comp, you're accruing for the target for the first half of the year. I just don't know that means for the incentive comp in the first half of the year is, a year-over-year headwind, tailwind, how much?","You made a comment about the timing of stock comp and I wasn't sure I followed what you're trying to say. And just big picture on the OR, when you talk about OR improvement, that - is that inclusive of the headwind for moving the pension? I know its 40 basis points, not much, but I just want to make sure that, that's inclusive of that headwind.","Cynthia Earhart","Okay. Yes, Scott. So on the incentive comp, like I said, 2017, obviously, was a strong year for incentive comp. And going into 2018, the Board raise the bar on our performance. And so typically, we will be accruing a target level for the first 2 quarters. Going forward into the back half of the year, it's really going to depend on what our operating results are, whether we are exceedingly targets or not.","So that's what the incentive compensation was. In terms of the stock compensation, we typically - if you will look back at our 10-Q's, you'll see that the first quarter expense for stock compensation is much higher than second and the third and certainly the fourth quarter. There was a change that has been made to our plan that changes the vesting period.","So now the expense is going to be recognized, spread more similarly across the first 3 quarters and of course, you'll have a similar, I guess to 2017 fourth quarter expense. So that's what the stock compensation was. You also asked a question about OR and pension and what the impact will be. We still - we're very confident that we're going to improve our OR year-over-year, even with the pension adjustment.","James Squires","So our OR guidance is inclusive of that reclassification.","Scott Group","Okay. And then I'm still not clear on what you're trying to say on the incentive comp are going to tell get us back of the. But when you say you're accruing to a target for the first of the year, does that mean that first half incentive comp is higher or lower than what you did first half of '17?","Meaning, you've given us a very helpful guidance the last couple of quarters of it's going to be a $50 million year-over-year headwind, which it was. Can you give anything like that to help because in can - in quarters be meaningful swing.","Cynthia Earhart","If you look back on the Q's, in the first quarter and the second quarter of '17, you'll see we're accruing to target there. And - that would give you - I think it will give you an idea of what - you should expect in '18 and for the first and second quarter.","Scott Group","Okay, all right. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Ossenbeck","Hi, thanks. Good morning, Appreciate taking my question. And so two quick ones. First one, Alan, perhaps Cindy, can you give us a reminder of the fuel surcharge tied to WTI, that you mentioned. Seems like you're shifting a little bit more away from the revenue that's tied to WTI, but where the pricing there right now.","We'll we see that become a meaningful contribution in the next couple of quarters? Can you give us an update on when we should see that come in and rough ideas how much, that would be helpful.","Alan Shaw","Brian, as I've noted, about 2\/3 of our revenue is in now on an OHD fuel surcharge program. The remainder of the data will be effectively public pricing. And that, which under contract is tied to a WTI base program.","And within the WTI base program, there are different triggers. So the primary focus is on the OHD base program and we saw a $40 million increase in our fuel surcharge revenue just in the fourth quarter, reflecting that.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay. And then the trigger for WTI, is that still $64 a barrel and for how long? because we're sitting right in about that number right now?","Alan Shaw","Yes, Brian, we are. And as I've noted, there are different triggers within the WTI base program. As OR within OHD, $64 is the predominant one within WTI, but it's a well less than 1\/3 of our fuel surcharge program. Does that make sense?","Brian Ossenbeck","Yes. And if I can just as a quick follow-up, and Alan on coal, the RPU's down about 1% of fuel as you noted, but export volume were up, well above expectations. Looking back over the year, looks like this is a trend for the full year, I'm not sure if there's a been if there's really been a big mix shift to more thermal perhaps, but it looks like it's only volumes that are driving the export - or the coal line rather and with exports been so strong.","I thought you might have seen a little bit more price on that as well. So is it the mix shift or is there other structural change that's going on given what was a pretty supportive backdrop for last year, it looks like we're on the same pace for the first early part of this year?","Alan Shaw","Brian, I'm glad you brought that up. Let me take time to clarify that. So the two things that are going on, as we've noted, in the fourth quarter, we've had significant decline in our longer haul utility south business. And you'll see that actually our overall length the haul within coal declined year-over-year in the fourth quarter.","Now as a result, in the fourth quarter of 2017, our utility North business was - we have more volume in that franchise than we did in the Utility South, typically our mix is about 55% to 60% Utility South and 40% to 45% Utility North.","That flipped a little bit, we had about 52% Utility North in the fourth quarter. So that in and out in itself is a drag on RPU. Secondly, you talked about that mix between met and steam. And as I talked about, we have about 50%, 51% of our export volume in the fourth quarter was steam.","Contrast that to fourth quarter of 2016 and 30% of our export volume was within steam. We've got and we secured significant rate increases up with particularly within our metallurgical export volume throughout 2017, we started to see those increases in the fourth quarter of 2016.","So we got market-based rate increases, we're just dealing with a shift in mix, which drives more steam coal, which is typically lower rated, and more Utility North than less Utility South, and Utility North is typically lower length of haul.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay. Great. Thanks, Alan.","Operator","Our next question comes up from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.","Bascome Majors","Thanks for taking my question. I just want to follow-up with one more on the incentive comp. It looks like from what you disclosed this year that the full year headwind was well over above $100 million in 2017. Just to put a finer point on some of the earlier questions, if we go back to target levels for 2018, can you quantify what that tailwind would be?","James Squires","Cindy? I think we need to let the year play out. And see how the results trend. That ultimately will drive the compensation expense accruals. But I think as Cindy has stated, you should see some favorability in incentive compensation in the first half of the year at least. And then later on the year, it will depend on the results and we'll mark up or down the incentive comp accruals depending on the results.","Bascome Majors","But it sounds like you're unable to quantify how much '17 was above the target level.","James Squires","Well, the incentive comp is volatile, I'd give you that. And it varies year-on-year depending on performance, that's the way is supposed to work and that's the way it's design. When we do well, operationally, shareholder benefit then incentive comp increases as you saw on 2017. Going back to 2015, the company didn't pay a bonus because results were nowhere near our expectations. In 2016 was a lower above bonus year as well.","And you see that reflected in incentive comp accruals throughout 2016. So what I would suggest is that you examine that pattern of the expense accruals in those 3 years, that will give you some sense of where the balance lies and what would be a target incentive compensation amount.","Cynthia Earhart","Yes. I think that's right. Just one other thing that - make sure I emphasize them. We talked about the first 2 quarters. I think you're good to see the first 2 quarters of '18 will look very similar to the first 2 quarters of '17. And also, we'll announce our - the actual payout of our incentive comp, a percentage in the proxy, which will be coming out soon. So you can get a better sense of it than I think as well.","Bascome Majors","Thank you for that color. As my follow-up, I do want to be the dead horse on service levels and capacity. But I think today's a backdrop or where you got flat headcount and rising volumes and in some recent challenges to service metrics is just bring back memories of 2014 and '15 investors' minds.","How can you get shareholders comfortable that we're not on the cost of what could be a multi-quarter resource catch up in investment cycle like we saw a couple of years ago. And with what we can see externally, what signpost of progress should be watch for?","James Squires","You should see improvement in the public metrics, you should see velocity pick up and intermodal decline. Those are not the only metrics we used to manage service, obviously, and to monitor network performance, but those are valid and important metrics.","So watch for improvements in those areas. We will keep you updated on other service improvements that we're seeing. We remain confident that we have the resources we need to get to that stable, more resilient service pattern.","Bascome Majors","Thank you for the time.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Mr. Spracklin, your line is open for questions.","Walter Spracklin","Sorry about that. Yes, mixing all the service and capacity metrics together. I was wondering if you might be able to talk about some of the lines our product segments that you're seeing that were hardest hit and have you've seen any, you mentioned your customers might have not lived up to the customer expectations and have you seen any movement on the part of the customers away from it in those lines that we're seeing the tightest capacity and lower service?","James Squires","The capacity is tighter in the southern part of our network than it is in the northern part. We have a less double track, less siding capacity in the South, that's where the trains have attended to slow down and we're facing the most challenging operating conditions today.","In the north, quite fluid, we double track, lots of double track capacity, we've made capacity improvements in the northern region going back a couple of years. So it's in the south where we're facing the challenge. We're hard at work in facing that as note, we do believe we have the resources long term, to provide the service that our customers expect.","Michael Joseph Wheeler","That's where we're holding traffic for the hurricanes, it really came in from the south. Yes, that's where we feel that.","Walter Spracklin","Is there any structural impediments to the geography that will make it harder to achieve some of the capacity increases that you're looking to build out either through double stacking or double tracking?","James Squires","Double stacking is really not a concern, we're almost completely double stack in our core routes in the South and in the North. So that's not really the issue. It's sighting capacity, its double track in the South, which is historically we lack.","Where it makes sense to shift that balance a little bit for targeted investments, we will do so. But this is really all about good process and making sure that we're getting the trains over the road with the capacity that we have available.","Walter Spracklin","Okay. And then flip side of the customer - of the customer question, you've got a new sales person over at your competitor who obviously, brings a different approach to how they sell in - or how he sells in to - or into your customer base.","Are you noting any major changes in how that is - how the competitive landscape is playing out? Or are you seeing any, as a result, any disruptive initiatives in your customers over to your network or any magnitude that you can provide to that would be also helpful?","James Squires","Yes, Walter. As I've said, our focus is enhancing value at Norfolk Southern. And we are confident that we can do that by providing a competitive service to our customers that will allow them to grow. So it's all about our customers and our service. Moreover, we do view trucks as our primary form of competition, that's like we are working so hard to provide truck-like service to our customers.","Walter Spracklin","Okay. Thank you very much for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your questions.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Thanks very much and good morning. If I look at your 2018 year-to-date care loads they would suggest that you continue to experience difficult seasonal operating conditions. So I just wondered if you could give some color on that and what that implies relative to returning service to target levels?","James Squires","I think that's fair, we've had a tough start to the year in terms of the weather and operating conditions. It just becomes all the more difficult particularly in the southern part of the network when we see the kind of weather that we've had. In existence, we know what to do, we have hard work on it.","And we believe we will see a restoration of service levels and network performance as we get a little further into the first quarter. So the volumes are what they are, but the outlook is very bright. The economic conditions are excellent right now and we see lots of opportunities for growth.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Okay, and then separately, in terms of the customer engagement strategy that you introduced in early 2017, I think you've had a focus on dialogues with customers entering 2017 to better understand how they defined service and how you could better meet their needs. What if anything do you have plan in 2018 to move that into a next phase?","James Squires","Well, the first thing we are focused on is service as a customer defined service. So we talked a lot about network performance metrics, velocity terminal dwelling and so forth this morning and we do monitor those things as important indications of network performance.","But from the customer standpoint, what really matters, our consistency, grounded availability, order field, depending on the line of business, much more tailored customer service metric. That's our ultimate goal is to drive those metrics and earn customer satisfaction by delivering the service that they want as they define it.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Great. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","David Vernon","Hey, good morning, guys and question for the broader team. When we look at the 12% growth and income from railway operations, is there any additional color or guidance that you can give us around how much of that growth is attributable to the stronger export coal market?","We got a lot of questions about what are we buying here with Norfolk? Is this railroad earnings or this commodity inflation, anything you could give us that would help us to understand how much of that tighter global coal market has impacted operating profit, would be very helpful?","James Squires","Sure. Well, you saw the increase in export coal volume. We talked about some of the drivers of that in terms of our results. And that definitely did contribute to excellent results in 2017.","I might remind you that in 2016, we face a very difficult condition in the coal market, and yet we delivered a record operating ratio and record results in 2016. So the hallmark of our plan is flexibility in the phase of changing of market conditions. Alan?","Alan Shaw","David, it's a good point, it's a valid point. Export is important to us. We're focus on it although recognized it's 3% of our volume.","David Vernon","I totally understand it's 3% of the volume but I mean you can go back to the '60s '70s and see parts of that Norfolk Western rail line looking like a 50 OR. It's a relatively short haul down the Lamberts Point and it does have a lot of commodity inflation. I'm just trying to understand where - what - how impactful is it, was it several hundred basis points, is it a smaller basis point.","I mean you guys have done an awesome job on the OR, that's not the question, the question is really how much of a headwind can we expect based on this commodity markets to earnings for next year. I'm just trying to get a sense for any additional data points you could use to help us - we could use to help understand that there.","Alan Shaw","David, recognized a Jim said we had a very difficult coal year in 2016 and yet posted year-over-year operating ratio improvements in each of the 4 quarters of the year, that's the beauty of our plan.","Ultimately, our plan is designed to take trucks off the Highway and our read of the tape right now in economic conditions in the truck market is that it's pretty positive. And so we are looking for growth in both price and in volume, in our intermodal and our merchandise markets.","James Squires","And finally, David, I would just add, if you're looking to sensitize your projections based on assumptions and commodities, ours is a very broad-based portfolio. Our top line is highly diversified. We have a lot of customer-facing lines of business. Yes, commodity is a part of the portfolio, but it's broad and diverse.","David Vernon","Okay. And maybe just a follow-up question on the 24% on tax rate. You're expecting. If you were to think about and in an effective tax rate to use as a discount to that 24%, what's the right range that we should be modeling? I know you're going to be expensed in the CapEx excessive depreciation, but are there other tax yields that would drive that number. How low of that tax cash rate number should we expect in relation to that 24% guide on the book rate?","Cynthia Earhart","Well, for 2018, I think what we said was for cash taxes, you should expect them to be about 25% less than the cash taxes in 2017. And that's going forward, however and the reason for that, if you look at 2017, we had some things going on that helped cash taxes primarily around the debt exchanges.","So going beyond 2018, if you use current taxes as a proxy for cash taxes and you look at that as a percentage of pretax net income, historically, that number for us has been in the mid-20%. And I think if you look at beyond 2018, that number will probably be closer to the high-teens for cash tax. So that's our way to approximate it.","David Vernon","Great. Thank you very much for that added color.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Ben Hartford","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Couple of quick follow-ups, on the fuel surcharge program, now we're above $64 that we accrued. Any change in the emphasis toward continuing to migrate the programs over to on-highway diesel?","And I guess, in that same thing, is there a target of the percent of revenue by the end of the year that you expect the fuel surcharge programs to be on Highway diesel arrangements as a percent of revenue?","Alan Shaw","Ben, our primary focus is pricing on the market, reflecting the value of our service. And fuel surcharge is one of the terms and conditions that, that we'll negotiate with our customer base because I cannot offer a target on that, our primary target our primary focus is on driving shareholder value through pricing and through volume growth.","James Squires","Alan and his team has done a great job of migrating our field surcharge program from WTI to OHD. That's something we set out to do a couple of years ago. But as Alan points out, the ultimate goal is price.","Ben Hartford","Okay. And then as it relates to the NAFTA discussion, what percent of your traffic interchanges either northern or southern border?","Alan Shaw","Its' a modest amount. Although, I'll tell you that overall, international business is for us kind of approximates the international business for the United States. But NAFTA itself is a modest amount.","Ben Hartford","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our final question this morning comes from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please proceed with your questions.","Tyler Brown","Hi, good morning.","Alan Shaw","Good morning, Tyler.","Tyler Brown","Jim, we've heard anecdotes about the drayage capacity issues, particularly in the long haul dray market. Obviously, I realize a dray company, but do you think dray capacity could mute intermodal conversion opportunity this year. And second, are any of your intermodal markets kind of in that 100-mile watermark?","James Squires","Certainly tightness in drayage is - is a sentiment tightness in the truck capacity generally. Alan, without the specifics on the length of haul factor?","Alan Shaw","We've got over 50% of the population in our network. We touch over 50% on the manufacturing and 50% of the energy consumption. One of the great things about our network as it is very close to population centers. That's why we're confident that our plan will allow us to pick up business from the Highway as truck capacity tightens.","We have seen tightness in his markets within the drayage committee. And in some aspects that impacted our volume growth in the fourth quarter.","Tyler Brown","Okay, that's great. And in the capital plan, is there any contemplation of adding capacity into the EMP fleet or maybe the chassis pool to support growth? Or would just expect your channel partners to make those investments?","Alan Shaw","We are projecting that we will add capacity in our chassis fleet in 2018. But that's already included in our 2018 capital budget, the one we went through today. So yes, additional chassis in the supply chain would be helpful going forward.","Tyler Brown","EMP?","Alan Shaw","We're revisiting that. We're taking a look at the evolving truck market. Right now we don't have anything in there.","James Squires","As you know, we are a multi-channel intermodal provider and the EMP is one of our channels and we have a number of others as well.","Tyler Brown","Right. And just real quick, Cindy, I can't wait on the. Cindy, can you give instantly what the '17 cash tax paid was?","Cynthia Earhart","It was around, hold on 1 second. It's around $700 million.","James Squires","That's footnoted in the analyst book that we just put out.","Cynthia Earhart","Yes.","Tyler Brown","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I'll turn the floor back over to Mr. Jim Squires for closing comments.","James Squires","All right, thank you, everyone, for lots of excellent questions and feedback. We look forward to talking to you throughout the year."],"16442":["Norfolk Southern Corp (NYSE:NSC) Q1 2015 Earnings Conference Call April 29, 2015  8:45 AM ET","Executives","Katie Cook - IR","Wick Moorman - Chairman, CEO","Jim Squires - President","Mark Manion - Chief Operating Officer","Marta Stewart \u2013 CFO","Analysts","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs","Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Tom Wadewitz - UBS","Matt Troy - Nomura","John Barnes - RBC","Brian Ossenbeck - JP Morgan","Justin Long - Stephens","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research ","Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company","David Vernon - Bernstein Investment Research","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie","Operator","Greetings. Welcome to the Norfolk Southern First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Katie Cook, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Cook. You may now begin","Katie Cook","Thank you, and good morning. Before we begin today\u2019s call, I would like to mention a few items. First, the slides of the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors section. Additionally, transcripts and downloads of today\u2019s call will be posted on our website.","Please be advised that during this call we may make certain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially from those projected. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Additionally, keep in mind that all references to reported results, excluding certain adjustments that is, non-GAAP numbers, have been reconciled on our website in the Investors section.","Now, it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Wick Moorman.","Wick Moorman","Thank you, Katie and good morning everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to welcome you to our first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With me today are several members of our senior team, including our President, Jim Squires; our Chief Operating Officer, Mark Manion; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart.","As all of you know earlier this month we announced first quarter earnings of $1 per share, 15% lower than last year. These results reflected lower fuel surcharges on the top line as well as continued weakness in our coal franchise which restricted growth in revenue and revenue per units. Additionally, very severe weather in our service territories slowed our operations, increased our expenses and impacted our volumes. ","With the exception of the ongoing effect of lower fuel surcharges and continued pressure in our coal markets, we believe that most of our issues will be largely resolved by the second half of the year. Having said that, we will be up against strong comps particularly in the second and third quarters as last year\u2019s results were wrecking record-setting quarters for us. Jim will share with you more detail on the revenue trends and the outlook for the remainder of the year. ","With respect to service, we've already seen steady improvement in our network and we expect to reach our strong 2012-2013 velocity and service levels in the second half of this year. Mark will provide you with the latest on the relevant service metrics and our operations outlook and Marta will round it all out providing you with details of our full financial results. ","Before getting down to the details, I\u2019ll just reiterate what I told all of you on our earlier call. We have a great team at Norfolk Southern and while there are always uncertainties around our markets, all of us are confident in the long-term strength of our franchise and our prospects for future success. ","On that note, I'll turn the program over to Jim, Mark and Marta and then I will return with some closing comments before taking your questions. Jim?","Jim Squires","Thank you, Wick and good morning everyone. First quarter 2015 operating revenue declined 5% to $2.6 billion primarily due to a $102 million reduction in fuel surcharge revenues as a result of lower fuel prices. Growth in intermodal and merchandise volumes offset coal declines increasing first quarter volume 2% to 1.8 million units. ","Revenue per unit declined 7% but without the impact of declining fuel surcharges revenue per unit declined only 2%. Mix shifts between increased volumes of intermodal and decreased volumes of coal offset strong pricing across most of our business segment. We will discuss the mix impact as we review each commodity group.","Overall volume growth of 2% for the quarter was driven by a 5% gain in intermodal and a 3% gain in merchandise markets, partially offset by a 7% decline in coal volumes. After a strong start to the year, volume in the first quarter was again impacted by winter weather conditions and the accompanying service disruptions particularly throughout February. But similar to first quarter 2014 we achieved strong volume and improved service levels in March. ","Breaking out the market segments, starting with coal, first quarter volume decreased 7%. Coal burn at eastern utilities was down 14.5% in the first quarter due to lower national and regional natural gas prices, causing our utility volumes to decline 6%. ","Volumes to northern utilities were down nearly 9% while volumes to southern utilities were down 2%. While handling a greater percentage of utility volume to our Southern utilities generally increases our coal revenue per unit, this positive mix impact was more than offset by a 20% decline in export coal volumes in the first quarter. Persistent weak conditions in the global marketplace, soft prices and a strong US dollar made it very difficult for US coals to complete in this oversupplied environment. ","Domestic metallurgical volumes were down 1% with weaker demand for met coals related to softer steel production and sourcing shifts partially offset by market share gains of coke ships [ph]. This decrease in volume and lower fuel surcharges reduced revenue by $86 million to $455 million, a 16% decline versus first quarter 2014. In addition to the previously discussed mix changes, lower fuel surcharges also negatively impacted margin. ","Turning to our intermodal market. We continued to see strong volume growth of 5% to nearly 927,000 units. Intermodal pricing gains outpaced our other business units with continued growth expected the rest of the year. Despite these positive trends, decrease in fuel surcharge revenues drove the decrease in overall revenue and revenue per unit.","The effects of lower fuel surcharge revenues more than offset a 2% increase in average revenue per unit already dampened by negative mix, resulting from higher volume increase in international freight. As we discussed before, international intermodal freight has a lower revenue per unit. ","Merchandise revenue of $1.5 billion was down 32 million or 2% for the quarter with a 5% decline in revenue per unit. More than 80% of this RPU decline was due to fuel surcharges. We also experienced negative mix associated with increased volumes in lower rated sand, gravel and aggregates while higher rated iron and steel volumes decline.","Our automotive sector was also impacted by negative mix with its decreased auto parts shipments and increased high level of traffic. Volume for the merchandise was up 3% overall with the strongest gain in our chemicals market due largely to increased shipments of crude oil from the Bakken and Canadian oilfields to East Coast refineries, as well as increased natural gas liquids from the Marcellus, Utica shale plays. ","Automotive volumes increased 4% in the quarter with increased vehicle production at several key NS served plants. Our metals and construction markets benefited from increased volumes of aggregates for construction projects in the Southeast as well as increased frac sand volume into the Marcellus, Utica region to support natural gas drilling efforts. These increases were partially offset by reduced shipments of steel pipe and steel coil driven by a softening of the pipe market and reduced steel production in the quarter. ","Agriculture shipments were up 2% with increased volumes of corn, moving to Southeast poultry producers as well as increased volumes of feed products and fertilizers. These gains offset reduced volumes of export soybeans resulting from a record South American crop, strength of the US dollar and limited railcar availability. ","Finally paper and forest products volumes were flat in the quarter with strength in lumber related to the continuing housing recovery offset by reduced volumes of wood chips and waste materials. ","Let me close with expected trends in volume and revenue for the balance of the year. First, we expect solid volume growth in many parts of our franchise throughout the year. Highway conversions and corridor investments should continue to drive domestic intermodal growth while international intermodal shipments will benefit from the recovery following the West Coast port disruptions earlier in the year. We expect growth in natural gas liquids despite lower oil prices, crude by rail volumes. Double digit growth in housing starts and increases in construction activity should generate more lumber plastics, soda ash and aggregates traffic. Automotive volumes should grow at a rate better than North American vehicle production driven by output at key NS served plants. ","Ethanol shipments should increase due to rising gasoline consumption and project related growth while a stronger crop should push export soybean volumes up later in the year. However lower oil prices are expected to cause declines in our metals and construction group as drilling activity slows reducing shipments of pipe, frac sand and other drilling imports. Further production curtailments by major steel producers and high inventories will likely dampen shipments of iron and steel products. ","Lastly though natural gas prices, utility stockpiles at or above target levels, a strong US dollar and global oversupply will make this a challenging year for coal. We continue to obtain price increases at or above the rate of real inflation in most areas of our business and should see negative price mix effects abate in the second half. However high fuel surcharge recoveries in the comparable periods last year are likely to result in lower revenue in the second and third quarters and for the full year. By the final quarter of 2015, however, we expect top line growth to assume. ","Thank you for your attention and I will now turn the presentation over to Mark who will provide an update on our first quarter operations.","Mark Manion","Thank you, Jim. Restoring our service levels remains our primary focus. However safety is at the heart of everything we do. So let\u2019s take a look at our safety numbers. ","Turning to Slide 2, our reportable injury ratio was 1.08 for the first quarter of 2015 as compared to 1.49 for the first quarter of 2014. The train incidents through March 2015 were 71 versus 61 over the same period last year. Grade crossing accidents through March were 76, down from 88 over the same period in 2014. ","Now let\u2019s take a look at our service. While our service composite in the first quarter was lower than 2014 as a whole, we are operating at a higher level than we were in the fourth quarter even with the more challenging operating conditions that existed in the first quarter. In addition, as you can see on the right, our service has been trending upward since the end of February. The timeline and trajectory of our service recovery I provided on our last call which outlined the incremental improvement in the second quarter with more significant improvement in the second half of this year has not changed. We expect that composite service performance will be near 80% by the end of the second quarter.","And as you see, the sizable improvement in train speed and dwell in December was maintained in January and although February was challenging recovery has been evident. We expect this trend of increasing train speed and terminal dwell reduction to continue through the rest of the second quarter. We fully anticipate that our end of quarter speed and dwell metrics will be commensurate with the superior service levels we achieved in 2012 and 2013. ","As you have seen, we\u2019ve made solid improvements and we expect to see even larger gains in our service metrics by the end of the second quarter. Slide 5 outlines our plan that will lead to these larger gains. We have an increase of 600 conductors and 50 locomotive engineers between March 1 and July 1. We expect to take receipt of 40 additional SD90MACs during the same time period and we\u2019re already seeing the number of bad order locomotives normalize which will result in 160 additional locomotives available for service. ","By the second half of the year we anticipate we will be storing some of our older higher maintenance locomotives which will reduce our expenses and strengthen our service reliability. ","With regard to infrastructure, the connection track in Chicago as well as Goshen siding east of Elkhart were completed in April. Both of these projects will further improve our fluidity through the Chicago corridor. Lastly, the second phase of the Bellevue plant has begun with modification of the eastbound flows. The westbound flows will then be implemented later in the summer. The full implementation of Bellevue will improve velocity through reduced car handling, improved asset utilization and result in an overall reduction in cost structure. ","In closing, we\u2019re confident our service will continue to trend in the right direction with sequential improvements in the second quarter. In the second half of the year we expect improved metrics consistent with strong service levels as the full effect of our investments is realized. ","Thank you and now I will turn it over to Marta. ","Marta Stewart","Thank you, Mark. Now let\u2019s review our financial results for the first quarter. As you can see on Slide 2 and as has already been noted, the weather and service challenges significantly affected our first-quarter results. Jim discussed the 5% decline in revenues and while operating expenses decreased by $61 million or 3%. It was not sufficient to offset the revenue decline resulting in a 9% reduction in income from railway operation and an operating ratio of 76.4%.","Slide 3 outlines the major cost categories affected by the weather and service recovery effort. These are estimated at $42 million the largest portion of which was in compensation and benefits. Additional service hours were incurred in all areas of operations, including train and engine employees for field service, mechanical employees to maintain the higher number of locomotives and maintenance way employees related to storm clean-up and repair. ","Similarly the other listed expenses reflect the increased cost of a slow network and added assets. Purchased services and rents were primarily affected by the decreased velocity, while the last two categories: materials and fuel were principally affected by the rise in locomotive count. ","As we previously stated, some of the service recovery costs are expected to continue into the second quarter, however, at a lower level currently estimated at $25 million. ","Turning now to Slide 4. This illustrates the year-over-year change by expense category. Fuel was the only category to decline versus the first quarter of last year and the decrease was largely attributable to lower prices as shown on the next slide. ","Breaking down the components of the fuel expense change, $160 million of the reduction was due to price as consumption was flat on the 2% increase in traffic volume. ","Slide 6 depicts a $43 million or 6% rise in compensation expenses. We had higher than usual wage rate and payroll tax increase. As discussed during our January call, the union wage increase was effective January 1 versus the July 1 timeframe of recent years. This resulted in a $26 million increase. ","Payroll tax rates rose on January 1 as well and total payroll taxes were up $14 million. In addition, employee activity levels, increased hours, more overtime and more trainees added $14 million and signing bonuses related to our recently ratified agreement with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers added $11 million. That labor agreement also calls for a lump sum bonus which will affect fourth quarter expenses by a similar amount. ","The final significant item within the compensation area was the reduction in the accruals for incentive and stock comp, reflective of the quarter's results. ","Slide 7 shows purchased services and rent expense which increased by $31 million or 8%. This rise is primarily due to higher volume related activities such as equipment rents and intermodal operation. As previously mentioned, lower network velocity also caused these costs to rise.","Turning to the next slide, materials and other expenses rose by $25 million or 11%, about half of the increase was due to higher materials expenses and was associated with both locomotive and maintenance of way usage. Environmental and personal injury expenses also rose in part due to a prior year favorable accrual. ","And lastly costs increased largely related to our train service employees who had more overnight stays as well as temporary transfers to areas on our systems with crew needs. ","Depreciation expense displayed on Slide 9 rose by $8 million or 3%, reflecting our larger capital base as we continue to invest in infrastructure and equipment. ","Operating expense headwinds are summarized on the next slide. In addition to the service recovery costs, the wage and payroll tax increases and the lump sum payment, 2015 expenses will include costs associated with the previously announced closing of our Roanoke, Virginia office. Approximately 450 employees will be affected by this move going from Roanoke to either corporate headquarters in Norfolk, operations headquarters in Atlanta or choosing to retire or resign. Moving and relocation costs in 2015 related to this transition are expected to total $35 million and will begin to be incurred in the second quarter although most of the costs will impact the third quarter when the bulk of the relocation are expected to occur. Efficiencies associated with this consolidation will begin to benefit expenses in the fourth quarter. ","Next, income taxes totaled $185 million or an effective tax rate of 37.4% compared with 33.6% in 2014. As you may recall, last year contained a $20 million or $0.06 per share tax reduction resulting from a tax law change in Indiana. ","Net income and EPS comparisons are illustrated on Slide 12. The $58 million net income decrease is a 16% decline compared to last year and diluted earnings per share of $1 was 15% lower than last year. ","As shown on the final slide, cash from operations covered capital expenditures as well as our higher dividend level $181 million. On our fourth quarter earnings call in January, I mentioned we anticipated returning to a higher level of share repurchases. During the first quarter, we used cash on hand to buy back $415 million of our shares. We now expect full-year 2015 repurchases to be between 1.2 million and 1.3 billion. ","And with that, I thank you for your attention. And I will turn the program back to Wick.","Wick Moorman","Thanks Marta. Well, as you've heard, clearly our first quarter results were not as strong as we and you expected that they would be. And in the short-term we face some continuing headwinds and the tough comps from last year. However we see continuing strength in the overall economy and as Jim described we have a lot of opportunities in many of the markets we serve and a great franchise with which to capitalize on these opportunities. ","In addition, we\u2019re well on the way to restoring our network velocity and efficiency which will drive further costs out of our operation and as all of you know that will also enable us to secure more business at rates that drive positive returns for our shareholders. As we do that we also remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders as demonstrated through our strong dividend history as well as through our share repurchase program where as Marta just mentioned we\u2019re now targeting between 1.2 billion and $1.3 billion in share repurchases this year. ","In sum, we have a proven strategy for success and the right people and resources to successfully execute it. ","Thanks and I'll turn it back to the operator for your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Thank you and our first question is coming from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.","Bill Greene ","Jim, you obviously identified in your slides the challenges ahead from the fuel surcharge mechanism. We asked this last time as well but since we\u2019ve gone another quarter and now with the pre-announcement, is there any reason to think that you might sort of address that again and come back and say, maybe we need to adjust that and change that going forward a number of the freight transports at rebates to fuel surcharges given the volatility there. So what are your thoughts on fuel surcharges?","Jim Squires","We are working toward shifting more of our revenue to an OHD based fuel surcharge mechanism over time and so that\u2019s going to take a while, it\u2019s contract by contract, customers have their own preferences. Our overall goal will be to increase rate and grow the revenue and -- but we recognize that our reliance on WTI in our fuel surcharge program creates volatility in our earnings and that\u2019s undesirable. So we will be working over time to shift to a more OHD based program.","Bill Greene ","Okay and then Jim, or even Wick, how you get confident in volume growth being actually a good thing? Obviously last year we had service challenges and we had unexpected growth and now we are having sort of a change in the macro outlook that's created some excess resources and yet the service levels aren\u2019t back. So can you sort of walk us through your thoughts on, does it make sense instead to sort of let\u2019s focus on getting the right kind of business on the network to result in a better margin or better outcome and not worry so much about the volume growth instead, do you know what I am getting at, right? So it seems like there needs to be more of a focus so much on shrinking the business, that will improve the service which is even better for price?","Wick Moorman","Bill, I understand your question that I think it's a very reasonable and interesting one. One of the things that I will say about our volume growth is we don't go out and try to grow volume at rates and margins that don't make sense from the standpoint of shareholder value. So we're not -- we're certainly not in the mode of let's just grow volume for volume sake, and in fact, if you look at a lot of our volume growth this quarter it's been in intermodal where you know we made a lot of investments and where we're now seeing, as Jim mentioned, a very positive pricing trends. So we don't see that as a problem. In fact, we see volume growth at good rates as a strength for us. We also don't see that volume growth as severely impacting in any meaningful way our service recovery. ","Our service recovery is based upon getting the right resources in there. We think we\u2019ve largely done that and we\u2019re on the right path back. Last year as you mentioned, we had some volume growth. We clearly did not foresee in the second and third quarter and got caught short primarily on the crew side. So the volume growth we're having right now we see as desirable, we see as continuing to be a good thing for us. As Jim mentioned in this quarter in particular and although we may see it for a little while longer, we saw some mix effects even within our merchandise business, this didn't overall -- didn't help our overall RPU but even within that, the somewhat lower rated traffic that was growing, was still good margin business and business that we want to continue to handle.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Ken on for Allison. So just a quick question on the buybacks, so I mean as you mentioned the buyback was pretty big in Q1 and you highlight a target of 1.2 million, 1.3 billion for the full year. Just curious on how that could possibly trend through the next few quarters, and whether there is any limit on how big of a buyback you can do in any one quarter?","Marta Stewart","Well, the estimate of 1.2 billion to 1.3 billion is just a little bit higher than what we projected on the January call and so we are very comfortable with that level. We did not issue debt last year, we have plenty of debt capacity this year and we\u2019re comfortable with our projections, that that\u2019s going to be an amount of cash we\u2019re going to be able to return to the shareholders.","Unidentified Analyst","And just as my follow-ups, so you mentioned that utility coal stockpiles were currently above target. Just curious how far above target you\u2019re seeing the stockpiles currently trend at your utilities and how long you would expect it to take to get back to that target level if we assume a normal weather environment?","Mark Manion","Based on our estimates, utility stockpiles in the south at the end of March were at around 71.5 days, in the North 65.3 days. Rough target for southern stockpiles of 70 and for the northern utilities about 50 days. So as between the two of the northern utilities are a bit more overstock, the stockpile trends will depend heavily on the weather pattern in the summer and all of our assumptions around utility coal, in fact, you assume a normal weather pattern in the summer which would drive our volume assumptions going forward.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs.","Thomas Kim ","Marta, I wanted to ask about your Roanoke relocation. You talked about the incremental costs you\u2019re going to incur this year but I was wondering what are the savings we should anticipate next year? And then I guess more importantly, are there further opportunities to rationalize or consolidate your operations and is there a pipeline that you might have alluded to?","Marta Stewart","Well, the Roanoke relocation had, Tom, two components to it. I mean the primary reason why we decided to do that was because we think it will be more effective for our people to be in fewer locations. So we think that will help the operations of all of the departments that are involved. So that was number one. But as a result of doing that, was sort of a catalyst to accelerate some G&A reductions that we have been planning for the next three or four years and so that allows us to \u2013 because some people are choosing not to move, that allows us just kind of accelerate those as I said. So we think we will have about 150 G&A positions between now and the end of the -- between the third quarter and the end of the first quarter of next year that will come out as a result of that.","Thomas Kim ","And then a question with regard to the coal and particularly I guess the coal exports. What are the levers you can adjust to a potentially longer and deeper down-cycle for export coals? I mean to what extent would it make sense to maybe even rationalize terminal interest and then maybe even with rolling stock, is there something you could do there, like you\u2019re satisfied with the utilization levels or could you do anything with regard to even that side of the business?","Mark Manion","For starters, we can be very nimble with our equipment asset, serving our coal business, our export coal business. We can obviously redeploy the locomotives, we can downsize or curtail coal car replacements. So we have complete flexibility with regard to the equipment. The infrastructure adjustments would involve adjustments to maintenance levels particularly in the coalfield and in some cases perhaps longer-term mothballing of the asset but most likely the infrastructure side would involve service reductions until the volumes return.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank.","Rob Salmon ","With regard to the merchandise outlook, obviously there are couple of puts and takes with regard to your growth expectations, with weakness on the softening steel production side as well as growth in several other end markets. When I'm thinking about the crude by rail outlook, it sounds like you're expecting continued growth. I would imagine we should be seeing those that volume growth decelerate and potentially decline in the back half of the year but I was hoping for a little bit more color in terms of your expectations regarding that and commodity.","Mark Manion","So we handled around 29,000 crude by rail shipments in the first quarter of 2015 and that compares to 22,000 crude by rail shipments in the comparable quarter last year. That\u2019s an increase of 34%. Now since the first quarter of last year we have had a handful of new customers come online. With softening oil prices we do expect the growth rate for crude by rail to decelerate but we think we should be able to maintain a ratable 29,000 or 30,000 car loadings per quarter this year. That would imply growth year-over-year in the second-quarter and for the full-year but we would be modestly negative relative to the crude by rail volumes in the third and fourth quarter. ","Rob Salmon ","And then with regard to the train length opportunities on the merchandise network, do you feel like as the service improves that there should be the opportunity to extend out those train lengths in the back half of the year or given some of the softening of kind of the growth in crude by rail as well as likely declines in the steel production, will that be an offset in terms of your ability to gain some operating leverage opportunity in the merchandise network?","Wick Moorman","We\u2019re always looking for ways to increase our average train lengths and in fact we are seeing an increase in our merchandise train lengths even now, I think we are in the neighborhood of 5900 feet thereabouts currently and keeping in mind that our system our siding capacity at a minimum is in the 8000 foot range. So lot of room to grow there and that\u2019s something we continue to work on and that has mostly to do with continuing to adjust our train plan, our operating network plan to be the most efficient.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.","Scott Group ","Jim, I know you talked about expectations for revenue to remain down the next couple of quarters. I am wondering is if you can share with us your view, if you think that the revenue declines kind of moderate in the second and third quarter or do they kind of stay here, maybe even get worse and if you think based on that -- should we continue to expect kind of these double-digit type range declines and I know you don't typically give that level of color but obviously a lot of us have struggled modelling the numbers in the first quarter, so might be helpful just to get your perspective on your earnings and revenue?","Jim Squires","Well, let me start by reminding you of the fuel surcharge comparisons in the second and third quarter. So in the first quarter of this year we booked $163 million in fuel surcharge revenue, that was a $132 million decline year-over-year. Last year in the second quarter we booked 358 million in fuel surcharge revenue, 369 million in the third quarter of last year. So assuming stable oil prices for the next couple of quarters that would imply roughly $200 million less fuel surcharge revenue per quarter for the second and third quarter. Then in the fourth quarter the comparisons get a little bit easier. Last year we took in $308 million in fuel surcharge revenue in the fourth quarter. So that right there is a pretty significant revenue headwind for the next couple of quarters. ","On the other hand, as I said we expect some of the negative mix effects we saw in the first quarter to begin to abate. And so by the third quarter \u2013 based on our current forecast we would be looking for revenue for shipment excluding FSCs to turn favorable. And similarly revenue ex fuel surcharges in the third quarter will turn favorable and then by the fourth quarter we start to see overall growth in the top line. Now that obviously has a volume component as well and there we are feeling pretty bullish. Obviously the declines in coal volume are not helping but we\u2019re feeling as if on the utility side, natural gas substitution has run its course and we should be able to see a fairly stable utility coal volume run rate for the balance of the year albeit with the tough comparisons to last year. So that\u2019s our overall outlook on the revenue and so we have a lot of opportunities to grow revenue and as I said the negative mix effect should begin rolling off in the second half. ","Scott Group ","And then just other question as we think bigger picture and a lot of rails have operating ratio targets in that 60%, low 60% range and I'm wondering as you think about the business, Jim, are there -- do you think that there are structural differences for you or Eastern rails in general or is that eventually a place where you think you can get to with the right mix of revenue and costs?","Jim Squires","No, last year at this time we were on the verge of producing some of the best quarters that we\u2019d produced in this company\u2019s history and the lowest operating ratios as well. And that was possible because we were seeing significant growth, volume growth in our merchandise and intermodal businesses in particular and that was sufficient to more than offset declines in our coal business and that's the formula for us going forward. We will begin to see our coal volume stabilized at some point and we will, we believe, grow our merchandise volumes, our highest incremental margin volumes and our intermodal volumes with a substantial price increases to grow. That is a formula for continued improvement in our financial performance and for materially lower operating ratios in the future.","Wick Moorman","Yes, let me add to that. I think that sure inherently if you -- relative to franchise businesses, the west looks different than the east, looks so different in Canada but we, as Jim mentioned, we came off of -- we come off a year where we took our operating ratio for the year below 70 for the first time. We expect to continue to drive operating ratio improvement and we have a very very strong franchise particularly in terms of intermodal and merchandise. So I think that the pace of when you get there is obviously always something that the economy will largely determine as well as our own efforts but we have internal goals for driving operating ratio down and we believe that we will continue to do that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS.","Tom Wadewitz ","Wanted to ask you a little bit about the pricing. You got a lot of moving parts in the revenue side and you\u2019ve highlighted the mix headwinds. But is there any way to kind of disentangle that and talk about core price, give us a sense of \u2013 were you at in the first-quarter or if you don\u2019t want to do that, if you just talk about progression, should we expect ex-mix to see acceleration in year-over-year price or did you kind of already get the step-up from tighter rail capacity in the first quarter and the negative mix rolling off, or how do we think about -- how much core price you\u2019re getting and whether that accelerates if you look in the second quarter, third quarter?","Jim Squires","We were successful in meeting our goal of increasing pricing, core pricing at a rate at or better than rail cost inflation measured based on all inclusive less fuel in the first quarter, in most of our businesses. Generally speaking outside coal, we were able to drive pricing higher and I think most encouragingly we saw the largest core pricing increase across our book of business in our intermodal line. ","Tom Wadewitz ","What do you see \u2013 you referred to a lift, where did you a lift in the first quarter?","Jim Squires","So reported a lift [ph] in the first quarter 2.8%. ","Tom Wadewitz ","So it\u2019s not really caveat lifting across the board, you would have done better than that 2.8% if we looked at the core price kind of taking out next, is that fair?","Jim Squires","Right, right, with the exception of coal as I mentioned, virtually across the board, there were pockets where we were stronger. But on average we were able to meet the goal of increasing core prices at that rate.","Tom Wadewitz ","And what about the aspect of accelerating? I mean it seems like you are pretty optimistic about improving the network performance, so you would think that customer service would improve as you look into through second quarter and second half, I guess the truck market seems like it boosts into a bit maybe freight overall isn\u2019t as strong. But do you think there is more momentum in pricing, that would accelerate or have you kind of achieved the run rate in the first quarter and if you stay stable in the next couple of quarters. ","Jim Squires","We will stay focused on raising prices at a rate better than, at or better than rail inflation. That\u2019s our long-term goal. The contracts vary by quarter, the pricing opportunity varies quarter by quarter but overall we\u2019re going to stay very very focused on that goal and are confident we can achieve it.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Matt Troy with Nomura Securities. ","Matt Troy ","I just had a question, maybe a big picture overview of the network. You guys have done a good job of explaining your target of returning the service metrics, speed or dwell or your composite service indices back to kind of the peak 2012 2013 levels by 2Q. And you\u2019ve also kind of outlined very nicely what you intend to do to get there. I just wanted to take a step back and maybe understand from an operational perspective, if we were to look at a network map, sort of a heat map if you will, what are the key areas that you need to address, the pinch points if you will, as you\u2019ve given us the pieces to get us there, the targets that you like to reach, I just would like a better understanding because we\u2019re only 6 to 8 weeks out from kind of the middle of the second quarter, or the start of the third quarter when you can hit these goals. What are the focal points that will help you get to \u2013 to get to these targets?","Jim Squires","Well our most challenging part of the system last year and into the first quarter was our Chicago line and really principally between Chicago and the Cleveland area and a lot has gone on in order to increase our velocity and I will say that, that area is running really well now. There\u2019s just really been a lot of focus on it. So in order to do that there was a \u2013 we really pinpointed the manpower increases which has come along very nicely and I will just say that we\u2019re in pretty darn good shape up in that area from a manpower standpoint. Now another thing that has been going on for a longer period of time is infrastructure improvement up there and I did mention the fact that we got a couple of significant infrastructure projects that are now complete, that just give us -- it just gives us a bigger pipe around that traffic through there. So keeping in mind that parts of that area, they will run a 100 or more trains a day. So infrastructure improvement, nice increases the Bellevue project like I said, it\u2019s more to come which will be very helpful as well as we go through the summer. So that\u2019s the area we put a lot of concentration into and it\u2019s paid off very nicely and of course a lot of the things going around the other parts of the system and other very important parts of the system but that was the big focus and it\u2019s really had a nice ending.","Matt Troy ","And my follow up would be on the intermodal piece. The international volume growth of 8%, makes sense given the potential for some diversions, residually from the West Coast port strike, work stoppage but the domestic piece, the volume is up only 3%, was a little bit lighter than I think we become accustomed to seeing through given your good traction and progress in highway conversions. Wondering if you could just update us on the corridor gateway strategy and was that 3% representative kind of more of a GDP level growth what you'd expect this year or were there certain mix factors or contractual factors that we saw a little bit of a dip in the growth in domestic intermodal for you folk should kind of resume at a multiple of GDP as it has been in the past?","Jim Squires","Sure Matt. Let me take a stab at that. So within the domestic intermodal we obviously have several channels. The intermodal company IMC channel principally hub and hunch grew at 6%. So that's a little closer to our historical growth rate and that\u2019s a sort of growth rate we would expect to see or better out of that channel going forward. Our premium and triple crown books declined somewhat and that's what led to the overall 3% increase in volume and the total domestic book. Going forward we do think that that we can continue to drive the entire domestic intermodal franchise at growth rates more like mid high single digits. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Our next question comes from the line of John Barnes with RBC.","John Barnes ","First on the operating ratio improvement, so asking for a specific target but whatever we model for OR improvement you\u2019ve given \u2013 you got the service related costs, you got the savings from Roanoke, you got some things like that, can you just talk about the magnitude of each of those and kind of from most important to least important, what's going to drive the improvement going forward?","Marta Stewart","The main thing that will drive improvement will be getting the network back to the velocity that Mark mentioned. So the train speed, the terminal dwell, improvements that he mentioned, he thinks will have in the second half of the year, that is the main thing that will help us with expenses. I would like to point out if you are looking at the OR that going forward as Jim mentioned the fuel surcharge component of it is going to be quite a drag on our operating margins the rest of the year. ","John Barnes ","And then from network velocity, kind of what\u2019s the next couple of catalysts there?","Marta Stewart","After network velocity? So it\u2019s just general productivity \u2013 and again that network velocity we think will begin to \u2013 will happen towards the end of the second quarter. So we expect that improvement to happen in the second half of the year. ","Wick Moorman","If you look at our track record for the 2012-2013 period and we discussed this a lot. When you ramp the network up you start to take -- not only do you take the costs out that Marta has been discussing but it then sets the stage for even further projects to continue to drive costs down particularly as volume grows and it's that combination of an ever higher network velocity Mark mentioned Bellevue and we talked to you about the savings that are coming online as we turn Bellevue on. But it\u2019s a combination of having a stable high velocity network which then sets the stage for continuing projects to drive velocity along with the leverage as Jim mentioned the volume growth that really drive the economics of Norfolk Southern and for that matter any railroad.","John Barnes ","And then my follow up is \u2013 Jim, you talked about stability on the coal franchise. Can you talk about how \u2013 how you weigh getting to maybe a more stable but lower level of coal both on the domestic and the export side and when you sort of make maybe some of those service adjustments and begin to take assets out, begin to downsize or rationalize the size of your coal support network, I mean when do you begin to do that, what do you have to see from a stability standpoint to really start to hammer again with the costs on the coal side if stable is going to be what we get going forward?","Jim Squires","Let me start with the utility side of the franchise and give you some of our assumptions for the balance of the year, and I will be referring to utility tonnage here. We did 21.1 million tons of utility coal in the first quarter and our current forecast has that level of utility volume holding basically steady for the remainder of the year. As I mentioned, we do believe that gas substitution with met gas in the current price range has run its course, there's very little tonnage left to come out due to match and of course the implications of carbon regulation down the road are somewhat unknown at this point. But in terms of mets we will maybe see 500,000 fewer tons this year and so at that level of volume that\u2019s albeit significantly depressed from last year and even more so from years past. We probably do not have an opportunity and would not want to take out significant infrastructure. ","On the other hand we can and already have downsized our equipment investments in our coal business. At this level of volume we can make do with our current coal car fleet for some time, that have been relieved of the significant capital investments in coal price. That pertains really more to the export side of the business. So let me touch on that as well. We handled 5.3 million tons of export coal in the first quarter, that\u2019s down significantly from last year first quarter which was our peak quarter for export coal. For the remainder of the year we are calling for 4.5 million to 5 million tons of export. Feel pretty confident on the thermal side of that. If there's a downside potentially it would be more on the met side or central app producers are very challenged right now. But again at kind of a $20 million annual run rate, 20 million ton annual rate for export coal, we probably would not want to significantly downsize our infrastructure, although we do have the opportunity to reduce spending on equipment and people side of it is something we can modulate as well.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Prashant [ph] in for Chris. I apologize, earlier we were having a little headset issue here. I realized running a little bit late in the call. So I could be brief \u2013 we\u2019re curious to know the growth potential for the core business and taking apart, leaving aside fuel surcharge and coal, if you got the core normalization do you think we could see the core grow in double-digit and in 2015 are really corn services the biggest factors preventing that, is there any way to isolate either, is that the right way to sort of think about that?","Jim Squires","Well, if by core business, you mean our merchandise, our industrial product businesses. So we do see growth potential there in 2015 and beyond, definitely. Now there are always puts and takes. We have some challenges on our metals and construction franchise right now due to very low steel prices and reduced demand for pipe in particular. Wall Street Journal quoted $444 per ton as the going price for hot rolled coil this morning, that\u2019s down from $474 at the end of March. So steel prices are very depressed and the capacity utilization is tracking below 70%. So we have some challenges on that side of our MetCon franchise. ","On the other hand, our steel within MetCon, aggregates were up significantly. Construction car loadings were up, cement traffic was up, driven by housing and road construction. So there are definite bright spots. On the energy side of the core franchise as well we see continued opportunity. Over in chemicals we were able to grow NGLs, crude by rail, we\u2019ve already discussed. Our plastics businesses were up, those are all indications of a pretty healthy industrial economy and should be the drivers of significant growth in our industrial products franchise going forward. Our ag volumes were up in the first quarter as well and that we see continued promise there for the balance of the year as well. So overall we feel real good about our industrial products franchise albeit there are always a few soft spots. And the intermodal continues to grow and on top of the volume growth this year we expect to see significant price increases. I mentioned that our core prices were up in our intermodal business more than in any other business segment in the first quarter and that\u2019s very very encouraging. ","Unidentified Analyst","And just as a quick follow up, on the comp and employee issue, it looks like on a per average employee basis the year over year change is just under about 2% which, kind of thinking about that and going forward on a year over year basis, how to think about that line item? Are there offsets to the headwinds and what are some of the initiatives that you guys see on the table, maybe in terms of combating some of the headwinds you pointed out on slides?","Wick Moorman","Well, if you look at our comp right now, obviously and we discussed this before, we have the labor agreements which cover about 85% of our workforce. We had the effectively an early pay increase as a result of the last round of negotiations that kicked in, in January rather than July 1, as Marta has discussed. As we look at overall headcount clearly we\u2019re focused right now on getting the right number of people in our train and engine service workforce to handle the traffic without delay. I will say that as these numbers and Mark showed you the conductors and engineers we expect to bring on in the next couple of months most of them are included in the headcount today because they are trainees at the end of the first quarter. As they come on they come off training status in which they are effectively paid a salary ad start to be paid on the trip rate. So that that will then be proportional to our operations and then on the non-agreement side and in a particular G&A side as Marta mentioned we\u2019re always looking at ways to do everything we need to do with the lower headcount and the Roanoke closure will help precipitate some of that. We will continue to look at that and try and drive those costs down wherever we can.","Jim Squires","Let me just add a footnote to Roanoke office closure question, having spent a lot of time with our marketing team in the last couple of months I'm really really excited about having all of our sales and marketing team under one roof here and that is going to allow us to produce a much focus and consistent approach to growing our top line and will have an opportunity to move people around between jobs that might not have been able to move around between in the past and there will be similar surgeries from a workforce standpoint across all of the functions that are currently in Roanoke today or IT and accounting departments. ","Marta Stewart","On the operation side, what I would add is Wick is exactly right, the increases that Mark described we have \u2013 you see those reflected in the average headcount which was up sequentially from the fourth quarter by 500 and what we\u2019re projecting for the remainder of the year is another 500 increase, most of that will occur by the end of the third quarter and that is almost exclusively in the operating area. So by the end of the year we think we will be up 1000.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JP Morgan.","Brian Ossenbeck ","So just two quick ones. Jim, you mentioned a lot of the headwinds of the strong dollar and some of the disruptive imports that we\u2019re seeing in the steel. You also mentioned you expect ethanol and soybeans to be up. So maybe if you could just summarize why you think those are moving and overall do you think that a strong dollar has a positive factor or a negative excluding coal and for the rest of the business, is strong dollar a positive or negative?","Jim Squires","Well, most of our business is US domestic economy focused. So there are certainly pockets of resistance in the revenue based on the stronger dollar. We highlighted a few of the most prominent of which would export coal and pockets elsewhere as well. But I don't see an overall dampening effect on the total revenue necessarily outside export coal from the much stronger dollar. In certain pockets of our business it will be an additional challenge but we have enough drivers of revenue growth within the US domestic economy to push the top line higher based on our portfolio even with the strong dollar.","Brian Ossenbeck ","And just one follow up on export coal side. You mentioned you\u2019re pretty confident on the thermal side and how that looks for the rest of the year but I know the mix has kind of bounced around a little bit. Could you just give us a refresher on what mix was in the first quarter and perhaps what you expect for the rest of the year?","Jim Squires","In the first quarter of this year 64% of the export tons we handled was metallurgical and 36% was thermal and that compares to last year\u2019s 69% met, 31% thermal. So we had a relatively high proportion of thermal coal in the first quarter this year. We think that will revert in the balance of the year to more of the 75:25 type of split. Now going back we were almost all metallurgical coal, the last couple of years kind of 70%, 80% met and the rest thermal has been kind of the common split and we think we will get back to something like that split. I will say though that the demand is still firm around the thermal side of the franchise right now and north app producers were able to jump on some opportunities there in the first quarter and that\u2019s why we saw the thermal part spike somewhat relative to the metallurgical coal moving predominantly over Lambert\u2019s Point. And by the way as you probably know most of the metallurgical coal we handle moves over Lambert\u2019s Point and most of the thermal coal moves over Baltimore. ","If there is a potential downside in our assumptions roughly 4.5 billion to 5 million tons per quarter for export coal, it would be on the metallurgical coal which in our case is coming out of central app and because of all of the factors we mentioned, stronger dollar, the global over-supply of coal, Queensland and 109 and spike coals moving prices below that, because of very low bulk dry shipping rates, it\u2019s just an extremely difficult environment for central app producers in particular right now. ","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Justin Long with Stephens.","Justin Long ","I wanted to ask a question about PTC. As you\u2019ve continued to roll out this technology how much of a disruption is it causing to the network? Is this a contributor to congestion in the rail network today or would you say it's not a significant needle mover when you think about fluidity?","Wick Moorman","It\u2019s something we\u2019re paying a whole lot of attention to and it has everything to do with how well we plan it. Those PTC cutovers take place on a regular basis each month and the good thing is that our signaling communication group are doing a very good job of reducing the amount of disruption that takes place with each of the events and case in point when we started this out and we\u2019ve been doing it for a while now but when we started these out the outages were in the neighborhood of 12 hours and of course we do a lot of scheduling and planning around that to really minimize the disruptions but as we've gone along here outages have gone to eight hours and now in more cases down to six hours. We\u2019ve got some things going on where we think we can reduce them even below six, some of them to little as four hours. So a lot of planning and schedule workarounds so the disruption factor will be minimized going forward but still something we do a lot of planning around.","Jim Squires","No, I will add one thing to that which I think it's very good question which \u2013 and we have not talked about that in any detail nor of the other railroads but I will say that we got a lot of the really problematic areas on the railroad in terms of traffic disruption down last year. We still have some more to go and my analogy for it last year was we were almost \u2013 it was almost like we were constantly running a low-grade fever. We had a lot of work to do out there and a lot of significant disruption that as Mark said we planned around it, we did everything we could but nonetheless it was disruptive and it's something that as Mark has described we continue to work on and in fact it's a real point of focus for us right now as we look at restoring our network velocity.","Justin Long ","That\u2019s helpful color and I will just sneak one more in on intermodal. I was curious are you getting a lot of pushbacks from your customers and your IMCs on the Intermodal price increases you are going out with today? And also as of today how much of your book of business in Intermodal had been repriced at higher levels call it at mid-single-digit range over the past year?","Jim Squires","We are not getting a lot of pushback on price increases. We are aligned with our intermodal partners in view of the marketplace and in desire to take prices higher at this point. If you look at our equipment by line of business as an indicator of where we have the opportunity to lean into price most, E&P is about 70% of the total book by volume and that\u2019s where as the rail owned fleet, rail equipment fleet is that's where we have the most ability to take prices up on spot basis. So also on the triple crown side of things at 10% of our total book by volume we can lean into rate for us as well.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon Oglenski ","Jim, welcome to the hot seat. And as you guys know we have been supportive of the stock here, so I am going to be conservative with these questions. But I do think it\u2019s worth of your shoulders to ask some of the difficult questions here though too. And granted I have never on train, we just live in Axle model, so please tell us we are wrong. But this quarter volume was up 2%, 3% growth in merchandise and intermodal is up 5% and yet earnings are down 15% on what was a pretty easy comp from last year given all the weather disruptions. So I mean that\u2019s a lot of the frustration I think with your shareholders and if I listened to the strategy to drive improvement going forward it\u2019s getting price above inflation which we got this quarter, it\u2019s getting growth in those intermodal merchandise segments and it\u2019s stability in the coal book. But I guess my concern here is where is the profitability outside of coal? I think you've even said and Wick said it in the past no, coal is a very profitable segment for you but where are the margins and returns on intermodal merchandise and is that going to be enough to drive future earnings growth for this company or do we have all these continual cost pressures and fuel surcharge headwinds or are we just not going to be able to see a lot of earnings expansion even with those pretty robust growth rates outside of coal?","Jim Squires","But let me add we appreciate the candor and by all means essence of questions. And we demonstrated last year that we can drop the operating ratios significantly based on solid general merchandise volume growth and intermodal volume growth even with coal headwinds. Now when you are talking about coal volumes down 7% overall in the quarter that's a pretty strong headwind and that is more difficult and we lost ground this quarter, no doubt about it. But that will stabilize. We will see a bottom on coal volumes and as we discussed on this call we think we may be there already. And then we have the opportunity to see continued growth in many areas of our merchandise franchise and in our intermodal franchise. Put on top of that significant price increases and you do have a recipe for growing earnings. It's essential that we get the network back up to speed, we have a plan to do that, we have the resources coming online. There will be some cost headwinds as we get from here to there in the short-term but once the network is back up to 2012, 2013 service levels we will see significant cost drop out as well. So it\u2019s the combination of that basic efficiency and the cost reductions, it comes from running a faster network, bottoming out of coal volumes and combination of volume growth and price in our general merchandise and intermodal businesses. ","Brandon Oglenski ","I mean you are not doing a railroad to see some pretty challenging coal numbers and I do agree with Wick\u2019s assessment that there is differences between the East and Western Canada but there are some similarities between Western Canada at least in terms of achieving a mid to low 60s OR for a lot of these carriers with public targets to get there, and if I am hearing you correctly, Jim, it sounds like we need to have stability in coal before we can get any real traction on the operating ratio. But I think there will be a lot of skeptics on the buy-side at least or your investor base where if we look at natural gas being up 5$ in the future, there is still some incremental gas capacity in the east and on top of it the export market doesn\u2019t look all that solid as you\u2019ve confirmed on this call. So can Norfolk get traction on margins even if coal continues to be maybe a modest headwind heading forward?","Jim Squires","I really do. This is going to be a tough year. We will start to see the top line grow again in the fourth quarter we think based on our current forecast. Until we get the top line moving it will be difficult for us to make a lot of improvement. That\u2019s coming. These mix effects that you saw in the first quarter are somewhat transitory. Over lings will bottom out, now we cannot say with total assurance that we have hit bottom in terms of coal volume today but we started our utility franchise pretty carefully and gas substitution becomes more difficult at this point with gas plants running full out. Now the export side of things there are headwinds there but there are opportunities as well particularly on the thermal side of that franchise. So we think we can do it, we\u2019ve got a couple of tough quarters ahead of us with the fuel surcharge headwind with some additional costs out there to get service back up. But once we are there on the service, once we see coal volume stabilized and we get past this fuel surcharge headwind we are in great shape to continue with the performance.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.","Ken Hoexter ","I am going to take a little bit of a different take on some of the same questions there but it looks like service starting to show some improvement still at the mid-70s operating ratio for the quarter. Why such a contrast? Maybe I could address this to Mark between your need to add the 650 employees between the conductors and engineers, the 200 some on locomotives and when you look at Canadian Pacific's plan to cut resources which creates a lot of capacity. Maybe Mark, can you just describe maybe a little bit of the differences in the operations or how you\u2019re running it so we can understand why we can see such a great contrast between one creating capacity and the ability to move more versus what \u2013 how you\u2019re structuring the operations?","Mark Manion","Well as far as the resources we\u2019re adding we know that when we\u2019re in the process of ramping up it's almost like you can\u2019t have enough locomotive, you need a certain number of locomotives just to spin yourself up, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re in the process of doing and in fact, I've got my sights set on restoring locomotives before long, in fact, we will probably get into that by May and give ourselves a surge fleet, we will see how far we go one to 200 locomotives. And same thing on the people side, I mean you need a certain number of people that man your trains and it is activity based, we pay them when they work. So we need to take on more people, we will stabilize on the people side by the end of the second quarter and from there on we essentially outside of business growth opportunities as we get into the second half, we\u2019re going to be levelled off on people and we will be hiring for attrition. So we don't see ourselves doing anything particularly differently than with the other railroads do as far as that goes.","Ken Hoexter ","So I guess maybe just to key taking into there \u2013 to take a step further, is it the network resets you\u2019ve done a few times over the long weekends or is it changing the operating plan which creates that extra capacity?","Mark Manion","No, we said last year that depending on the severity of the winter that we would do as we typically do as we come out of these winter events. These are big network systems and they ramp up on a gradual basis, that is what has been happening ever since March. And so we\u2019re seeing some nice nice ramp-up now and I'm sure you look at our numbers as well you see our cars online going down, you see our bad order ratio going down, our train performance is improving, our connection performance improves, the number of locomotives available improves, all that drives overall network velocity but it happens in a gradual way. And we will see that, we will continue day in and day out see that gradual improvement take place through May, through June and I think by the end of June we will see some pretty darn good numbers.","Wick Moorman","Just in overall theme let me say one more thing about that. And it goes back to this idea every franchise is different, every railroad is different and the Eastern carriers obviously are as all of you know shorter haul complex networks and that\u2019s fine. For one thing we live where all the people are and we think that has a lot of positives in terms of growing. But the overall belief that I think everyone in the railroad industry shares is that velocity creates capacity and that's where we are going. The first thing you do is get your velocity where you want it to be, where we\u2019ve had ours in the past. As you see velocity go up, as Mark mentioned, cars online goes down, our terminals get more and more fluid and that\u2019s what then drives further operating and cost improvement and that's the path we\u2019re on. And if you look at some of the things we've done in the past here we've done a lot of work on our terminals in terms of we closed two significant yards. We've expanded one to make up for that and to make up for changes in our traffic base. So the patterns may look somewhat different based on the franchise but the theme is always the same in terms of constantly improving the velocity of your railroad no matter whose railroaded it is in order to create cost efficiencies and create further capacity.","Ken Hoexter ","And if I could get to follow-up, I guess Jim as you prepare to take over in two months or so what are your thoughts on M&A? Obviously we\u2019ve heard Wick\u2019s kind of thesis in the past. I am just wondering how you view the world and obviously given the discussions that we've heard from some of the Canadians and maybe your peer on the east in the past, just want to get your insight and whether you think it's possible -- if not, why not and then if not now, does that mean something could happen in the future, maybe just some thoughts on that?","Jim Squires","Sure. Well I will share a few thoughts and then I will invite Wick to chime in as well. First of all, let me start by saying that we are a public company, we\u2019re obviously here for our shareholders. So there are no categorical answers in that regard. On the other hand we do see significant challenges associated with further consolidation. The regulatory review process for consolidations in this industry is very very time-consuming, onerous and risky and I say that as one who practically lives at the surface transportation board for year and a half or so as we were going through Conrail. It's a very unpredictable process, and it is a very costly and risky process as well. And there are relatively few synergies to be achieved in exchange for those risks as well, the remaining combinations in this industry are end to end and by definition fewer synergies available. So we don't it's a good idea and we think we have a freight business plan around this company on a standalone basis, that what we can do with this company is better than anything that could be achieved. ","Wick Moorman","Jim and I agree completely about this but I think Jim's first caveat obviously is important here. We are a publicly traded company. We are interested in long-term welfare and benefits to our shareholders. That is our job and we understand it very clearly. But I think that what is sometimes really underestimated by those who don\u2019t live or immersed themselves in the regulatory environment in the way that we do is just how hard it would be a) to have any kind of transaction approved particularly under the new merger rules where a) by definition it has to be pro- competitive whatever that -- and no one has defined that. ","And second, the enormous risks that the conditions imposed if you were even able to get a merger approved by the STB would negate any and all benefits and beyond of the transaction itself. And there would be an enormous amount of resistance on the certain parts of our customer base and we just think that you never say never and the time may well come, but right now it\u2019s not a time where trying to do a transaction of any size makes any sense.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research.","Jeff Kauffman ","I want to ask a question on a different aspect of the coal franchise. Given that most US based coals are well out of the money globally and given that the utility inventories remain quite high, I think up till now everybody is focused mainly on the volume aspect of the coal franchise. But I guess the question becomes at what point do either the coal producers or utility customers say if we want to keep the coal moving we need a pound of flesh and let\u2019s revisit the pricing so that we can keep coal competitive and keep coal moving? When we look at your contracts both for export and domestic, can you give us an idea of when they get repriced, come up for renewal and how much confidence do you have in this kind of environment that we won't have this new leg down this fall when these contracts or next year we go to reprice?","Jim Squires","We believe we continue to have a compelling value proposition and our ability to deliver coal from various basins and various ways to our utility and export customers and we\u2019re going to reprice that on a value basis. So on the export side there just isn't that much we could do unfortunately. Our major customers are finding it very difficult to place coals into the global market particularly on the metallurgical side. So our goal as is the case across our franchise is to obtain the maximum value for the dollar for the value that we provide our customers and we will continue to do that in the coal business sense as I flip throughout our financials.","Jeff Kauffman ","And domestic?","Jim Squires","Same story. A I said we think natural gas substitution which has been the driving factor in the decline in utility volumes, has largely run its course and we are in position to continue holds to our utility customers. A normal summer weather is critical to our assumptions in that regard though. Another very cool summer and we could see further declines but provided we have a normal summer we think we are in good shape to manage a pretty consistent run rate on the utility coal this year.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen and Company.","Jason Seidl ","Two quick ones. One, can you talk a little bit about your ability to price as your service levels start coming up, because clearly you are getting price now and services as well, let\u2019s call it less than optimal. Is there any relation between rail service and pricing or should we not look at that way?","Jim Squires","Clearly there is and our pricing potential will only improve with better service levels in the long run. You have to give the customer something more in order to obtain price increases and that\u2019s one of the big reasons we're spending now to get service back up so that we will be able to grow volumes but also so that in the long run we will be able to take prices up for a better and better product delivered to the customer.","Jason Seidl ","And I guess my follow up but I apologize if you guys already covered this because there were some overlapping calls this morning. We haven't seen any announcements out there in terms of getting Don's positions, so I was wondering where you guys are out there and are you reviewing outside candidates?","Jim Squires","We are reviewing both internal and outside candidates. We have been running a process, we expect to complete that process and make an announcement within a matter of a few weeks. ","Operator","The next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. ","David Vernon ","Hey Marta, first question for you, how much additional borrowing capacity do you have and have you gotten more comfortable raising the overall borrowing and leverage profile of the business going forward?","Marta Stewart","Yes, we have quite a bit of additional borrowing capacity as I mentioned earlier and as I am sure you know, we didn\u2019t issue any debt last year. So we are planning to issue debt this year and we're comfortable bringing up our leverage levels but staying within our current credit ratings BBB plus, Baa1. ","David Vernon ","Is there like a target level of coverage that you are shooting for?","Marta Stewart","Well the target is stay within the credit ratings band, because last year we did issue we floated down a little bit within the band. We are still within the band of floated down a bit. So we're comfortable ramping up towards the upper end of that band but staying within it.","David Vernon ","And then maybe just as a quick follow up, Jim or Mark, I guess have you guys given any thought into how much of the service related costs you guys are pouring into the network right now actually do come down and I mean I get the velocity driven improvement, you pulled some costs down but I would also think that the change in the freight flows across your network are requiring a different level of resources than you had in the past, and changing like haul, the longer haul intermodal, less short haul coal, that kind of stuff? I mean how much of the extra investments you are putting in, should we expect to actually come out?","Marta Stewart","We are expecting the 42 million that we highlighted in the first quarter. We think it\u2019s going to moderate to 25 million and roughly the same categories that I outlined, a little bit less percentage wise and compensation because the compensation part in the first quarter had a transportation part and maintenance of way part related to the weather. So percentage wise the comp part will come down a little bit and the total will be 25 million and then we believe if we get up to the train speed levels that Mark described in the second half we think we will not have services, so that 25 million in other words would go away in the third and fourth quarters.","David Vernon ","But do you get like the 42 million or the 25 million back next year or do you think there\u2019s going to be some of that costs, it\u2019s just going to be in the network?","Mark Manion","No, I think those costs are the costs that we view as purely transitory in nature and the answer to your other question is that yes, as we see business mix change we can see some shifting in resource requirements particularly in terms of maybe where we need train crews but net, net I don't think that those changes are material in terms of overall crew requirements or train operating costs. ","David Vernon ","Even that, with the difference in length of haul and coal, do you think that would just take more labor hour but \u2013","Wick Moorman","Well you are looking at length of haul on coal changing as basins change, the Illinois basin coal comes on, we hold the coal longer farther as the mix changes within coal. In intermodal we\u2019ve done a pretty good job and expect to continue to of really not necessarily running a lot more trains but just getting more and more containers on each one of the trains through stacking and additional train length. As I say, Mark, I don't think net net that amounts to a whole lot. ","Operator","The next question is from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie.","Cleo Zagrean ","My first question relates to coal, so I appreciate that we may be looking at a stabilization in quarterly run rate on the domestic and maybe I guess export front to grow but still this year we are looking to \u2013 it sounds like 10% decline in the domestic volume and maybe mid-teens in exports. So let this [ph] coal alone do to your operating margin or to the operating ratio this year in terms of the headwind?","Jim Squires","It unquestionably is a headwind, when we see the kind of year over year declines that we experienced in the first quarter of 2015 and projecting for the balance of the year. So yes, we think it\u2019s steadier run rate both utility and export coal tonnage but the comparisons are difficult. Second-quarter of 2014 was our peak quarter for utility coal volume and so we are comping that very difficult comparison and similarly in the third quarter as utilities rebuild stockpiles into the third quarter, we are facing some difficult comps now. By the time we get to the fourth quarter it gets a little bit easier and we would expect to see lesser year over year volume declines.","On the export side of the franchises as we discussed the comparisons really get easier in the second half, beginning in the second half and again particularly the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter of 2014 export \u2013 total export tonnage was 4.8 million, dropped below 5 million by the fourth quarter of last year. So tough middle part of the year, tough couple of quarters coming, by the fourth quarter we start to see growth.","Cleo Zagrean ","Can you say maybe if you face specific challenges in your franchise compared to your peers and how we can think about the operating ratio impact?","Jim Squires","No, we don\u2019t we face peculiar, particular challenges relative to our competitors in this regard.","Cleo Zagrean ","Also on your operating ratio, if you would like to quantify or maybe just say that you are prepared for this to maybe assess the impact of coal, that\u2019s fine but on the ex-coal, ex the fuel surcharge hit this year, would you comment as to whether you see mix just below the top line being the tailwind or headwind on the operating income level? I mean we are focusing too much on the top line but surely there must be benefit in growing intermodal and merchandise right, if you can help seeing that for us, that would be very helpful.","Jim Squires","Absolutely and we said in the past and it\u2019s still true today that our general merchandise business is particularly volume moving in our scheduled network, or our highest incremental margin businesses. You layer it on top of the natural spontaneous favorable economics of volume growth in this business significant core price increases and that\u2019s really a key driver of improvement for now. Now much of this unfortunately will be masked in the middle part of the year by the fuel surcharge headwinds which will be significant and with the kinds of deltas to last year we are talking about in the top line from fuel surcharge alone, we will probably see margin pressure in the second and third quarter unlike in the first quarter where the decline in fuel expense actually exceeded the fuel surcharge reduction. That will slip most likely given the magnitude of the fuel surcharge revenue headwind in the second and third quarters.","End of Q&A","Operator","At this time I will turn the floor back to Wick Moorman for closing comments.","Wick Moorman","Well thanks everyone for bearing with us on what has been a somewhat long call but hopefully we have given you a lot of data and a lot of color on what we are doing. We appreciate your time and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Pete Sharbel, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Sharbel, you may begin.","Pete Sharbel","Thank you, Melissa, and good morning. Before we begin, please note that during today's call, we may make certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. The slides of the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors section, along with our non-GAAP reconciliation. Additionally, a transcript and downloads will be posted after the call.","Now, it's my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires.","Jim Squires","Good morning everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer; Mike Wheeler, Chief Operating Officer; and Cindy Earhart, Chief Financial Officer.","Turning to our financial results for the third quarter. Income from operations was approximately $1 billion , net income was $657 million, EPS was 249 and the operating ratio improved to 64.9%. These results include the unfavorable impact of a $32 million write-off of a receivable resulting from a legal dispute, which affected the OR by 110 basis points and EPS for $0.09.","As highlighted on Slide 4, these were record results including a record third quarter and year-to-date OR. Earlier this year, we outlined a dynamic flexible new operating plan, TOP21, capable of creating value in all market conditions. In the months since, particularly in the second half of this year, volumes across the transportation sector, including our volumes, turned sharply lower.","In response, leveraging TOP21, our team doubled down on productivity and achieved major resource reductions. For example, in the third quarter, we reduced crew starts and increased by 11% year-over-year. That was nearly double the rate of the volume decline, driving a 9% decrease in employment levels.","Following the first phase of TOP21, we swiftly moved to Phase II, which includes refinement of our guarding local trains, deployment of additional distributed power on long trains and blending of intermodal and unit trains into existing trains wherever feasible.","These efforts are producing further reductions in crew starts, circuity and road train miles. And we've begun Clean Sheeting our intermodal terminals and preparing for the third phase of TOP21 using the formula we used to successfully overhaul the carload network while sustaining a high level of network performance and service.","Earlier in the year, I spoke about the momentum building across our organization and our commitment to enhancing operational and financial outcomes. This commitment is evidenced by significant expense reduction so far this year, which Cindy will describe in more detail later in the call.","With revenue trending below our expectations in the second half and some unusual costs expected in the fourth quarter, we continue to expect operating ratio improvement for the full year, but that improvement now seems likely to be less than our earlier forecast of at least 100 basis points.","Nevertheless, we remain confident we can achieve our goal of a 60% OR by 2021 through additional cost structural changes and future revenue growth. For example, we are pursuing savings opportunities in fuel, mechanical and other aspects of operations about which Mike will speak shortly.","And we continue to drive bottom line improvement with pricing increases, commensurate with the value of our service with the results evident in the third quarter and year-to-date in revenue-per-unit and revenue-per-revenue ton-mile trends. Alan will speak further about those trends in a minute.","All of us at Norfolk Southern are committed to transforming our Company to drive shareholder value creation. As I've said before, we are embracing new ideas and positioning leaders throughout the organization who are Champions for Change.","We are all working hard to operate as safely and efficiently as possible and deliver what we promised to our customers and shareholders. The results so far this year. Improved service levels for our customers, a lower operating ratio and bottom line growth, and the return of nearly $2.3 billion to shareholders.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Alan.","Alan Shaw","Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone.","In the third quarter, we continued our focus on pricing to the value of our service product and delivering productivity gains, generating a record third quarter operating ratio despite difficult economic conditions. Trade uncertainly continue to influence the economic environment, which coupled with lower spot truck and commodity pricing negatively impacted volume during the quarter.","As we cycle through the headwinds associated with the market, we have and will maintain our focus on margin improvement driven by price, service and productivity, while collaborating with our customers to provide a platform for growth.","As shown on Slide 6, a 6% decline in volume led to a 4% revenue decline in the quarter. Increased revenue per unit, which has improved year-over-year for 11 consecutive quarters, partially offset the volume decrease. A consistent delivery of RPU growth highlights the effectiveness of our pricing strategy.","Third quarter revenue in our merchandise segment was flat year-over-year, as continued strength in pricing offset volume declines. Volume declined 4% resulting from reduced steel and natural gas shipments, while favorable fuel price differentials drove gains in crude oil, the East Coast refineries.","During the quarter, we experienced growth in automotive and aggregates as a result of increased production at [indiscernible] auto plants and improved service respectively. Intermodal revenue declined 5% due to reduced volume in our domestic franchise. Strong relationships with steamship lines and share shifts at the East Coast ports produced international volume growth year-over-year.","Domestic intermodal declined due to lower spot truck pricing and a weakened manufacturing environment. Intermodal arc of yield was flat in the quarter as pricing increases were offset by the negative mix impact of increased international volume and lower fuel surcharge revenue.","Turning to coal, revenue was down 13% in the third quarter. Our utility portfolio was impacted by additional natural gas capacity and prices that suppressed coal burn. Export thermal and metallurgical prices remain at low levels, making it difficult for U.S. coals to compete globally. Improved pricing drove our revenue-per-unit increase of 2%.","Moving to Slide 7. We expect the same factors affecting third quarter volumes to persist in the fourth quarter. Macroeconomic conditions, tariff uncertainty and global weakness continue to negatively influence business investment, manufacturing and exports. Lower commodity pricing will impact many of our markets, including coal and steel. Truck loadings are expected to be flat for the rest of 2019 with excess capacity keeping spot truck rates low.","While we expect a challenging economic environment for the remainder of the year, we remain focused on our strategic plan to drive margin improvement. We are collaborating with our customers daily to fine-tune our service product and identify long-term growth opportunities.","Our strategic plan is producing pricing and efficiency gains, and we are fully committed to the execution of the plan while meeting our customers' expectations and establishing a platform for future profitable growth.","I will now turn it over to Mike for an update on operations.","Mike Wheeler","Thank you, Alan.","Today, I will update you on the state of our operations and the efficiencies we are creating with our TOP21 plan. In the third quarter, we delivered strong service for our customers, made further progress on the next iteration of TOP21, and began implementing initiatives in TOP21 Phase II on a rolling basis.","Our operational momentum is driving significant cost savings and we are flexing our dynamic plan in accordance with market conditions. We continue realizing efficiencies while providing a superior service product to our customers.","Moving to Slide 9. We have continued our laser focus on the execution of our plan and principles of precision scheduled railroading. We substantially improved train speed and terminal dwell compared to last year and delivered record quarterly performance. These achievements support our strategy to meet our customers' expectations while eliminating costs and prudently managing our assets.","The operation continues to be resilient as evidenced by our ability to work through two recent major incidents in the fourth quarter, a bridge outage and a large derailment, with minimal disruption to our customer supply chains. This shows the strong resiliency of our operating model.","These overall results are due to relentless execution by our operations team and other employees supporting them. We want to thank our field employees for their unwavering focus on safety, service and efficiency.","Turning to our service and productivity metrics on Slide 10. These metrics align with our strategic plan as they measure key productivity and customer service levels. We have been aggressively reducing our resources to meet our productivity goals, account GTMs dropping by 9% in the quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the blue bars represent our goals for 2019.","Starting with the Service Delivery Index, which is the on-time delivery performance of our scheduled shipments indexed to 2018. This is a customer-facing metric that combines intermodal availability and shipment consistency, which measures trip plan adherence for general merchandise as well as automotive traffic. Strong service performance continued in the third quarter and we expect to drive further improvement.","We are trending ahead of where we thought we would be with our T&E productivity goal for 2019. And we anticipate this trend will continue for the remainder of the year. We are at our lowest T&E headcount on record, having reduced by 14% versus third quarter 2018, while still providing exceptional service.","We are already realizing the benefits of our TOP21 plan. The results are driving the comp and benefit improvements, to which Cindy will speak.","As mentioned during the last call, we are continuing to work on improving our train weight. The majority of our goal was back-end loaded, as the first phase of the TOP21 operating plan was successfully implemented on July 1st.","We are seeing improvements in our general merchandise train weights, which were offset by headwinds associated with intermodal and coal volumes. Locomotive productivity continues to be an important metric for NS. We are tracking to meet our goal for this year. We have been rationalizing our locomotive fleet, which is 22% lower than the same period last year.","We also have an aggressive initiative to rationalize resources associated with the maintenance of these wealth of others, including a reduction of 525 positions already this year. We will continue to focus on the remaining resources required to maintain this lower fleet size.","And the Cars-On-Line, which is down 20% versus our 2018 baseline, continues to trend very positively. Thanks to our fast and consistent service product. This includes cars in storage, which can be deployed as market conditions warrant.","Turning to our progress on our TOP21 operating plan on Slide 11. As you may recall, our operating plan has four major objectives; operate as one network, execute a balanced train plan between terminals, serve our customers frequently, and reduce dependence on major terminals.","The first phase of TOP21 primarily focused on our general merchandise bulk and automotive business and was successfully implemented on July 1st. We have been aggressively implementing the next phase, which has an added emphasis on distributed power to drive further train consolidations. We have increased the number of DP trains per day by more than two-and-a-half times with the expansion of this initiative since our TOP21 rollout.","We will continue to add DP trains across the network, which will have the benefit of improving train length and fuel efficiency. Regarding fuel efficiency, we have several other initiatives for improvement. Specifically, one, ensuring a healthy energy management lead locomotive; two, compliance with horsepower-per-ton procedures; and three, compliance with usage of energy management technology.","We are also syncing up our local schedule and the new train plan. We are implementing these changes on a rolling basis and driving significant structural improvements. Specifically, total circuity for general merchandise and auto traffic is down 27% versus pre-TOP21 and road train miles are down 13%.","Additionally, we have been working to calibrate our local plan to maximize efficiency while continuing to provide good service to our customers. Together, these changes have helped to continue drive down crew starts while keeping velocity and customer service high.","We have also begun the process of Clean Sheeting our intermodal terminals and preparing for the third phase of TOP21, which remodels all traffic for additional opportunities. This will drive further cost and resource reductions and improve our fuel efficiency.","I will now turn it over to Cindy, who will cover our financials.","Cindy Earhart","Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone.","I'll begin with our operating results from Slide 13. The continued execution of our strategic plan is delivering tangible results that are flowing through to the bottom line. The structural changes we are making, including the implementation of our PSR-based operating plan, generated expense savings in compensation and benefits and equipment rents. These savings as well as lower fuel prices more than offset the decline in revenues.","However, in the third quarter, we wrote off a $32 million receivable as a result of a legal dispute, which added 110 basis points to the operating ratio and lowered earnings per share by $0.09. Income from railway operations for the quarter was nearly $1 billion and we reduced our third quarter operating ratio by 50 basis points, achieving a third quarter record of 64.9%.","Moving to Slide 14. We are delivering cost savings as evident in the $82 million decline in operating expenses. Our new operating plans have resulted in fewer trains on the network and reduced crew starts. Compensation and benefits expense declined as a result of a $47 million in savings due to lower employee levels and reduced overtime and recruit.","We drove average headcount down by approximately 1,000 employees from last quarter and have reduced headcount by 2400 compared to last year. We also remain intensely focused on improving asset utilization. By increasing the velocity of our network and improving fluidity, we have significantly reduced the need for locomotives and freight cars, resulting in equipment rental savings of $35 million.","We also achieved savings of $10 million in material expense due to fewer locomotives and service and freight cars online. Partially offsetting the efficiency gains that we delivered in the quarter was the $32 million write-off that I previously mentioned.","We also experienced $17 million of additional expense due to increased pay rates. Finally, lower fuel price and a decrease in consumption drove the $48 million decline in fuel expense. Fuel efficiency continues to be an area of focus, and we know there are opportunities to generate savings through improved efficiency.","Slide 15 summarizes our third quarter results. Income from railway operations was slightly under last year's record, and non-operating items added an additional $16 million of expense. Third quarter net income was $657 million and diluted earnings per share was $2.49.","Recapping our year-to-date cash flows on Slide 16. Cash from operating activities was $3 billion, and free cash flow for the first nine months was $1.5 billion.","We continue to return capital to shareholders, as evidenced by the 9% increase in the quarterly dividend we announced in July. Dividends and share repurchases totaled almost $2.3 billion for the first nine months. As we head towards the conclusion of the year, I want to highlight a few specific items that will impact the fourth quarter.","First, starting with headcount, we expect a continuation of position reductions in the fourth quarter. By year-end, we expect headcount to approximate 23,300, which is a reduction of over 3200 positions compared to the same time last year.","Also, we expect incentive compensation to be favorable over prior year, but the magnitude will depend upon our full-year results. However, as Mike mentioned earlier, there have been some specific incidents in the fourth quarter that will result in incremental expenses.","We expect additional costs associated with future in trains due to a bridge outage and lighting damage resulting from a large derailment will approximate $25 million in additional expenses. Additionally, we expect that gains associated with the sales of operating property will be lower than last year.","You recall, the fourth quarter of 2018 included $145 million in gains on the sale of operating properties whereas, we expect the current quarter to be about one-third of that. The execution of our strategic plan is delivering results and even in the face of obstacles unforeseen at the outset of this year, we are confident we will improve our full-year operating ratio in 2019 and achieve our goal of 60% by 2021.","We are seeing the benefits associated with our new operating plan. We are actively identifying and implementing further measures that will produce improved financial results and drive shareholder value.","Thank you for your attention. And I'll turn the call back over to Jim.","Jim Squires","Thank you, Cindy.","As we've outlined, and as our third quarter results demonstrate, we continue to build momentum by executing planned initiatives and pushing well beyond many of the goals we set out earlier this year. We are hard at work preparing for the third phase of TOP21, rightsizing our local and yard operations, further consolidating road trains, and going after cost savings in fuel and mechanical operations.","While pursuing all of these efforts, the Norfolk Southern team continues to provide superior service to our customers, enabling us to price to our value in the marketplace while ensuring that we are positioned at the leading edge of growth when it returns.","These actions give us confidence, we will reach a 60% operating ratio by 2021. Before we open the call for Q&A, I do want to recognize Cindy for her 34 years of service to Norfolk Southern and her support to her final date here at the Company on November 1st. I highly value the role she has played in pioneering new technologies at our Company, developing our strategic plans, and delivering shareholder returns. On behalf of the entire Board and Management team, I thank Cindy for her many contributions and wish her well in retirement.","We'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Long","Thanks, good morning and congrats, Cindy, on the retirement. Maybe to start with the OR guidance for 2019, I just wanted to clarify something. Are you excluding the impact of the $32 million write-off in 3Q in that guidance? And then Cindy, you mentioned the $25 million of unusual cost in the fourth quarter. So I'm just curious that if you exclude that $32 million write-off and the $25 million of unusual items in the fourth quarter, if that OR guidance of at least 100 basis points that you previously put out there would have been achievable.","Jim Squires","Justin, it's Jim. Let me see if I can clarify for you what we have said this morning. Our guidance is that we expect to achieve a full-year operating ratio improvement year-over-year, even with the additional expenses and the trend in revenue and even with the receivables write-off that we discussed earlier. But, also including those things, we do not expect to be able to hit our goal of at least 100 basis points improvement in the operating ratio.","Now with that said, that does not diminish our confidence in any way that we can get to a 60% operating ratio by 2021. And to back that up, I just want to take a minute to recap what we have achieved to date. Because those achievements are the foundation of further improvements that we will make to get to the 60% operating ratio.","And I'll just touch it again, on our operating plan. Because that, in many ways, is the bedrock of the improvements we have made and will continue to make. All right, Phase I. As of July 1, we cut over it seamless. We see an immediate reduction in train starts and active trains on the network as we have shown you previously. We see a sharp decline in crew starts as we showed you today. There is no disruption to service as a result of it, however.","In Phase II, we pursue additional train consolidations. We blend more intermodal bulk and carload traffic. We accelerate distributed power. By now, we have more than doubled the number of DP trains per day operating on the network. We pursue further rationalization of equipment. We work to sync up the local operating plan, would give you network plan and that results in additional crew start reductions.","As you can see on Slide 11, crew start reductions actually accelerate coming out of the initial cut-over as we move through Phase II. And then, if we pursue intermodal Clean Sheeting, the analog, if you will, to the Clean Sheeting we did in the merchandise network and we are hard at work on fuel efficiency initiatives, where we know we have some grounds to make up.","So, these are the things we are operative today. In Phase III of TOP21, we will remodel all traffic to unlock additional efficiencies. Now, what has been the results in terms of resources of these various phases of TOP21. So, let's start with T&E productivity. As Mike mentioned, T&E down 13% versus third quarter of 2018, giving us the lowest T&E headcount on record for our company.","In terms of locomotive productivity, we have reduced the number of locomotives out there by 22% versus last year. And that reduction in locomotives operating on the network, along with the reduction in Cars-On-Line, yielded an additional reduction of 525 mechanical positions already in this year, which together with the G&A reductions, which together with other employment reductions we have made, gave us 9% lower overall again in the third quarter with more decline in the fourth quarter. Cars-On-Line down 20% versus the 2018 benchmark, yielding significant equipment rent savings along with the locomotive reductions.","Cindy went through the different expense categories; the compensation and benefit savings, the material savings, the equipment rent savings that were the result of these resource reductions. In TOP21 Phase III, there will be more of the same.","We will see through additional train consolidations additional reductions in crew starts and we would expect to see T&E reductions follow. With continued rationalization of locomotive fleet, we will see lower maintenance spending and so on and so forth.","And lastly, we will stay very focused on our pricing plan, our yield-up strategy which showed excellent results in the third quarter and for the full year-to-date. We are determined to price to the value of our service in the marketplace.","Justin Long","That's great and comprehensive answer. I think, secondly, I just wanted to ask a bigger picture question. Obviously, we're dealing with a more challenging demand backdrop right now. As we think about that guidance to get to a 60% OR in 2021, do you think that's still achievable if the demand environment stays around current levels and the coal environment stays around current levels, or do we need to see a positive inflection and demand in order to hit that 60% OR?","Jim Squires","We are determined to achieve the 60% OR goal by 2021 in any foreseeable revenue environment, including the one that we are in now. But yeah, ours is a balanced plan and we've said that all along; we are pursuing growth, we believe we will see the fruits of our efforts in the form of a resumption of growth during the remaining years of our current strategic plan. But if we don't, we will push even harder on efficiency measures, on productivity measures, to get to the 60% OR.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Allison Landry","So now that you're in Phase II of TOP21, and as you move into Phase III, should we start to expect at a meaningful acceleration in the year-over-year OR improvement. I guess, just as you're talking about all the trains you're eliminating and increasing train weights and adding the DPU, why wouldn't you be able to move below a 60% OR more quickly, as we've seen with many of your peers.","Jim Squires","If we can get to 60% OR sooner, Allison, we will continue to push. We are determined to do all we can to generate shareholder value through growth and through a lower operating ratio. And 60% is our goal by 2021, if we can do better than that, we certainly will.","Allison Landry","And then I was hoping maybe you could offer some thoughts on the recent addition to the Board by Claude Mongeau. What role would you expect him to play, and how is that materializing so far? Thank you.","Jim Squires","Claude, as you know, brings a great deal of experience in our industry, having served as CEO of Canadian Natural. He brings in-depth knowledge of operations of railway finances. He served as CN CFO for a number of years and so, he is a most-welcome addition to our Board. We are looking forward to having him advice and counsel us as we pursue all of the initiatives that we intend to pursue for the next few years and beyond.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Ossenbeck","Appreciate taking the question. So, Alan, maybe one for you on coal, I was little surprised to see that RPU was up sequentially ex-fuel, so maybe if you can give some color behind that and where do you think this goes in 4Q, '19 and 2020. And obviously the export markets are telling us, things are going to get worse before they get better again. So I just wanted to see if there's any other offsets that you might have from a pricing or yield perspective, considering it was a bit stronger this quarter than we expected.","Alan Shaw","Yes, absolutely, Brian. As I've noted in my prepared remarks, we continue to deliver strong pricing across all of our business units. Coal is no exception. Coal will be pressured in the fourth quarter with the reduction and the seaborne coking coal price.","So, you should see a sequential decline in export coal pricing as we move into the fourth quarter and that's going to be running up against some difficult comps, because at the same this time last year we were seeing a sequential improvement in export coal pricing.","So that will be a headwind for us. Throughout all of this, we are continuing to focus on pricing to the value of our product and we are delivering a very good product to our customers.","Brian Ossenbeck","And then one on fuel and train weights for you, Mike. We've seen some pretty good progress on fuel in particular from the rest of the class ones we're looking at Norfolk. It looks like fuel efficiency, gallons-per-thousand GTMs are actually getting a bit worse sequentially and year-over-year. So, clearly we're seeing train weighs aren't moving up as fast as you think throughout the course of the plan, but what can you offer on, I know you\u2019ve got some initiatives there, but it seems to be a pretty big factor for efficiency gains that others have realized, but you haven't been able to take that sort of stride.","Mike Wheeler","Yes, so on the fuel efficiency side, we are seeing an increase in general merchandise train weights. So that was part of the TOP21 plan. We're getting those benefits, but they are offset by the headwinds of the lower train weights on the intermodal and bulk trains and we're making - we're taking actions to address that. You'll see more of that in Phase II as we go forward and then some of that in Phase III as well. But we also have a very aggressive initiative on utilizing the energy management technology that we've been rolling out.","And so, this is an all-hands-on-deck thing and we've got folks down in our new consolidated network operation center really staying on top of this, making sure we got the right locomotive on the head-end that's got working energy management and then making sure that we're using the right horsepower-per-tonnage for our trains, being very aggressive with that, and then making sure that, that we're compliant with the energy management technology. So, big initiative and we expect that to be paying off as we go forward.","Jim Squires","Brian, I'd like to weigh in on this as well. We benchmark our peers' performance all the time and do so extensively, and we are aware of the ground that we have to make up in fuel efficiency. We have - because we have not made progress despite our best efforts in the last couple of quarters [indiscernible]. That's going to change. We are focused on all the things that Mike has outlined. Running longer, heavier trains is certainly a part of it. On-board energy management, real-time fuel monitoring, horsepower-per-trailing-ton compliance and so forth. A host of initiatives in place, which we believe will bear fruit as I am holding our operations team shortly accountable to that goal.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Group","So I want to go back to Justin's first question because I'm not sure if I understood the answer. So, you guys said there's $32 million of legal costs in the third and you talked about $25 million of bridge costs in the fourth. So, that's 50 basis points to OR. If we were to exclude those, would you have been hitting the OR targets or not? I guess we're all trying to understand, is this a small margin missed that's arguably understandable or is this a bigger margin miss?","Jim Squires","Cindy, why don't you give that.","Cindy Earhart","So, Scott. As Jim said previously, the $32 million and the additional cost of $25 million were not only bridge costs, but also lading costs associated with derailment. Well, our guidance to a miss on the 100 basis point OR improvement, we don't exclude either one of those and we're going to continue to push as hard as we can to improve the OR. But those have not been excluded in that guidance today.","Scott Group","No, no. I understand they're not excluded; I'm just saying as we play with our models, if we were to exclude them, would you be hitting that OR target or not. I think that's what we're all trying to understand.","Cindy Earhart","I think that I would say that we will miss our target. The extent of it is probably not material. It's not a big miss, but it will be a miss.","Jim Squires","Again, that does not diminish our confidence in any way that we will get to a 60% operating ratio by 2021.","Scott Group","And then, Jim. So I think - I mean, all the rails are dealing with the same volume issues. I look so far - I think every rail has had better margin improvement than you so far in the third quarter, even though you're at a lower starting point. So, do you feel like you're going fast enough? Do you feel like you've got the right people to get us here? And then another difference is sort of on the capital front. Is there - With volumes weaker, are there opportunities to sort of change the capital spend?","Jim Squires","We are controlling the things that we can control and doing so aggressively. So we've been through all of the expense savings initiatives, which bore fruit in the third quarter and for the year-to-date, and we will continue to push on all of those things as far as we must to get to that 60% operating ratio by 2021. We've got a great team in place and everybody is aligned around our bottom line shareholder value goals.","Let's see. The second part of your question, Scott, was the capital. Yeah. So we have previously talked about a range of 16% to 18% of revenue for capital spending. What really matters here, obviously, is shareholder returns and return on capital. That's what we're managing to, that's why we are targeting that level of capital spend because we believe that it is the optimal range of capital spending relative to revenue, to generate the return on capital and the shareholder returns we're seeking to generate. It's a range and in the mean times we may take it down somewhat within that range. But again, it really gets back to return on capital and our goal of generating superior shareholder value.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Alger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Jordan Alger","So I know you've reiterated the 60 operating ratio in 2021. I'm just sort of curious if volumes stay kind of soft for at least the first part of next year. I mean can you give some sort of sense for how much you think OR and PSR benefits can push things in 2020 even with let's say, first half continuing softness environment? Thanks.","Jim Squires","We've spent a good deal of time already this morning talking about the efficiency initiatives, those that are well underway in Phase II of TOP21. Those will come to fruition in 2020 so we will see the full year benefit of expense savings from all of those initiatives, which we're pushing so hard on in 2019. And then we get into Phase III of TOP21, which will result in additional cost structural savings in 2021. And those will be again the drivers of further expense savings on the royalty 60 operating ratio.","Jordan Alger","And then just a quick follow-up on intermodal, comps obviously get pretty easy by middle of next year. If we get some truck capacity tightening and maybe spot pricing turns the other way a little bit. Would you expect or can you potentially anticipate some sort of inflection, especially given where your network is on rail intermodal volumes. I mean is that something that's conceivable as we move through next year, again assuming the economy is reasonably okay?","Jim Squires","Alan?","Alan Shaw","Yes, so Jordan we are aligned with the best channel partners in the business. And we are aligned with the steamship lines that are adding capacity to the East Coast as you see a shift from the West Coast to the East Coast. So we've got some strategic advantages to our intermodal franchise, which make it the best in the East. And so absolutely - as the economy turns and we deliver a very strong service product to our customers. We anticipate that intermodal is going to remain a growth engine for Norfolk Southern.","Intermodal revenues, as you know grew by 11% in 2017 and then follow that with an 18% growth last year. We've got a great franchise, great customers it\u2019s going to continue to pay dividends for our shareholders.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Ravi Shanker","Can you just clarify your current go-to-market strategy on price are you at a point where you guys can command the price you need to make the yield-up targets without losing volume. Or do you think that's more of a 2020 or 2021 thing, when there are more changes made in the network?","Jim Squires","Alan?","Alan Shaw","Ravi, we are very confident in our ability to price through a - vastly improved service product and we're providing our customers with a platform for growth. Take a look at our merchandise network in which the year-over-year rate of increase in price has improved for nine consecutive quarters. And you also see it reflected in RPU trends and revenue per ton mile trend. So we are intently focused on price even in this weak economic backdrop because we've got a great franchise and a great service product.","Ravi Shanker","And as follow-up you guys recently appointed Mr. Claude Mongeau to your Board at this point in your PSR strategy kind of what do you looking for from him and kind of what role is he likely to play?","Jim Squires","As I mentioned earlier Claude is an outstanding addition to our Board with his extensive experience in the industry. He got operations knowledge and experience, same on the finance side. So he will be a welcome addition, he is a welcome addition to our Board. And we'll bring all of that and more as we proceed through our PSR journey for the next couple of years and beyond.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Fadi Chamoun","Maybe, Alan if the pricing in the intermodal business doesn't really improve like truck pricing competition remains intense. Can intermodal margin improve to the level needed to achieve a 60% OR over the next couple of years and - if you're looking on the operating side. Are there steps meaningful steps that can be taken in the intermodal network to improve the OR if you can maybe outline those?","Jim Squires","Alan?","Alan Shaw","You take a look at the cyclical nature of the trucking industry we saw weakness in the spot truck market in 2011 and 2015 and 2019. And through all of that, we continue to deliver year-over-year rate increases in intermodal every single quarter. So we are very confident in the strength, the unique strength of our intermodal franchise.","Our alignment with the best channel partners in the business and we're going to cycle through this as - we noted before we grow revenue by 11% in 2017 and 18% and 2018. We've got a very strong franchise. The spot market will recover, and we're going to be positioned for growth because of the very strong service product that we're delivering.","Fadi Chamoun","And maybe just follow-up on the operational side, you mentioned clean sheeting in intermodal what is that exactly in tailwind. And if you can describe to us what is going on the operating side that would - going to improve the margin performance of that business?","Jim Squires","Mike, why don\u2019t you take that one?","Mike Wheeler","So, on the intermodal terminals just like we did the clean sheeting of our merchandise terminals. We're looking at each terminal and making sure that we have the best practices across all the terminals in our intermodal network. We've got all the right processes and procedures. And then once we do that we\u2019ll sink that up with the train plan for more efficiencies going forward and then continue to deliver good service product at the same time.","So it's kind of that deep dive into each one of the - each one of the intermodal terminals using good industrial engineering practices to make them as efficient as possible and more importantly consistent best practices across all the intermodal terminals.","Jim Squires","Mike, I'm very encouraged by this process because we and our customer saw the benefits in the merchandise network as we clean sheeted the merchandise network. You saw it reflected in a reduction and dwell, you saw it reflected in an increase in train speed and you saw it reflected in an improvement and our SDI our customer facing service metrics. And so I'm confident that we're going to continue to deliver the same as we apply these same principles to our intermodal franchise.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Seidl","I wanted to talk a little bit about your T&E productivity. You've shown a slight improvement in 2019 and you put a check there saying you're sort of on track but if we look out to your 2021 goal that's a much larger step-up. Could you walk us through how you guys plan on getting there?","Jim Squires","Mike?","Mike Wheeler","Yes it's going to be the continuation of the things that we've done where we continue to look at increasing the size of the trains and that drives crew starts down. Continuing the distributed power strategy, we're going to do more and more of that and that will drive train consolidations. And then continue to look at our local and yard network and making sure we're as efficient as possible there. So as we go through all this we uncover more opportunities.","And when we uncover those more opportunities we get into that we take the benefits of it and then we go the next step. So this has been a very good process for us to continue down that path. And we will continue to do that, we've got more in the gas tank with all these phases that we're talking about. So yeah, we're going to get there","Q \u2013 Jason Seidl","And I want to jump a little bit back on Scotts CapEx question going forward. Jim, I think you mentioned a range of 16% to 18%. Given what we've seen in the overall demand environment and the competitive truck market, should we look at 2020 as probably being towards the lower end of that range?","Jim Squires","Jason, we'll give you some more guidance on CapEx, expected CapEx, when we meet again in January. But let me say this, majority of our capital budget, as you well know, the great majority is replenishment capital spending, including our DC to AC conversion program, which is meant to and will rejuvenate our locomotive fleet.","So for us, that's a pretty significant line item in and of itself in the capital budget under the category of sustaining capital spending. And then of course there's everything else that goes into sustaining franchise rail cost balance and so on and so forth.","The growth piece of it, we will protect, we will project. It's relatively small compared to the sustaining CapEx. But it needs to be part of the plan, because we do aspire to grow and we believe we have growth prospects that will generate excellent shareholder returns down the road.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Q \u2013 Chris Wetherbee","Wanted to ask about head count. Obviously, you've made some progress here and target further progress in the fourth quarter. I wanted to get a sense of maybe how you feel like the workforce is calibrated to the volume environment? Assuming some degree of stabilization, how much more is there to go as you kind of run through Phase 2 and Phase 3 of Top 21? How should we be thinking about sort of headcount as we move through the beginning to first half of 2020?","Jim Squires","Cindy, why don't you go back over to what we are expecting in the fourth quarter, reflecting end of year versus our average headcount in the fourth quarter versus fourth quarter of last year and then talk a little bit about where we're going?","Cindy Earhart","Yes. Well, Chris, as I said, we expect the year-end headcount to be at 20 - around 23,300; which is 3,200 less than the end of last year of 2018. So we've made obviously significant progress. I think our original estimates for headcount reductions this year were 500. So that has really been accelerating.","And obviously, big part of that structural, there has been - there's been reductions associated with volume and then you could moderate that as volume goes up or down, but we certainly expect going into next year, you've heard all the initiatives that Mike has talked about, both in terms of T&E as well as mechanical that we expect headcount to continue to come down.","Jim Squires","We also want to be sure we are prepared for when - so that's a balancing act, and we want to be sure that we operate as optimally as we can in a declining volume environment, like we're in now, but we also want to be confident that we can handle the business when it comes back.","We believe that we have a great formula for that, we're just that. And that is responding appropriately in the current volume environment, but we are also protecting our ability to handle the business when it returns down the road.","Q \u2013 Chris Wetherbee","And then if I could turn to Purchase Services, it was up sequentially, although volumes were down. I wanted to get a sense, it's a big, obviously, line item on the cost side for you guys. When we think about sort of plan, as it continues to roll out over the next few phases, how big an opportunity is that? Was there anything specific in the third quarter and just kind of how can you go from here?","Jim Squires","Cindy?","Cindy Earhart","Well, Chris, as we talked before about Purchase Services. And I will say, if you look at Purchase Services and rents, we have seen big improvements, as I mentioned before on equipment rent side, a $35 million improvement year-over-year. And that's really been associated with just the improved velocity of the network, as well as getting a lot of these cars offline. So that has been favorable. We expect that to continue to be favorable going forward.","On Purchase Services and rents, there's a lot of different things that are in that category. Some is volume dependent, although not as much as you would think. We have pointed out in the prior quarters that we've had additional spending on the IT side. We're going to continue to invest in IT and we've seen that on capital spending, as well as in this particular item.","We think that that's really prudent investment to be making, because it's focused on things that are going to improve the productivity of the workforce, the reliability of our equipment and so forth.","We did have - we've had a little bit additional expenditure in Purchase Services and rents associated with freight cars, as we've taken freight cars offline and we've had to turn them back leases, we've had some additional repair costs associated with that.","So there's some puts and takes there. But overall, I think you'll see Purchase Services continue similarly as we move forward sequentially.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Amit Mehrotra","Just a quick one. The first one at least will be quick. Was there any impact in the quarter from the strike at General Motors? I know auto volumes were actually up in the quarter and yield was kind of flat. I didn't know if there was anything to call out there with respect to stranded or unabsorbed costs related to that or even in the fourth quarter?","Jim Squires","Alan, why don't you take that.","Alan Shaw","Yes, the timing of that work stoppage will more impact our volumes in the fourth quarter.","Amit Mehrotra","Any stranded costs associated with that, that we should think about for the fourth quarter or not enough to call out?","Alan Shaw","No.","Amit Mehrotra","And then, Jim, I wanted to just, if I could just follow-up, I think on the - one of the very first questions. And I think it's really the most important one with respect to your OR targets for 2021 at least. And obviously it's in the context, if you guys walking back this year's OR improvement.","So when we look back in February or February 11th, when you did the Investor Day in Atlanta, you guys were very explicit about your revenue targets; 5% compounded annual growth rate for the entire business, 10% revenue growth in intermodal. I was hoping that you could be as specific now, 10-months later or so or a little bit less than that. Given what's happened in the revenue framework, how the revenue side of the business rolls up to your OR target.","And I understand you're not going to use revenue as excuse and there's a lot of productivity, but given how specific you were in February, we'd appreciate it I think if you can give us some sense of what that revenue roll up looks like now, relative to the 5% and 10% growth you did in February to get to that 60, 60 by 2021 target?","Jim Squires","Fair enough. Let me say, first of all, about the strategic plan. As with any such plan, the assumptions they are in, are good for about as long as it takes the inkjet to write on the strategic plan.","So conditions change. Business conditions change, the revenue picture, the volume picture has changed rather dramatically since we issued the three-year plan in February. We've always said that one of our hallmarks is flexibility and adjustability. That's what we did in 2016, when we saw a significant volume decline. And we responded with additional productivity initiatives in order to hit our goals. That's what we will do again this time around.","Now, we will review with you our revised macro assumptions in January when we report out on the fourth quarter results, and we'll give you our productivity goals, our Tier-1 methods going forward for the next couple of years. We'll give you some high-level assumptions with regard to revenue, and it's part of that plan as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Wadewitz","So, Alan, I wanted to get your thoughts on the export coal framework for 2020. Just maybe if you could give us a sense about, at current prices, did you expect tonnage to be down pretty meaningfully? Or if you look at seaborne prices, do you think it's more of a hit to your, the revenue per ton that you're achieving? Just maybe some broader thoughts about that and I don't know if you want to tie it to met coal levels and where you really have the sensitivity to a tonnage decline?","Alan Shaw","Tom, as I've talked about, at current prices it makes it really difficult for U.S. coals to compete in the market, both on the - with respect to thermal and metallurgical. We've talked before about some of those thermal contracts are effectively hedged, but contracts between the producers and the receivers are effectively hedged through 2019.","And so you'll see pressure in the thermal market as we roll into 2020. And the met market is going to follow demand overseas in the global economy, and seaborne coking coal pricing. And I'll provide a lot more color on that on our fourth quarter earnings call, as we start talking about 2020.","Tom Wadewitz","I guess if you look back just to kind of look at levels of export coal on Norfolk, in the 2015-2016 area, you were kind of 15 million tons, 16 million tons. I think 2019, you're running at a rate of like something like 24 million tons. So do you think this feels like 2015, 2016 or would you say; hey, we haven't fallen to that level, it of feels better than that. So just trying to get a sense of the right framework to consider given that there's obviously pressure on the export market.","Alan Shaw","There is pressure and we've been pretty clear about that. Let's just talk about coal broadly. Right now coal is about 12% of our volume. And export coal is about 25% of our coal volumes. So there you're talking about a little bit less than 3% of our overall volume.","It's important to us, it's important to our franchise. We've got a very diverse franchise, as we've built out our intermodal network. So it's - I'll provide more color and more historical context on the outlook for export coal in the fourth quarter call.","The important thing to consider is that we've got a great merchandise network, a great intermodal franchise and we are securing price, reflecting the value of our product.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please proceed with your question.","Bascome Majors","On the receivables write-off you took for the September jury ruling on the [indiscernible] contract. Is there any accruing revenue for liquidated damages in this year, and is there any go forward impact associated with that ruling?","Jim Squires","Cindy?","Cindy Earhart","Bascome, we've recognized what we think is the probable financial impact of that legal dispute.","Bascome Majors","Was that all backward looking or is there some ongoing impact included in that charge?","Cindy Earhart","No, that was backwards.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Hoexter","And I know OR has been hit a lot, but in an environment where you're supposed to be significantly cutting costs and walking away from the 100-basis point improvement, and your peer is doing 400 basis points better excluding the real estate sales, and you've got employees down 9%, cars and trains are down. Jim, maybe talk about why is this not getting better or Michael, why are we not seeing a stair-step improvement at this point?","Given the changes you've made, is it just the coal margins are impacting so much overwhelming the gains or is there something else that's constraining the ability to get that stair-step improvement?","Jim Squires","Ken, certainly, we're dealing with a different sort of revenue and volume context and reward in the first half. So that's been a major change. We have responded aggressively to that change with the resource reductions we've been through this morning, positions locomotives, freight cars, materials, all favorable in expenses. So you're seeing the momentum in expense reductions from our acceleration of the various initiatives with more to come.","Now, we still don't expect to see operating ratio improvement for the full year. But because of the additional expenses that we've been through this morning in the fourth quarter, we don't expect to meet the - at least a 100-basis points goal. But that does not diminish our confidence. We can get to a 60-operating ratio by 2021.","Ken Hoexter","And then I guess maybe, Alan, given that volumes have gotten worse now year sequentially and seemingly at an accelerating pace, I don't know if that was - is related to the derailment Cindy talked about, but you're now down 8% quarter-to-date. And I know it's only a couple of weeks in the 4th quarter, but down from 5% to 6%. Coal seems to be staying down mid-teens, but, Alan, you mentioned things are still ugly. But are things getting worse than an accelerating pace, just looking at intermodal and ag and some of the other commodities outside of kind of autos from the strike? It just seems like we're accelerating on the downside, maybe your view on economic side.","Alan Shaw","Again, we're not really seeing this much of a peak within the intermodal franchise. And so that is certainly having an impact on volumes and year-over-year comps.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the floor back to Mr. Squires, for any closing comments.","Jim Squires","I want to thank you all for your questions and for participating in today's call, and we look forward to speaking with you again in January. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."],"16265":["Norfolk Southern Corp.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Katie Cook, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Cook. You may now begin.","Katie U. Cook - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Thank you, Rob, and good morning. Before we begin, please note that during today's call, we may make certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important.","The slides of the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors' section, along with our non-GAAP reconciliation. Additionally, a transcript and downloads will be posted after the call.","Now, it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman, President, and CEO, Jim Squires.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's second quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today are Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer; Mike Wheeler, Chief Operating Officer; and Marta Stewart, Chief Financial Officer.","Turning now to slide 4, we're pleased to report another quarter of strong financial results, as we've continued to drive both resource utilization and growth. Marking our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating ratio improvements and an all-time record, we decreased our second quarter operating ratio by 230 basis points to 66.3%. Income from operations of $888 million was up 15% compared to the prior-year period. Earnings per share increased 26% to $1.71.","We continue to successfully, execute our multidimensional strategy and achieved another record operating ratio of $68.1 million for the first half of the year, a 130 basis point improvement from last year's record. Income from operations was up 11% to $1.7 billion. And earnings per share increased 20% to $3.18, also a first half record.","These results demonstrate that our strategic plan built upon our core pillars of safety, service, stewardship, and growth is working as intended, providing a reliable framework that our team has successfully executed upon to propel improved operational efficiencies, which will deliver over $100 million productivity savings this year. The determination and perseverance of our employees to affect sustainable change has been instrumental in our achievements. Importantly, their work has also established a strong foundation for ongoing growth and success.","As reflected on slide 5, since the inception of our strategic plan, we have commenced a broad set of initiatives including, reducing G&A and consolidating headquarters; restructuring Triple Crown and Pocahontas Land subsidiaries; rationalizing over 1,000 miles of track, including the short lining of our West Virginia Secondary and Delmarva south lines; idling our Ashtabula Docks coal terminal and restructuring yards, including the idling of Knoxville, Sevier Yard, and Chattanooga hump operations; and consolidating operating regions and divisions, including the recently announced consolidation of our Central Division.","In addition to these initiatives, we have rationalized and revitalized our locomotive fleet, achieving our highest quarterly locomotive productivity and fuel efficiency on record. Productivity initiatives targeting freight car utilization are ongoing as well. Through our dynamic plan, we are continuing to aggressively pursue additional opportunities for improvement. Mike will provide you with an update on our ongoing initiatives and metrics later on the call.","Moving to slide 6. With respect to our market approach, we remain steadfast in our commitment to deliver quality service that our customers value and growth that complements our network. Alan will provide additional details on some of our ongoing initiatives, which include: partnering with customers to develop unique key performance indicators; implementing projects that enhance both the customers experience and improve our efficiencies; and leveraging the strength of our industrial development team to feed our pipeline for future growth.","As a result of our initiatives, and as you can see on the right of this slide, we've increased volumes by 6%, while reducing average head count 3% versus last year's levels and 10% compared to 2015. Our strategy has supported the return of capital to shareholders, through increase in dividend payments and share buybacks.","As reflected on slide 7, cumulative distributions have totaled $17.1 billion since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2006. Dividends per share have increased by 12% compound annual growth rate over that period. In addition, we've repurchased nearly 164 million shares at an average cost of about $65 a share. As we look forward, given the strong financial results we've achieved to-date and the confidence we have in outlook, we're increasing this year's share repurchase guidance by 25% to $1 billion.","Turning now to our longer-term guidance on slide 8, we continue to make solid progress toward achieving a sub-65% operating ratio, which I'm confident we'll accomplish by 2020 or sooner. I have consistently said that our plan is dynamic and flexible. And as we reach these targets, we're committed to driving performance improvement, whether through improved productivity, or growth, or both. I have every confidence in our ability to achieve and surpass our objectives and create sustainable value in both the short and long term.","And I'll now turn the program over to Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer. Alan?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter was marked by strong year-over-year volume improvement in intermodal and coal, generating total revenue of $2.6 billion, up 7% versus 2016. Intermodal reached a record quarterly volume with a year-over-year increase of 57,000 units, benefiting from continued highway conversions and new service offerings.","Utility coal increased 27,000 shipments in the second quarter as a result of a previously reported market share gain and higher year-over-year natural gas prices. Export coal grew 25,000 units due to improved seaborne pricing, which made U.S. coals more competitive in the international market. Positive pricing was partially offset by mix, improving our revenue per unit in all seven groups, and 1% in total. Overall, our merchandise volume was flat in the second quarter as gains in frac sand and steel were offset by declines in crude oil.","Growth in the metals and construction segment was driven by increases in shipments of frac sand due to increased drilling activity in the Marcellus and Utica Shale regions. Additionally, improvements in steel pricing, change in supply chains, and inventory replenishment led to higher volumes in our steel franchise. These gains were partially offset by the clients in our crude oil volume, which has been negatively impacted by pipeline activity.","Automotive volume declined due to decreases in U.S. vehicle production. While paper was impacted by strong truck competition. Merchandized revenue increased 1% versus second quarter 2016 to $1.6 billion, with a corresponding 2% increase in revenue per unit. Positive pricing was impacted by mix shifts, as well as excess truck capacity.","On slide 12, intermodal revenue increased 10% to $593 million, as volume increased 6% to over 1 million units. Domestic volume grew in the second quarter due to continued highway conversions and collaboration with our channel partners to develop new markets. These gains were partially offset by headwinds due to elevated truck capacity. Our alignment with shipping partners growing at East Coast ports led to 5% growth in our international volume. Revenue per unit was up 4%. Intermodal pricing continues to be impacted by excess truck capacity, a condition we expect to improve as the year progresses. Tightening capacity is expected to drive stronger pricing growth in 2018.","Moving to slide 13, our coal revenue grew an impressive 32% versus the same period last year to $447 million. Volume increased 27% and revenue per unit improved 4% compared to second quarter 2016. Increased utility coal volume resulted from the previously discussed market share gain coupled with favorable natural gas prices compared to prior-year levels.","Growth in this segment was also driven by increased export volume as tightening international supply improved seaborne pricing. Year-over-year, revenue per unit increased 4%. Positive pricing, particularly in our export market, was partially offset by increased short-haul Utility North volume and mix shifts within the export market, similar to what we saw on the first quarter.","Moving to slide 14, we expect year-over-year growth in the third quarter, led by intermodal and coal, with low to mid-single-digit decline in our merchandise volume. Comparisons to last year become more difficult, as overall volumes began to accelerate sequentially in the third quarter of 2016. Merchandise volume is expected to be negatively impacted by continued diversions of crude oil and natural gas liquids to pipelines.","Steel shipments are expected to decline sequentially as customer inventories were replenished in the first half of this year. Moreover, a projected annual 6% decrease in U.S. vehicle production will negatively impact automotive volume in the second half, with the largest year-over-year decrease in the third quarter. Partially offsetting these declines, we project continued growth in frac sand due to increased natural gas production, although the year-over-year growth will be less than what we experienced in the second quarter.","We are generating opportunities, as our customer supply chains adapt to the rapidly evolving e-commerce and consumer markets. Our marketing and operations teams are collaborating together with our customers to align their growth with ours through new strategic services that capitalize on these quickly-changing market trends. Our intermodal franchise benefited from these new services in the second quarter, which will provide ongoing growth for years to come. We are also prepared for growth as the truck market continues to tighten, driving highway to rail conversions, strong service products that focus on the needs of our customers, as well as efficient operations provide confidence that our growing intermodal franchise will continue to enhance shareholder value.","While we project the year-over-year improvement in the coal market in the second half, the pace of this growth will lessen due to a sequential decline in export coal and higher utility volume in the second half of last year. Export tonnage will likely moderate from first half levels to the 4 million to 5 million ton per quarter range, with volume contingent on sustained seaborne price levels. In line with our projections last quarter, we anticipate third quarter utility tonnage between 17 million and 19 million tons, with the fourth quarter tonnage contingent on some of our stockpile levels and natural gas prices.","Our best-in-class industrial development team consistently works with potential new customers, strengthening our position in the supply chain. Our list of active projects remains robust and will provide continued growth opportunities that will benefit future-year volumes, further underscoring the sustainability of our plan.","Our strategic plan maintains a focus on the customer experience. Part of this focus includes working with our customers to align our service metrics with our customers' view of our performance, as well as partnering to ensure we provide effective tools to schedule and manage their business with Norfolk Southern. Our aim is to continually evolve the elements of our operations that drive quality growth and efficiency. This approach increases our value to customers and strengthens our position in the marketplace for the near and long term.","As our customers are innovating to serve a dynamic changing world, we are doing the same, working together to design efficient supply chain solutions for their emerging needs. For example, we recently repurposed a Triple Crown yard to provide innovative solutions for the gas market. We further enhanced this service by combining aspects of unit train operations with the demand for single-car shipments. Customers value these types of innovative solutions, driven by the continuity and our longstanding customer relationships, market knowledge, and seamless marketing and operating philosophy. With our strong partnerships throughout the supply chain, we'll continue to enhance our ability to serve our customers, while generating strong returns for our shareholders.","I will now turn it over to Mike, who will discuss our operational performance.","Michael J. Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Thank you, Alan, and good morning. In the second quarter, we continued to grow our business and provide a good service product to our customers. We also achieved our strong results, while streamlining our operations and idling our largest hump yard to-date in Chattanooga. Our all-time record operating ratio for a quarter as well as for the first half of the year is a testament to our strategic plan and the hard work of our employees.","As shown on slide 16, there were significant milestones achieved in the quarter as well as the first half of the year that were key drivers of our success. The efforts towards driving locomotive productivity, fuel efficiency, and train length, which we will discuss in more detail later in the presentation, all helped to drive our record operating ratio.","As noted on slide 17, we are continuing to take steps to improve service and reduce cost. We idled our largest hump yard yet in Chattanooga in the second quarter, and this is the fourth major hump yard idled. We have also announced the consolidation of our Central Division, which will further reduce the number of operating divisions from 10 to 9. This is a continuation of the steps we took in 2016, wherein we consolidated from 11 to 10 divisions and reduced the number of operating regions by a third.","In addition, as we discussed on our last call, we removed another 100 locomotives from service in the second quarter, and we did so while handling more volume. All of these actions drive the pillars of our strategic plan: safety; service; productivity; and growth, and puts us on-track to exceed $100 million of annual productivity savings this year.","Moving to safety on slide 18, we are pleased to see a 12% improvement in our reportable injury ratio, as well as a 23% improvement in our serious injury ratio. These reductions demonstrate our continued dedication to maintaining a safe and productive working environment for our employees throughout operations, which is a cornerstone of our strategy. Working safely and efficiently is a key component of our efforts to drive sustainable value-creation.","Our network metric performance, shown here on slide 19, did trend down in the second quarter due to a number of episodic events that were concentrated in the Southeast. More importantly, our metrics have trended higher in the recent weeks. We are confident we will remain at these high levels, while handling the additional volume and continuing to aggressively pursue productivity initiatives. Our customer-facing metrics are allowing us to have specific data-driven discussions with our customers, deepening our already strong relationships.","Moving to some of our productivity initiatives, starting on slide 20. You can see we continued to increase employee productivity, which is driven by optimizing our train plan as well as our improvements in train length. As you may recall, 2016 was a record year for train length, and we are on track to set a new record for the full year of 2017. The second quarter was the highest quarterly train length on record, and June represented the highest monthly train length at Norfolk Southern. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of sequential improvement, and we are excited to build on our momentum.","As shown on slide 21, train length, along with the continued rationalization of our yard and local fleets, has resulted in significant improvements in our locomotive productivity. We removed 150 locomotives from service in 2016 and another 150 so far this year. The second quarter was the highest quarter of locomotive productivity in our company history, and we are on pace to set a new record for the full year. We will continue to actively manage our locomotives to ensure we are driving the highest value for shareholders, while we continue to support the needs of our customers.","Not only do these improvements result in lower maintenance cost; they also enhance our fuel efficiency, which I will discuss on slide 22. Our fuel efficiency improved 7% in the second quarter versus the same period last year and resulted in an all-time quarterly record. As you may recall, 2016 was a record year for this measurement. We accomplished this by continuing to improve train lengths, locomotive rationalizations, and implementing our energy management initiatives. Together, these initiatives continue to drive improvements for this measurement.","In closing, we are confident we will continue to provide a level of service to our customers that will grow our business, while at the same time driving long-term productivity savings and superior returns for shareholders. We are proud of the accomplishments we have made and continue to identify opportunities to drive additional efficiencies for the benefit of NS shareholders.","I will now turn it over to Marta, who will cover our financial achievements.","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with our summarized second quarter results on slide 24. The continued execution of our strategic plan delivered a 7% increase in revenues, which, when coupled with only a 4% increase in expenses, resulted in more than $100 million of additional operating income, and as Jim noted, an all-time record-low quarterly operating ratio of 66.3%.","Turning to the component changes in operating expenses on slide 25. In total, they were higher by $65 million or 4%, as our sustained focus on controlling expenses helped mitigate costs associated with inflation and with the 6% volume increase.","Slide 26 highlights the drivers of the variance in Compensation and Benefits, which rose by $36 million or 5% year-over-year. As I mentioned on last quarter's call, inflationary increases continue at a quarterly run rate of $30 million to $35 million, which is higher than historically, primarily due to the large increase in premiums on union medical plans.","Also previously noted is an increase in incentive compensation associated with the improvement in operating results. Partially offsetting these items were reduced employee levels, which resulted in $16 million of lower expense, as head count was more than 800 employees lower than the second quarter of 2016 and down almost 400 sequentially. With the efficiency improvements Mike mentioned, we now expect that we can hold overall head count at this lower level for the remainder of the year.","Fuel expense, as shown on slide 27, rose by $16 million, entirely attributable to higher prices, which added $18 million. Fuel efficiency continues to improve. And as Mike mentioned, we achieved a record on this metric, which resulted in 2% fewer gallons consumed on 6% more volume.","Moving on to Purchased Services and Rents on slide 28. This category was up $8 million or 2% year-over-year, largely due to the increase in intermodal traffic.","Slide 29 displays other income, which rose $28 million for the quarter, due principally to higher returns on corporate-owned life insurance and increased income from coal property.","Turning to Income Taxes on slide 30. The effective rate for the quarter was 36.3%, unchanged from the second quarter of 2016.","Summarizing second quarter earnings on slide 31, net income was $497 million, up 23% compared with 2016; and diluted earnings per share were $1.71, up 26% versus the second quarter of last year.","Wrapping up our financial overview on slide 32, free cash flow for the first six months was nearly $700 million, up $200 million versus the prior year. And as Jim noted, with the improvement in cash flow and our confidence in future free cash generation, we have increased our full-year target for share repurchases from $800 million to $1 billion.","Thanks for your attention, and I now turn the call back to Jim.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","As evidenced by our record results just a year and a half into our plan, our team is engaged and energized. Having consistently delivered strong performance, we are confident in our ability to reach a sub-65% operating ratio by 2020 or sooner. Additionally, as we reach our targets, we'll continue to achieve improvements that drive shareholder value.","Before taking your questions, I want to thank Marta for her many contributions and devoted service over the years, as she will retire from Norfolk Southern on August 1. She's been an outstanding leader in our organization, a terrific member of the management team and instrumental to Norfolk Southern's success. On a personal note, she's also been a trusted partner and a great friend, so it is a bittersweet goodbye for me.","Our search for Marta's successor is ongoing. We are working with a nationally recognized executive search firm and are considering both external and internal candidates. While the search continues, the board has elected Tom Hurlbut, currently VP and Controller, to the position of Interim CFO, effective August 1.","And with that, we'll now open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Due to the number of analysts joining us in the call today, please ask one primary question and one follow-up question to accommodate as many participants as possible.","Our first question today is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. Good morning. So, I just wanted to ask about the long-term target. It seemed like there was sort of a slight shift in the language. Previously, you've talked about a 65% or below by 2020, and now it's sort of 65% by 2020 or sooner. Should we read anything into that as you're stepping up the operational initiatives as well as various customer projects, or, really, is it just semantics?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Good morning, Allison. Let me start by pointing out again that the second quarter of this year represented our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year OR improvements and all-time records in both the quarter and for the first half. So, our plan is working as planned, and it's allowing us to deliver a lot of financial improvements through operational gains. So, we are very confident that we can reach our goals. And we're pulling all the levers. We've got the pedal to the metal. And as soon as we can get there, we will.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. So, would you characterize that, with the good results over the last few quarters, as maybe pulling that target forward a little bit?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah, things are going really well. The plan is working as planned, and we're making rapid progress. So, yes, we are very confident.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, great. And then if I could just ask about the third quarter. Historically, the OR is flat to slightly down on a sequential basis. So, as I think about some of the puts and takes in the volume side that you discussed earlier, is that still the right way to think about it, or are there any cost items or other items that might drive a deviation from historical patterns?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","We do feel confident we'll post a lower operating ratio year-over-year in the second half of the year. Now, the pace of improvements quarter-by-quarter will depend on various factors. Long term, obviously, the drivers are our top line growth in productivity, and that doesn't change. Quarter-by-quarter, things like real estate gains can make a difference, can tip the balance. And recall that in the third quarter of last year, we did have a significant real estate gain.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your questions.","Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC","Wow. Thank you very much. Could you parse out some of those comments you made about episodic events in the second quarter impacting you a little bit on the negative side? And then maybe talk about how your metrics are trending up and what that can mean on a sequential basis, and how we're looking at your numbers from 2Q to 3Q?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Sure. Well, let me set the backdrop, and then I'll hand it off to Mike to talk about some of the specific things we encountered in the second quarter. You did see network velocity slow down a little bit in the second quarter, and you saw dwell tick up some. We've turned a corner on that. Third quarter, to-date, the metrics are looking good. We are steadfast in our commitment to deliver quality service and customer value.","And network performance, even through the second quarter of this year, remained well above 2015 levels. And as I said, it's been trending higher. So, this is the platform for growth. And we are committed to keeping network performance and service performance at a level that allows us to grow and drives productivity as well.","So, with that, Mike, why don't you comment a little bit on some of the things we experienced in the second quarter.","Michael J. Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah. Okay, will do. So, we had really three things that were going on. They were going on pretty close together, but we had a lot of flooding pretty much between Louisville and Kansas City, on that line. During the quarter, we also had some flooding just outside of our Cincinnati terminal, which is a high-volume terminal there. During the quarter, we had some fires going on down in North Florida that were shutting our line down different times during the third quarter. They'd come near the tracks, so we shut the tracks down and opened it back up.","So, those three things were going on, dealt with those through the quarter. And we feel very comfortable about how we bounced back. In the last month, our train speed has increased 10% back to prior levels and our dwell's back to what it was prior to some of these stuff. So, feel real comfortable about how we've responded and returned service to where we want it to be. And it continues to trend higher, and we're going to continue to work on that.","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","So, Allison, this is Alan \u2013 or Jason, excuse me.","Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC","Jason.","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah, excuse me, Jason. So...","Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC","She's the better looking one.","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","We have seen improvement since the beginning of the third quarter. We've seen it in our network performance metrics. We've seen it in our customer-facing metrics. And more importantly, as Jim, and Mike, and I get out and talk to our customers, we see it in the feedback from our customers. They sense the improvement. They're seeing the improvement in our service product.","Michael J. Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yes. And we're pleased with where it's at, and we're going to continue to keep it there, continue to further improve.","Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC","All right. I guess, my follow-up is going to be more on the top line side. We did, as you know, our big Railroad Shipper survey,. And your eastern competitor probably got the worst ratings and service. And we just held dinner last night with some railroad people, and clearly, they're having some service challenges over there. Have you seen freight come over from the other eastern railroads due to poorer-than-expected service, where it can come over? And if it's come over, has it come over at regular pricing, or have you been able to actually increase the pricing on that?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Look, Jason, again, let me just set the stage here, and I'm going to let Alan comment specifically on what's going on with the top line in that regard. But first off, our focus is very much on enhancing value at NSC and driving our plan to continue to drive productivity and growth. And growth is an important part of that plan. We'll take the market share, whether it's from truck or competitors, as long as it complements our network and obviously falls to the bottom line. Those are the keys.","So, Alan, what are you seeing in terms of the landscape?","Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC","Hey, Alan.","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Jason, we are always talking to our customers. As Jim noted, our primary form of competition is truck. But we're talking to our customers about service products that offer a sustainable view of their markets and allow them to grow. And we have seen some business move over to us. It's a small amount, I'll tell you that, but it's early. We've got a really good service product. The customers value the continuity of our market approach, of our operating philosophy, and our focus on allowing them to grow with their customers.","Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay, gentlemen, thank you for the time. And Marta congratulations on the retirement, and best of luck to you.","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning, and also wanted to extend the best wishes to you Marta in retirement.","Let's see. I guess, the question on rail competition and kind of customer conversations and so forth, you gave us some perspective on that. I think, Alan, you said, it's early. I guess, with the nature of the customer conversations recently, would you say that this is something that's likely to build in terms of the potential for us and business to come over, or would you say, look, business kind of naturally falls to one or the other, and you really shouldn't consider too much in terms of share gain as you look the next couple of quarters? How would you frame that?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah. Again, let me do the framing, and then hand it off to Alan. I want to emphasize that we have been in front of our customers a lot. That is just a part of our regular routine. Mike, Alan, and I are in front of our customers all the time. We are going to them. We are in their offices and their conference rooms, hearing about their business and how we can gain more of it. So, that's a big focus for all three of us. We want the feedback from our customers all the time, and we're getting it.","So, Alan, talk a little bit more about the market share opportunity.","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","So, we're going to capitalize on opportunities that fit our network. And if customers see that we provide a predictable, efficient service product that meets their needs, whether that's in competition with truck or another rail carrier, then we're going to go after that business, Jim, as long as it fits our network and we can drive value to our shareholders.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. But when you said, it's early, does that imply that there might be some building in the opportunity, or am I over-reading that comment?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","I'll tell you that the average duration of our contract is three years, and so, it takes time for some things to play out.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Right, okay. I guess for the follow-up question, it seems you had weakness in 2015 and 2016 in coal, some other NG-related areas, then you had pretty significant strength year-over-year in the first half. I think we're kind of \u2013 so, the industry's transitioning to a slower pace of growth in volume overall. How does that affect how you would view the opportunity for margin improvement year-over-year, or if you want us to take it and say, we're really focused on productivity? Just trying to think about how we think of those two things, productivity or improvement, as you may have a slower year-over-year volume growth backdrop looking forward.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Let me comment generally. With respect to our coal customers, as with all of our customers, our goal is to serve them. And that means having the resources available to serve them, when the demand is there, when they need our service. So, we are committed to that. We're committed to serving our coal customers as with all our other customers as well.","Alan, in terms of resource deployment and market opportunity, what are you seeing?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Well, Tom, within coal, I was with several of our coal customers just last week, and there is optimism, particularly on the export side for continued strength throughout the year. As you know, the benchmark moved in the mid-140s to $175 just within a span of a couple of weeks as the Chinese reported record steel production in June. I was also with some intermodal customers, and they're commenting about how they're starting to see tightness in the truck market. That's important for us, because as we've noted, truck is our primary form of competition, and so as you see spot rates move up double digit within the last couple of months and maybe start to move above contract rates, that portends well for both volume and pricing opportunities for us into 2018.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks so much for taking my questions. First one is on the automotive business. You mentioned the headwind from auto production in the second half, but General Motors production, specifically, I think is expected to be down as much as 20% in the third quarter. That's not necessarily organic. I guess, it's due to the change over their light truck platform. I think you guys have some disproportionate exposure there on the Fort Wayne line, if you could just talk about the impact there. I think it'll probably be one-time given the changeover effect, but any color on maybe what that could have in terms of revenue growth, and then also fixed cost absorption in the automotive franchise. That would be helpful. Thank you.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Automotive production in the U.S. declined 6.5% in the second quarter. It's supposed to be down 9.3% in the third quarter. That's the largest year-over-year decline that is currently being projected. And so, consequently, we see a decline within our automotive volumes, particularly in the third quarter.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, I know that, but the question was really on the disproportionate exposure to General Motors and the fact that that business is going to be down 20%. What type of impact that may have disproportionally to your exposure in the auto business?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","We're not going to discuss specific customer relationships. I think I've given you some good color as to what we see within our automotive market for the back half of the year.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's fair. And then one follow-up with me, just piggybacking on the last question with respect to OR expansion in the back half. I mean, the contribution margins \u2013 the incremental margins in the first half have just been unbelievably strong. Those productivity initiatives have definitely dropped to the bottom line, and then the business obviously, really capital-intensive. But just a question on your ability to maintain the incremental margins that you did in the first half in the second half. Obviously, mixes, volumes are not going to be as strong as they were in the first half. But then the productivity and the head count will stay flat sequentially. So, just the puts and takes there in terms of your ability to maintain incremental margins maybe in the neighborhood of where they were in the first half, that'd be helpful. Thank you.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","The key is the plan's dynamism and flexibility. And that's what we have done for the last year and a half. We have responded to changing business conditions as necessary to continue driving results. And so, when necessary, we'll lean into productivity. And for the long term, it's all about a multidimensional approach, a combination of growth and productivity at any given time. Maybe it's a little bit more growth; maybe it's a little bit more productivity. So, we'll be flexible.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. All right, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Can you just comment on pricing in the second quarter and kind of the gap to inflation, kind of how you see that evolving through the year, because it does look like inflation was higher in the second quarter and is probably going to accelerate into the second half of the year?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah. Our rate of year-over-year pricing growth in the second quarter was consistent with what we saw in the first quarter. And the rate of year-over-year pricing growth was consistent with what we saw in 2016. So, we're committed to focusing on price and recognizing the value of the service product that we provide, and we're committed to pricing long-term above inflation.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","But do you feel like you're going to get there in the second half of this year as well?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yes.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And as a follow-up, in the intermodal market, are you confident that the rising tide of pricing in all of trucking will help intermodal pricing over time? I'm just wondering if there's enough overlap between the kind of mom-and-pop truckers who are most impacted by ELDs and the intermodal market as it stands right now?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah. We are very confident that it's going to provide pricing opportunity for us, and it's going to provide volume opportunities for us. We've got great channel partners out there, who are working to grow their business. And we've got a service product and schedules that support their growth. Now, most of that growth from ELDs will come in 2018.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter, Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch (US)","Great. Good morning. And, also, congrats to Marta on her retirement. Great working with you over the years.","Michael or Jim, can you talk about the experience on the hump yard in Chattanooga? You shut it down. Did you convert that to a flat yard? Did you shift the business elsewhere? Just want to understand, is that replicable as you think about your network, or was this just from maybe shrinking business in that region, and you didn't need it, and you moved it elsewhere? Can you maybe walk though a little bit about that?","Michael J. Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Sure will. So, we idled the hump, but we are using that yard, and it's in a great location for us, because it has a lot of feeder lines from our network going into it to do block swapping. So, while we idled the hump, we now do a lot more block swapping, we do more blocking further into the network. So, it is giving us good productivity, because the cars are getting through there faster and providing even better service, because of less time on the network getting to the customers. So, that's the piece to it, where it's a big yard in a great location, to be able to do a large amount of block swapping.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch (US)","And, again, Michael, maybe your thoughts on, is that something that's replicable to other yards? I mean, you talked about the number of hump yards in the past. Is that something you plan on continuing the conversions to other yards?","Michael J. Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","We continue to look at it. It has to make sense. It has to end up getting traffic through the network faster and taking cost out, or a balance between the two. And we're only going to do if it hits those criteria.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch (US)","So, when you look at this example, is it something that's accelerating, and you look at it, and say, we're going to do more, or is this just a one-off? I just want to understand if this is something you can replicate to your other yards.","Michael J. Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah. And we can replicate it to other yards. It may be in yards that aren't necessarily hump yards and do more of the block swapping in locations where it makes sense, something we've been doing over the last couple of years. But we've done it more aggressively lately, and this is one piece of it. And we're doing it more aggressively at other locations.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch (US)","All right. Great. Marta, if I can have a follow-up with you on your employee levels, you talked about being flat going forward. Maybe talk about the cost per employee impacts there. You talked about a couple of things that drove costs up in the quarter. Can you talk about that up 8% year-over-year on a cost per employee base? Is that something you look to continue in the back half of the year, or is there something that can maybe slow down on the increased cost?","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Well, Ken, the cost per employee was up in the second quarter as you noticed, and it was up for two reasons. One of them is the one we've been talking about all year, and that's the 5% inflation, which is higher than normal inflation. And the other factor why in the second quarter the cost per employee was up was due to the incentive comp. And you should expect to see the increase in incentive comp continue in the third and fourth quarters.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch (US)","All right. Thank you.","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to talk a little bit about productivity and sort of the progress to the $100 million target that you talked about. Can you give us a sense of sort of how far along in that you are so far through the year and maybe some of the potential variability, the drivers in the second half of the year, particularly in a slightly lower or potentially meaningfully lower volume growth environment?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","We're making excellent progress in productivity. You saw Mike's data points there: record locomotive productivity; record fuel productivity; and across-the-board significant cost savings, as a result. So, we're going to continue to push. We're not done. We will continue to strive for ever better productivity performance in all of the areas where it matters most: employees; and locomotives; and fuel efficiency; and facilities and so on.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. I guess, trying to get a sense, do you think there's sort of upside potential to that $100 million? I don't know sort of how you're thinking about sort of the ability to \u2013 I know you talked about it being continually adjustable, but just kind of curious about that.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah, we think we'll be able to do better than the $100 million.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Appreciate it. And then a quick follow-up on coal, and specifically, thinking about sort of the export market. Alan, you mentioned sort of an increase in the seaborne prices. When you think about sort of the second half or maybe more specifically about the third quarter, should we see yields in coal collectively, kind of mirror what we saw in the second quarter? Just trying to get some sense around that, because there's been some volatility with the mix of your business; and sort of exports, when they're moving and when they're not.","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Hey, Chris, very good questions. So, the seaborne price in the second quarter of the year was closer to about $200 a metric ton; now, it's closer to $175. And so, within export, there will be pressure on pricing, although we still expect and are confident that it's going to be up year-over-year. The rest of the impact on RPU is going to just be highly dependent upon the mix within our utility franchise, and whether we handle more U-South or more U-North. Last year, we were handling \u2013 about 55% of our utility coal was U-South, which tends to be longer-haul and higher-rated. This quarter, it was about 50\/50, so that puts pressure on RPU also.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And 50\/50 is probably a good number to use going forward for this year?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","It's going to be dependent on the weather, Chris.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks, and good morning. Maybe to follow up first on that last question. I wanted to ask about your expectation for consolidated RPU going forward. I know there a lot of moving pieces, but when you think about export coal likely to moderate sequentially, intermodal looking like it will be the leader in terms of near-term volume growth. Just from a directional standpoint, do you think that RPU ex fuel can still be up year-over-year in the second half?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","I think, we've given you a lot of inputs on it, Justin. If you look at our RPU for our seven major commodity groups in the second quarter, it was up between 2% and 5%, and our total RPU was up 1%. So, it's heavily influenced by mix. I've given you some guidance on our utility coal volumes, our export coal volumes, what we're seeing in intermodal, and what we're seeing in merchandise. So, we're very confident in our approach to pricing and the level of year-over-year price increases we get. The overall RPU for the corporation that falls out is going to be heavily dependent upon those mix factors.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And maybe to follow up on some of the market share questions earlier. I was curious if there were any major contract wins or losses during the quarter that we should keep in mind for the back half of this year in 2018? And then as a follow-up to that, looking out over the next 12 months, how much of your total book of business do you expect to reprice?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Hi, Justin. As I talked about, any market share shift that we've seen so far in the early stages is pretty minimal. It's there, but it's minimal. So far, for this year, we've got \u2013 about 80% of our revenue is committed. Most of what is uncommitted so far for the remainder of this year is in export. And in any given year, we're going to renegotiate about 50% to 60% of our revenues.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Great. That's really helpful. I appreciate the time today.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your questions.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to go back to coal for a moment. And I know it's difficult to forecast out, but you've given us good color into the back half of the year. As you're situating and talking to your customers about 2018 and kind of assuming no significant changes in weather patterns, how are stockpile levels among your customers that would give you indication as to just directionally on both export and domestic utility? Do you expect it'd be higher, lower, or about the same compared to the 2017 levels?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Walter, good question. So, right now, stockpile levels at utilities that we serve, and this is a publicly available number, are about 15 days below where they were last year. However, we recognize they're still 21 days above target. So, we've made a lot of improvement over the last 12 months in the stockpile levels. June was very mild, and that significantly impact coal burn to the negative.","Last year, in June, stockpiles dropped by about six days. This year, they only dropped by about one day. So, as I think, about the outlook going forward, July has been hot. Natural gas prices, while down versus June, are still up above where they were this time last year. And so, it's going to be heavily dependent upon how the rest of the summer weighs out in terms of load demand and natural gas prices. And that's just a function of the fact of coal being a load follower.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Right. So, too early to tell even directionally, which way you see coal going in 2018?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","It's going to be heavily dependent upon how the summer plays out. We had a very, very hot summer last year, and that really benefited our volumes and our utility coal franchise through the second half of last year and through the first quarter of this year.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. Just housekeeping now for Marta. Other income run rate, I know it moves around a lot. Is there even an annual number? I know you kind of dipped down last year from $100 million down to $70 million and now maybe turning back up at around over $100 million. Is there kind of a run rate even on an annual level we can plug in there? And also, tax rate going into 2018. Are you seeing any major changes in the guidance you've given for this year going into 2018?","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Well, Walter, you have it about right. And looking at last few years' estimate, about $100 million. As you know, there's a lot of different pieces in there. So, estimating that for the annual is probably the best thing you can do, looking at the recent years' average. And then what was your question?","Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","And there's tax where you've been guiding us at kind of around 36%, but longer term you talked a bit about 37%. So, we're using a 36% for the back half of the year and 37%, 2018 and beyond. Is there any reason why we should change that?","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","I'm glad you asked that question, too, because you should be using a 37% for the full year. And it has been lower in the first half for the reasons we discussed in the first quarter. In the third quarter, we expect an increase above 37%, because there's a State Tax Law change, which is increasing their income tax rate, and therefore, we expect to have about $13 million of additional, because we have to adjust our deferred taxes. So, when you work that into the mix for the full year, we expect the rate to be about 37%.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's great. And 37% into 2018 as well?","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yes, sir.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for taking my question. And congrats, Marta.","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Thank you.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Would be nice. So, I wanted to come back to the first question on this call, Jim, or maybe even Marta, on the sequential outcome in OR. If I look back maybe last five or six years, I think you guys are averaging a back half OR that's down maybe a 100 basis points to 200 basis points sequentially. But you guys did talk about sequential declines in metals. We've talked about the coal situation with exports most likely coming down, and head count being flat from here. I mean, should we think that, that normal relationship holds this year, or do those items potentially mean it's less or more?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","As I said, we do expect a lower second half operating ratio versus 2016. Now, quarter-by-quarter, things like the timing of real estate gains, which are difficult to predict, can tip the balance versus the prior year. And also, bear in the mind that in the third quarter of last year, we did have a significant real estate gain. Now, long term, it's all about growth and productivity, those will be the drivers of improved operating ratio and earnings.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Jim. And, I guess, following up from that, how important is volume growth in 2018 to maintaining the trajectory on OR improvement? Let's just say, we have another dull year and can't get hotter growth from the network, is that going to push plans back a bit? You've talked a lot about the dynamic plans, so what can be dynamic about it next year if we don't see growth for the industry?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Sure. Volume growth is certainly one piece of the puzzle. Pricing is another in the top line, and then it's all about expense control and driving productivity. We demonstrated the ability to drive productivity to the benefit of a lower operating ratio and earnings growth in 2016 when we didn't see much volume growth. And that's what we'll do again if that's the way 2018 plays out.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your questions.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yeah. Thank you. I wanted to drill down a little bit more on the merchandise portfolio. I think it's pretty well-understood the challenges you're seeing in auto, some of the challenges that you're seeing in another parts of that portfolio, but also, some of the growth you're seeing in the frac sand business. But if we can take a step back and maybe think about the industrial merchandise, the non-crude chemicals, the paper and forest products, that-kind of core industrial business, what's the outlook for these non sort of specific issues you're focused in? Do you think we'll see growth in those parts of the portfolio in the second half of the year, and what are you hearing from customers?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Bascome, what we're hearing from customers is there's optimism. Certainly, the plastics franchise will continue to be strong for us, as polyethylene plants come online. Lumber has been impacted by tariffs and kind of an inventory overhang. We think that'll unwind itself in the third quarter, but that'll put pressure on third quarter volumes. Ag is going to be dependent upon crops. We participated in soybean exports last year. Now, while that's less than 0.3% of our overall revenue, we're probably not going to have as much of a soybean export program this year, because South American production has been so strong.","Generally though, if you look at things, industrial production has improved each of the last five months, and manufacturing seems to have firmed. So, longer term, we're focused on growing this part of our franchise, that's why our industrial development department is so critical to what we do. And you heard Jim talk about it. Our pipeline is very robust for new projects, probably more robust than it's been since the Great Recession. Now, that won't necessarily drive volumes this year, but that's longer-term growth opportunities. To us, that indicates confidence on the part of our customers in the economy and confidence on the part of our customers and doing business with Norfolk Southern over the long term.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","I appreciate that comprehensive answer there. Just wanted to clarify. I think you said you expect merchandise volumes to be down low to mid-single digits year-over-year in the third quarter. Can you just confirm that? Go ahead.","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah, Bascome, that's what I said.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yeah. And if I look sequentially, that implies a little weaker quarter-over-quarter trend than you typically see in the book as a whole. Is that just a function of some of the auto pressure, is there something else going on there, or maybe even some conservatism?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah, Bascome, that is a function of the auto pressure. It's also, as I noted, second quarter steel volumes were benefited from a slight inventory rebuilding. And you've seen steel prices and capacity factors pulled back in May and June. Now, they've improved a little bit in July, so we'll see how that plays out. But it also reflects a little bit of pressure on steel in the third quarter.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please, proceed with your questions.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys.","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Scott.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","So, just wanted to follow up there just on this kind of auto, steel discussion. Obviously, we can see that auto is 9% of your total revenue this quarter. But when you think about the derivatives that go into the auto sector, what percentage of your total business do you think is tied to autos? And as we think about autos and steel, and maybe some of the other derivatives falling in the back half, should we think about those as having higher or lower than normal incremental margins?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Scott, there are some inputs into it. Certainly, carbon black or plastics or steel are the primary ones. Auto doesn't make up a material portion of our volumes in those groups, but if there's a pull-back in auto, that'll have a little bit of pressure in those markets.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","But is there any way to say like so, yeah, direct autos are 9% of the business, but we add up all the derivatives that total exposure to autos is 15% or 20%, I don't know, is there any way that you could just try and help put that in perspective?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","It's not a material number.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","You're saying not materially above the 9% that we can see that's directly auto?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Right. It does have an impact, but it's \u2013 you've noted a 9% to 15% or 20%. It's not in that range.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Okay, good. And then just on the utility coal side, utility coal volumes were up 23% in the second quarter. It looks like the guidance for the third quarter is that utility coal is going to be down year-over-year. I'm surprised down, just given that you still have the contract win from CSX. So, did we hear that right, and given that dynamic and then what you talked about on the export side, do you think RPU and coal is positive or negative in aggregate in the third quarter?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Scott, you did hear that right. That's exactly how I guided. If you recall, third quarter of last year, we saw a significant jump in our coal volume sequentially from about 15 million tons in second quarter of last year to over 18 million tons in the third quarter of this year. That benefited from a very hot start to the summer, including June. We haven't seen that this year. And so, that puts pressure on our utility coal volumes in the quarter.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","And then just \u2013 so, given that dynamic of utility coal down, export up, but export rates falling a little bit. In aggregate, do you think coal RPU is positive or negative year-over-year in the third? I know you said exports positive, I'm just trying to think in aggregate for coal?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","We won't guide the specific RPUs in specific markets on a quarterly basis, but you've got all the right thoughts there in terms of the moving parts.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. All right. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it. And best of luck to you, Marta.","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your questions.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.","Thanks very much, and good morning.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Good morning.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.","Wanted to ask a question about your strategy of integrating more closely with customers across the supply chain. Can you talk about how broadly you're approaching that? Have you started with a few key customers, or a few key business lines, or is it more general than that?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Well, we did begin by doing some focus groups with key customers across various parts of our business. And then we have taken that feedback, along with feedback we have received from a bigger group of customers. And some of that feedback has been informal, as we've been out there meeting and talking with our customers; some of it has been more formalized.","We took all of that. We have been working on redesigning our customer interfaces, our equipment strategies, sitting down with the customers about service parameters. What do you consider to be service excellence? Well, that's what we are going to try to deliver. And so, it's been a very broad-based and comprehensive effort to taking our customers' feedback, to understand their service needs, and to redesign our network around what they want.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.","And just by way of a quick follow-up, as we go forward, how do you plan to internally measure success? Is it economy plus growth or some other metric?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Well, a couple of dimensions there, certainly, one measure of success would be how we are doing from a service standpoint relative to the shared KPIs we have developed with our customers. And then, we will recognize success in both top line growth and margin expansion \u2013 margin expansion and bottom line growth. I mean, that's the key, obviously, is to garner revenue growth that translates to better margins and a better bottom line.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you for the time, and my best wishes to Marta as well.","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Good morning.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I just had a quick one on PTC, Positive Train Control. If you can just give us a sense of where you are this year in terms of OpEx and D&A. What's in the 2017 numbers? And when you look forward to 2020, obviously, there's still a lot of moving parts, the system's being developed and tested, but I imagine you have some idea what's baked into your 2020 guidance. So, can you just kind of give us a starting point where you're at now and where you expect that to settle in 2020 when the system comes online?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Well, let me comment on the state of implementation, and then I'll turn it over to Marta to address the expense components. So, we're making excellent progress on PTC. We do expect to meet the deadlines and have the system fully installed next year. And then, we will begin then to turn it on across the board. So, everything is going very well in terms of the implementation. Longer term, we're seeing an opportunity to utilize PTC in various ways. So, that's all a good thing.","Now, Marta, why don't you talk about the expense components of PTC going forward?","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Certainly, well, the first thing to note is that the PTC-related costs are included in our long-range guidance. And so, Mike's folks have estimated what they think the cost will be associated with that and has included it in all of our plans. So, now, with regard particularly to this year, we expect that we'll have \u2013 we have included in depreciation, probably about $60 million. Going forward, upon total completion, it'll probably be about $100 million, but again, it's in our expectation.","With regard to the maintenance cost, the way his team is approaching that is to include the PTC maintenance for the years going forward as part of our overall maintenance budget. So, we don't have a specific number for that, because they're integrating the work in with their other work. Mike, do you have anything to add to that?","Michael J. Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","No, but from a dollar standpoint, it's not a material increase in those costs. But again, it's already...","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Because, you're incorporating it into...","Michael J. Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah, incorporated into, and it's already in our 2020 plan.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So, it sounds like the biggest increases then come from just depreciating the assets that you're putting into place, and you feel like part of the maintenance you can kind of leverage with what you're already doing on the network?","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yes. I mean, it certainly has additional extra work with it, but they're going to incorporate it with it. And going forward, of course, for reporting purposes in the R-1 and so forth, we will break out the portion that's PTC. But, again, the important point that Mike and I are both making is that it is integrated with our plan.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up for Alan. You talked about the trucking market getting tighter in 2018, and you posted record intermodal volumes this quarter. So, maybe if you can just talk a little bit more about the international side, some of the port activity picking up on the East Coast, investments being made, bridges being raised, that sort of thing, how those partnerships are progressing, and when you might expect to see some of that activity?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Hey, Brian, good question. We've got some great relationships with our steamship lines and our port partners. And we've benefited from the shift of volume from the West Coast to East Coast. Our imports through the East Coast are up 13% in the quarter. And so, we have seen already the benefit of that growth in volume and expect to continue to do so.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for your time this morning.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.","John Griffith Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. Good morning, everybody.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","John.","John Griffith Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And best wishes to you, Marta. Just wanted to ask a bit of a brain teaser on the RPU math. I think, Alan, you'd mentioned that of the top seven commodity groups, the RPU there has risen year-over-year somewhere between 2% and 4% depending upon the commodity group, yet the overall RPU growth is up 1%. Could you explain what I'm missing there in terms of that translation from a bunch of groups growing 2% to 4%, yet the overall is growing at only 1%.","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah. John, it's a mix impact. RPU is up between 2% and 5% for each of our seven commodity groups year-over-year in the second quarter. However, if a large percentage of your volume growth is in lower-rated intermodal, while intermodal RPU can be up 4%, it'll have a drag on the overall RPU for the company. So, that's an important fact to remember as we look at RPU. It isn't always reflective of price or of value to the corporation.","John Griffith Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. That is very helpful. And then just maybe a follow-on regarding the PTC line of questioning, a couple of questioners ago. As you look out, it's pretty clear that you planned out through 2020 and maybe beyond. As that PTC CapEx begins to fall off and you have gotten the network into great shape and made a lot of the operational changes that you're going through now, where do you see the sort of long-run CapEx settling out as a percentage of revenue? There is one railroad you're aware of, I'm sure, that has targeted sort of a 15% number. Is that a sustainable number and reasonable to apply to Norfolk Southern, or do you have a different dynamic at work?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Well, John, post-PTC, we do see CapEx coming down somewhat as a share of revenue, for example. Exactly where that lands, I think we'll have to see. Really, there's no fixed ideology there. Our goal is to invest as much as we possibly can and generate shareholder value and appropriate return on capital. So, that's the goal, but as much, but not more than we can, while generating excellent returns. So, I think we'll see. It's likely to come down post-PTC, but again, it's really all about paying close attention to the return on capital, make sure we're generating an appropriate return and investing just enough to do that.","John Griffith Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Sounds terrific. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning. Alan, maybe, when you talk about the tightening of the truck market, as you think about how that's going to impact core price, and maybe even volume a little bit, when should we start to expect that to come in if we see this sort of sustained tightening of the truck market that some of the truckers are talking about right now? When should it show up in the Norfolk P&L or core pricing metrics?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","David, I believe that'll start to show up in 2018. It'll have to be reflected through trucking bid season later in the year, and then so we'll start to see it in our contract negotiations later in the year and into next year. Potentially, we could start to see it in volume later in the year, but you'll see it in pricing in 2018.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And then maybe just a quick follow-up. I think, in talking to some guys who are on the coal field, there is a little bit of speculation that the recent uptick in the met coal settlement is a result of U.S. miners maybe not having the capacity to just pull out more production for met. Are you hearing anything about the supply constraints kind of restricting availability of U.S. met coal exports, or is that something that you feel your customers are going to be able to respond to if demand stays strong?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","I think, a lot of what we've heard is it's a result of the increase in Chinese steel production. And the Australians have taken some production offline, they guided to that. We're going to continue to watch production. And David, to your point, production is going to limit probably our export volume in the second half of the year.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","But that should still give you an ability to kind of benefit from the price without the volume, though, right?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yes.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Right.","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","It will.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I will turn the floor back to Jim Squires for closing comments.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Well, thank you, everyone, for your questions today. We look forward to speaking with you again in October.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

It\u2019s my pleasure to welcome you to our second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With me today are several members of our senior team, including our President, Jim Squires; our Chief Marketing Officer, Don Seale; our Chief Operating Officer, Mark Manion; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart.","I am very pleased to report that Norfolk Southern's second quarter financial results set all time records across the Board. Earnings for the quarter were $1.79 per share, up 23%, compared with $1.46 we earned in the second quarter of last year. These very strong results reflect a substantial increase in demand, coupled with our continuing effective cost control.","Overall traffic was up 8%, reflecting a double-digit rise in intermodal, along with increases in both merchandise and coal. These strong volumes resulted in record revenues, which topped $3 billion, a $240 million or 9% increase versus last year. Don will fill you in on all of the details of these gains in a few minutes.","At the same time, our expenses were up only 3% despite the volume surge and some continuing slow down in our network velocity. Our resulting 66.5% operating ratio set an all time quarterly record.","To put the volume growth in perspective, our weekly volumes averaged about 153,000 loads in the second quarter of this year, compared with only 141,000 loads on average in last year's second quarter. In fact, we only saw volumes exceed 150,000 loads in two weeks, up all of 2013 and in contrast we have seen only three weeks of less than 150,000 loads since the last week in March of this year.","Now going immediately from the severe winter weather that we experienced to this kind of volume growth has obviously created some challenges for us, but our operating team has clearly risen to the occasion. Our network continues to be fluid and stable, although our service metrics are not yet back to last year's level. Mark will give you the numbers as well as describe our initiatives to improve network velocity.","While the network slowdown in our recovery efforts did give rise to some added cost, our overall expense control was strong and Marta will go over all of the financials with you in more detail.","To sum it up, it was a great quarter for our company and while we don't necessarily see the same kind of volume growth being sustained for the balance of 2014, our results show the strength of our franchise and our potential for ongoing improvement. In recognition of this potential, I am also very pleased that our Board increased our dividends yesterday by $0.03 per share or 6%.","And on that note, I'll turn the program over to Don, Mark and Marta and then I'll return with some closing remarks before we take your questions. Don?","Don Seale","Thank you, Wick and good morning, everyone. The second quarter of 2014 as Wick stated was Norfolk Southern's first $3 billion quarter, with revenue growth of $240 million or 9%, compared to second quarter of last year. Revenue in all three primary business units increased with intermodal up 11% followed by merchandise at 8% and coal up 7%.","With respect to the quarterly revenue variance, our volume increase of almost 145,000 generated $221 million in addition revenue, while improved pricing and positive fuel surcharge revenue largely offset the negative mix effect of having higher volumes of intermodal traffic.","Turning to the next slide, despite higher intermodal volumes, our overall revenue per unit increased by 1% in the quarter with steady price increases among most business units. Coal revenue per unit was up 5%, due primarily to longer lengths of haul for utility coal, which offset the negative mix effect of lower volumes of export coal.","In our merchandise segment, RPU was up 2% in spite of negative mix effects from higher short haul movements in the metals and construction and agricultural product segments.","Lastly, our intermodal sector experienced positive pricing, which was offset by the negative mix effects of increased international volumes, which have lower revenue per unit characteristics compared to domestic shipments.","Now turning to the details of our volume for the quarter, total shipments increased 8% due primarily to increases in metals and construction, intermodal, coal, crude oil, natural gas liquids and housing related commodities.","Intermodal volume was up 11%, driven by organic growth and new business and international coupled with continued strength in our domestic market and highway conversion programs.","Our merchandise market also experienced strong growth led by our metals and construction franchise, which was up 13%, followed by chemicals up 7% and agriculture at 5%. Volume growth of 9,000 units in coal was primarily from increases in the utility sector, which were offset by decreases in our export traffic.","Turning to the next slide, focusing on our individual market segment starting with coal, coal revenue was up $46 million or 7%, which was our first quarterly revenue increase in coal since 2011. This gain was led by our southern utility business which grew by 23%, partially offset by a 3% decline in northern utility volume.","The utility coal demand has improved as a result of higher natural gas prices and stock pile replenishment coming out of a harsh winter. The eastern utility stock piles remain down by 18% compared to December 2013 levels.","In the export market segment, volumes were down 13% as thermal supply competition remains very strong in Europe. The API 2 index to Western Europe is currently in the $70 range, pushing U.S. thermal coals out of the market.","Export metallurgical coal is also being impacted by weak seaborne pricing and strong Australian competition. In our domestic metallurgical coal market, we saw a 7% decline in our volume compared to the second quarter of last year as the steel market remains oversupplied and we experienced the impact of two plant closures in Canada. Finally, industrial coal volumes increased by a strong 24, due primarily to new business gains.","Now let's turn to intermodal. Intermodal revenue in the quarter increased by $62 million or 11% to $650 million, which is an all-time high record for this high growth business segment. International shipments grew by 16% due to strong general market expansion, new projects and advanced shipments ahead of the ILWU labor contract negotiations at West Coast ports.","The increase in our domestic volumes continues to be driven by highway conversions across all of our business segments. We're seeing organic growth in our large key accounts as well as increased use of intermodal by recently acquired premium and truck load customers.","Our targeted quarter initiatives, which we've discussed with you in the past, coupled with associated infrastructure improvements made over the past 10 years are providing the necessary tools to grow our business efficiently and profitably and we're continuing to work on increased velocity and performance across this best-in-class intermodal network.","On Slide seven, we focus on our merchandise markets, which in the quarter increased by $132 million or 8% to $1.7 billion, metals and construction led this growth with 13% more volume generated by higher volumes of frac sand shipments to the Marcellus and Utica shale regions.","Growth in the imported slabs through our East Coast ports and also increased coil steel due to continued strength in the automotive sector. The 5% gain we saw in agriculture was driven by year-over-year improvement in shipments of corn, due to increased demand and processing, primarily for ethanol production. Additionally, expanded export activity led to higher volumes of soybeans and wheat.","In our chemical franchise we continue to see increases in crude by rail, natural gas liquids and other chemical commodities used in growing automotive and housing markets. Automotive car supply constrains across the North America network moderated automotive volumes in the quarter. But as shown on the chart, our automotive volumes increased by 3% in the quarter despite these challenges.","Lastly, volume within our paper clay and forest products group was down 1% for the quarter, due primarily to the impact of the recent closure of an international paper mill in Northern Alabama. On a positive note, these declines were largely offset by continued strength in the wood products markets for both lumber and wood chips.","Now let's conclude with our outlook for the balance of 2014, we remain optimistic that we'll continue to generate growth across most of our business units. The utility coal shipments are expected to be up throughout the rest of the year, as gas prices remain elevated and stock piles are replenished, but overall coal volumes will be tempered by weaker export met and thermal coal market conditions along with lower domestic met coal shipments.","Turning to intermodal, as truck capacity tightens, we anticipate continued volume growth and pricing opportunity in our domestic network. For example, in our rail-owned domestic container segment, we successfully increased transcon rates 4% on June 1st and will be taking a 3% increase on our local EMP freight effective September 1. These two business segments together represent 17% of our total domestic intermodal book.","We also expect continued volume increases in our international intermodal business, but we expect the pace of growth in this sector to moderate somewhat in the second half.","In our merchandise businesses, we expect growth across most market segments. In chemicals, crude by rail continues to be strong. Last year, as you'll recall, we handled approximately 75,000 car loads of crude oil and we expect our full year 2014 volume to be well in excess of 100,000 car loads with substantial opportunity for continued growth in 2015.","And natural gas related commodities such as frac sand and liquid petroleum gases are expected to continue to increase as well. In metals, U.S. steel production is projected to increase 3% for this year and we continue to see growth across most of these markets.","In automotive, our automotive volume should continue to improve as car supply becomes more fluid and production increases by over 4% this year. In our agricultural markets, favorable growing conditions for another robust soybean and corn crop should lead to strong year-over-year gains ahead.","Lastly, with housing starts expected to grow by 15% this year, we expect continuing volume increase and housing related commodities such as plastics for carbon, soda ash going into the manufacturing of glass, steel for appliances, synthetic gypsum for wallboard and in asphalt and aggregates for paving.","In summary, to wrap it up we expect continued volume and revenue growth ahead across most of our intermodal and merchandise market segments and in utility coal in the second half. With respect to our yield management plan, as we've shared with you in the past, we remain committed to providing improved service to our customers that supports our ability to price to market at levels that equal or exceed rail inflation and which supports further investments in our network.","Thanks for your attention, and I'll now turn the mic over to Mark for his comments on our operations. Mark?","Mark Manion","Okay. Thank you, Don. For the second quarter, operations were definitely affected by the very positive traffic growth on the heels of a difficult operating environment in the first quarter, the higher volumes presented a new set of challenges for our operations and slowed our progress in returning the network to targeted service levels and network velocity.","However, it did demonstrate that we have a physical capacity in the network for future growth. It also pointed out that going forward, we need to find ways to respond more quickly to changing market forces, particularly with respect to train and engine employees.","Turning to Slide two for a review of safety performance, we saw solid improvement in the second quarter, reportable personal injuries dropped to 0.88. For the first six months, the injury ratio stands at 1.19. Furthermore, our serious injury has not increased.","We also saw improvement in the rate of train incidents in the second quarter, down to two incidents per million train miles. For the first six months, the train incident rate is 2.3 per million train miles. Crossing accident rates were up slightly to 3.8 per million train miles for both the second quarter and the first half of the year.","Results traded on Slide three our composite service metric improved modestly from 73.4% in the first quarter to 74.5% in the second quarter, but remains well below the high service levels of 2012 and 2013. For the first six months, the service composite was 74%.","Our network has remained very fluid with no significant bottlenecks due to physical constraints; however, service performance and network velocity remained below targeted levels due to accrue base that was planned for lower traffic volumes. Based on recent business growth trends and an updated business outlook, we've stepped up hiring and training in order to align T&E forces with expected volumes.","Looking at employment for the total company during the second quarter, we had about 900 fewer employees versus full year 2013 average. With the additional T&E hiring, we expect that we will ramp back up to the 2013 employment level by the end of 2014.","Train speed shows similar trends and for the very same reasons. In the second quarter train speed fell to 21.8 miles an hour for the first six months of 2014 train speed was 22.4 miles per hour. In addition to the efforts in crew hiring, we also pressed on locomotive availability.","Not only did we have all our seats surge fleet deployed, but we also stepped up repair activity to increase the total number of available locomotives. As Marta will discuss with you, this resulted in higher costs, but it was well worth to assist in the recovery.","This point is illustrated by our next slide of our dwell times. As you know terminal dwell is the second major component of network velocity and it improved by 6% from 25 hours in the first quarter to 23.4 hours in the second quarter. Terminal dwell remains above the high performance levels in the last couple of years and we will also improve over coming months with improved crew availability.","Moving to the next slide, with a volume increase of 8% in the second quarter, crew starts actually declined by 1%. This margin of difference is in part due to conserving crews through train combinations and train enrolments.","However, we would still see a very positive margin even with a more robust crew base. Our current crew base is clearly stretched, which is reflected in higher overtime hours and increased re-crews up 20% and 23% respectively for the second quarter compared to the same period last year.","With the hiring plans I outlined, network velocity will improve over the coming months and we\u2019ll see that improvement reflected -- and further improvements in operating efficiencies, particularly reductions in overtime and re-crews.","Higher volumes were largely absorbed with the existing train operation resulting in a 4% improvement in carloads per locomotive. Our fuel utilization was also favorable as gallons per 1,000 gross ton miles declined by 4% compared to the same period last year.","Thank you and I would like to take just a minute to recognize all of our operating department employees. The first and second quarters presented different, but very difficult operating challenges. As always, our people rise to meet every challenge.","That\u2019s the Norfolk Southern spirit and Marta, now I turn it over to you.","Marta Stewart","Thank you, Mark and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s take a look at how all of that strong volume translated into second quarter financial results.","As shown on Slide two and as Wick and Don already mentioned, our operating results were strong. Railway operating revenues of over $3 billion rose $240 million or 9% versus 2013, while operating expenses increased only $57 million or 3%. This improved leverage, resulted in a best ever quarterly operating ratio of 66.5.","The next slide shows the major components of the $57 million net increase in railway operating expenses, which as you can see, were largely concentrated in materials and other and in fuel. Now, let\u2019s take a closer look at each of these variances.","The materials and other category increased by $35 million or 16%. About $20 million of this was due to higher casualties and other claims as the prior year had a large favorable personnel injury adjustment.","In addition, about $10 million of the increase is related to higher material usage, primarily for locomotive repairs. As Mark discussed, our search fleet is fully deployed. As you would imagine, those locomotives typically require more maintenance.","In addition, we had some spillover of locomotive work related to weather issues from the first quarter. With the anticipated demand that Don described, we plan to continue to use those older locomotives in the second half of the year. Therefore, you can expect a similarly elevated level of material spending.","At displayed on the following slide, the $17 million or 4% increase in fuel expense was almost entirely due to higher consumption. Gallons used were up 4% on the 8% increase in traffic volume.","Next, depreciation expense rose by $12 million or 5% reflective of our larger capital base. As shown on the left hand side of the slide our fixed assets before depreciation are $1.3 billion higher than this time last year.","Slide seven addresses the $4 million or 1% rise in purchase services and risks. Most of this increase was due to higher volume related cost, in particular equipment rents, joint facilities and intermodal terminal cost. Somewhat offsetting these volumetric increases were lower professional service fees as well as lower expenses associated with the shared asset theory.","Slide eight details the $11 million or 2% decrease in compensation and benefit cost. As we previously discussed, the first quarter amendment to our retiring medical plan along with strong equity returns in 2013 and a lower discount rate resulted in a decline of about $40 million in post retirement medical and pension accruals.","In addition, health and welfare benefit costs were slightly lower for the quarter. Partly offsetting these declines were higher incentive compensation, increased pay rates and increased overtime. The higher incentive comp was due to bonus accruals related to the strong operating results as well as to higher stock-based compensation.","Overtime increased by $9 million and was mostly incurred in two areas of our workforce, employees who operate our trains and employees who repair equipment, principally locomotives.","We expect a somewhat elevated level of overtime for the remainder of the year. As Mark described, we have already hired and will be continuing to hire train and engine employees. So the overtime in that area should gradually moderate as the employees become qualified.","Slide nine depicts our second quarter income from operations. With revenues up 9% and expenses up just 3%, the operating margin expanded by 22% and exceeded $1 billion for the first time in the company\u2019s history.","Turning to our non-operating items, both categories were $11 million, unfavorable for the quarter. Other income net declined by 38% due primarily to reduced coal royalties associated with lower coal production. And interest expense on debt was up 9% due to the last year\u2019s debt issuances.","Slide 11 shows our bottom line results with record quarterly net income of $562 million up 21% compared to 2013 and deluded earnings per share of $1.79 up 23% versus last year.","Wrapping up our financial overview on Slide 12, cash from operations for the first six months was $1.4 billion covering capital spending and producing $628 million in free cash flow.","Although capital spending year-to-date is somewhat behind last year\u2019s pace, we still continue to project full year CapEx of $2.2 billion. Within this total amount, we have reallocated resources to acquire some used locomotives and to enhance capacity.","With respect to stockholder returns, we repurchased 100 million of our shares and paid $335 million in dividends. These dividends reflect a $0.54 per share amount paid in the first and second quarters.","As Wick mentioned, our Board yesterday raised the dividend rate to $0.57 per share, a 6% increase, which will begin with our September dividend payment.","Thank you and I will now turn the program back to Wick.","Wick Moorman","Thanks very much Marta. Well as you\u2019ve heard, we were obviously very pleased with our second quarter results. Clearly, there is still work to be done in terms of improving our network velocity and service levels and we\u2019ve a solid plan in place along with a great operating team to do just that.","But even with that slower velocity, I\u2019m very proud of the way that our team kept our cost in check, even in the face of a volume surge, the magnitude at which, quite frankly none of us saw coming.","Looking ahead, as you\u2019ve heard from Don while we still have some questions around coal and particularly export coal, we continue to see strong fundamentals in most of our businesses.","Looking even more broadly we believe that the U.S. economy will continue to recover at a reasonable, although not robust level for the balance of this year and next, which would also help us to continue our upward momentum.","There are some question marks on the regulatory front, most immediately concerning the transportation of crude oil, but I remain convinced that the U.S. rail system can transport crude oil safely and that the regulators understand and believe that as well and that they will not issue rules, which will seriously diminish our ability to do so.","I\u2019ll close by repeating again our core strategy at Norfolk Southern, which is to focus on delivering superior transportation service to our customers in the most efficient and effective way possible at prices, which reflect the value of that service in the marketplace and thereby deliver superior returns to our share holders. We\u2019ve the franchise and the team to execute this strategy and our second quarter results also prove that we are on the right track.","Thanks and I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Wick, I wanted to follow up on the last comment that you made with respect to crude by rail regulation. We\u2019ve recently been hearing some chatter actually that the DOT and PHMSA might put out, you know potentially even as soon as today or tomorrow, rules not only concerning the tank cars but also the speed limits and some of the numbers that we\u2019ve heard are a limit of 25 miles per hour.","I know that the industry has talked about 40 being the lowest that you could do, but let's just say that the is scenario is 25. What happens and how would -- how would the industry respond? Would you stop moving crude altogether or substantially decrease what you\u2019re moving?","Wick Moorman","Allison, it\u2019s a good question and we obviously do expect to see very shortly the regulators put out a notice of a proposed rule. There\u2019s a lot of speculation about what might be in that proposal, but there will then be the opportunity for all of us to discuss it before they come up with a final regulation -- and obviously speeds in the range that you mentioned, 25 0r 30 miles an hour would be extraordinarily disruptive to our rail network.","Not only to trying to ship crude in which the exposure quite frankly would go up significantly because it would take a lot more trains and cars to move the same amount of oil, but it would be incredibly detrimental to the service in all of the rest of our business including Amtrak and including our auto business, our intermodal business, you name it and the resulting capacity loss I think is something that the rail network quite frankly could not manage.","So we\u2019ve done a lot of modeling. We\u2019ve had a lot of discussion with the regulators and I believe that we\u2019ll be able to make our case that a minimum speed in the 40 to 45 mile an hour range is not only safe, which it is, but also is the range in which it will not be extraordinarily disruptive to the North American rail network.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Okay. So potentially we could see the -- the proposed rule come out with something more onerous than you guys would like but there is an opportunity to go back and revisit that.","Wick Moorman","They\u2019re clearly in the process. It will be a proposal and there will be as I said a comment period and a period for the rail industry to present evidence and we\u2019ll have compelling evidence that any significant speed restriction would be in fact disruptive to the point of almost shutting down the North American rail network.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Okay, that\u2019s a great color and just a follow-up question, I guess turning to coal; is it safe to say that the rate concessions on the export side are largely behind us or should we expect further rate cuts just as prices continue to be weak globally and at what point does it become uneconomical to continue making these downward adjustments and maybe instead you start reallocating some resources elsewhere since you\u2019re seeing growth across the business.","Don Seale","Good morning, Allison, this is Don. We believe as long as metallurgical coal prices in the world market remained in the 120 level and they\u2019ve been stable at the 120 level now for a couple of quarters, our export pricing is at the bottom and it's going to remain flat.","In the third quarter based on that I will tell you thermal API-2 pricing in Western Europe has deteriorated further. We do not plan to try to follow that coal or incent that coal with transportation pricing because frankly the delta is too wide for us to make much of a difference in that market.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Okay. Great. Thank you so much for the time.","Don Seale","Thank you, Allison.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs","Good morning. Thank you. Can you elaborate on what your corporation growth was in the second quarter?","Don Seale","We don\u2019t comment on what our core pricing results were. I will tell you that we\u2019re pleased to advise that it was in excess of our rail inflation rate and as we pointed out in the revenue per unit review in my remarks, we were pleased to see the results in our coal business with revenue per unit being up 5%.","Our merchandise business up 2% and our intermodal business even with last year even though our international business volume was up 16%, double the domestic rate of growth, and as you know our domestic intermodal as a about a third higher revenue per unit than our international business based on international containers moving. So we were very pleased with our pricing results in the quarter.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs","Okay. That\u2019s great. Thank you and then to what extent could you comment a little bit more about the coal pricing the domestic coal -- domestic utility coal versus the export side. Elaborate in terms of the trends we\u2019ve seen in the second quarter and particularly for the export coal.","Don Seale","Our trend in export coal in the second quarter was essentially flat with the first quarter. As I mentioned in the previous question, we don\u2019t see that moving now, we\u2019re pretty much at the bottom of the market and we don\u2019t have plans for any appreciable movement downward in our export market rates at this point.","In the utility market, I will tell you that most of our gain in RPU, revenue per unit, was attributed to longer haul coal that\u2019s originating in the Illinois basin and the Northern Appalachia Pittsburgh moving to our Southern utilities. That business was up 23% in the quarter and our business in the north was down 3%. So we had a very favorable extended haul result that drove our RPU and coal.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s great. Thank you very much.","","Don Seale","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Hey thanks. Good morning guys. So Don, just to follow-up on that last point about the coal yields, do you expect that mix of much better growth to southern utilities relative to north? Do you think that mix continues, is that a long term trend or is this something that\u2019s choppy and maybe not so sustainable?","Don Seale","Good morning, Scott. It\u2019s a good question and we\u2019re seeing a continued conversion of utility coal from Central Appalachia with higher cost of production to the Illinois basin and to Northern Appalachia and I will share with you in the second quarter our origination percentages, we were 34% Central App, 31% Northern App.","We were within 3% percentage points of Northern App now equaling Central App, which has been our traditional source of thermal coal, but the notable change was that the Illinois basin in the second quarter was now 19% of our thermal originations, which is three percentage points higher than the PRB originations coming to our network now at 16%.","So we\u2019re seeing Illinois basin growth take place and we\u2019re certainly seeing Northern Appalachia growth take place both into the Southeast. We expect that trend to continue.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","And is there something about riots more going into the Southeast than the Northeastern that should continue?","Don Seale","Well, the Southeastern stockpiles are at a level that they\u2019re being replenished coming off in the winter. We expect that replenishment to continue in the second half of 2014 and also higher natural gas prices have created a situation where thermal coal is dispatching at a higher rate in the South than it did this time last year.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Okay, great. And then just second question, when we're hearing about adding more people but hopefully overtime and things like that and it should come down and service gets better net-net should that mix change, should that be good for operating margins and incremental margins in the back half of the year. You typically see earnings improve in the back half and just wondering should that continue this year?","Marta Stewart","This is Marta. Scott, the overtime was about half and half occurred in the T&E and the non-T&E area. So the effect of the hiring that Mark described will reduce to moderate as the year goes on as these folks gets qualified. We'll reduce the T&E over time. We expect the non-T&E over time to continue right about this level through the end of the year.","Wick Moorman","Yes, Scott. This is Wick. I would say too that overall we know and we've done a lot of analysis that tells us that as network velocity improves, our cost come out and our expectation is that over some period of time through the second half into next year as that network velocity increases even with the additional employees and T&E, our overall cost structure should benefit from it.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Okay, so ultimately a good thing. Okay. All right, thanks a lot for the time guys.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Hi there. Good morning. Don, can I ask you to comment a little bit on some of the things you said in your preparatory marks, capacity we know is getting tighter. You mentioned that. It's getting tighter in the truck markets. We've seen that very clearly in a lot of data points.","How soon is it before we have to start to see some higher pricing for the rails simply to handle this demand right to try to create if you will some elasticity which I know there is very little and along those lines, how much is service a limiter and what you can do on price?","Don Seale","Good morning Bill. Let me take, I\u2019ll take the first part first, first part of the question first. We are seeing truckload capacity tighten. We have seen that trend take place now over the past 15 to 18 months. And it certainly is continuing to open up opportunities for us to improve our pricing for Intermodal where you know we still have a differential of 12% to 15% generally between Intermodal prices and truckload prices.","That\u2019s -- a good example of that is what I mentioned in my remarks looking ahead of us taking a 4% increase on our originated business going West on transcontinental and a 3% increase effective September first on our local EMP business as well. And that's 17% of our domestic book of Intermodal, which I think is indicative.","It illustrates the movement that's beginning to take place on pricing and Intermodal. We don\u2019t see any change or reversal in truckload capacity as long as the economic trends continue to move upward. And so we expect a more favorable pricing environment ahead and you will see us take more selective increases ahead with that.","Now with respect to the second part on service. As Wick mentioned and as Mark mentioned, none of us are satisfied with our service levels at this point. We are working very closely with all of our customers to work through any concerns and the issues until we can get our service back to where we expected and where our customers expect it.","But I\u2019ll tell you that with double-digit growth in most of our quarters including Crescent, Corridor and Heartland in the quarter service has not been an impediment to us handling our international business or continuing to have successful track record of converting highway freight to rail.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Very good. Wick, can I ask you one another question. And that is you probably saw the BN agreement with Smart on possibly moving to one man cruise if ratified on areas where they have PTC in place. Do you think that this is a possible game changer for the industry? I know PTC is far from operable, but as we get there is there something we need to keep in the back of our minds?","Wick Moorman","We certainly have seen that agreement. We are trying right now internally to work through all of the economics of that agreement to see what kind of impact something like that would have at Norfolk Southern.","It's clearly a sea change agreement. But I think it\u2019s -- we're a long way from understanding how the economics play out and as you say its PTC contingent and our best guess right now on when PTC is actually operational across the entire North American rail network is approaching 2020. So is it interesting, yes. Could it be significant, yes? Does it have any immediate impact, I don\u2019t see that.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Okay. That\u2019s great. Thank you for the time.","Wick Moorman","Thanks Bill.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Maybe a question for you Mark on the velocity side just looking edge you move through the second quarter and clearly there was volume growth I should say coming out of the winter. But as you saw the quarter progress, it seems like some of those matrix may be deteriorate a little bit towards the end of the quarter.","We've seen a recent bounce back here, but just want to get a rough sense of when we think we can start to see some more material improvement there and should we be focused on that? Is that something we need to be considering as we look for those matrics to improve and ultimately continue to drive what were very, very strong incremental margins in the quarter?","Mark Manion","Yeah. Chris. Realistically as we go through the third quarter there is going to continue to be a lot of pressure on the operation. We see a lot of volume. Third quarter is always a robust quarter anyway and it looks like this one certainly is going to be. So we are going to stay up against it and we are not going to see additional cruise that are coming into the operation in the third quarter.","We will start to see some -- we will put some additional locomotive power against it as we go into the third quarter. We are continuing as we have been -- we continue to march forward with improvements from additional infrastructure projects and they are very helpful. They have made a world a difference and we are certainly seeing that play up now. So we are going to hold our own, but we are not going to see a tremendous amount of improvement during the course of the third quarter.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate the color. And then Don just a follow-up on a question before, as you talked about the changing mix in southern utilities taking coal from different originations and ultimately have it playing out into the business. Can you just give us an update on where is southern and northern utility stock piles rest relative to historical or multiyear averages? Just want to get a rough sense of have we played this catch-up or how much is left to go until the second half of the year?","Don Seale","","Chris. You may recall that back in the first quarter after we came through the so-called Polar Vortex Winter, we, at the end of our first quarter we shared a number of stock piles and our network had come down by about one third.","We estimate now that we've worked off a portion of that reduction, but they are still down about 18% compared to December when we went into the weather and gas prices are still trending in an area of -- there are about 380, 390 Illinois Basin Coal, PRB Coal, and Northern App Coal will dispatch at those prices.","So stock piles have not been replenished. There are still some work to be done and as long as gas prices are in the range that they are at today or higher, we will see utility coal demand in the south and hopefully in the north pick up as well.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup","Okay. And those stock piles are relatively balanced between northern and southern utilities.","Don Seale","We see a little more opportunity right now in the south than we do the north, but I\u2019ll tell you that it's not much difference and as you know our utility volume is about 50-50 split between the north and the south.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for the time I appreciate it.","Don Seale","","Thanks Chris.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company","Good morning. gentleman. The first question is going to focus on the Intermodal side of things. Obviously we have seen you take some of the prices up on some of your book of business. But I think you mentioned it was 17% your domestic book. Can you talk to us about what percentages more of your domestic that you might be taking up in the near future, can you just do an across the Board tariff increase on some other segments of your business? Are there any larger contracts rolling over this year?","Wick Moorman","No, we have contracts in place with intermodal and we cannot do an across the Board increase. What we'll have to do is time those increases when the contracts make available the opportunity to do that. Quite a bit of our business is priced year-to-year. So as we get through this calendar year, that will open up additional opportunities for our partners in the intermodal market to take up pricing as well.","So this is a good start with our rail control containers, our EMP containers taking the 4% West transcon to 3% coming September 1st within local. You will see us take more, but it will be incrementally as contract open up and give us the opportunity to do that.","Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company","So it seems like more of a 2015 event then.","Wick Moorman","Yes, in those contracts I would point out that we do have escalators that apply until we get to the point where we can take a market based increase.","Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company","Okay. And follow-up is related to crude by rail, when you're looking at sort of the safety statistics and I know that part of the focus on this release is going to be on some of the train speeds, but of the accidents that we've seen sort of across the rail networks that have been highly publicized, how many were actually due to excessive train speed?","Wick Moorman","None to my knowledge.","Wick Moorman","Okay. That's what I thought. Okay guys, those were my two. I appreciate the time as always.","Wick Moorman","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Hoexter \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Great. Good morning. Congrats on pretty solid results and record operating ratio. Great to see that it continues. On the -- just a thought on, Mark on the capacity here, you're almost running at 2006 peak levels on a car load basis.","You mentioned how much you are up or I guess year-over-year, so you mentioned your thoughts on your ability to recover velocity with employees and adding the crews on, what about CapEx? Do we need to -- do you need to increase that? Is this is a physical capacity that you're starting to bump up against or I guess can you talk about what your thoughts are and may be Don your thoughts on throwing it on the crescent and hotline if you're starting to see that ramp-up on the capacity there as well?","Mark Manion","It has been very interesting to see how well we have digested the freight from -- the additional freight volume from an infrastructure standpoint and we just have not had bottleneck situations and like I commented some in the past on these calls, is the more than 10 years worth now of continual infrastructure improvement that just it takes place on an ongoing basis and there are a variety of projects that are loaded up in the pipeline and they keep coming out.","We've got more that will be completed and more that will be started, this has. So we're trying to stay ahead of it and so far we are staying ahead of it. We've got our -- we've got our modeling and our capability based on traffic forecast to see where the next tight spots will be and that's when we put the infrastructure projects up against them and that process has been working well.","So we're going to keep doing what we're doing and we got a major project, I think you are aware of coming out later this year, it will be in the fourth quarter when we have our Bellevue expansion that opens up and that is going to be very helpful to as far as lightening any capacity constraints up in our northern areas. So that's the way we're looking at it.","Don Seale","Ken, I would add, this is Don. I would add to that when you look at the composition of our growth in the quarter for example out of our 145,000 loads, 95,000 units were intermodal and we've done a lot of work to densify our double stack-up operations, get the right box on the right car and that helps us manage capacity much more effectively.","We're not adding trains in intermodal to handle the 95,000 additional units that we handled in the quarter. So that defecto is additional capacity and with respect to the quarters, the Crescent quarter I mentioned double-digit growth earlier, Crescent was up 11% in the quarter, Heartland was up 10%, Meridian was up 15% and because of what I just mentioned we're not -- we're not running into capacity issues at all in those quarters.","As I had also mentioned in my remarks, we've made the investments over a multi-year period in those quarters with speed enhancements and terminal operations, new terminals and frankly we're positioned for growth and we're planning for growth.","Ken Hoexter \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Great. Appreciate the insight and then secondly on your strong free cash flow, I guess two parts to that, one I guess we saw the dividend increase, why not more engaging on the share buyback given your large authorization and maybe Marta your thoughts on that.","And then also I think Marta you mentioned your buying used locomotives, are there any available out there, given everybody is using surge capacity and does that mean maintenance could go up even higher I guess given these are the bottom of the barrel ones that are left in the market if they're not already been on the network?","Marta Stewart","Well, with respect to the locomotives, yes, what I mentioned was that we've reallocated within the capital budget some of the funds towards used locomotives this year and our mechanical folks have inspected those and luckily we have the Juniata shop and they can refurbish those.","So we feel that we're in a very good position to be able to acquire those and those are small pockets of locomotives here and there that our purchasing folks can find and mechanical folks inspect and know that we can repair adequately at Juniata.","We already had -- before this reallocation, we already 75 new locomotives that we were buying this year 25 that come in and 50 will come in the back half of the year and that's why one of the reasons why our capital spending is backend loaded this year because those 50 will be coming in, in the last six months.","So with respect to your free cash flow question, you're correct, we're having very strong free cash flow. We've talked about the increased dividend. We have the strong capital spending this year.","We have been forecasting for the next two or three years, we're going to have heavy capital spending as we have some freight car purchases that are going to be timed in the next couple of years and so we feel that the share repurchase level that we have is appropriate given the free cash flow, given the capital that we feel is needed to reinvest in the system and which has good returns and really overlaying it all too is that the entire stock market is high and so we have in the past moderated our share repurchases when the stock markets is high.","Ken Hoexter \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Thanks for the insight. Appreciate the time.","Wick Moorman","Thanks Ken. Appreciate the kind words too.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays","Well, good morning, everyone and congrats as well. Wick, can I just ask you -- we've seen several quarters now of pretty robust margin expansion I think driven by some pretty good cost outcomes, you're getting the growth outside of coal and I realize we still have some questions going forward in your coal markets, but I think the big issue for investors in your stock is can this company sustainably grow earnings even with a segment like coal down let's say in 2015 if that were the case?","Do you feel like you have the confidence now, you are at a point where it doesn\u2019t necessarily matter what one commodity segment is doing on your network. You have a robust enough franchise now that you can maintain earnings momentum and margin expansion as long as the macro economies cooperating?","Wick Moorman","I think the overall answer to that is certainly yes. We have some work to do as we've discussed extensively in terms of continuing to improve productivity and efficiency from the levels we're currently at.","We're going to do that. I think that that's going to give us the ability to continue to drive more volume through the network in a very cost effective manner and give us strong operating margins -- operating leverage on that growth.","I think the only caveat and you mentioned it as well is that we're going to have growth. We see strength in a lot of our businesses as we've all discussed and as Don has really kind of worked through the details with you.","I think the only question mark about coal is it still is significant amount of our business and I know Brandon you\u2019re aware and everyone on the phone is of how much coal revenue we\u2019ve lost over the past two to three years.","I guess in excess or at least to close to $1 billion over a two-year period. If we see stability in that market and there\u2019re certainly lots of signs particularly in the utility world that we are seeing stability now. I think we\u2019re poised to do very well. If something unforeseen comes along in the coal world or in the overall macro economy, then clearly we'll have challenges too, but given the conditions that we\u2019re seeing today, we continue to see -- have a very positive outlook for our company in the next -- certainly in the second half and I think in 2015 as well.","Brandon Oglenski \u2013 Barclays","Well I appreciate that Wick and Don, maybe as a follow up, beyond intermodal because I know your thoughts about rate increases this summer, but are we -- because of the constraints that we\u2019re seeing across the system, not just at Norfolk, but it seems like some other carriers are at capacity as well on the rail side. Are we moving into a higher rate of price inflation for this industry?","Don Seale","Brandon, we always price -- try to price to market and we think -- we think the truckload market will continue to tighten and that will support pricing with anything that\u2019s related to truckload activity.","The rest of the business, we\u2019ll just have to stay tuned and see how the market moves. We\u2019re going to stay close to that market and we\u2019ll price to that and ensure that our yields meet our target of equaling or exceeding rail inflation going forward.","Wick Moorman","Brandon let me say one other thing. I think that we talk about capacity in the transportation marketplace, but Don always points out that there\u2019s truckload capacity and that\u2019s one marketplace but you know we -- we have a very different set of dynamics in utility coal where the competition\u2019s not with the highway, it\u2019s more and more with gas and different coal souring.","You look at the energy markets. The competition there has a very different set of factors, which aren\u2019t necessarily all driven just by what we see in the transportation marketplace. So every marketplace that we\u2019re in is different, has different dynamics and as Don always said we take that into account and try to price effectively in that particular marketplace.","Brandon Oglenski \u2013 Barclays","Thank you.","Don Seale","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin of RBC. Please proceed with your question.","","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks very much. Just following up on that last question, we\u2019ve heard some of your competitors are now talking about -- more about yield management programs and in fact at -- coming up with tight capacity in the rail system and in fact looking at pruning some of the lower returning customers.","Is that something that you foresee that perhaps without really rate increases per se but rather reallocating capacity to higher returning customers is that something that is new to your organization -- is it an opportunity that is emerging for Norfolk Southern? Is it something that you see playing out in the next -- next year or two?","Don Seale","Good morning, Walter. This is Don. We plan to continue to improve our service product to serve all of our customers. We do not have plans to segment business that would deviate from that overall objective. So I would say that our commitment to our customers is very strong and that\u2019s to provide a good reliable service at a fair price.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And second question here, I guess Wick you mentioned in your opening remarks that the first or the second quarter saw some volume that perhaps unsustainable for the rest of the year and I think lot of the questions today were -- were zeroing in on the fact that you typically do better in the third quarter than you do in the second. You had a very good quarter this second quarter.","So I guess what I am trying to understand is, is there -- was there carryover volume from first quarter to second quarter that really helped you drive some good operating productivity that -- that probably won\u2019t carry into third as market indicated with some of the higher -- higher count, employee count or is there -- is the incremental margin here that you\u2019re getting on this volume steady through third quarter, that the seasonal pattern of you doing better in the third quarter than the second quarter can hold again here again this year?","Wick Moorman","Well first of all in terms of first quarter carryover, we\u2019ve looked really hard at that question and quite frankly we -- as the second quarter went on we became more and more convinced that there was very little of that.","There is some -- has been some pent-up demand in the automotive network with vehicles stored at assembly plants because of the slowdown of the North American rail network and car supply problems for the automotive industry, we\u2019ve had a big push on in the past three or four weeks and Mark and his team has done a great job on our network of bringing those numbers down significantly.","I think of the tenure of remarks begin with is that we certainly didn\u2019t forecast an 8% year-over-year volume growth and we saw a lot of strength across a lot of businesses. We continue to see that strength, I was just I guess trying to temper my own enthusiasm and say I am not sure we\u2019re going to see the thirds quarter up 8% year-over-year or the fourth quarter we had a good second half last year but we do expect to see continuing strength in these businesses.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Well, it was very much a good quarter. Congratulations. Thank you.","Wick Moorman","Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long of Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Long - Stephens","Thanks and congrats on the quarter. I wanted to first follow up on an earlier question in intermodal, so intermodal growth has really started to accelerate. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about how much runway you still have to add to train lengths? How long can the high single digit or low double digit intermodal volume growth continue without adding additional train starts?","Don Seale","Mark, do you want to?","Mark Manion","Yeah I\u2019ll -- let me -- let me just lead off with a comment about that Don, our intermodal train length is in the neighborhood of 6,000 feet and so when we look at the -- when we look at our high density corridors as far as where we handle intermodal, we can handle -- we can handle significantly more than 6,000 feet, 8,000 at a -- 8,000 at a minimum and in lot of cases we run over 10,000 feet. So there\u2019 still a lot of room to grow in that area.","Justin Long - Stephens","Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful and as a follow up, I was wondering in coal, do you have any major contracts in that business that are coming up for renewal over the next couple of quarters or so?","Mark Manion","Justin, I will tell you that we have some opportunities that will be coming over the next three to three quarters and we\u2019re optimistic that those opportunities will bear fruit but we\u2019re not there yet.","Justin Long - Stephens","Okay. Great. I\u2019ll leave it at that. Thanks for the time.","Mark Manion","Thank you.","Don Seale","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","John Larkin - Stifel","Hey, good morning and thank you for the taking the question. Mark, I think you mentioned that you\u2019re planning on adding roughly 900 new folks throughout the remainder of 2014 to bring the manpower level up to roughly where it was in 2013. Are all those people coming of furlough, do they need complete training, partial training. How long does it take to bring them up to speed and how expensive is that process?","Mark Manion","We have earlier this year -- we began bringing people out of furlough. We were pretty successful in getting more people than usual to actually make some transfers from the location they were furloughed to other locations where they were needed.","That process is complete and going forward the additional people we bring on or new hires that go through our training program and we will see -- we'll essentially see the first of those people coming out qualified in the fourth quarter.","John Larkin - Stifel","Okay. Thank you. Perhaps another question on the reallocation that occurred in the capital budget maybe from Marta, it sounded as if some money was reallocated towards the purchase of used locomotives that could be remanufactured at Juniata and there were some bottleneck elimination projects perhaps in there as well. What projects did you draw that capital from and what was the thought process behind perhaps paring back the spending in that area?","Marta Stewart","Well, some of those areas were naturally delayed frankly because of the weather in the first quarter. Our engineering forces were busy with the weather and so there was a little bit of when you schedule out there work for the rest of the year a little bit over \u2013 flopped over into 2015. So some of it occurred naturally, both in engineering and some of it also in the mechanical area. There was some car work that it\u2019s going to flop over into 2015.","So the total amount that we reallocate was about $40 million. About two thirds of it used locomotives and about a third of it to very targeted, very specific locations that came out of that model Mark described. About very small pinch point, so the remainder of that is spread throughout the system in different places with sightings and that sort of thing.","John Larkin - Stifel","Very good. Thank you again.","Marta Stewart","Welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank","Hey good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Don, when I am thinking about the intermodal pricing opportunity you had highlighted, the 17% if I am thinking about that remaining 83%, I know you said basically over a full year the majority of that kind of comes up whether it\u2019s a rebid or it's just an escalator embedded in the contract. Can you give us a sense of what percentage is going to be re-pricing in the back half of this year with a new contract as opposed to an escalator?","Don Seale","Rob, I will tell you that the EMP fleet, the rail owned or rail controlled containers that I referenced with respect to the increases we\u2019re taking locally and westbound, that will be most of the increases we\u2019re taking in intermodal for the second half unless we\u2019re taking an increase in an existing contract with an escalator that triggers quarterly or triggers annually within the second quarter.","Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank","Okay. All right. That's helpful and then with regard to the Ag outlook I think your words were either strong or robust in terms of the back half of the year. How should we be thinking about that in terms of the third quarter and fourth quarter, because there are always their puts and takes with your network?","Don Seale","Yeah, with respect to the third quarter, we\u2019ll see the new -- new crop start to come in in late August or early September. So we will be end of that time frame before you see it. We still see a lot of volume activity associated with the 2013 crop, which was strong as well.","So we see opportunities ahead in corn and soybeans predominantly with this new crop. There\u2019s over 90 million acres of corn planted and over 80 million acres of soya beans planted and growing conditions are very good because they\u2019re getting the proper rainfall. So we expect export activity to be there and some other domestic opportunities as well.","Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank","We should think about that rippling through your ethanol franchise as well I would imagine.","Don Seale","Well the ethanol production, ethanol prices and ethanol demand continues to trend upward. So we see opportunity ahead for greater activity in ethanol and inbound corn for processing to make the ethanol.","Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank","Thanks so much for the time.","Don Seale","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","Thanks. Good morning. Summarizing the data correctly it appears you improved RTM per fuel gallon pretty nicely over the prior year period, almost 5%. As we think about sustainability of the quarter\u2019s low operating ratio and the importance of fueling the cost structure, maybe you could comment is this an idiosyncratic period as far as fuel economy or is this just another data point on the overall improvement trend line.","Wick Moorman","I think the way we would look at it and the way we do look at it is that it is just a data point on a trend line but it\u2019s a trend line that we expect to continue to get better over time. We have a lot of technology out there that we\u2019re employing to reduce fuel usage. That\u2019s ramping up nicely. We still have always to go with that the LEADER technology but it\u2019s employed across more and more the railroad and our goal is to drive on an average, the fuel usage per ton mile down. We\u2019re always going to see seasonal variations.","We certainly saw that in the first quarter particularly with the very cold weather, you\u2019ve to leave these locomotives idling, you run short of trains and you do a lot of things but we think it\u2019s -- we think it\u2019s obviously this quarter is a good productivity improvement and we expect overall to see our fuel usage go down in the future as our technology gets better and better.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","Thanks and for second question, I would like to ask a little bit about the intermodal volume increase, I know it\u2019s a phenomenon that probably occurred later in the quarter but could you comment on what portion of the volume increase you believe resulted from customers concerned with West Coast disruption risk?","And related to that does the summer\u2019s intermodal volume trend give any insight into your expectations concerning volume that may result from the completion of Panama Canal project. Thanks.","Don Seale","We have difficulty identifying the portion of the 16% increase in international that was directly attributable to the ILWU contract negotiation. We know it was present. We\u2019ve been told by customers that they were making some secondary arrangements for contingency plans.","So part of our increase of that 16% we know came from that. But frankly we\u2019ve also been seeing an ongoing trend of conversion of international shipments in our network from the West Coast ports to East Coast ports of entry with all water services. So we know that\u2019s a part of it.","Plus I have to remind you too that the Inland port that we opened in partnership with the Port of Charleston had a very good quarter. That\u2019s -- that's in that higher number plus we had a couple of new accounts in that quarter as well. So it\u2019s the combination of all of those things.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","Okay. Any insight on Panama yet or too early?","Don Seale","You know the Panama Canal -- our view and -- and of course our view is going to be basically predicated by what our customers decide to do and our customers are the steamship lines and the beneficial cargo launders that are working with the steamship lines but they\u2019re telling us that they don\u2019t see at this point in time a pronounced impact when the canal opens most likely now in 2016 because of so much activity that\u2019s already beginning to take place through the Suez Canal with larger vessels coming to the East Coast ports and as the freight originations in Asia continue to shift away from China and go southward toward Malaysia and Vietnam etc.","So we\u2019re being told at this point not to expect a significant shift in business when the canal opens. We just have to wait and see and of course we\u2019re staying close to our customers who will make the ultimate decision of how they want to move their cargos.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","Great. Thank you for the comments.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research","Thank you very much and thank you for taking my question. Congratulations, the quarter looked fantastic. Marta, I want to come back to the question Ken Hoexter asked on cash flow. I heard what you said, you have the debt coming up in September, I think it\u2019s about $430 million give or take.","I guess the question I have is you -- your cash balances are up almost $1 billion from where they were a year ago working capital is the whole increase has been cash. Even with the higher level of capital spend and some of the projects coming on and the debt payout you still look to be cash flow neutral. I hear you that the stock's up a lot with the market but is there a better use ultimately the reason to have a $5 billion, $6 billion of cash sitting on the books.","Marta Stewart","Well we don\u2019t believe -- we do have that now, you\u2019re correct. We don\u2019t believe we\u2019re going to end the year at that. As you\u2019ve pointed out we\u2019ve that $430 million debt maturity in September and we now currently plan to pay that off. So that\u2019s going to be a use of the cash and also as I explained earlier we have higher CapEx in the second half of the year so we do not expect to end the year at this high at the cash level.","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research","To be even with all that it -- it's still looks like you\u2019re going to finish close to $1 billion, $2 billion, $3 billion I mean that is above the normal amount of cash you hold. Is there like a 2015 project that you\u2019re thinking about?","Marta Stewart","Well, you\u2019re correct that that\u2019s above of what our historical norm, where we run cash. 2015 will have the heavy CapEx. We also hope that it\u2019s going to have the very strong free cash flow, which will support that. And so I think what we are trying to do is just maintain our discipline, keep an eye on the market and be ready to take advantage of any volatility that arises.","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research","Okay. Thank you very much.","Don Seale","Thank you, too.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Donald Broughton of Avondale Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Donald Broughton - Avondale Partners","","Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to kind of strategically get your outlook on this -- both UNCX certainly seen strong demand at least in your system in the short term you\u2019ve proven to be much more resilient then they have. After reporting a multi quarter performances of high volumes, lower headcount, I am hearing a prediction of higher overtime in the second half, but you also have strong safety performances.","So when you look into this you look as this is an opportunity to further leverage your assets and infrastructure with existing headcount or just slightly higher or do you think there is a greater opportunity and just materially growing the headcount and using the services disparity to gain real volume real market share?","Wick Moorman","Well, Don that's excellent question. The one correction or clarification I would make is what I think we expect in terms of overtime is just to see overtime rates year-over-year certainly in the third quarter dollars continue to be higher, but that I will also point out is in the contrast to in 2012 and 2013 we drove overtime way down compared to prior year. So we think we have the capability we will do that again.","I think it goes back to what Don talked about is that we have done a lot of analysis across our rail road, which has really proved to us that maintaining a high network velocity albeit it may take more resources in some way. It's certainly going to require some more crews as Mark pointed out, ultimately gives us a lower cost structure, total cost structure, and more efficient operation and in addition it gives customers the service that we want to give them.","So when we see our network running at the levels that it is today, we know it's still efficient and you\u2019ve seen the numbers and we think that we need to still bring on the resources, drive the velocity up, give the customers at services that's going to give Don and his folks more ability to go out and get more business. It's going to go out, allow them to go out and charge their prices in the marketplace for that, and it's going to give us a better cost structure.","And Mark reminds me that we said at the beginning of the year that we had a number of productivity improvements underway and that we estimate that it is the time that that would take about $100 million out of our cost structure and we still think we are going to achieve that number this year. So we think we got a good strategy, but it's a service and velocity based strategy and it's paid off for us in the past and it will continue to pay off for us.","Donald Broughton - Avondale Partners","","So your comments about overtime are really more of a reflex back towards what's more normal after making the kind of significant productivity and velocity gains you posted recently is what you are trying to say if I hear you right?","Marta Stewart","","The overtime that we think we are going to have for the rest of year is very targeted where we think it's going to occur. So let's split it into the two things.","On the T&E side, which is about half of it we think because of the need to train these people it's one of the other people ask about, those are not going to be qualified until the fourth quarter many of those new people. And so we don\u2019t expect the T&E overtime to decline until the fourth quarter, but we do expect to decline.","On the other side is our shop employee generally speaking and most of that has been incurred on the taking care of the older and now be used locomotive. So on that side, we are not projecting to significantly ramp up the number of employees because that is more of a shorter term in nature.","Donald Broughton - Avondale Partners","","Simple.","Marta Stewart","","Exactly.","Donald Broughton - Avondale Partners","","That makes it much, much more sense. Thank you,","Marta Stewart","","So that portion of the workforce will be -- will fade most over time, but the T&E will work itself back to stray time as the people get qualified.","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research","Thank you. And I look forward to seeing you next week.","Wick Moorman","Thank you. Look forward to it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.","David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein","Thanks for taking the question. Marta, just to kind of step back from the short term use of the cash and think more about the longer term, you mentioned the step-up in equipment power placement, is that something that you think could push the capital spending above that 18% to 19% of sales that we've been seeing in the last couple years?","Marta Stewart","For that, that 18% to 19% of revenue is an elevated level for us. I think we've signaled in last -- within the last year that we think we're going to stay at that elevated level for at least two more years, largely because of the power placement needs and longer term and of course PTC is elevating that too.","So right now, trailing 12 months we're at -- our 2.2 is at 19%, 2% of that PTC. So when you back that out and get 17% and when you get past the next two years, we are targeting after that to get back more in the historical range of 16%, 17% of revenue.","David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein","And given Wick's comments around PTC, maybe extending into 2020 with that 2% kind of continue to linger or is this going to be more front end loaded?","Marta Stewart","That we'll have to see how that plays out.","David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein","All right. Thanks, and maybe just as a quick follow-up on intermodal Don, you mentioned the escalators that are in the contract, would you have expected them to maybe deliver a little bit more on the wholesale contracts from a pricing perspective given the spike in truck rates or can you talk a little bit about how that lag or mechanism should work so they are being trying to gauge the opportunity going forward?","Don Seale","The escalators in our intermodal contracts would be more correlated to the rail cost adjustment factors all inclusive plus steel, which is an independent factor from motor carrier cost. So those escalators are not tied to truck load pricing in general.","David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein","So you haven\u2019t tied the intermodal pricing to your wholesale or to your retailers to the truck rate?","Don Seale","No, we do not in general.","David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein","All right. Thanks that's my follow-up. Appreciate the time.","Don Seale","Thank you.","Wick Moorman","","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question is coming from the line of Cleo Zagrean of Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Group","Good morning and thank you. In the opening remarks you mentioned that you were looking to price equal or above rail inflation. Can you help us understand how you think about pricing portfolio, how managed portfolio on pricing versus margins and this is where you were only able to price in line with inflation benefitting from more slag capacity such that margins had returns across the portfolio or even would appreciate any insight into that.","Wick Moorman","","Cleo, good morning. With respect to our pricing philosophy again, we look at the market segments and we try to maintain a direct correlation with our yield management plan and the various market segments that we're participating in and that runs the range of conditions from truck load capacity to barge capacity, conditions in barges, the availability of barges to a lesser degree than truck load and then rail to rail competition.","And then of course we always have an ongoing change in the mix of our business. So when you're looking at revenue per unit of our book, it will be an ongoing change in that book, based on things like the longer haul of coal that's taking place today and utility coal, the fact that for example in this quarter, we had no liquidated damages on coal, so the revenue of coal has no LVs in that.","So does that get the essence of your question?","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Group","I guess I was trying to make sure that we keep our eyes on the right metric in terms of the bottom line and do not get overly concerned if some mix issues at the topline could point to a deterioration. Is there any reason of concern to you that in some pockets you are only pricing in line with inflation versus say may be trying to price consistently above?","Wick Moorman","","You're making a very good point and we look at the overall margin and incremental margin on the business, the book taking into account the price mix and we're not -- we don't become concerned with mix changes. They are what they are and we manage through that and that doesn\u2019t impact also the yield management or pricing plan.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Group","Thank you. And my follow-up is also with regards to a comment you made in the opening remarks that from the experience so far this year, you have learned about new ways to adjust your resources to respond to changes in demand.","Can you help us understand whether some of the changes that you are making should help with the long term progression in margins once we're out of this congestion and you benefit -- sustainable benefit from the changes in the network and investments that you're making spurred by this experience that maybe would lift your long term efficiency goals or bring them sooner. Thank you.","Wick Moorman","","Obviously, any time we not only experience high volume growth quarter like this one, but certainly the quarter like the first quarter with the network disruptions across the North American rail network that we've seen, we try to go back and see what learnings we can take from them.","I think to Mark's point about -- we have to think again about quite an ancient service resources and how we are able to respond to unanticipated growth. We're going to go back and I think learn some lessons from that and I think what you will see as a result is that over some period of time, we will become more efficient because when we see something like the situation we've had in the second quarter, we'll able to react more effectively to it and hopefully not lose network velocity or see increased over time because we'll have responded with the resources in a more flexible way.","But there is a lot of learning to be had out of all of these experiences and we're always looking at what has happened and trying to improve ourselves as a result.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Group","Thank you very much.","Wick Moorman","","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I'll turn the floor back over to Wick Moorman for closing comments.","Wick Moorman","Well, thank you everyone for your patience and your questions and we look forward to talking to you all again at the end of the third quarter.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation."],"16264":["Norfolk Southern Corp.

Cook - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Thank you, Rob, and good morning. Before we begin today's call, I would like to mention a few items. The slides of the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors Section along with our non-GAAP reconciliation. Additionally, transcripts and downloads of today's call will be posted on our website.","During this call, we may make certain forward-looking statements which are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from our actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important.","Now, it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. With me are Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer; Mike Wheeler, Chief Operating Officer; and Marta Stewart, Chief Financial Officer.","We are pleased to report another strong quarter of financial and operational results. Our first quarter record results reflect the successful execution of our strategy to drive both service and operational performance in a growth environment.","As shown on slide 4, we achieved a record first quarter operating ratio of 70%, despite rising fuel prices, as well as record income from operations of $773 million, up 7% compared to the prior-year period. Earnings per share increased 15% to a record $1.48. Capitalizing on our 2016 success, we have stayed focused on our core mission of safety, service, productivity and growth, the cornerstones of our strategic plan.","We have demonstrated our ability to adapt to a changing world. Last year, we excelled in a challenging economic environment, improved our service and significantly reduced costs. This year, we're off to a strong start. We are building on the momentum we've created and continue to focus on strengthening our company, positioning NS for growth and maintaining a disciplined cost structure.","As evidenced by our recent results, Norfolk Southern is relentlessly focused on improving productivity and prudently investing to drive efficiency and growth. Slide 5 highlights some of the components of our continued operational success. Our measure of network performance, the Composite Service Metric, has remained steady even as units increased. We are driving continued improvements in customer service and efficiency through the solid execution of our operating plan.","To ensure we are providing a service product that is tuned to our customers' needs and that drives return on assets, we have implemented strong analytical tools and multi-department insights. For example, our new crew planning model has enhanced our ability to manage employee resources effectively with demand, which supports our high service quality while also keeping costs in check. We are confident that service will increasingly be an important differentiator for our company.","Improved resource utilization also remains a core focus, and Mike will detail our initiatives and progress in all the major areas including employee, locomotive and fuel efficiencies later on this call. We expect our initiatives to generate at least $100 million of productivity savings this year, building on the $250 million of productivity savings achieved last year. We continue to make strong progress on our productivity initiatives and remain on track to achieve our objective of $650 million in annual savings by 2020.","We have a balanced strategy that leverages strong long-term partnerships with customers and dynamic internal processes that support effective asset management. Our planning and operating technology, informed by collaboration with our customers, is strengthening our position in the supply chain. For example, we are working together with our customers to further align our internal metrics with those that are most important to their unique operations. Additionally, through this holistic focus on the entire supply chain, we are proactively aligning resources with demand. We have initiatives for additional improvements ongoing as we develop new technology to optimize the distribution of empty equipment, and that improves load scheduling, visibility and flexibility. As reflected on the lower right of slide 5, the efficiencies we have already achieved have enabled us to effectively contain employee resources while delivering growth.","We are confident that our strategic plan is sustainable and provides a strong foundation to attain growth at low incremental costs, and that's a powerful formula for enhanced shareholder value. In 2016, we returned $1.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and we're on track for similar amounts in 2017.","I'll now turn the program over to Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer.","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Norfolk Southern delivered first quarter revenue of $2.6 billion, a strong 6% year-over-year increase, which was driven by volume growth of 5% and a revenue per unit improvement of 1%. We attained volume and revenue gains in all three of our major market groups with a particularly robust performance in coal, intermodal and steel versus the first quarter of 2016. Additionally, fuel surcharge revenues increased due to higher on-highway diesel prices. We maintain our focus on pricing. Revenue per unit excluding fuel was flat as pricing gains were offset by negative mix associated with increased intermodal volume and short-haul utility coal.","On slide 8, Merchandise revenue was up 2% for the quarter with a 1% increase in volume and overall revenue per unit growth of 2%. Volume gains were primarily driven by metals and construction strength due to improved steel production and increased construction and drilling activity. Other markets declined slightly in the first quarter due to reduced energy shipments, truck competition and, in automotive, decreased U.S. light vehicle production. Merchandise revenue per unit increased 1% excluding fuel surcharge as positive pricing gains were partially offset by negative mix related to increased aggregate and soybean volume.","Turning to our Intermodal market on slide 9, revenue of $571 million represents a 9% increase over first quarter 2016 with a 4% gain in volume and a 5% improvement in RPU. Our improved service product helped drive a 5% volume increase within our domestic intermodal franchise despite weakness across the trucking industry. Continued strength in East Coast port activity supported international volume, which was up 3%. Excluding fuel, our intermodal revenue per unit improvement of 1% was driven by current pricing initiatives within the context of a soft trucking environment.","Moving to slide 10, Coal revenue increased 20% to $420 million in the first quarter, driven by significant volume increases in the export and utility markets as well as pricing gains. Utility coal volume of 17.6 million tons in the first quarter benefited from our previously announced market share gain and higher natural gas prices, which offset the impact of mild winter weather.","In our export market, we handled 6.3 million tons in the quarter through Lamberts Point in Baltimore due to improved demand and pricing for U.S. export coal. More than doubling its shipments, Baltimore is primarily lower RPU thermal coal and represents 38% of our total export volume, while Lamberts Point grew over 50% and is predominantly metallurgical coal.","As we look ahead to slide 11, our focus is on continuing to execute our strategic vision for growth. We are forecasting generally improved economic conditions, particularly related to manufacturing and consumer spending, which we expect will positively impact our volume.","Merchandise volume is expected to be relatively flat in 2017. Crude oil, which represented over 50,000 units last year, is predicted to decline close to 30% in 2017 as shipments are diverted to the Dakota Access Pipeline. The largest year-over-year decrease is projected in the second quarter. Additionally, a projected 3.5% decline in 2017 U.S. vehicle production will negatively impact our automotive volume. However, metals and construction, grain and plastics are expected to be up year-over-year.","Within Intermodal, our strong service product has and will continue to enable success in converting service-sensitive volume from the highway. Looking ahead, we expect positive macroeconomic trends to drive organic growth. Expected increases in transportation demand and gradually tightening truck capacity in the latter part of the year will provide potential volume growth through the remaining quarters this year.","We expect year-over-year growth within our coal markets with export gains driven by the continued tightening of international supply, most recently affected by Cyclone Debbie in Australia. Though seaborne prices fell from the highs in late 2016 and earlier this year, the after effects of the cyclone recently increased prices again. This should be a short-term benefit to U.S. coals in the global market. Due to this volatility, we expect to exceed our guidance in the second quarter and return to 3.5 million ton to 4.5 million ton rate in the third and fourth quarters.","We expect utility coal volume to grow this year and remain confident in our quarterly guidance range of 17 million tons to 19 million tons. It is important to note we are in shoulder months when the utilities typically rebuild their inventories from winter; although this winter was relatively mild, particularly in the South and, as a result, stockpiles remain elevated.","Consistent with our strategic plan, we are securing high-quality revenue growth that complements our existing network. We have developed a service product conducive to attracting new revenue and launch new customer focused initiatives designed to improve our customer experience and make it easier to do business with Norfolk Southern. At the same time, we have a keen understanding of the capacity of our existing network and we'll work to balance growth in targeted areas with the needs of our customers. While leveraging the value of our service product, we will continue our initiatives to attain pricing in excess of rail inflation.","As we have previously stated, we take a long-term view of our markets and pricing to yield sustainable shareholder value. We will continue to work with our customers to understand their expectations and remain an integral part of their supply chain.","I will now turn it over to Mike, who will discuss our operational performance.","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Thank you, Alan, and good morning. In the first quarter, we successfully executed on our strategic plan to provide a high-level service product and to pursue productivity initiatives while handling more volume.","Starting with safety on slide 13, we are pleased to see a 13% improvement in our reportable injury ratio as well as a 26% improvement in our serious injury ratio. These reductions demonstrate our continued dedication to maintaining a safe working environment for our employees throughout operations and the communities we operate in. Working safely and efficiently is a key component of our efforts to drive sustainable value creation.","Turning to slide 14, we continue to drive improvements in network performance and operate at high service levels. Our service composite remains strong, with dwell improving 4% and train speed decreasing 4%.","Moving to some of our productivity initiatives starting on slide 15, 2016 was a record year for train length and we are on track to set a new record for the full year. This is one of the factors that has allowed us to handle increased volume without a commensurate increase in resources. Importantly, we are ensuring we keep our yards fluid and we are providing a good service product to our customers. As Jim mentioned, we achieved these results by optimizing our operating plan and aggressively accelerating the use of distributed power, which utilizes locomotives on the head and rear of longer trains to allow for better train handling.","As shown on slide 16, train length, along with the continued rationalization of our yard and local fleets, has resulted in significant improvements in our locomotive productivity. We removed 150 locomotives from service in 2016 and we removed another 50 so far this year, with an additional 100 to be removed in the second quarter.","We did this by, again, reviewing our local and yard service and by combining deliveries so that fewer locomotives are required without affecting customer service. In total, we will have removed 300 locomotives from service since the beginning of last year. Consequently, we are on pace to set a new record this year for our locomotive productivity. Not only do these improvements drive lower maintenance costs, they also enhance our fuel efficiency and help protect our business against adverse fluctuations in fuel pricing.","Taking a closer look at our fuel efficiency on slide 17, we achieved a 6% improvement in the first quarter versus the same period last year and, as you recall, 2016 was a record year for this measure. We accomplished this by improving train lengths, locomotive rationalizations and our energy management initiatives. Together, these initiatives continue to drive improvement in fuel efficiency.","Lastly, on slide 18, we improved our employee productivity in the first quarter. We are continually rightsizing our workforce by working closely with our marketing team to project where we see growth and where we see reductions in our volumes. Our strategy of implementing hiring floors at our core locations, particularly in some which have proven difficult to hire in the past, is a part of our process to maintain high customer service levels.","Remaining properly staffed also aids our asset utilization through improved velocity. Our ability to achieve these improvements is driven by optimizing our operating plan and our increases in train length. In addition, we are realizing improvements from our strategy of terminal rationalizations, which we continue to review as markets shift. We expect our full year T&E head count to be up slightly to handle expected increased volumes.","In closing, we are executing on our flexible and balanced strategic plan, driving long-term growth through excellent customer service coupled with aggressive productivity initiatives.","I will now turn it over to Marta to discuss our financial results and achievements.","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter operating results are summarized on slide 20. As Jim mentioned, both income from operations and the railway operating ratio set first quarter records. We expect to see year-over-year improvement in our operating ratio in each of the remaining quarters of this year as compared to 2016.","Before we take a look at expenses in detail, let's examine the effects of changing fuel prices on both our revenues and our expenses. As highlighted at the top of slide 21, the net impact from fuel on our operating ratio in the first quarter was 170 basis points. The table on the slide shows the year-over-year change by quarter for both fuel surcharge revenue and fuel expense.","Throughout 2016, we had largely offsetting declines. In the first quarter of this year, while fuel surcharge revenue was higher compared to the prior year, the increase was not enough to offset the increase in diesel fuel expense, thereby negatively impacting operating income by $33 million. The graph below the table illustrates that this was largely due to the divergence you can see reflected in the first quarter of 2016. Since the difference in prices narrowed thereafter, we do not expect a significant net effect on operating income in the remaining quarters of this year.","Turning now to the component changes in operating expenses on slide 22, in total, expenses rose by $105 million, with the majority of that increase relating to fuel as all other categories increased by less than inflation plus volume. Let's take a closer look at the components.","Fuel expense, as shown on slide 23, rose by $64 million and the higher fuel price accounted for all of the increase. As Mike described, we had markedly better fuel efficiency with a 1% decline in consumption despite the 5% increase in traffic.","Slide 24 highlights the major drivers of the variance in Compensation and Benefits, which rose by $20 million, or 3% year-over-year. Increases associated with wage inflation and higher health and welfare rates added $31 million to expenses and we expect these increases to continue at a similar run rate for the remainder of the year. Partially offsetting these inflationary items were reduced employee levels, which resulted in $12 million of lower expense. Headcount was about 600 employees lower than the first quarter of 2016. Going forward, we expect total employment levels to remain steady, dependent, of course, on volume.","Slide 25 shows the $16 million or 8% increase in the Materials and Other category. Claims costs were higher due to a case-specific accrual for a third-party claim which totaled $9 million. Additionally, locomotive and engineering materials were up $7 million.","Turning to Purchased Services and Rents on slide 26, this category was down $2 million or 1% year-over-year. Equipment rents decreased by $6 million due to the lower automotive traffic Alan mentioned as well as better system fluidity. Costs associated with increased intermodal traffic accounted for an $8 million increase in purchased services during the quarter.","Moving on to Income Taxes on slide 27, the effective rate for the quarter was 33.9% versus 35.5% in the first quarter of 2016. The rate this year was lower largely due to the impact of tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation.","Slide 28 shows our bottom line first quarter results. Net income was $433 million, up 12% compared with 2016, and diluted earnings per share was $1.48, a first quarter record. This performance demonstrates the effectiveness of our strategy, which continues to drive record results.","I'll now turn the call back to Jim for closing remarks.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Thank you, Marta. Now, before I move to closing comments and we open the line for Q&A, I do want to acknowledge a press release we issued this morning in conjunction with our earnings press release. This morning, we announced that Marta Stewart, our Chief Financial Officer, will be retiring effective August 1. Marta will be with us through the second quarter and will be back in late July to present our second quarter earnings, but I cannot let the moment pass without acknowledging her decision to retire and thanking her for her many contributions to Norfolk Southern over the years.","We continue to execute our strategic plan and remain well on our way to reaching our goal of achieving $650 million in productivity savings and an operating ratio below 65% by 2020, all while maintaining our superior service product. Our plan is dynamic and flexible, and as we identify additional opportunities whether to improve productivity or drive growth, we will aggressively pursue them. Our strategy has proven successful and we have a strong, engaged team to continue the momentum.","And with that, we'll now open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question today comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse","Thanks. Good morning. So, I guess I'll take the obvious one here since I have the first question, but you put up solid operating results if you adjust out some of the onetime-ish items from the prior year as well as the current quarter. But if we think about the numbers that CSX put up last week and an indication that the 2018 OR could be in the low 60%s, does this up the ante for your long-term targets?","And is there anything that you've observed in terms of the operational changes at CSX so far, including yard rationalization, etcetera, that you think you could adopt for your own network to bring out additional costs? I guess, long story short, does better competition breed better competition?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Good morning, Allison, and thank you for your question. We are watching closely what's happening in the industry with our peer and we are doing many of the same things, albeit at a somewhat more measured pace, and we will continue to do so. But we will focus on our strategy, which revolves around safety, service, productivity and growth. Safety, because it's absolutely the most important thing we do. We never take a day off when it comes to safety. Service, because we are a service company. Service excellence defined by our customers, because we serve them not vice versa. Productivity, because we have a very large asset base and it's our responsibility to manage it every day. Cost consciousness is in our bones. And lastly, growth, our customers want to grow and we want to grow with them, provided we can do so profitably.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse","Okay, great. Thank you. And just as a follow-up, speaking about growing with your customers profitably, do you expect to take any share gains from CSX to the extent that there's any network disruptions? And if so, what commodities do you think you'd likely see the most benefit and if there's any way to size the potential of that? Thank you.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","We're always looking for good revenue growth opportunities. We have the capacity and we have the willingness to take on additional volumes and growth provided we can continue to maintain excellent service levels and that the growth we take on flows to the bottom line.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, great. Thanks, and good morning. I wanted to pick up a little bit on that last sort of comment just thinking a bit about relative operating ratios between geographic competitors. We focused a lot on the OR, but I want to get a sense from management's perspective. Do you think that you're either at a \u2013 do you think that different ORs put you at material disadvantages in terms of servicing the customer and sort of market share opportunities? Just want to get a rough sense of maybe sort of management's thinking about where you might stack relative to other peers from a margin standpoint, if it's as important for the customer service side?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","You know, I guess what I would emphasize, Chris, is that ours is a balanced strategy. We are working to grow the bottom line through topline growth and through better operating margin, and we get there through excellent service to our customers; and that helps us grow the revenue. It also helps us to operate efficiently as well, as we've shown in the past. So, it's really all about balance. It's a combination of topline growth, margin improvement driven by productivity and incremental margin; and, all while keeping our eye on the service ball and making sure that what we do is sustainable for the long-term as well.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up, just thinking about the volume opportunity in 2017, so your comps get decently easier in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. When you think about sort of the business opportunities ahead of you both from a competitive standpoint, but also from an organic standpoint, how should we be thinking about sort of volume trends as we go forward through the rest of the year?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Well, I'll say this, and then I'll turn it over to Alan for a little bit of color. Certainly, in the second quarter to-date, the volume comparison to last year is looking very favorable. And volume conditions feel pretty stable right now. We're looking for a good year in terms of growth. Alan?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yes, Chris, as you noted, we do have relatively easy comps in the second quarter. We also had that in the first quarter and we delivered 5% growth. It starts to get a little bit more difficult in the third and fourth quarters, although that's the time period in which most analysts expect that trucking competition is going to tighten. And so, we're going to continue to leverage our very good customer-focused service product and try and take trucks off the highway. We did that in the fourth quarter of last year, and we did that in the first quarter of this year in pretty loose truck environment. So, we feel good about where we are with growth. We've given you some guidance on what we see in our coal and our merchandise markets, and in our intermodal markets.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Morning, everyone. Jim, Marta, I'm wondering if you can comment on pricing trends in the first quarter and how that compared year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter in terms of whether it accelerated or decelerated? And are you confident you can get pricing over inflation in 2017?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Alan, why don't you take that one?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yes, we saw consistent pricing in the first quarter with last year, and we're continuing to differentiate ourselves based on our service and ability to innovate as supply chains evolve. We're confident in our ability to continue to drive high-quality revenue that complements our network at low incremental costs, which will ultimately and continue to drive shareholder value.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Can I just follow up on that? When you say consistent pricing, did you mean the same rate of price increases you were getting last year is what you're getting this year? And can you comment on the sequential trends as well, please?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Sequentially, it's \u2013 yeah, it's pretty much the same as where we were last year year-over-year and sequentially. We continue to see pressure in the trucking environment and we are getting some very significant and competitive rate increases at our export coal franchise. As truck markets tighten and economic conditions continue to improve, we fully expect additional opportunities for price later this year and into 2018.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to follow up on the margin trajectory versus CSX, the first question. Jim, I wanted to just get your thoughts on if there are any structural reasons why Norfolk Southern returns should be much different than CSX over time. And I'm not asking you to comment on what CSX is doing, obviously, but the company, as you said previously \u2013 I mean, it's not really operating in a vacuum. You're very well aware what your competitors are doing. So, if you can just help us understand why there could be or would be any structural reasons the returns in your business would be different than CSX's as volumes do come back. Thanks very much.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Sure. Thanks for the question. So, let me put it this way, we have outlined a plan to deliver consistent, reliable, sustainable improvements in operating margin and bottom-line growth, and that's what we're going to do. It's a combination of factors, as we've been through. It's a balanced plan. It relies on both growth and productivity. And that will deliver the goods for shareholders, we are quite confident.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. I thought I'd try to ask that question, but I appreciate the answer. Let me ask you one specific one with respect to the numbers. You talked originally about growing revenues at lower incremental costs, and that's kind of obvious, right, in a capital-intensive business. And it seems like if you adjust the net fuel expense, it looks like incremental margins did come in just above 50% in the quarter; and it seems like it would've actually been quite a bit more than that if the materials and claim expense were not as high as they were in the quarter. So just in that context related to your comment about year-on-year margin expansion in the remaining quarters, is kind of 50% to 60% normalized the right bogey in terms of incremental margins to drive that margin expansion, or are there any specific items in the cost structure that may make that number \u2013 that incremental margin number higher or lower as we look out into 2Q, 3Q and 4Q? Thank you.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","You know, we talked in the past about the composition of volume growth and its effect on incrementals, so that's certainly a factor to keep an eye on; but, you're absolutely right. Volume growth through a relatively fixed cost base is the key to high incremental margin and corresponding earnings growth, and that's really what we're focused on here. We're focused on disciplined cost structure that keeps costs in check while volumes are growing, as they are in this environment. Now, with that, let me turn it over to Marta to talk about the incremental margin in the quarter, excluding some of the items that you mentioned.","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yes, well, you're absolutely right that the fuel had a dampening effect in the first quarter. We don't think that's going to continue, as I described, in the second \u2013 at least not to that extent in the second, third and fourth quarters. So, our incremental margin excluding the fuel effect was closer to about 67% in the first quarter. In my remarks, I mentioned that we expect to have continued improvement in the OR. So, year-over-year, in the second, third and fourth quarters, we expect to improve the operating ratio. As you know, since we embarked on this strategic plan, for the past 5 quarters we have shown year-over-year operating ratio improvement, and we continue to expect that. So, based on that, you should expect that we'll have similar incremental margins going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Good morning. And Marta, good luck in the next phase of your career as you move forward. But, Jim, you suggested doing things at a measured pace. I just want to understand that comment a little bit. The board \u2013 what does the board suggest that management start looking at? There was a recent 8-K, I think, talking about pay levels can accelerate significantly if you accelerate the plan. Can you talk about what was behind that? Is that maybe the board suggesting a faster pace or a larger scale in terms of your operating plan?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Sure, sure. So, when I say measured, I want to be clear. What I'm talking about is a pace of change and improvement that is sustainable for the long run. We are trying to produce sustainable financial improvements for the long run. With that said, we are looking at everything out there to drive acceleration of our financial results, and we won't stop with the plan that we have outlined. It's a flexible plan and when we see opportunities to improve upon it, we will jump on them.","As you mentioned, Ken, the board did put in place an accelerated turnaround incentive and that's there to incentivize management to find those opportunities to drive improvement and acceleration. It's meant to be a stretch plan and that's what it's for, but we're going to work as hard as we can to achieve it.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And then a follow-up, Mike, you noted the composite service at 79%. I just want to maybe dig into that a little bit. Is that a grade? I just want to understand, are you giving yourself a C rating on the service? Is that on on-time performance? It just doesn't sound that efficient if something's operating at 79% of capability. Maybe you can talk a little bit about the input and outputs there.","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Sure; and the composite service is made up of several components. It's made up of train performance. It's made up of connections, and it's made up of planned adherence. So, it takes into account all of those in different measures to make sure that we are taking care of the customers' needs, and I would just relate that to the fact that our network velocity is still at all-time high records. So, we feel very comfortable with that. It's providing a good service product and our customers like what we're providing.","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Ken, this is Alan. Network performance is one way to look at it. Jim's been very clear that we're driving customer-specific service metrics that are unique to the markets that we serve and, in many cases, unique to the demands of individual customers as their transportation needs evolve. This allows us to improve the value that we provide to our customers. It provides for more rich conversation with our customers as we're renegotiating contracts and looking for additional business, about the benefits of the Norfolk Southern product. And, they can become defined as for individual customers or broadly by markets. And if you look at, say, intermodal, it could be availability of a box on a chassis at a terminal; within the merchandise network, it could be consistency of delivery to a customer location to the original ETA. Those are all important things to the customer. And I can tell you, categorically, that for each of those individual customer metrics, we are in much better shape than we were last year and have improved year-over-year. And that's what we're doing is we are collaborating with our customer to find out what they want and becoming a much more integral part of their supply chain.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your questions.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yeah. Thanks for taking my question this morning. So, Jim, what are you and the rest of the board's priorities, both for experience and skill set, as you search for Norfolk's next CFO? And can you just give us a little signal on where your head is \u2013 the odds of an external versus an internal hire at this point from where you sit?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Well, granted, we have big shoes to fill here, that's for sure, with Marta's departure. But look, we're looking for someone who is going to focus single-mindedly on shareholder value. That's the type of person we want in the CFO seat and throughout the C suite. Our focus is driving shareholder value through successful execution of our strategic plan. That's the number one criterion for the next CFO.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","And the internal versus external, is there any color you can give us on how you guys are thinking about that?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","We have some excellent internal candidates and we're going to look at external candidates as well, and we'll see what falls out of that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your questions.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Yeah, thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. So, I guess my question is on the efficiency trends that you did reaffirm here, both for the full year and longer term, but I don't think I heard an update as to what the run rate is for the first quarter and whether there's been a change to the cadence of that, particularly on the employee side. I think I heard that you're guiding for up slightly, now, from flat and still at 5% inflation, all-in inflation. Is that correct?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","So, we don't guide on quarterly productivity. Let me just say that at the outset. We did see some improvements in the first quarter. Marta, let me turn it over to you to address the employment question, specifically.","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Okay. So, on the employment question, and I'm glad you asked that because we have a couple of pieces there. So, as Mike described, we do expect, with the volume increase that Alan talked about, we do expect that we will need to add some train and engine employees, those employees that directly face the customer, directly affect our service.","However, overall, for our total employment, we expect to keep that about even for the remainder of the year, sequentially with the first quarter. As you noted, that is a reduction from last year. So previously, we had guided to staying even with last year's average, which was about 27,900. We now think that our employment level will be about 400 less; 27,500 for the full year.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","And we plan to use attrition across the other areas. So, in other words, the customer-facing folks, the train and engine folks will go up, but all of the other areas, we will handle attrition to offset that.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Great. Okay, and then my follow-up is on tax. You were about 300 basis points below, I think, the 37% you'd been guiding to, Marta, before? Can you reconfirm? Is it 37% we should be using? And I think you mentioned it was on stock-based comp. Can you quantify that? Was that the full 300 basis points relative to what you had been guiding us for the 37% on a run-rate basis?","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yes, just about. It was substantially all of that difference. And so, the normalized rate, if you will, you're correct, that we guided to was 37%. In the first quarter, PSUs and RSUs were issued because they're earned out in the first quarter. In addition, as the stock hit all-time highs in the first quarter, options were exercised. So, going forward, depending on what happens with option exercise in the remainder of the year, we may see the normalized 37% a little bit lower. However, it probably won't be as much as the first quarter, 3%, because we don't have the PSU \/ RSU earn-out other than in the first quarter of the year. Does that make sense?","Operator","Yes. Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your questions","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Yes. Good morning, and congratulations on the strong results. Those look like you showed very good improvement on a number of different metrics, and it's strong results. I wanted to ask a bit on the operating side; and you gave some very useful metrics to look at for productivity, locomotive productivity, train length. What do you think the opportunity is as you look the next several quarters and even into next year? Are there \u2013 you talked about using distributed power. You talked about significant locomotive productivity gains and train length expansion. Does that opportunity continue? Is that going to linger the next couple of quarters or have you realized a lot and you need to pause? So, just wonder if you could offer some more on broader productivity on a couple of metrics. Thank you.","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yes, well, we're not pausing at all on any of those. We talked about 50 locomotives already out this year, and another 100 we're going to have out here in the next month or so. That'll help. And then, going forward, we continue to look at what opportunities there are further in reducing locomotives from the fleet, still keeping our service product the way it needs to be. We're continuing to work on rationalizing our freight car fleet as well, taking freight cars out of the fleet, but still providing good customer service, particularly by going to a more homogenous fleet and flexible fleet. So, those are big initiatives.","We continue to aggressively implement distributed power; still a lot of opportunities there. Fuel efficiency, a lot of initiatives still going on there. So, I don't think that we're pausing at all. In fact, I think we continue to ramp-up aggressively all these things. We just have a lot of productivity initiatives in the hopper that we're working on.","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yes, Mike, you talked about our equipment strategy, and I think it's notable that our efforts to go to a more homogenized fleet don't just benefit operations. It also improves our ability to compete with truck and provide a better service product to our customer. It's more flexible by definition. It lowers investment risk. It lowers operating costs, and it improves our ability to provide a serviceable piece of equipment to our customer in good working order on time.","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yes.","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","So, there's great collaboration between marketing and operations on a lot of these initiatives to make sure that we're taking a sustainable approach and a balanced approach to take costs out while improving our service \u2013 individual service to our customers.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Can you \u2013 that's helpful. I appreciate that. Can you give \u2013 are there any numbers you can say, well, like distributed power, we've got X percent of trains on distributed power and we think we can get to Y? Can you give any kind of framework for that and \u2013 not second quarter, but just the next couple of years what you could get to, or even on kind of maybe locomotives or cars that you might be able to put in storage, things like that?","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","No, not really. All I can say is it's all going to be more. We're going to have more distributed power. We've got a plan to have more cars out of the network, like Alan talked about, but still providing the good service. So, all these things that we've got in place are going to be more and better, but we don't have a quantity to put out there right now; but, you will continue to see improvement.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys.","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Good morning.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Marta, I wanted to ask a different one on the operating ratio. So, if I look historically, first quarter and then the full year, the full year is typically, I don't know, 300 basis points or 400 basis points better than the first quarter, so kind of implying a 66% or 67% operating ratio for the year. Is there anything wrong with that math, or anything you want us to think about, good or bad, relative to kind of what we've seen historically from the model? And then, just maybe along those lines, can you just remind us how much more head count you have to go relative to the initial plan as part of the $650 million of productivity?","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Okay. Well, as I mentioned in my remarks, we expect the OR in the second, third and fourth quarters of this year to be lower than the OR of last year; and, I think we'll leave it at that in terms of detail. As you know, all of those quarters last year were well below 70%. So, we continue to expect improvement in the operating ratio.","Now, with regard to the employee head count levels, we're currently down 2,600, approximately, employees in total from the end of 2015 \u2013 or the average for 2015. And so, the \u2013 going forward, the savings will be in maintaining that lower level of head count as well as the other things within compensation that are not head count-related: the overtime, which Mike and his folks are really working on, keeping the overtime down in all of our categories; the extra boards; the re-crews. And so, it's a combination to get to our total goal of about $400 million over the five-year reduction in compensation and benefits through that head count and a managing the average cost per employee number as well.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","And just to follow up, do you think is there \u2013 if volumes continue to improve and you need to add more T&E, is there enough other non-T&E to potentially remove to keep head count flat next year as well in a flat \u2013 in a growing volume environment?","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","That is our goal. What we are looking \u2013 that's our plan for this year, as Mike and I both described, was T&E is going up, the others are going down slightly in order to stay level with the first quarter. Going into 2017 \u2013 I mean 2018, to get out to the next year, we will always attempt to try to keep the appropriate resources to have the right amount of good customer service, and then take it in elsewhere in the company, if we can. But that will depend on the level of growth of volume that we have in 2018, if we're able to offset it completely.","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yes, and we're really not growing the overall T&E count. We're hiring to handle attrition and volume growth, right? So, it's not a long-term growth of our T&E population.","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","You mean in 2018.","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Correct.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Good morning.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So, Alan, just had a follow-up on kind of the realized rates ex-fuel, and especially on coal. Revenue per unit there ex-fuel was down 1%; exposures you highlight, the rate mix. Other were basically down 2%. You mentioned the short-haul utility coal, but just wanted to circle back to the export coal market pricing that we've all seen get pretty strong here, recently. And also, the volumes you mention were actually up quite a bit in Lamberts Point. I think it was over 50%. So just wondering if you can help us figure out if that's going to come through on a lag, or it's really a big mix headwind from the shorter haul utility coal that's keeping some of those numbers down?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Hey, Brian, I'm glad you brought that up. It's \u2013 it is an issue with the mix headwind, as you reference. However, we did get very competitive rate increases, and very significant rate increases, at Lamberts Point; although, you should note that Lamberts Point is still only 14% of our overall coal volume. So, it's a relatively minor component, because we have a pretty diverse coal franchise. And so, while Lamberts Point grew over 50%, Baltimore, which is more of a thermal market and has a lower RPU, grew over 100%. And so, you can see some mix issues within that within export. And then, we were supported by a market share gain in the North, and the very mild weather in the South limited our growth in Utility South.","So, last year, we had talked at this time, Brian, our Utility South volume was about 54%, 55% of our utility volume. That's flipped a little bit. And now, Utility North is more than 50% of our utility volume. That also has a \u2013 tends to have a lower length of haul than Utility South, and so that creates some pressure on our RPU. But I'll note, we are really focused on adding high-quality revenue that fits our network, complements our product and drives long-term shareholder value. And that's \u2013 and our first quarter results reflect a successful execution of that strategy.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thanks. I appreciate the detail on that. And just as a follow-up is \u2013 we've seen the export met coal price continue to move up and volume's trending pretty (53:58) strong there as well, would you expect mix headwinds to at least get a little bit better, maybe not as bad, as we haven't seen the same strength on the thermal export market? Thank you.","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah. You noted that with Cyclone Debbie that prices have gone up. That's a near-term phenomenon and we're already starting to see a correction there; although, that will benefit, clearly, our second quarter export volumes. And so, in my remarks, I guided to the fact that we would probably exceed our previous guidance of 3.5 million tons to 4.5 million tons in the second quarter, and then third and fourth quarters would be back within that range. There's a lot of volatility, as you could expect, within our coal network; not only because of seaborne prices, but also because utility coal is now a load follower and stockpiles, while significantly down from last year, are still elevated.","And so, we're going to be watching the same things that you watch. We're going to be watching natural gas prices, weather, electricity demand, cooking coal prices and API, too.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please state your questions.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks, and good morning. So, maybe to follow up, first, on some of that coal commentary, when you combine all of the puts and takes that you just walked through, do you think consolidated coal RPU can move higher sequentially over the remainder of the year?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","It's going to be highly dependent upon market conditions and those four or five factors that I just referenced, Justin. We're getting price. We're particularly getting price in the export met market. The sustainability of that's going to be dependent upon the \u2013 some of the factors, such as coke and coal price.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Okay, and then maybe shifting gears to intermodal, your two major IMC (56:14) partners have both indicated the intermodal pricing environment has been highly competitive at the start of the year. And I was curious if your approach to that market has changed at all, and would you be willing to provide any additional rate relief to your intermodal partners this year or are those rate increases at this point unlikely to change?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah, we \u2013 Justin, we take a long-term sustainable view of our pricing, the value of our service product, the markets and the customers we serve, which ultimately is going to promote shareholder value in the near-term and long-term. We are fully confident that trucking capacity is going to tighten in the second half of this year, which will lift truck prices maybe \u2013 late this year and early next year, and we're taking a long-term approach to this.","We grew our volume in the fourth quarter of last year in a difficult truck environment. We grew our volume in the first quarter of this year in a difficult truck environment as we leveraged the value of our service product.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please state your question.","Eric Morgan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, good morning. This is Eric Morgan on for Brandon. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow up on some of your more structural costs. It sounds like you're making progress with terminal rationalization, but, Mike, I think you mentioned you're actively reviewing some of those initiatives as markets shift. I guess, can you elaborate on some of the things you're looking at there and if that's where some of the opportunity is for acceleration in the plan?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","I'll let Mike address the specifics of your question, but I want to emphasize just how focused we are on structural costs reductions. That is essential to successful execution of our long-range plan, so whether it's fixed assets in the network or it's mobile assets like locomotives, we are very focused on improving productivity in those areas. Mike?","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah. So, there's a couple pieces to it. Obviously, we want to make our operating plan as optimized as we can, and we spend every day doing that working through the plan. The other piece is the terminals. Where can you take cost out of the terminals, whether it's idling a terminal and taking it out of your network, we look at that all the time? There are things we're working on \u2013 or just taking costs out by having less resources at those terminals, whether they go from three shifts to two; we're finding ways to do more in those terminals with less resources. So, it's a combination of optimizing the operating plan to reduce costs, finding ways to take out costs in the terminals, whether it's taking them out of the network or just driving costs out of those terminals. And we're working on all three of those, and you'll see all of those incrementally improve.","Eric Morgan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. I appreciate that and maybe just a quick follow-up on yard productivity. Can you just update us on the number of hump yards you're operating and maybe your views on converting to flat switching and how that might impact both the cost structure and the ability to service the customer?","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yes, so we have 10 hump yards. And as we've noted on here, we've idled three of those over the last couple of years, the last being last year in Knoxville, Tennessee. So, we continue to look at it. But those yards, they're part of our network. They're part of processing the volume of cars through the railroad and they're part of what we have to make sure we provide a good service product.","So, we're balanced and making sure we've got a good service product, but finding ways to take costs out; and, if we can take terminals out and still provide a good service product and the velocity being there, we're going to do that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Matt Elkott - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning. This is actually Matt Elkott for Jason. Thank you for taking our question. Staying on this topic here, I was wondering if you guys can talk a little bit about the potential track reduction opportunities.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Mike?","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yes, we don't see large pieces of the network coming out. As Alan has noted before, we've got a network reach that's very good for our customers, and that's an asset and a competitive advantage.","But we do look at ways to take costs off the lines and still provide the service product that we need. So, if it's a lower density branch line, we're able to continue to reduce the speeds, continue to take costs out, but still safely service the customer commitments that we have on there.","So, we don't see large pieces of the network necessarily coming out from a line standpoint, but the costs will come out as we continue to find ways to service those pieces of railroad at a lower cost. And we're doing it; a lot of initiatives we have in place to do that. So, you won't see big chunks of the railroad coming out, but you'll see costs come out.","Matt Elkott - Cowen & Co. LLC","Got it. That's very helpful. And just one quick follow-up on the locomotive front, I know you have plans to remove from service some additional locomotives. What does volume have to do from your current internal expectations for the year, whether accelerate or decelerate, for you to reconsider the number of locomotives that you're taking out?","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yes, so what we've already committed to, the 50 that we've done and the 100 that we're going to take out, is really not volume dependent at all. Going forward, as volume comes back \u2013 comes to the railroad, we've got the ability to add that volume to our trains without having to add commensurate locomotives. So, we don't see having to add a bunch of locomotives to the fleet going forward to handle volume, with all the initiatives we have going on.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. Alan, I wanted to see if you could comment a little bit about what you think the Norfolk strategy will be if the truck market does start to tighten. It seems historically you guys have been more pushing volume into a less mature intermodal network and keeping rates low in order to do that. Do you think that if the truck market tightens, you'll be able to kind of push both the price and volume levers, or do you think it'll still be more of a volume story?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Dave, we're achieving price. We have achieved price, and we're going to continue to do it. For us, truck is pricing opportunity. Conversions from truck create an opportunity not just in intermodal, but in our merchandise network. And Mike and I talked about collaborating with customers on an equipment strategy that allows us to convert truck to rail in the merchandise network.","So, we're going to continue to push on price. We've achieved price and volume in very difficult truck environment last year and in the first quarter of this year. It's potentially starting to tighten a little bit, and the analysts believe that it's going to tighten a lot more as the year progresses. So, that's our focus is taking a long-term view of our pricing and the value of our service.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","How do I square that with the 1% gain in the intermodal RPU ex-fuel?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","We had some shifts within our intermodal network, but we achieved our price. And, clearly, truck is limiting the upside to our price, so we've talked about that in the past, too. We're confident in our ability as we move forward and our results reflect it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Aegis Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Aegis Capital Corp.","Thank you very much, and congratulations on the quarter. A lot of my questions have been asked at this point, so let me turn to a longer-term one in terms of your capital plan. We've had a lot of rationalization. You talked about putting more locomotives and cars into storage, yet the free cash flow is growing. What are your thoughts in terms of capital reinvestment in the business and kind of where are the more attractive opportunities near-term for capital dollars that, say, may drive more productivity or may enhance operations?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","So, we've outlined, in conjunction with our long-range plan, our intent with respect to capital allocation. First call on capital is always reinvestment in the business. We see great investment opportunities there, and we intend to continue to maintain our franchise through judicious capital investment and we'll fund growth opportunities as well, as appropriate.","With the excess capital, with free cash flow, we'll buy back shares and we will pay a dividend, as we have always done. So, at a high level, that's our capital allocation strategy. Marta, you want to fill in some of the blanks in terms of what we've outlined for 2017?","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","So, with regard to the capital budget for this year, we have planned on $1.9 billion. You are correct to note that, going forward, we think that's going to go down because that includes $240 million for PTC. As we complete that, we are looking to holding capital spending, but still provide for growth capital. We analyze our growth capital very strenuously.","Mike and his folks, too \u2013 one big component of that, as you noted, too, is locomotives. We have a robust locomotive rebuild program that we started working on several years ago; have really accelerated last year and this year, and we expect that to continue into the future. We have a good base of \u2013 fleet of locomotives that we can upgrade that well, and that's going to be a key component in the future in being able to control our total capital spend.","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Upgrading the locomotives at a lower capital cost, it's a win-win.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Aegis Capital Corp.","Okay. Thank you and best of luck, Marta. Thank you.","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Zachary N. Rosenberg - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Actually, Zach Rosenberg on for Ben here. Thanks for squeezing us in. I want to shift the questions here a little bit. I saw that there was a comment from President Trump out expecting a tariff on softwood lumber going into the U.S. from Canada. Just wondering, specifically, if that has any impact to your guys business and network? But more broadly, just if you have any kind of updated thoughts on the potential impact to the business just from increasingly protectionist policy and any updates on thoughts around regulation?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","I'll take the question about regulation, generally. We are certainly in favor of a lighter touch with respect to regulation in some parts of our business. In fact, across the board, any time we see an opportunity to achieve further productivity and otherwise advance our financial objectives, we're going to be in support of it. And that certainly includes lightening the regulatory burden. Why don't you comment specifically on the announcement recently?","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah, Zach, as we look at it, that may result in additional volume coming from the Pacific Northwest into our markets or it may result in additional volume that originates on our network. So, all in all, we don't think it's going to have a material impact on our volumes.","Zachary N. Rosenberg - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you. That's it for me.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.","Thanks very much and good morning.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Good morning.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.","Just wanted to ask one, because the call is running long, and that was with respect to your plan to move to a more homogenous equipment fleet, which has obvious benefits. Can you just comment on how quickly that happens through natural attrition of the fleet, if you will, and whether at some point you would consider stepping up your CapEx to accelerate that process?","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah, this is Mike. No, we don't expect to accelerate our CapEx at all for that. And we've got a couple thousand that are going to come out of the fleet this year because we are more homogenous going to a car that can be used in many different areas, and it's already progressing. It's been part of what we've been doing for the last several years. We've taken several thousand, almost 17,000, cars out of our fleet over the last several years and we're continuing that, but still being able to have a car when the customer needs it. Alan, anything you want to add to that?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","It's a process. As cars fall out, we can scrap them. It's a homogenous fleet and it has quicker cycle times. You have to buy \u2013 purchase less cars, invest in less equipment to replace that carrying capacity.","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","It's more flexible.","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","And, Cherilyn, the expectation of this gradual conversion to a more homogenous fleet is anticipated in our five-year capital plan, already.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.","Okay. Can you just elaborate on how many car types you would have today and where that might go directionally?","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","We've got a lot of car types out there, but we're probably 50 different car types out there. We're trying to take probably 10% of that out this year and probably took 10 of them out last year.

Additionally, a transcript and download will be posted after the call.","Now, it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman, President, and CEO, Jim Squires.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's second quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today are Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer; Mike Wheeler, Chief Operating Officer; and Cindy Earhart, Chief Financial Officer.","We continue to deliver record results as our second quarter financial highlights on slide four clearly demonstrate. Income from operations was over $1 billion, an increase of 18% and an all-time record for any quarter in our company's history. Net income was $710 million, up 43% over the prior year, and earnings per share was $2.50, a 46% increase.","Our second quarter operating ratio was 64.6%, a 230-basis point improvement from last year and the 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating ratio improvement. All of these measures were second quarter records for Norfolk Southern.","Halfway into the year, our strategy continues to deliver improved financial performance. We have produced first half records for operating income, operating ratio, net income, and earnings per share.","Income from operations for the first six months was $1.9 billion, a 14% increase over the prior year, and our operating ratio improved 180 basis points. Net income for the period was $1.3 billion and earnings per share was $4.43.","As we handled near record volumes, we continue our focus on deploying resources to improve service and remain committed to improving network performance for our customers.","Two-and-a-half years ago, we laid out our five-year operating plan and highlighted a number of aggressive yet achievable goals. Since then, we have consistently delivered record financial results. And today, we are more confident than ever that we will hit our targeted OR of less than 65% by 2020.","Importantly, based on the significant momentum underway and the dedication of our team, we are on track to achieve that target ahead of schedule. As we've said before, given our operations and seasonality, we do not expect OR improvements to occur in a straight line. However, we have already significantly reduced OR and remain on track to achieve another year of year-over-year OR improvement for 2018.","As we've said before, when we get to 65%, we won't stop there. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress as we continue to take action to strengthen our network and enhance shareholder value.","Now, Alan will cover trends in revenue; Mike will provide additional color on the state of operations; and Cindy will detail our financial results; then we'll take your questions. Thank you.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Alan.","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter 2018 marks the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth with second quarter gains in revenue, volume and revenue per unit across all three of our business groups.","Merchandise revenue grew 8% in the second quarter with increased oil and gas drilling activity driving volume expansion in frac sand and NGLs, along with strong growth in ethanol, fertilizers and crude oil. These increases were partially offset by lower automotive volume. Improved pricing and higher fuel surcharge revenue raised RPU 4%.","Robust economic conditions and a historically tight truck market led to record-breaking revenue and volume in intermodal. In the second quarter, NS delivered a 20% increase in intermodal revenue, marking the second quarter in a row with record revenue growth. RPU was up 11% year-over-year with increased fuel surcharge revenue, strong pricing and positive mix. Given the projected demand for the NS intermodal product, the strength in the pricing environment is expected to continue.","Our coal franchise revenue increased 4%, driven largely by sustained high overseas demand for U.S. coals. The 10% top line growth generated by revenue growth in all seven of our commodity groups reflects Norfolk Southern's ability to deliver both pricing and volume growth and the strength of the economy.","Turning to slide 7, we expect continued revenue growth in the second half of 2018. The economy is anticipated to remain strong throughout 2018 with increased consumer spending and industrial production coupled with a tight truck market and elevated commodity prices. In addition, inventory rebuilds are driving increased demand for our services.","In merchandise, we expect continued strong demand in many of our energy-related commodities such as crude oil, frac sand and ethanol. We project sustained strength in intermodal in the second half as the truck market remains extraordinarily strong aided by a robust consumer economy. This growth will be enhanced by the steady increase in e-commerce volume and anticipated inventory builds.","Coal will be supported by strength in seaborne demand with export volume anticipated in the quarterly range of 6 million to 8 million tons. Utility volume, dependent upon weather and natural gas prices, is expected to remain between 15 million to 17 million tons per quarter.","Pricing remains an emphasis and an opportunity benefited by increased truck rates, higher fuel prices and tight transportation conditions across all modes. We remain confident that executing our balanced long-term plan will allow us to capitalize on the growing economy, support our customers' growth and strategically invest for the future.","Execution against this plan drove growth in the first half of the year that we expect to continue in the second. Our focus includes remaining flexible in response to changing markets, increasing our competitiveness with truck, and, most importantly, efficiently meeting the evolving needs of our customers to deliver value to our shareholders.","I will now turn it over to Mike for an update on operations.","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Thank you, Alan. Good morning. Today, I will update you on the state of our operation. We progressed with our service recovery plan during the quarter in which we grew our business, handled near-record volumes, and achieved a record second quarter operating ratio.","Turning to slide nine, we are pleased with the increasing efficiency of our operations. An all-time quarterly train length record helped drive record crude productivity. Specifically, we handled 6% more volume with just 1% increase in crew starts. In addition, we were near our quarterly fuel efficiency record. All of these factors combined to help drive a record second quarter operating ratio.","Moving to our operation on slide 10. Our reportable injury ratio was up sequentially, but our serious injury ratio improved 10%. The safety of our employees and the communities we serve continues to be our top priority and where we focus a lot of attention.","We are also taking significant steps to improve our service levels. Our service composite performance as well as train speed declined sequentially, but we improved on dwell, which is encouraging.","We are more fluid in the south since resumption of pump operations at Chattanooga, which was idled in 2017. To continue to improve service, a portion of the hump was reactivated on May 17 to keep pace with near-record carloads. This hybrid model, which calls for the humping of local traffic while still utilizing block swaps for through traffic gives us the best balance between service and efficiency.","In addition, we are increasing our hiring to handle our strong growth. Our train and engine hiring target is now 1,800 for the year, an increase of 700 over our initial plan, which will result in a net of approximately 300 qualified conductors from now until the end of the year. In the interim, we are continuing to utilize our temporary transfers and our rapid deployment Go Team initiatives in our areas of need.","On the locomotive side, our DC to AC conversion program is paying dividends by giving us more powerful and reliable locomotives at a lower cost. We have received 75 of these units and an additional 50 will be coming online this year.","In the meantime, we are temporarily supplementing our fleet with leased locomotives. 130 of these units are on the property and pulling freight and another 25 are due this quarter. As our velocity improves, additional locomotive capacity will also be created.","In closing, beyond simply improving our current service levels, our plan will allow us to handle continued growth. As our resources continue to come online, our operational improvements will accelerate. We are committed to enhancing service performance and are confident we are taking the right steps to drive meaningful improvement of our service metrics in the second half of 2018.","I will now turn it over to Cindy, who will cover the financials.","Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Let's take a look at the second quarter operating results starting on slide 12. This quarter, we delivered record financial results. As Alan discussed, we had strong revenue growth of 10%, which helped drive all-time record income from railway operations of over $1 billion, 18% higher than last year. We also achieved a record second quarter operating ratio of 64.6%, improving on last year's results by 230 basis points. Just as a reminder, 2017 results have been recast to reflect the required reporting reclassification of certain pension and post-retirement costs.","Slide 13 illustrates the changes to operating expenses. In total, operating expenses increased by $107 million or 6%. Let's take a look at the details starting with fuel. Fuel rose by $82 million, primarily due to higher prices, which added $71 million. Consumption was up 5% over the prior year relative to the 6% increase in shipments. Purchased services and rents increased $38 million or 10%.","Equipment rents expense rose $14 million, the result of higher volume-related costs and slower network velocity. Purchased services increased $24 million, largely a result of transportation and engineering related activities and higher intermodal volumes. The materials and other category decreased $9 million or 5%. This quarter included $20 million of rental income associated with operating property, which you'll recall is now included in this expense category. This was partially offset by approximately $5 million of increased locomotive material usage, primarily due to an increase in locomotives and service, and $4 million of higher environmental remediation expenses.","Finally, compensation and benefits decreased by $13 million or 2%. A favorable Supreme Court ruling was issued in June related to employment taxes withheld on stock-based compensation. As a result, we recognized $31 million benefit for this refund of employment taxes paid on equity awards for prior years. Reduced head count levels saved $17 million over the same quarter last year. Headcount was approximately 550 positions fewer than in the second quarter of 2017 and up about 100 sequentially as we've increased our T&E hiring while continuing to decrease head count in other areas.","Consistent with the first quarter, lower health and welfare rates also resulted in savings of approximately $9 million versus last year. Incentive compensation was $34 million higher than in the second quarter of 2017 as we have continued to achieve strong financial results during the first half of the year.","Overtime and recrews increased compensation and benefits by $13 million. Finally, with respect to head count, we expect average head count to continue to trend sequentially up slightly in the last half.","And moving to slide 14, you can see that our strong operating results resulted in an 18% increase in income before taxes and contributed to record second quarter net income of $710 million, up 43% year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share also set second quarter record at $2.50, a 46% improvement.","Now wrapping up our financial overview on slide 15. Free cash flow for the first six months was a record $990 million and over $1.1 billion has been returned to shareholders, up 47% compared to last year through the repurchase of 4.8 million shares of our common stock for $700 million and $408 million of dividend payments.","Thank you for your attention. I'll turn the call back to Jim.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Thank you, Cindy. As you can clearly see, we are well-positioned for success as we look forward to the balance of the year. Volumes on our network remain robust at levels that we have not seen in over a decade and we are adding resources to improve service for our customers.","Our strong performance this quarter enables us to continue our progress toward our goals to generate shareholder value. We are confident in our long-term prospects for success and the strength of our franchise as we continue to execute our strategy.","With that, thank you for your attention, and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thank you, operator, and good morning, Jim and team. Alan, I think you mentioned that pricing is both an emphasis and an opportunity for you. I was wondering if we can dive into that opportunity part. Is the opportunity continuing to be on some of that truck competitive business in both intermodal and merchandise or are there other areas too that we should be focused on?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah, Jason, good point. It is an opportunity for us going forward as I have talked previously about the cadence of pricing. We felt like the tight truck market would lead to improvements in pricing well into 2019 and that's precisely what we're seeing now. And you can see that reflected in our numbers with a 20% improvement in intermodal revenue and an 8% improvement in merchandise revenue.","The truck market is exceptionally tight. Inventory levels are still very low and the consumer economy and the industrial economy are doing well. So, there's a high demand for our services and it creates a very good pricing opportunity for us.","Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. Next follow-up question is going to be for Michael on productivity. Can you talk about productivity in the back half of the year? What we should look for? I mean, you just posted an all-time record in train lengths. Is that going to continue or are we going to start to plateau? And what are some of the other areas that we should look for, for the NS to show improvement in two half 2018?","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah. So, we continue to focus on train length. Obviously, you have to balance that in the terminals with getting trains in and out of there. So, train lengths will continue on. That's a good new story.","The other thing is, as the railroad continues to get better and we've seen the railroad slowly continue to get better, we'll have productivity in locomotives because we'll be shedding the locomotives and not needing as many of those and that relates into lower cost for locomotive maintenance. Recrews will go down, overtime will go down. All those things that come out as the railroad continues to get better. So, that's \u2013 those are the things that will come out as we continue to make the railroad faster. But there's also other initiatives we continue to work on. But right now, our focus is on service restoration but still initiatives in the pipeline that are always on our mind.","Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thank you, everyone. Appreciate the time as always.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Reustle with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Just looking at intermodal, specifically in pricing there. It remained strong, but it did flatten out relative to the first quarter. I was wondering if you can talk about some of the dynamics there, particularly with mix, international versus domestic? But if you're still seeing tailwinds domestically into the back half of the year, what are potential for reacceleration in that pricing?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah, Matt, we certainly are. We just effectively finished up bid season, some of the shorter term business and the more transactional, and we're very pleased and encouraged by the results of the great increases we got there. If you look at our pricing year-over-year within intermodal, it was higher than \u2013 in second quarter than it was in first quarter and it improved with each month as we move through the second quarter. So, as I stated before, our contract structure and the general pricing environment gives us a lot of confidence on our ability to continue to secure price in truck competitive business well into 2019.","Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. And just to follow up in somewhat related terms. I know it's hard to differentiate between the tight trucking market and what we have going on with fuel prices. But I'm wondering, are your customers talking to you about the higher fuel prices? And do you see an opportunity where some of this market share shift you can actually hold on to as trucking capacity comes to the market? Is there any way to think through that in terms of what's sustainable here from some of the volume growth you've seen from the tight trucking market?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah. I think there's some structural changes in the trucking market that are irrespective of fuel. One of them is the growth in e-commerce. In 2004, U.S. e-commerce sales were about $71 billion. Last year, they were about $453 billion. You got ELDs and hours of service. And basically, initially, the impact of those was greater than what was originally expected. And then lastly is labor. It's been almost 10 years since the last recession, so there aren't a lot of truck drivers on the sideline waiting to get back into that market.","Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens, Inc. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks, and good morning. So, maybe to start with a couple questions on the OR. Jim, you made the comment that you're on track to achieve the sub-65% OR target ahead of schedule. I'm curious if we should translate that into pulling that forward a year. Do you think that's achievable in 2019? And then, more near term, the last few years, you've seen a sequential improvement in the OR in the third quarter. Is that same seasonality your expectation this year? Just curious if you think directionally that's where we go or if there's anything that would prevent that from being the case.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Well, we certainly do expect to have a lower operating ratio year-over-year for the full year of 2018. We've said that since the beginning of the year and that's (00:24:12).","Longer term, our goal remains the sub-65% operating ratio by 2020 or sooner. We're making excellent progress on that with our outlook for this year. And so we are in the middle of long-range planning and redefinition of some of our long-range goals, and we'll be back to talk about that more at a later day. But that's certainly a necessary and appropriate thing given the progress that we've made on our long-range plan \u2013 our current long-range plan thus far.","As far as the seasonality is concerned, within the year, you do have some of that in each year. I wouldn't expect this year to be different in terms of the usual seasonal pattern. But as I did say, we expect the full-year operating ratio certainly to be lower.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And secondly, just given some of the recent macro headlines, I was wondering if you could share the percentage of your business that you feel is exposed to international trade. And within that number, could you talk about the geographies or commodity groups where you see the most uncertainty with some of the recent news that we've seen on tariffs?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah. Justin, basically, our percentage of volume and revenue associated with international trade pretty much approximates that of the U.S. economy. It's effectively 20% to 30%. Digging into that, which you asked about geography, Mexico is a very modest amount. Canada is a little bit more, but it's still less than 5% of our revenues. The big ticket items are international intermodal, export coal, and international merchandise business.","As we take a look at trade skirmishes and potential trade war, we don't see much of an impact at all in 2018. It will be longer than that for supply chains to readjust.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Make sense. I'll leave at that. Appreciate the time this morning.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities","Thanks. Good morning. Let's see. So, I wanted to understand how you make the decision to take on incremental intermodal business, specifically in the environment that we're seeing right now, which is capacity constrained. And you obviously have a lot of different traffic that's competing for the space on the network, so curious to know how you evaluate intermodal and specifically whether it's based on its OR or ROIC.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Well, it's both. We're certainly looking at the OR and the ROIC of that business along with the others as we add traffic to the network. We are \u2013 as you know, we have a multichannel strategy and we work closely with our various channel partners to determine optimal levels of traffic on the network, and so that's a partnership with our channel partners.","And we're looking to take advantage of the capacity that we do have and to grow where we can, certainly with an emphasis on volume growth, but also pricing in this environment. Alan, you want to add anything to that?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah. Allison, we work closely with our customers and also with our operating team to make sure that we've got the capacity to handle the growth. If it's generating good incremental returns for Norfolk Southern and our shareholders and we have the ability to do it, well, bring it on. You've also seen us close a couple of lanes this year where we weren't generating the returns that we needed to. So, it's a balanced approach. It's a great market for us. We have improved the incrementals within our intermodal franchise over the last couple years. And this year, we've been able to deliver 20% revenue growth.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities","Okay. And just following up on the capacity comments. You mentioned you do have capacity. Is that sort of on an overall basis for the network? And if you had to think about it in some of the big corridors, could you maybe parse out where the capacity utilization is on some of the major lanes?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Sure. As a general proposition, we have more capacity on the northern region than we do on the southern region of our network because we're largely double tracked in the north, but not in the south. Now, that said, with the uptick in commodity's volumes, there's plenty of traffic up north as well as down south right now. So, capacity and capacity utilization are a dynamic equation in our business. We do believe that as the network picks up speed that we will generate capacity and that we will thereby be even better positioned to take on more growth.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities","Okay. Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi Investment Research","Hey, thanks, and good morning. Jim, a couple of questions ago you had a comment about sort of the long-term planning and sort of implied or sounded like you might be considering making some updates at some point. I guess, I just wanted to sort of explore that a little bit further. When you think about it, would that be in the context or the scope of everything including OR targets and beyond? Or how do you think about that, I guess, in terms of what you might be sort of reviewing or what the timeframe might look like?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Our next long-range plan will certainly be a combination of financial targets, just as our current plan is. It will continue to emphasize operating ratio improvement. That's important to investors. We've said all along that we never plan to stop at 65%. We'll continue to push past 65%. But it's a balanced plan. We're looking to grow as well. And increased return on capital, that will be a part of our next long-range plan as well. The process is underway. We're working hard, focused very intently on developing our next long-range plan given the progress that we have made under our current plan. And we'll be back to talk to you later in the year about our progress in that planning exercise.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi Investment Research","Okay. That's very helpful. Appreciate it. And just quick followup on service cost. I apologize if I missed it, conflicting calls this morning. But did you quantify what the actual service cost was in 2Q relative to what you incurred in the first quarter, maybe how that looks in the back half?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Sure. So, we did incur a service cost in the second quarter. They did come down a bit from the first quarter given the additional volume on the network. That absorbed some of the costs \u2013 extra costs we allocated to the volume growth. But we did incur some service costs and service is not where we wanted to be and where our customers expect and deserve to be. So, a part of work on that, Mike went through some of the things we're doing.","With that said, we did make excellent improvement in margin with the lower operating ratio and we were able to deliver a lot of the growth we experienced to the bottom line.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi Investment Research","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, I wanted to ask you about, I guess, a couple of specific items in the kind of comp and benefits and maybe how that affects the OR. You had a $31 million payroll tax benefit in the quarter. You had a $34 million higher incentive comp. So, those two seem to offset each other I would guess in the quarter or roughly so. How would you think about those two items going forward? It sounds like payroll tax might be one-time, but I'm not sure if you faced a similar headwind on incentive comp in third quarter. So, I think really, how to think about that and how that affects comp and benefits per worker in third quarter, fourth quarter?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Cindy?","Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Sure, Tom. In terms of the employment tax refund, you're right. It's basically sort of a one-time item. It refers back to prior years, so I wouldn't expect there to be any benefit with that really too much going forward.","On the incentive comp, that's really based on the results of the company and the business. We had strong results in the first half, so that resulted in an increase in our incentive comp that we recognized in the second quarter.","I will remind you that last year we had a similar increase in incentive comp in the third quarter, so the timing was a little bit different. So, as we go further into the year, it will all depend upon what the business results are doing. And it could go up, it could go down, it could stay the same, but it will be highly tied to the results of the business.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. But the comparison is easier, I guess, in third quarter because you accrued more last year. Is that what you're saying?","Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","You're right. There was a large accrual in the third quarter of last year.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then, just I guess for the follow-up question, I might have missed this. I was on another call earlier. But, Jim, where do you think we're at in terms of the network investments and improvement? It seems like you've seen stabilization some improvement in dwell time and things and velocity. Are you kind of past valley and you've got room for it to ramp further or just how do you think about your kind of confidence in the path forward on the network metrics?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah. Well, I think we are making progress. We've seen a modest uptick in train speeds thus far in the third quarter. Terminal dwell is still too high and we need to push train speeds back up to that 23, 24 mile per hour zone and bring dwell down accordingly.","Now, behind the scenes though, we believe we're seeing some improvements. Just a couple of the things that we watch, car counts within our major classification yards have generally been within yard capacity for the last month or so. We watch the inbound pipelines for the major classification yards very, very closely. And those have been manageable. But that's an indication of network fluidity.","And the overall active trains out on the network, that peaked probably a month, month and a half ago. That's come down. So, that's a good sign. Still too many cars online that really has not come down, so we're managing that right now trying to get cars online down to a more normal level.","So, all in all, I think the network is running better. It has stayed fluid throughout and the traffic is moving. Customer service, not where we want it to be though, not where our customers expect it to be, so we're still hard at work on making improvements.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, operator. Thanks, everybody. Jim, Canadian National on their call last night in an answer to the questions around long-term targets talked about having OR targets that are the leader of the Class I pack, which I think was an effective way to communicate it. Given volume, to some degree, is out of your control; to a large degree is out of your control. So, I was hoping you could do the same thing vis-\u00e0-vis CSX. I understand that in any given year, there could be differences for various reasons whether they're short term, mid term or long term. But over time, is there any reason that Norfolk should have a different return profile than CSX? And if you can just help us think about that from a structural standpoint I think that would be helpful. Thank you.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Look, margin improvement is important. We get that OR improvement \u2013 consistent OR improvement is part of our plan. And in fact, we have lowered our operating ratio 10 consecutive quarters year-over-year as you've seen. So, we're very focused on operating ratio improvement. Ours is a plan with balance in it though. We also are looking to grow the top line. I wouldn't call ours a growth strategy. It's a strategy to improve return on capital. That does include growth, but also a healthy dose of margin improvement and capital efficiency as well. So, we're going to continue to push on operating ratio when we get to the current goal of sub-65%. We certainly won't stop there.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, I don't want to put obviously words into your mouth, but if I can just think about it, meaning there's no real structural reason, but maybe you guys want to focus a little bit more on growth than maybe some of the other competitors out there. Is that a fair way of characterizing it? Or is that wrong?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","I will say this is a terrific environment in which to grow. And we have been executing on growth by sending that growth to the bottom line and that's how you get to the kind of operating income improvements that we put up this quarter. So, I think in our business, it is cyclical. You better jump on that growth opportunity when you have it and that's what we're executing on right now. Productivity remains a consistent focus. It too is an important tool in getting the operating ratio lower and the bottom line up.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Sure. Let me ask one followup unrelated to that, just more on the balance sheet. So, Union Pacific obviously and then CSX both expanded the balance sheet in recent quarters and returned more cash to shareholders obviously given the confidence in the business and the environment. Is this kind of assessment of the balance sheet within the scope of how you guys are evaluating your long-term plan, i.e. is the company, is Norfolk Southern evaluating what the optimal cap structure is? Or are you kind of comfortable with where you are today? Just any thoughts there.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","We are examining capital structure and we recognize that with the impact of tax reform we have delevered to some extent. So, that is certainly part of our planning process. We're taking a look at capital structure as well as operating.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Cindy, can you just update us on where the adjusted gross debt to adjusted EBITDA is as of the last measuring point so we have the apples-to-apples number on how you guys are thinking about it, how the credit rating agencies think about as well?","Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Well, we have met with the credit agency \u2013 both credit agencies actually this quarter, and we are committed to maintaining BBB+, Baa1 credit rating. And we want to stay sort of in the middle of that. And we are \u2013 as Jim said, we are currently evaluating our leverage and whether we have some additional debt capacity. And we're just going to (00:39:12) continue to do that. So, that's sort of where we are right now.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks, guys. Congrats on a good quarter. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets","Yeah, thanks very much, operator. Good morning, everyone. Just coming back on the OR question. And Jim, I always thought that I understood that and it did make sense that you want to have a balanced approach to operating ratio improvement with growth. What we've seen however is that you can have both while there is initial kind of disruption as you realign your network to achieve a structurally lower OR, but that disruption effectively goes away. And we've seen evidence of it certainly with the Canadian peers and starting to see it with the U.S. \u2013 with the CSX. They're generating operating ratio of about 500 or more basis point difference than you, but still in the case of, for example, CNCP, they're guiding to 5% to 7% growth, which is probably as much growth as you'd want. Isn't there a case here to take some short-term pain to restructure your operation a little quicker, take the service hit, but then on a go-forward basis be generating that same growth rate at a much lower OR?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","First of all, we play close attention to industry developments and we're watching our peers and watch what's going on in the industry and open to any and all best practices in terms of operations or otherwise. And we are looking at operating our railroad differently in a variety of ways as well. Let me just give you a couple of examples. We are about to restructure our divisional and regional transportation leadership positions. So, that's in an effort to streamline operations and push our strategic plan at the field level. Those frontline supervisors will have responsibility in the future not only for transportation, but for car mechanical operations as well, increasing their span of control and ability to influence the business.","We are bringing our dispatchers into Atlanta. By the end of this year, we'll have everyone centralized under renegotiated implementing agreement by the way. They're in Atlanta side by side with our network operations team, our locomotive control team, our service design team. And that's an industry best practice that we are embracing. And that's a change for us. Something to be said for distributed dispatch in the field, but centralized dispatching is the norm these days and that's what we're going to do as well. We're also working on simplifying our operating plan locally and improving our terminal operations going through the network node-by-node, location-by-location and focusing on a local operating plan at each venue that we can execute well consistently.","We're doing that in collaboration with our customers. They are very much a part of that planning process and executing a local service plan that works for them and works for us. So, we're certainly not satisfied with the status quo of our operations and we're pushing change in a lot of different areas. Right now...","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets","Do you see any \u2013 go ahead.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","I was just going to say right now, we are very focused on getting customer service back to where it needs to be as I said. And we're going to add some conductor trainings this year. Mike gave you the numbers. Overall head count was down significantly year-over-year. And labor productivity remains a very, very important objective. But adding T&E is the right thing to do when we have a growth environment like we have right now.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets","Do you see anything more dramatic as just being too risky? If you take your number of hump yards on your system and cutting them by 70% or 80%, the kind of big \u2013 bigger type of changes, do you see that as too risky to do at this point given the demand that you're seeing? Is that a good characterization or...","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","A classification network that can provide good local service is one of the keys to growth in the merchandise network.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets","Right.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","So, we have rationalized our yard network and we'll continue to look at that, but it is important to maintain adequate classification capacity. And we closed a couple of hump yards and we brought one back recently. So, it's a dynamic plan. It's ambient (00:43:49) customer service and efficiency.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And just last question here on pricing. I know you don't guide to it, but is there \u2013 it's a good time to be in freight transportation. You're seeing tight capacity across all modes and that's leading to some standard price increases. Is there any reason why due to mix or contract types or whatever it might be that you wouldn't get the same same-store pricing as your peers?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Alan?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","This is a great environment for pricing.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets","Yeah.","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","You see truck rates going up contract 12%, spot rates going up, double that. So, as I said, pricing is an opportunity for us and it's an emphasis. We saw our pricing year-over-year improved in second quarter relative to first quarter and we saw our pricing improved as the quarter progressed. And we've said that our pricing will continue to improve as we move into 2019.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. So, I wanted to just try the margin one a little bit differently. So, if you look over a 30-year period, your margin is 300 basis points better on average than CSX. Do you think your \u2013 forget about what you're operating ratio target is and theirs, do you think your network is structurally better than theirs?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","I like our network a lot, Scott. I think we have an outstanding network with a lot of potential for both efficiency and growth. We go a lot of places. We have great partnerships with our customers, with our channel partners. And we have a terrific opportunity to achieve greater productivity and growth.","So, I'll take our network any day. And I think we're going to continue to push on all fronts. We are very, very focused on our strategic plan and developing a successor to it. And that plan will include significant efficiencies, significant growth, and, as always, the focus on safety as well.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then just quickly for Alan. Can you just help us a little bit, any way to think about the benefit of the WTI surcharges kicking in the third quarter? And then any color you can give us on kind of model coal revenue per car going forward? Just if you think that will be higher or lower sequentially as we go into the back half.","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Scott, so I'll take the fuel surcharge one first and remind you that we've been successful over the last several years of transitioning off of a WTI-based program to a highway diesel-based program, which frankly more closely follows the path of our expenses.","So, right now, over two-thirds of our base revenue is associated with an on-highway diesel based program. About 25% is associated with WTI. And the majority of that is now in the money. There's a little bit of a lag associated with that and so we saw that improved as the quarter moved on. More important for us is price and we are very confident in our ability to secure price in this competitive and economic environment.","With respect to coal, there's several moving parts in there. One is export. We had pretty strong growth in our export volumes in the quarter. It was up 21%. However, our net export coal, which, as you know, tends to be higher rated, was up 4%. So, the predominance of that came through \u2013 the growth came through steam coal, which tends to be lower rated. And also, we had a little negative mix within our utility franchise. Last year in the second quarter, we are about 50\/50 in terms of Utility North versus Utility South. This year, we were \u2013 58% of our utility tonnage was in the north, which tends to be a shorter length of haul.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Do you think those two things, just real quick, the north steam versus met and export and more north or south you think those continue in the back half?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","I think there's an opportunity to grow the Utility South franchise a little bit more than the Utility North going forward. Stockpiles are starting to come down and there's been a lot of heat in the southeast. The steam in met is going to be highly dependent upon overseas demand. The forward curve for API2 is moving up. The forward curve for the met coal overseas is moving down, but it's largely range bound and we don't really see any big catalyst for shock there.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Does that make sense, Scott?","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Yes, it does. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, just going back to the OR, always decent noise on that metric. But since it is a singular one, it gets a lot of focus. Two, we get a little bit of clarity on maybe a cleaner rate for the quarter and looking into the second half of the year. So, it looks like the employment tax was maybe about 100 basis points help in the quarter. Just curious to see what the OpEx of fuel did to the OR. And then on gain on properties, it's become more prevalent in the railroad industry in general, but can you just call out what they were in the quarter? They're down year-over-year and for the first half of the year, but is that the spot where we should expect them to stay for the rest of the year?","Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yes, Brian. In terms of the fuel's impact on the OR, on revenue, we had about $72 million worth of incremental fuel revenue. The incremental fuel expense was about $82 million. So, in terms of a detriment both to operating income as well as operating ratio. In terms of the property sales, we really didn't have very significant operating property sales in the quarter. And those are \u2013 they're difficult to predict from quarter-to-quarter. We've said that before. I will tell you that even though they were not significant in the second quarter, we continue to focus very strongly on looking at all of our property. And if it's property that we don't need for the business, we're looking to monetize that. So, we would expect to see operating property sales going forward. It's just hard to tell you exactly when they may happen because some of these things take a while.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And can you quantify, Cindy, the actual impact on OR from fuel in the quarter just from an optic perspective because it's essentially passed through? But that sound like it actually was a negative drag as well if I heard you correctly?","Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yes, it was negative. Negative.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Anything on the \u2013 can you quantify the basis point impact on OR in the quarter?","Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Well, if you look at fuel, just the price, the price part of fuel, so in revenue, the price was about $68 million was related to price. On the expense side, it was about $71 million. So, for \u2013 on OR, that's about 100 basis point impact.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you very much. If I could just ask one quick question on capacity. STB is still monitoring service. Service is clearly improving a bit here. I guess for Alan and Mike, how do you think about balancing the network? Can you continue to grow volumes at this clip without taking up CapEx?","And just curious if there's conversation internally about needing to improve some of the operating resiliency, maybe cast a wider net with the infrastructure to capture volume growth where it might tick up unexpectedly. Or do you think you can kind of vantage at these levels through higher head count, pricing and some better efficiency to release some capacity in the back half of the year and into next year?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Brian let me take a stab at that. Certainly, the capacity CapEx question first. We have spent consistently in our capital budgets on capacity all across the region. So, if you look back over the years, we have invested where we needed to invest to address capacity tightness at locations on the network. And we'll certainly continue to do that.","We're going to try to be very thoughtful about that and very strategic with where we put that money. And that's important for one thing because these are long-term investments. And investments in infrastructure capacity are not a quick fix for any service concerns at the moment. So, we have to be thinking years ahead when we make those capacity investments, where are the pinch points on the network that need to be addressed for the long term.","So, in the short term, network velocity and efficiency and customer service really are about injecting crews and locomotives into the network. And that's what we're focused on right now. We take a longer term view of the capacity investments, trying to find places on the network where we can make a real long-term difference by increasing capacity.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for your time this morning.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Great. Good morning. Alan, just to followup on Scott's question there. Did you update your outlook on export coal volumes for the year?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah. Ken, I said 6 million tons to 8 million tons per quarter moving forward.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks for that clarification. And then, Jim, I know you've got a lot on the OR and you keep mentioning you watch peers and you adapt. And I'm just wondering with your peer now at 58% and I guess if you adjust out the 100 basis points impact from the comp and benefit gain, it's a 700 basis point differential. And so just where do you see the cost opportunities? Is it the employment that you talked about? Is it the efficiency? How do you adjust? And then, I guess, on that point, Mike, do you feel like you need to bring in additional precision real expertise into the management team to create some of that overhaul that maybe Walter was kind of questioning about?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Ken, as I've said several times, we certainly understand the importance of margin improvement and we are pushing hard on the operating ratio, and we will continue to do so. Not stopping at 65%, but continuing to drive for lower operating ratios. That is a critical element of continued financial results for us. Ours is a balanced plan. We are looking for long-term growth in this franchise that we can pair with the margin improvements just as we did in the second quarter of this year to drive the bottom line. We \u2013 as I said, we are open to all best practices and we are certainly watching closely what goes on in this industry all across the industry and making a number of changes to our own operations, some of which I went through earlier. And we'll continue to do that. Part of our long-range planning process will definitely be to examine the operating plan we currently run and figure out ways we can run better.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","No, I understand that. I think you kind of went over a bunch of those points. I was just wondering, where do you see the opportunity to improve, right? You said you're looking at your plan. You might change and adapt and lower from the 65% in your next long-term plan. Just, is it \u2013 is there other particular areas where you see the exaggerated improvement? Is it the network operations? Is it employment? I'm just wondering where you see the biggest opportunities to adjust those changes?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Cost structure in our business comes down to people and assets. Certainly, labor productivity is key. Now, right now, we're focused on ramping up T&E to get T&E back to where it needs to be to provide the customer service. But other areas within the workforce are coming down. And you will continue to see us focus on head count. That's a big cost center for us. Network velocity, spending the assets is a big part of cost structure as well, managing cars online, managing the number of locomotives you have out there pulling freight, managing all of the other assets we have. And we will continue to push on asset productivity certainly as part of this planning as well.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, just \u2013 if I can just followup on that, right? Because the biggest differential I guess is when you talked about the employees, right? I mean, it's a significant differential in terms of number of employees. So, are there \u2013 when you look at the network structure, do you have to \u2013 that's why I was asking do you need to bring in additional precision rail expertise to make that monumental change or to assist in that change in order to get those large employment kind of cost differentials out of the network?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","I'm very, very confident in our operations team and their ability to drive productivity, while laying and maintaining a foundation for growth. So, I think we're in great shape as a team. We're always open to outside practices and outside perspectives and we do bring those in from time-to-time. So, I think we've got a good plan and we're going to continue to pursue it.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks. Look forward to hearing the details of that next plan. Appreciate the time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please proceed with your question.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thanks for taking my question here. And rail learning season is almost over. If there's been one consistent analyst question for you guys and your management team, it's some version of why can't you put up results more like CSX's. And while that's already been asked several times today, Jim, I'm curious if you could speak for management and the board on your longer term strategic response to the changing competitive landscape in the east. I mean, into that, I mean in NS's view is what CSX's management team has accomplished over the last year and a half is that driving short-term profits at the expense of long-term growth? And I guess the natural extension of that is, do you think your shareholders will be better served over the next two to three years by the current strategy versus a more aggressive push into some of the operational change that your peer has made?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","We are pushing very aggressively on all fronts to drive results for shareholders. So, we are approaching every day with a sense of urgency and enthusiasm about our performance and a desire to get better every single day.","So, as I said, we are always open to best practices. We're watching the industry. We're doing things differently ourselves, driving for shareholder value. So, I'm very confident that we're on the right track and that we are going to pursue a balanced plan that includes both efficiency and growth and we'll produce great results for shareholders as a result.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","So, does that suggest that while the CSX moves have been very effective in the short term that you think that that strategy purely pushed in that direction could be damaging long term? I'm just kind of curious what the board's perspective is?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Well, we believe in our plan. And our plan is a balance of efficiency and growth, as I've said several times this morning. That really is the right formula in our view. You do need to make the investments for growth. You do need to have a certain level of resources available, particularly in times that are conducive to growth like these times.","So, while we are definitely focused on productivity going forward, right now is the time to make sure that you have the workforce in place to handle the business, so that you can grow when that's possible. So, I think our plan will be the right plan for our shareholders in the future.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you for your perspective, Jim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, Jim, not to pepper you with another one here versus your competitor, but I do think it's important when you think about the cost structure of someone you're going to bat against especially with competitive contracts, I mean, we know there's not that much overlap in business in the east, but definitely some jump-off here. And just looking at the metrics at least optically, it does appear that CSX has the right formula here with much lower labor cost and higher velocity in the past year. So, I mean, what \u2013 do you have any concerns going forward that while we might actually be quite uncompetitive from a cost structure and a service perspective as we look out into 2019 and 2020?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","We are very focused on cost structure as well, and cost structure is critical in our business. We are an asset-intensive resource, intensive business. And you have to mind those resources every day. So, sweating the assets and making sure that we have the right level of people and other resources to get the job done is critical in our business. And we'll continue to focus on that, very focused on cost structure.","You also have to make the investments in order to grow them. So, we're going to make those. We're going to continue to keep the people on the stuff that we need to generate that growth and support great customer service, and likewise for all of the other resources we employ.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Alliance Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question, and I will not ask about the operating ratio. I would like to know a little bit, Alan, about something that is going right. You guys are outgrowing the market in domestic intermodal by a factor of 1, 1.5, and you're getting a little bit better price. What are you guys doing right in the domestic intermodal business right now? And how should we think about how sustainable that could be over the next, call it, 12 to 24 months?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah, that's a great question. We've got the best intermodal franchise in the east. And to pivot off what Jim said, we've made investments in this intermodal franchise over time and that is bearing fruit for us and for our shareholders. And that's why we've been able to deliver 20% growth in intermodal in each quarter this year. And our confidence remains very high on our ability to execute going forward. Our customers want to continue to do business with us and are very excited about the growth prospects in this economic environment moving forward. So, we're in great shape with our intermodal franchise. We've improved price. We've improved the margins on it. And we're benefiting from the investments that we've made in recent years to support this growth and provide a service product.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Is there anything you can help us to understand kind of at a \u2013 from a top-down level? We spent some time with the intermodal schedules, but if you were to think about kind of how your transit times compare versus other transit times in the marketplace, like how big of an advantage is there? And do you see any risk? Or is there \u2013 or there's some structural things that you guys have that allow you to keep that transit time advantage in the schedule?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah. We got a great network between Chicago and Eastern PA and then down to Atlanta. Our primary form of competition is truck and we're able to leverage the tight truck market into 20% growth. We're also doing that in our merchandise network. I mean, recognize that our merchandise revenue was up 8% in the second quarter. And if you combine our growth rate in merchandise and intermodal, we outpace the growth rate in truck volume over 300 miles in the first half of this year. So, we have a great franchise whether it's intermodal, coal or merchandise. And we're competing very hard, very aggressively against truck and it's delivering results.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","All right. Appreciate the added color. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you .Mr. Squires, there are no further questions. I'll turn the floor back to you for any final comments.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Well, thank you very much, everyone.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Clay Moore, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Clay Moore","Thank you, Adam, and good afternoon. Before we begin, please note that during today's call we may make certain forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important.","The slides of the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors Section. Additionally, a transcript and downloads will be posted after the call. For comparative purposes the fourth quarter and full year 2017 results have been adjusted to exclude the re-measurement of deferred taxes due to the enactment of tax reform in 2017 and 2018 comparisons are to be adjusted 2017 results. Please refer to our non-GAAP reconciliation, which is also available on our website.","Now, it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires.","Jim Squires","Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Norfolk Southern's fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. Joining me today are Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer, Mike Wheeler, Chief Operating Officer, and Cindy Earhart, Chief Financial Officer.","In the fourth quarter, we once again delivered strong financial results. Slide 4 highlights the results for the quarter and full year 2018, compared to the prior year. Income from operations was 1.1 billion, an increase of 27% and an all-time quarterly record. Net income was 702 million, up 44% over the prior year and EPS was 257, a 52% increase. The operating ratio for the quarter was 62.8.","For the full year, we achieved record income from operations totaling nearly 4 billion, an increase of 17% from 2017. Net income increased 39% to 2.7 billion and earnings per share increased 44% to 951. The full year operating ratio of 65.4 was a record for our company and was our third consecutive year of OR improvement. In addition to lowering the OR and boosting earnings in 2018, we returned more than 3.6 billion to shareholder through share buybacks and dividends and our Board of Directors yesterday increased the quarterly dividend by another 8%.","Looking ahead, we are determined to take Norfolk Southern to even greater heights. At our Investor Day, on February 11th, we will go over our new operational and financial targets and discuss in detail all of the initiatives with which we will drive shareholder value.","Now to provide further details on our fourth quarter results, Alan will cover trends in revenue, Mike will cover operational performance, and Cindy will go over the financial results. I'll now turn the call over to Alan.","Alan Shaw","Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon to everyone. As you can see on Slide 6, strength in all three business units drove the fourth quarter revenue increase of 9%. Each business unit posted a revenue per unit gain of 7%, reflecting both improved pricing and higher fuel surcharge revenue, as Norfolk Southern delivered fourth quarter year-over-year pricing increases that were the highest in over six years.","Merchandise revenue grew 7%, generating a fourth-quarter revenue record on flat volume. As carload gains in chemicals and agriculture were offset by weakness in automotive and metals and construction. Our success in pursuit of pricing improvement, combined with higher fuel prices, resulted in a record merchandised revenue per unit.","Norfolk Southern intermodal franchise once again delivered record-breaking revenue and volume results for the quarter. Our outstanding intermodal franchise, combined with tightness in the trucking sector and high levels of consumer spending, has generated three consecutive quarters of record intermodal volume. Intermodal revenue reached an all-time high in the quarter, reflecting a combination of improved volume, pricing strength and increased fuel surcharge revenue.","Moving to coal, revenue increased 7% with a corresponding 7% increase in revenue per unit as a result of pricing gains in fuel surcharge revenue. Volume increased 1% as our utility franchise benefited from increased winter demand in high natural gas prices in the fourth quarter, while export volume was limited by coal availability.","Moving to Slide 7. In 2018, Norfolk Southern achieved revenue growth in all three business units, including record revenue in both merchandise and intermodal, while handling record volumes. NS delivered 9% revenue growth in 2018, on top of 7% revenue growth in 2017, while improving the margins on our business through a combination of volume growth, pricing initiatives and efficiency improvements.","Our year-over-year pricing was the highest in seven years, with strength in all business units. Throughout the year, the trucking industry experienced capacity constraints, and high truck rates, which supported strong growth in intermodal. In addition, consumer spending and industrial production both increased close to 4% in 2018, providing conditions that Norfolk Southern leveraged to drive merchandise growth.","In the energy sector, increased demand for U.S. coals and favorable fuel price differentials led to revenue gains in export coal and crude oil, respectively. Overall, Norfolk Southern delivered strong top line results and improved margins in 2018, and we look forward to building on that momentum in 2019. I'm excited about our upcoming Investor Day, and sharing with you our outlook and plans for growth.","I'll now turn it over to Mike for an update on operations.","Mike Wheeler","Thank you, Alan. Today, I will update you on the state of railroad. 2018 was a year in which we handled record volume, record gross ton miles, and achieved a record operating ratio.","Moving to our network metrics on Slide 9, we are pleased that the velocity of our railroad accelerated at the end of the fourth quarter and we drove further improvements in the first quarter of 2019. This has been achieved by the healthier T&E crude base, Clean Sheeting gaining further traction, the full implementation of our network operations center, and intense energy and execution by the field.","We are operating from a position of strength as we go into the year and are laying a good foundation for our operating plan changes that you will hear more about in our investor day next month.","Turning to some of our productivity initiatives on Slide 10, we are continuing to drive improvement in all areas. Record GTMs combined with our ongoing locomotive strategy resulted in record locomotive productivity for 2018. Beating the prior record set in 2017. We stored over 300 locomotives throughout the quarter and turned in 100 of our 180 leased locomotives.","Fuel efficiency for 2018 tied our record performance from the previous year. Both of these measures have been driven by our improvements in train length, which was a quarterly record and for the full year. This is the third consecutive year we have either matched or exceeded record annual results for these key metrics.","In closing, our full attention is looking forward. We are excited about the momentum we are delivering in operations and we expect our performance to continue to improve in 2018 and beyond.","I will now turn it over to Cindy who will cover our financial achievements.","Cindy Earhart","Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon everybody. We delivered another strong quarter and finished the year with record financial results. I'll start with fourth quarter summarize operating results on Slide 12, which as Clay mentioned earlier are compared to the adjusted 2017 results. As a reminder, 2017 results have also been recast to reflect the required reporting reclassification of certain pension and postretirement costs.","As Alan discussed, our strong revenue growth has continued into the fourth quarter. The 9% increase in revenues when combined with the slight decrease in railway operating expenses resulted in all time quarterly record for income from railway operations of $1.1 billion, 27% higher than last year. We also achieved an operating ratio of 62.8 improving our last year's by 550 basis points.","Let\u2019s take a look at the component changes in operating expenses in more detail on Slide 13. In total operating expenses were $4 million lower than last year\u2019s expenses. Gains in the sale of operating properties more than offset entire inflationary and volume-related increases. The material in another category decreased a 111 million or 66%. This quarter included a $145 million in gains on the sale of operating properties, as compared to approximately 25 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.","Property sales do fluctuate from quarter to quarter. The large sales in this quarter highlight our ongoing strategy to monetize assets that are no longer needed in our operations. The berries of this line item also included 20 million of rental income associated with operating property, which you will recall is now included in this expense category. This favorability was partially offset by higher casualty expenses, which were 9 million higher than fourth quarter 2017. We also incurred expenses associated with dispatched in our relocation which was completed in December.","Compensation and benefits rose by 27 million or 4%. The largest driver of this change is related to increase pay rates of $30 million primarily due to negotiated rate increases for our union employees that occurred in the second half of the year. Incentive compensation expense was unfavorable by $12 million this quarter related solely to the timing of these accruals. As incentive compensation is about even for the year as compared to the amount earned in 2017. Overtime and recruits also added $11 million of costs this quarter.","Consistent with our experience in prior quarters, health and welfare rates resulted in savings of approximately $9 million. Purchase services and rents increased $30 million or 7% compared to prior year results. This increase was primarily attributable to higher expenses associated with our volume related increase, higher technology cost and additional transportation and engineering activities. The remaining $8 million increase is related to higher equipment rent expense reflecting slower network velocity and the cost of additional short-term locomotive resources.","As we mentioned last quarter, we expected equipment rents to drop sequentially in the fourth quarter and it did by $14 million. Fuel rose by 36 million primarily due to higher prices which added $29 million. Consumption was up 2% over the prior year and as Mike mentioned we held our fuel efficiency metric constant.","Slide 14 shows a summary of our fourth quarter results. As you can see, other income earned for the quarter was fully offset by year-over-year negative returns on our corporate owned life insurance investments due to the decline in market performance experienced this quarter. Net income of $702 million was up 44% compared to last year's adjusted results, benefiting from our full year of the lower effective tax rate due to the enactment of tax reform. Diluted earnings per shares was $2.57, a 52% improvement over fourth quarter of 2017.","Full year results are shown on Slide 15. We set company records in both income from railway operations and operations ratios. Income from railway operations of $4 billion was a 17% improvement over 2017. The full year operating ratio of 65.4 with a 270 basis points improvement as compared to last year's results and was a record full year alone.","Slide 16 reflects our full year cash flow. Cash from operations totaled 3.7 billion, covering capital spending and generating a record 1.8 billion in free cash flow 16% higher than last year. We returned more than $3.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our previously announced 1.2 billion accelerated share repurchase program was completed during the quarter, and we continued our ongoing open market purchases.","Our share repurchases underscore our confidence in the business as we continue to drive growth and create shareholder value. As Jim noted, our board of directors remain committed to returning capital to shareholders and approved an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.86 per share, reflecting an 8% increase over the previous quarter's dividend. This marks the third increase in our dividend over the past year. We continue to deliver improving financial results and are excited about the momentum we have to drive ongoing shareholder value into the future.","Thanks for your attention and I'll turn the call back to Jim.","Jim Squires","Thank you, Cindy. Three years ago, we announced a strategic plan aimed at delivering value to our shareholders through growth, productivity and bottom line improvement. Thanks to the hard work and dedication of our employees, we did just that. We lowered our operating ratio over 700 basis points, improved operating income by 39% and increased EPS 86% compared to three years ago.","Building on these successes, we have been overhauling our operations from top to bottom in the quest for shareholder value. In short, we have been reimagining Norfolk Southern. At our Investor Day next month, we will discuss our new financial targets, the initiatives that will propel us into the future, and the metrics you will use to assess our progress. Today, our focus will be our fourth quarter and 2018 results.","Thank you for your attention, and we will now open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now be conducting our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Allison Landry from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.","Allison Landry","I realized that you plan to share a lot more detail in a couple of weeks, but wondering if you could speak broadly to when you think network fluidity will start to improve in the material way such that you can begin to eliminate the need for re-crews and additional locomotives and other added costs?","Jim Squires","Good afternoon. Allison. We will go into a lot more details at investor day, not only about our new financial targets, but about the operating initiatives that will drive the financial results. And as I mentioned, we will also be introducing some new metrics with which to gauge your progress.","Today, we are going to try to keep the focus on 2018. I do want to emphasize a couple of things that Mike pointed out in his portion of prepared remarks. We posted annual records and key productivity measures in 2018, locomotives efficiency and trend size for example. We stored more than 300 locomotives in the fourth quarter, and we returned 100 leased locomotives and that was while over the course of 2018, we handled a record volume and record gross ton miles.","In the latter part of the fourth quarter, we achieved our highest monthly network velocity for 2018 and that was in December with service and velocity continuing to improve in first quarter. So the point is, we have a lot of momentum early in 2019 as we head into our new plan period. We've gained traction through Clean Sheeting and full implementation of our network operations center, and we're operating from a position of strength as we implement the new operating platform.","Allison Landry","And maybe a question for the quarter, could you parse out the growth in domestic versus international intermodal? And maybe on the domestic side, I know you talked about tight capacity, but relative to Q3 or even if you went back a little further, has there been any change or sequential loosing in truck capacity because of lower spot rates?","Alan Shaw","Good afternoon, Allison. Our international volumes were up 9%, and the fourth quarter and domestic volume was up 4%. And yes, we've seen some loosing and the truck market. I know the market still tight and we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing so far in bid season, and we are also encouraged by what we're hearing from our channel partners with respect to their outlook from both price and volumes as we move through 2019.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee from Citi. You are now live.","Chris Wetherbee","Wanted to just sort of make sure I understood how you guys are viewing the 2018 performance to the 65.4% operating ratio obviously includes some gains and there is going to be gains and hopefully lost to a degree when you make transactions in the portfolio. So I get that, I just want to get a sense. Do you think sort of 65.4 is a good rate off of which sort of the future builds? Or maybe do we think about something that\u2019s adjusted extra of those gains? I just want to get a sense maybe how you guys think about the process?","Jim Squires","Let me comment generally for us on how we view our 65.4 annual operating ratio for 2018 and then let Cindy address how we might want to think about that going forward. We started out three years ago with the goal of the sub 65 operating ratio by 2020, and here we are with the 65.4 operating ratio in 2018. So that represents excellent progress under our prior strategic plan and we made many other financial improvements along the way. So, we are pleased with our performance up to this point. We recognize that we have much more to do and that we are intent on continuing to drive financial results and shareholder value in the future and we have a lot, lot more to say about that at Investor Day.","Cindy Earhart","Yes, Chris, I mentioned this in my comments we did have $145 million worth of gains of operating property this quarter which is high, I mean, compared to 25 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. We are going to continue to look at these assets and try to monetize them. It's very, very difficult as you know we're to be able to predict what quarter sales may come in. I certainly think that we got a very large gain in the fourth quarter around the property in Atlanta that\u2019s pretty unusual, but we are going to continue to sale property as we can. And it's going to continue to help from the operating ratio. Although, I'll say that going forward that we will continue to do that. The benefits in the operating ratio are really going to come from improved revenue and continue to push on productivity and that\u2019s what's going to drive our operating ratio long-term.","Chris Wetherbee","And then just maybe, Alan, if I could switch gears onto the coal side just to get a sense, I know again trying to keep it relatively focused on the current period, but just sort of in context of what you are seeing in the market today. Maybe a comment on the utility side what you see from an inventory perspective in early '19 and then maybe some thoughts on the export side will be helpful?","Alan Shaw","Yes, absolutely. On the utility front, stock piles have declined in the north and in the south by 17 days over the past year. And bulk of the some of our coproducing customers it's pretty clear that utilities are screaming for coal at this point and that\u2019s kind of the factor that we are seeing right now is limiting both volumes and the utility franchise and on the export side is coal availability, particularly thermal coal availability.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long from Stephens. You are now live.","Justin Long","I wanted to ask about incremental margin, if we look at the gains on sale impact this quarter and what it was last quarter and back that out. I think you get to low 40s incremental margins, which I think is below what we have come to expect from a lot of the rails especially with some of the productivity initiatives in place. Could you give us some sense of the incremental margin you expect going forward? And what you view as a more normalized number?","Jim Squires","Sure, again, let me address that generally and then I'll invite Cindy to add to my comments. I think, you think about incremental margin as being a reflection of the lower marginal cost of additional volume in part. Price -- the impact of pricing on the bottom line and productivity, those three key components, incremental margin will be a significant objective and output of the initiatives we undertaken all three areas in our new strategic plans. So recognizing the important the critical important of incremental margin that will certainly be a big part of the plan.","Cindy Earhart","Justin, I would just say that, I think we said in the past the 50% incremental margin is kind of we talked about in the past it's going to vary from quarter-to-quarter. We did have in this quarter increased cost particularly in comp and benefits around incentive comp based on the business results that we have. So I mean I think that\u2019s a sort of way we think about it.","Justin Long","And maybe for my second question, I know that you are going to get more details about the specific financial targets here at the Investor Day. But just bigger picture, as it relates to the OR performance, we heard from a variety of other class I rails that they want to lead the industry or be near the top of the fact. I know like I said, we\u2019re going to get the details today but just from a high level. Is there any reason why Norfolk can\u2019t progress from what is now the worst OR in the industry to something that's at least in the middle of the pack? Just curious how you're thinking about the OR performance relative to the rest of the industry?","Jim Squires","We will do what we need to create shareholder value adjustment and so, we understand the importance of operating ratio, and that is certainly front and center as we think about the future. So, we\u2019re going to continue to push on operating ratio. We will get there, as well as operating income and other key financial metrics. We will get through a combination of growth and efficiency.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra from Deutsche Bank. You are now live.","Amit Mehrotra","If we take out the 145 million non-cash gain in the quarter, the core operating ratio is more like 67.8%, unless I calculated something incorrectly, that\u2019s an improvement year-over-year but not nearly that impressive in the context of best pricing environment in seven years, which I think was a comment that was earlier made. So, and also obviously still far away from your peers, so what are the issues, I guess, either from a cost or volume side that maybe is not allowing you to make that type of progress of the profitability side in the context of pricing? And I guess maybe you can address in this answer the fact that you have CSX out there that is in a much better proper position and has taken out significant cost and may be in a position to drive a little bit of market share shift.","Jim Squires","I think if you step back, we have produced over 700 basis points operating improvement, operating ratio improvement under our all strategic plan. We've made significant progress on operating ratio and that\u2019s been accompanied by very strong earnings growth and shareholder returns as well. We've taken that the cash that we have generated. We have reinvested it in our company and we have returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase. So, it\u2019s been a strong performance for the last three years.","Now, we've recognized that we have more room to increase shareholder value and that's obviously our objective in the new plan. So, we\u2019re going to continue to push operating ratio is front and center as I mentioned, and we will pull out all the staffs to generate shareholder value in the coming years.","Amit Mehrotra","Just one follow-up if I could on the balance sheet, really on the cash flow side. You know every rail now I mean, UMP just brought their number down to 13.5% of sales in terms of their CapEx. CSX has been there, I think you guys are still up in that kind of much higher level is CapEx and leverage levels really CapEx. Is their ability to bring down CapEx towards where the rest of the industry is part of this evaluation? Just any update or thought there as you guys look at that.","Jim Squires","The level of CapEx going forward will obviously be depended on the return that the capital spend it can generate. In our view, 16% to 18% of revenue has been a solid range, that\u2019s what we have been doing for the last several years, and likely we will continue to. Again depending on the returns, we believe that that level of capital spending we can generate excellent shareholder returns.","Amit Mehrotra","So, 16% to 17% for the next several years is that going to be updated in February?","Jim Squires","Look, we will talk more about that at Investor Day for sure, but we previously said that we believe 16% to 18% is an appropriate zone for capital spending because it can drive the shareholder returns that we are trying to drive.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz from UBS. You are now live.","Tom Wadewitz","I wanted to get thoughts on the -- you talked about Clean Sheeting. You've identified some of the metrics that saw some benefits from that and in terms of some of the productivity metrics. Just wondering, if you could give us a sense of where you're at in that process, I know that focused on I guess the local yards. So that I'm sure there is a lot more to go to that you will talk about in February, but maybe just some thoughts on where you are at in the work on the local yards in the Clean Sheeting process?","Jim Squires","Okay and we will talk a lot more about that in a few weeks, but let me turn it over to Mike for some thoughts on what we're doing right now.","Mike Wheeler","Yes, so the initial phase of the Clean Sheeting process is going to be completed essentially crossed the railroad, early summer, and it is going very well. We are really pleased with that's why we are really focusing a lot on it. But the idea of using good industrial engineering practices to look the way we do business in our local serving yards and really any of our yards is going to turn the way we are going to do business the NS way in the future.","But once we get the Clean Sheeting initially done, we will be rolling out the new operating plan on top of that in midsummer as well. But I'll tell you, we are taking the opportunities we see now when we see an operating plan change that that works now we are going to hit and implementing it. But Clean Sheeting will be done by midsummer and then we will be implementing the new operating plan then.","Tom Wadewitz","And then, a question for you on the export coal side or maybe on the broader coal side, Alan, you mentioned that supply issues are constraint. Is that a temporary constraint? Is that just kind of near-term issues at existing mines? Or is that something where you said that\u2019s just kind of tapped out where they are running and you would have to bring new mines online in order to produce more coal?","Alan Shaw","Tom, good question and thank you for allowing me to clarify that, that is -- our perception is a temporary constraint from speaking with our partners on the production side, something that we feel like is going to cycle off by the end of the first quarter. There is very strong demand out there both overseas and domestically.","Tom Wadewitz","So, you could see tonnage growth given the market but just probably not in first quarter given the mine constraints.","Alan Shaw","Yes, the production is going to be a limiting factor here in the near term.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. You are now live.","Ravi Shanker","Just to clarify on the Clean Sheeting, did you say that you're working on the plan just now and will be implemented over the summer? I just want to check if you have already started implementing certain actions and if there are any cost drags in the fourth quarter as result of that?","Jim Squires","We have been implementing Clean Sheeting for some time now, in fact, for much of 2018, we were Clean Sheeting the railroad, and we are making some changes in the operating plan even as we speak with more of that to come in 2019.","Ravi Shanker","Are there any pretty growth cost items you would like to point out as being the drag to railroad?","Jim Squires","No not as a result of Clean Sheeting or implementation of the high velocity plan.","Ravi Shanker","And just as follow-up, I mean, just given the pricing environment that you mentioned. Just going ahead in 2019 and the potential loosening of truck markets and maybe a broader macro slowdown, can you just clarify your broader strategies and pricing going forward? Are you happy to push for more pricing gain even if that means a loss of volumes and shippers switching from rail to truck?","Jim Squires","Ravi, our strategy to when it drives shareholder return and this is a great environment to push our price. We\u2019re going through bid season right now in the air model network, and we\u2019re seeing continued strength there. So, I\u2019m very confident in our ability to continue to price through 2019. We've talked about that basically for the past year that 2019 was lining up to be a strong pricing year, and we still see that and we're expecting the momentum that we created and 2018 to carry over into 2019.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Reustle from Goldman Sachs. You are now live.","Matt Reustle","Back to the intermodal business, you did see deceleration in volume and pricing in the fourth quarter. It sounds like the environment is still strong. Is that purely a case of lapping tough comps? Is there anything else there in terms of competition picking up, loosing truck market that\u2019s driving that deceleration?","Jim Squires","We actually saw an acceleration of pricing in the fourth quarter, Matt. And I will point you back to the fact to your point that fourth quarter 2017 at the time was a record volume and a record revenue quarter for us in inner model. We go a great intermodal franchise, we got the best intermodal franchise in the east and then there is great opportunity for highway to real convergence going forward.","Matt Reustle","Yes, I\u2019m looking at RPU on ex fuel basis and it looks like 3Q to 4Q that came down a bit, but understood.","Jim Squires","We've talked about a shift, international intermodal grew 9%. Domestic intermodal grew 4% in the quarter. So, that's a negative mix was in intermodal. We had a great pricing quarter and fourth quarter and intermodal and expect that to continue and based on what we\u2019re seeing so far with bid season, we\u2019re very confident it will.","Matt Reustle","And just more philosophical question looking back at 2018, you've mentioned a couple of times. You're coming off a year where operating income is up in the high-teens. It's at the high end of the peer group. You've shown all our improvement. So, when you look at 2018 results, what drives the need to shift to a new operating plan? What is it that stands out that was disappointing, which requires a whole new operating strategy versus progress that you've been making over the past couple of years?","Jim Squires","Financial results were good. Network performance and customer service were not what they should have been in 2018. And so, it\u2019s a push to achieve higher levels of network performance customer service and greater efficiency as well. Of course that has us taking another look at the operating plan.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. You are now live.","Brandon Oglenski","Jim, I get it that you guys had the rental gains and we include those for other carriers too, but it was pretty chunky. I guess just want to circle back because the OR is trailing your peers now. I mean, is there a sense of urgency inside the organization that says, clearly, there is an operating model that can drive well cosmic system better service. How are guys incentivizing I guess the organization to go and achieve these goals?","Jim Squires","Sure, absolutely, there is a lot of urgency around here and a lot of enthusiasm, energy and excitement about this new mode of operations we are adopting based on precision schedule railroad. So, we talked about that on the third quarter call about the people that we have brought into the organization to help us drive PSR preferences and it's working. You see it in the surface metrics thus far in the first quarter in the latter part of the fourth quarter as well. So, it's clearly taking hold. We feel like there's a lot of momentum, and yes, there is a great deal of urgency here about the new plan. We will talk a lot more about that at Investor Day.","Brandon Oglenski","And I get that, you want to save a lot of discussion for Atlanta, but the headcount line, we saw headcount move up a little bit in the fourth quarter and I think the key tenant when we have seen these PSR implementations work is very rapid reduction in employee counts because productivity gets that much better. So, how do we think about just in the context of heading into '19, the movement between volume and the network and headcount and the ability to drive incremental labor productivity?","Jim Squires","Significant improvement in operating ratio, which is our goal will be premised on a combination of growth and productivity. Productivity in turn is a function of better efficiency with respect to labor, locomotives, fuel and our other resources in the business. So, that's the foundational, all of that is the foundation of our new strategic plan, and we will get into a lot more detail on those things in February.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin from RBC Capital Markets. You are now live.","Walter Spracklin","Just going back on your characterization, I'm little surprised by Jim you characterization of your operating ratio given how significant the gains were. I'm just curious whether there -- how much gain was predicated in the sub 65 OR that you had anticipated compared to what actually came to play? And should we bank on continued gains to this level over the next few years? Or maybe some guidance around what gains, what level of gains you expect?","Jim Squires","Walter, I can't give you good guidance on real estate gains, except to say that they will occur from time to time and in some quarters they will be significant as they were in the fourth quarter. Monetizing real estate and all underutilized property is part of our strategy. And that results in better results for shareholders. That will not be the driver of our success as a company going forward. What will make a difference for shareholders and will drive shareholder value will be railroad operations, pricing, and growth and so that will be the focus from time to time, there will be significant gains and I'm sure enough they were in the fourth quarter.","Walter Spracklin","So, you did compare your quarter 2 to sub 65, so you did obviously have an assumption for gains for that sub 65 level. How do they compared to what you're realizing the share?","Jim Squires","We no longer want the real estate gains would occur from time to time. It's very difficult to predict when you will book the more significant gains, but certainly that\u2019s part of the strategy part of the plan and we saw lot of them.","Walter Spracklin","Just on call, you've done a good job just to kind of characterizing a quarter-to-quarter expectation for how your domestic volumes would come in. Any -- I know, it's uncertain, obviously, but any move toward giving contextualizing the sequential quarter going forward with of course domestic utility call.","Jim Squires","We will talk more about the 11 demand is strong, stockpiles have declined, and customers are searching for coals. So depended upon availability of thermal coal could be a pretty strong quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl from Cowen and Company. You are now live.","Adam Kramer","This is Adam for Jason. I guess just a couple quick questions on precision schedule railroading and Clean Sheeting. First in terms of Clean Sheeting, how many relocations were you guys able to attack in the fourth quarter and go after with the Clean Sheeting process?","Mike Wheeler","Well, we ramped it up in the fourth quarter as we plan to do because we are excited about what work results were getting out of it and we even ramped it up a little bit more going into this year to get it done early into the summer. So we\u2019re moving ahead of pace on what we wanted to get done and Clean Sheeting, but I will tell you in addition to putting teams out there that were doing Clean Sheeting from location to location, we've embedded people into the field to just make this the part of the way of life at NS. So while we\u2019re while Clean Sheeting across the railroad, we\u2019re also building it just the daily operating practices at the railroad. So early summer when this things all done, we will be ready to go with our new operating plan.","Jason Seidl","And I guess quick follow-up as well. You guys cited the customer service was kind of one of the drivers here for improvements what you're looking to do. I guess maybe little bit on your conversations with shippers and with your customers concerning PSR. What have those been like? What are the back and forth spin? What have shippers been telling you guys about PSR? And the data effects that you had on them either positive or negative?","Jim Squires","Ours has been and we will continue to be a consultative approach. We\u2019re working with our customers as we overhaul our network. Let me turn over to Alan to talk a little bit about the dialog with customers as we go through Clean Sheeting.","Alan Shaw","Absolutely, our approach with our customers has been highly collaborative. They want us to succeed and they want a supply chain partners that can support their growth and so their goals are aligned with ours, we\u2019re focused on improving service and also putting a product out there that lets them compete and we\u2019re seeing that, we got 9% growth in 2018 on top of 7% growth in 2017 and we\u2019re very excited about the growth opportunities that we see in 2019","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck from JP Morgan. You are now live.","Brian Ossenbeck","So, Mike, just going back to some of the performance in the quarter, and I'll get few more metrics in the next couple of weeks. But last call, you mentioned that network velocity measured at the car level. That was near the highest for the year and crew productivity was also strong. So I was hoping you could give us an update as to where those metrics were in the fourth quarter? And did they also improve through the middle of January?","Jim Squires","The answer is yes. They continued to improve. We saw our terminal really get fluid into the third quarter going into the fourth quarter and that's where I was referring to that was getting the cars through the terminals. And then at the end of the fourth quarter our main lines really became fluid. So yes, and it's continued on even into the first quarter so both of those are doing well going forward so pretty excited.","Brian Ossenbeck","Jim, obviously, there is some more tariffs and credits going into effect in the network next month and these have obviously been used to incentivize compliance with service design changes at the aspects of PSR at different networks. But with the STB is trying to look at these demurrage and accessorial fees, do you think that approach has to change this time around? Appreciate some context in terms of interaction with the regulators some of the shipper response to these items and how you might plan utilizing in the future?","Jim Squires","I'll ask Alan to talk about the specifics of our demurrage changes, but let me say that we are in regular dialogue with our regulators, including the STB. As you know, Chairman, [indiscernible] send a letter to all the Class 1 about changes in demurrage programs to which we responded we will continue to keep up that dialogue that open relationship with our regulators. Alan, some more specifics on our changes in assessorial.","Alan Shaw","Brian, our assessorial program is designed to align our interests and our customers' interest with our mutual benefit, and really complements the efforts of our operating department to improve our service and efficiency. And we are delivering that. As Mike has said and you can see in the public metrics, our train speed is improving our dwell is declining and customers are seeing improvements in our service. That\u2019s ultimately what they're looking for.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors from Susquehanna. You are now live.","Bascome Majors","As we look into the first part of next year and I realized the meet of the guidance is going to come in couple of weeks here, but other than the gain and maybe some elevated incentive comp expense. Is there anything abnormal about the fourth quarter results when we think about what they mean in a run rate or seasonal basis going forward?","Jim Squires","Cindy went through the particulars in the expense lines and flagged the things that stood out in the fourth quarter. Cindy, other things that\u2026","Cindy Earhart","No, I would just say that and you'll notice in my comments. I did talk about we still have some additional cost associated with re-crews in overtime and some equipment rails associated with the some of our network velocity. So they were some of those, but nothing else.","Bascome Majors","And with the headquarters move, from economic perspective, should we expect anything lumpy over the next couple years, be it in labor with packages for people who don't decide to relocate or rent additions for new facilities or capital cost? Just anything financially from that course may that can move the needle on enterprise basis?","Jim Squires","We will begin relocating employees in 2019 in the middle of the year and we will relocate the majority of the employees in 2021. Tallying up all the costs associated with those moves we would not expect them to be material over that period of time. So the purpose of the headquarters relocation I might add is closer alignment and we\u2019re excited about that we think that having all of our folks in one head quarters building will be a very good thing.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter from Merrill Lynch. You are now live.","Ken Hoexter","Cindy, you've noted the incentive comp boosted salaries and benefits. Do you include the gains in that to get to your -- or to you OR target, are the gain included to get to that incentive comp? And then, were there any other real estate gains throughout this year or only in the fourth quarter?","Cindy Earhart","In terms of the gain on the sales of operating property, as you know, Ken as to operating income and operating ratio, those are two key components of our incentive comp. So, it did add to incentive comp. We obviously have had property sales this year throughout the year and not to the extent of the fourth quarter and we had obviously improved the issues as well. So it does add, it does add to the incentive comp.","Jim Squires","Ken, as Cindy mentioned, incentive compensation for the full year 2018 was roughly comparable to 2017.","Ken Hoexter","No, I asked it because if I look at the largest for year gains for CP was 95 million CFX with 140 million. So your one quarter here was bigger than full year that both those companies included. So, is there -- you've mentioned there were others earlier in the year, but I don\u2019t think they got called out. Can you give us the total for what they were for the quarters?","Cindy Earhart","Yes, so Ken, in total, they were probably 10 million to 15 million for the three quarters.","Ken Hoexter","And then I guess Mike, if we can just on your KPIs that you talked about. Jim noted you take out locomotives and I presume that accelerating as your performance improves. So you plan to improve that, but your gross tons miles for locomotive chart that you had there was flat year-over-year. Just wondering as you step back and think about that given the Clean Sheeting, is that something we should have see improvements that we should going forward see improvement? I guess is that something you focus on with whether it's train length growing our or improve sidings how you think about that that metric?","Jim Squires","Yes, it is absolutely one of our KPIs now and going forward. But if you look at the fourth quarter, you'll see that in December it really changed there was a big step function up in the quarter. So, we took the locomotives out near the end of the quarter, we\u2019ve continue to take locomotives out even into this year. So absolutely train links, train weight are all part of the operating plan changes were put in place and again were not waiting when we see opportunities were take advantage of it . But the more holistic operating plan will be the next quarter or two.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group from Wolfe Research. You are now live.","Scott Group","So, a couple of things for you Cindy, can you give us any guidance on other income going forward? Can you give us some thoughts on how much of an increase we should expect in accessorial revenue? And I guess since you don't report other revenue, will that be just put in revenue per car? So, two questions, and then I guess maybe just a comment Cindy like in the future if we ever not some made really big gains just in the 8-K like let us know about in advance would be helpful?","Cindy Earhart","Scott, in terms of other than that I think the run rate perspective, we would say that probably about 80 million annually is the good run rate for that. In terms of the accessorial, you are right. I don\u2019t know that we are expecting there to be big changes in that and it just becomes part of the normal revenue car. So, does that answer your question?","Scott Group","Yes, I guess why wouldn\u2019t there be big changes like we saw pretty meaningful increase in that other revenue for CFX series, they made changes? Are your changes different than what they did?","Jim Squires","Not with our.","Alan Shaw","Scott, our changes are designed to improve our efficiency and our network velocity. So, we are not counting on additional revenue with these. What we're doing is we are collaborating with our customers on our service changers they are being brought in on the front end of this because we want to make this smooth for them and smooth for us. They can help us, we can help them and we can both grow together that\u2019s the overall intent.","Scott Group","And are you seeing compliance with it right away?","Alan Shaw","Yes, you can see improvements as Mike talked about we are in storing locomotives at the end of December while volumes were accelerating and our change people is improving.","Mike Wheeler","Scott, the customers are really engaged in this and they want, as Alan noted, they want to see it see us and this process succeed.","Alan Shaw","And we've gotten off Scott to a very strong start to start January in terms of both volume and service product. Now, the storms in the Northeast have had an impact on our volumes and our velocity so far this week, but we are very confident in the product that we are delivering and the demand out there for our product.","Scott Group","I know we are going to get long-term sort of labor productivity headcount guidance in the interim, can you just give us some guidance on 1Q for headcount?","Jim Squires","I think if you can hold for just a couple of more weeks, Scott, we will give you as much forward-looking guidance as possible. I know that\u2019s obviously going to be a big focus of investor day to give you the longer term and shorter term in some cases shorter term financial goals and the resource components thereof.","Scott Group","I know I'm going over but just to help us get ready for next kind of month. Should we be thinking five year targets, three year targets, I just want to get prepared?","Jim Squires","We will get into the plan period, duration of the new plan period in February along with everything else.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon from Bernstein. You are now live.","David Vernon","Alan, when you look at the intermodal per unit for the revenue bringing for intermodal, up 7 with fuel up 4 without fuel coming off sort of mid teens increase in truck rates. Should we be expecting that numbers to creep up a little bit is a lag effect sort of kind comes into the business? Or is that a good kind of 15, get to your 7 kind of ratio thinking about for the pricing leverage you guys can take out of the truck rate, inflationary that\u2019s happening in the market?","Jim Squires","David, we as I said our pricing improved throughout the year, which was very good about where we\u2019re headed as we move into 2019. Bid season has started for us pretty well and the feedback that we're getting from our channel partners is there is continued strength and intermodal pricing. We\u2019re seeing strength there as you know our RPU was up 7% in every single one of our business units. It has to go back seven years to find that. So, we're very confident in our pricing strategy and our approach, it will continue into 2019.","David Vernon","Is it reasonable to think that it could approach those sort of levels that you saw in truckers? Or is that going to be -- is that just kind happening too much?","Jim Squires","We\u2019re going to push it as hard as we can and you saw that this year. We delivered 18% revenue growth in our intermodal franchise and 2018 on top of 11% growth in 2017, while improving margins, that is exactly what we need to do.","David Vernon","Thank you that\u2019s helpful. And then Cindy, just to clarify before, I think you said other net should be about 80. Is that inclusive of the reclassification of the some of the rental income of above the line or because I\u2019m just trying to reconcile the zero and 4Q this year to a expecting like an 80 for the full year of 19 on that other net line?","Cindy Earhart","Yes, the 80 is we would expect for an annual run rate. I have mentioned in my comments in the fourth quarter, we had about $25 million decrease year-over-year in returns on a company or life insurance. So, that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing in the fourth quarter. That was pretty unusual. It was tied very much just market performance in the fourth quarter.","David Vernon","Okay and then just in that other offset to the other line that moved above the line. I\u2019m assuming the coal royalty to be included in that. Can you give us any sense for how much of an increase you got into fourth quarter this year on that number?","Cindy Earhart","Yes, it's not significant","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Jim Squires for closing comments.","Jim Squires","Thank you. We are proud of what we've accomplished and are excited about our prospects for future success. In a few weeks, we will discuss the strategic initiatives we have underway which will further strengthen our company deliver even more value to our shareholders, and we look forward to discussing them with you at our investor day on February 11th.

With the results in the second quarter and first half of 2019, we are on track to meet the commitments we made to shareholders in February, namely an operating ratio this year at least 100 basis points below 2018 and a 60 OR by 2021. ","Our railroad is performing very well. The transition to our new PSR-based operating plan TOP21 went flawlessly and we are already seeing the financial benefits with more to come. Top'21 and Clean Sheeting exposed numerous opportunities for cost savings in the second half of this year and beyond, which we are now aggressively pursuing. These savings coupled with the modest top line growth we expect in the back half give us confidence we will achieve our stated goals even amidst economic uncertainty.","Turning to the financial results for the second quarter. Income from operations was $1.1 billion, an increase of 4%. Net income was $722 million, up 2% over the prior year, and EPS was $2.70, an 8% increase. The operating ratio improved by 100 basis points versus last year to 63.6%. First half net income and EPS experienced double-digit percentage growth, while we reduced our operating ratio by 210 basis points to 64.8%.","Looking ahead, we expect continued year-over-year improvement in the operating ratio in the second half, leading to an OR for the full-year at least 100 basis points lower than 2018. Before turning it over to Alan, Mike and Cindy, let me say a few more words about TOP21 and our outlook. As you know, the first phase of the new operating plan, which we fully implemented on July 1 focused on our merchandise network.","As Mike will highlight TOP21 reduced plans circuity for merchandise and auto traffic by 20% and that's in addition to circuity reductions accomplished earlier in the year through increased fluidity. 87% of the cars in the merchandise network are now operating with new trip plans. Despite these sweeping changes, crucial network performance metrics, train speeds, terminal dwell and Cars-On-Line, and corresponding customer service metrics have held steady new record best levels.","As we implemented TOP21, it's also important to highlight that we successfully addressed adverse weather conditions, including floodwater from the Missouri River, which severed our line to Kansas City for more than a month. As I highlighted during our Investor Day, we are transforming our culture to ensure that every employee is focused on achieving our goals and is aligned with how Norfolk Southern will pursue them. Our engineering department is a perfect example of this winning culture.","Despite the challenges presented from the flooding conditions I highlighted; they didn't miss a beat. They work together to execute our plan, quickly restore our track, and get us moving again. This is just one example of why this team is the best in the business. Since launching TOP21 we have seen no adverse effects on network performance or quality of our customer service.","The benefits of TOP21 reduced circuity and improved velocity are already apparent, as we can now serve the majority of our customers with more predictable trends at times and fewer assets to move their freight. As I noted, we are already seeing a favorable financial impact from TOP21 as well. In conjunction with velocity improvements from Clean Sheeting and pre-implementation work earlier this year, TOP21 has enabled us to reduce employment levels well ahead of plan, which Cindy will discuss later.","We saw this in the second quarter, with decreases in head count related expense, materials expense and equipment rents. We're confident that as the new plan takes hold in the second half favorable year-over-year comparisons in TOP21 related expense categories will accelerate, and we've already started work on Phase II of the plan.","Turning to our outlook for the balance of 2019. We expect modest volume and revenue growth. As Alan will explain, the growth is expected to come from select merchandise lines of business and from a resumption of Intermodal growth consistent with commentary by our channel partners. Even as we pursue growth, we are determined to exploit every efficiency we uncover from the new operating plan. As a result of TOP21, we see opportunities for additional cost savings and serving yards, local operations and locomotive maintenance among other areas.","At Investor Day, I described our belief that to keep up in a rapidly changing world a company must constantly reexamine its culture. Openness to new people and new ideas is critical, so as having the right leaders, in the right jobs, doing the right things, committed to shareholder value. That remains our mantra. As new leaders across a broad spectrum of functions dig deep into established ways of doing business. All of us are working together and seeking ways to improve service for our customers, manage our assets, control our costs, operate safely and develop our people. We continue to transform Norfolk Southern and are excited about the progress we are making.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Alan.","Alan Shaw","Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone. In the second quarter, we continued to execute our strategic plan of leveraging our improving service product to yield up and drive greater margins. The outcome of these efforts allowed NS to grow revenue and income in a challenging freight environment. We partner with our customers daily on these initiatives, through constant communication and collaboration. This has proven an effective approach, clearly demonstrated as we successfully completed the implementation of the TOP21 operating plan on July 1. Throughout the second quarter we worked in concert with our customers on the impending improvements through numerous face-to-face meetings. This collaboration, coupled with a flawless execution by our operating team resulted in a seamless implementation.","As shown on Slide 6, we delivered a second quarter revenue gain of 1%, despite a 4% volume decline. This marks Norfolk Southern's tenth consecutive quarter of revenue growth, building on last year's second quarter revenue increase of 10%, slower economic growth drove volume declines in Intermodal, export coal and steel. Volume decreases were offset by the continued implementation of our strategy to price to the value of our improving service product, generating a 5% increase in revenue per unit. Merchandise delivered a record for quarterly revenue with a 2% revenue gain, despite a 3% volume decline.","Revenue growth was driven by improved pricing and volume gains in our aggregates and agriculture franchises from increased network velocity. Midwest flooding adversely impacted merchandise volumes, primarily in our automotive segment. Steel volumes were down 8%, due to tariff impacts and lower steel prices. Pipeline activity continues to decrease NGL volumes. Increased truck capacity, higher inventories and Midwest flooding negatively impacted Intermodal revenue, which declined 2% year-over-year.","Intermodal volume declined 4%, due to reduced domestic volume that was partially offset by 7% growth in our international franchise. Revenue per unit increased 2% year-over-year with solid pricing, reflecting the value of our service product offset by the negative mix associated with increased international volume. Coal revenue was flat year-over-year, as strong pricing was offset by a 6% volume decline, primarily in our export market. The pricing helped increase revenue per unit by 7%. RPU was also enhanced by the positive mix associated with increased volume in our utility south market.","Production challenges at several mines and low seaborne coal prices resulted in lower export volume against difficult comps. Utility volumes improved year-over-year, due to weather delayed tons from the first quarter, service improvements, and stockpile replenishment. Pricing to the value of our service product continues to produce positive results, with RPU growth in all three business units, and a 5% RPU improvement overall. This gain highlights the successful execution of our plan and contributes to the foundation of our long-term success.","Moving to Slide 7. Consumer confidence remains high. Unemployment is near a 50-year low, and consumer activity is still strong. The ISM manufacturers indexes dropping, although still an expansion range. Tariff uncertainty remains a headwind, primarily in the manufacturing sector. Taking together, we remain confident and continued growth in the economy, although at a lower rate than what we experienced in 2018. ","Based on this economic backdrop, we expect modest year-over-year improvement in revenue, volume, and RPU in the second half of the year, with the bulk of that growth in the fourth quarter. This growth is a result of our strategy, the success of our TOP21 operating plan and our continued focus on customer alignment. Increased pricing is the largest driver of growth projections with RPU in the second half expected to increase despite lower diesel rates and difficult comparisons to the second half of last year, as well as the impact of lower seaborne pricing in the export market.","I will now highlight some of the primary drivers of our expectations in each of the business units. Within merchandise, we expect oil price differentials will support demand for crude oil shipments to the East Coast. Based on a forecast of 3% increase and U.S. light vehicle production, automotive volume is projected to increase in the second half. Aggregate and sand volumes are anticipated to benefit from improved service levels and a normalized spend throughout the year. Pipeline activity is expected to continue to negatively impact shipments of natural gas liquids while steel markets will be disadvantaged by weak demand, tariff impacts, and low commodity prices. Our continued focus on pricing to the value of our service product is expected to increase revenue on flat annual volumes.","Intermodal volume is projected to finish 2019, slightly above 2018 levels, as expected growth in the second half will offset first half declines. We project second half growth in both the international and domestic markets resulting from sustained year-over-year growth forecast for consumer spending. Although, domestic growth will be tempered by increased capacity in the truck market. Our coal markets will likely continue to decline in comparison to 2018. API 2 prices are forecasted to remain at low levels in the second half, while seaborne coking coal prices are projected to decline impacting both volume and RPU. Utility volumes will be impacted by natural gas prices and weather.","In summary, we expect total coal volume to finish below 2018 levels, while RPU is also pressured. We continue to leverage the value of our service product and secure opportunities that set the stage for long-term success. We remain focused on margin improvement and growth initiatives supported by a consistent and efficient service product that the market values.","I will now turn it over to Mike for an update on operations.","Mike Wheeler","Thank you, Alan. Today, I will update you on the state of the railroad and the successful implementation of our TOP21 operating plan. In the second quarter, we continue to drive service improvements for our customers, finalized our new TOP21 operating plan, and achieved record operating ratios for a second quarter and the first six months of the year. We continue to build on our strong momentum and are confident in our ability to deliver strong value for shareholders and support for our customers.","Moving to Slide 9. Our continued focus on execution of our plan and the principles of precision scheduled railroading is evidenced in our performance metrics. Specifically, our train performance, terminal dwell, shipment consistency and car level velocity for the second quarter were the best on record for any quarter. These achievements are due to the relentless execution by our operations team and laid a firm foundation for our new TOP21 operating plan. We want to thank our field employees for their unwavering and relentless focus on safety, service and efficiency.","Turning to our service and productivity metrics on Slide 10. These metrics are aligned with our strategic plan, which is built upon providing a service product that will allow our customers to grow with us. As before, the blue bars represent our respective goals for 2019. Starting with the Service Delivery Index, which is the on-time delivery performance of our scheduled shipments indexed to 2018. This is a customer facing metric that combines shipments consistency, which measures trip plan adherence for general merchandise as well as automotive traffic and Intermodal availability.","I am pleased to report that we are on track to exceed our goal for 2019, due to our first half service performance and flawless implementation of the TOP21 plan. As noted on the previous slide, we are delivering a record number of shipments to our customers on time. We are trending ahead to where we thought we would be with the T&E productivity goal for this year. ","We anticipate this trend will continue for the rest of the year as we fully implement our TOP21 plan. As mentioned during the last call, our train weight goal is backend loaded and we will be monitoring and working on this goal for this year as our new TOP21 operating plan is implemented. We are already seeing improvements in our general merchandise train weights, which are offset by headwinds associated with Intermodal and Coal volumes.","Locomotive productivity continues to be another strong metric for NS and we are tracking to meet or exceed our goal for this year. Locomotive as well as T&E productivity are being negatively impacted by the decline in gross ton miles. But we are actively adjusting resources to ensure we remain on track to meet our goals. Our team is flexible, dynamic and will adjust to ensure we hit our targets as business levels change. And the Cars On-Line is trending very positively, thanks to our fast and consistent service product.","It should also be noted that this number includes cars in storage of approximately 15,000, up 5,000 from the prior quarter. This is the capacity dividend we have referred to previously, which we created in part by the timely adjustment of our equipment distribution to match market conditions. I would also like to update you on the progress of our new TOP21 operating plan on Slide 11. As you may recall from our Investor Day, our new operating plan has four major objectives. Operator, is one network. A balanced train plan between terminals. Serve our customers frequently; and reduce dependence on major terminals. This iteration of TOP21 primarily focused on our general merchandise bulk and automotive business.","As Jim noted, we are already working on the next iteration of our operating plan, while we continue to harvest the opportunities from the newly implemented operating plan. We implemented some of our operating plan changes throughout the second quarter. These targeted implementations were concentrated primarily around the edges of our network. The successful implementation of the full plan on July 1, which involved over 180 iterations before implementation was a partnership between network planning and optimization who model the plan, marketing view is involved in both developing and communicating the plan and transportation who executed the plan.","As promised, we have been and will continue to work closely with our customers to collaborate on the new operating plan. Prior to TOP21 implementation, we held 19 joint customer employee Town Halls across the network and that one-on-one with all large customers. This provided our customers the opportunity to better understand TOP21 and the benefits of the plan.","Turning to Slide 12. I would like to give you a comparison of the final TOP21 plan that was implemented on July 1 versus the baseline plan. A key pillar of the new operating plan is expanding the use of distributed power for our merchandise and automotive trains. TOP21 will also drive at least a 20% reduction in circuitous miles by utilizing capacity at regional yards, focusing less on creating density at hump yards.","There will also be 15% reduction in train miles for manifest, automotive and locals, as well as at least a 10% reduction in train starts. This was a significant undertaking with just under 90% of merchandise and automotive traffic, receiving a new trip plan. This will result in a more efficient network with fewer trains as shown on the graph on the right. We are confident that execution of our new operating plan will drive further improvement in the near and long-term.","I will now turn it over to Cindy, who will cover the financials.","Cindy Earhart","Thank you, Mike, and good morning. I'll begin with our operating results on Slide 14. Income from railway operations was $1.1 billion, up 4% improvement over the prior year and a second quarter record, driven by 1% increase in revenues and a 1% decrease in operating expense. Our operating ratio was 63.6%, also a second quarter record and a 100-basis point improvement on last year's results. We continue to make significant progress on the financial goals of our strategic plan and expect that our full year operating ratio will improve at least 100 basis points over the prior year.","Slide 15 illustrates the changes to operating expenses. In total operating expenses were $12 million lower than last year's expenses. As we recognize the benefits associated with our improved network velocity ahead of the full TOP21 implementation in early July. And looking at each of the income statement line items, lower fuel price during the quarter, drove the decline in fuel expense. Purchase services and rents were down, due to a decline in equipment rents, a function of improved network fluidity and lower volumes.","These decreases were partially offset by planned increases in technology spending. Materials and other were slightly higher than prior year. Our operational initiatives drove a reduction in the number of locomotives and service and freight cars-on-line, resulting in $10 million of savings associated with materials. These expense reductions were offset by higher claim costs of $12 million, driven by increased environmental and loss and damage expenses.","While compensation and benefits expense was up slightly, we continue to see a decline in head count. Average headcount for the second quarter was down over 1,200 sequentially, compared to the first quarter. The operational improvements from Clean Sheeting and running a consistent plan every day have resulted in the pull forward of benefits from reduced head count. We expect headcount for the remainder of the year will continue to decline as we reduce resources as a result of our TOP21 implementation.","During the second quarter, we had savings of $24 million, due to lower employment levels over time and recruit. In addition, we also had lower incentive compensation. However, these savings were offset largely due to the absence of last year's employment tax refund, as well as higher wage rates. You will recall that second quarter 2018 benefited from a $31 million refund from employment taxes on stock-based compensation. Finally, depreciation was up, reflecting our increased capital base.","Let's move to our summarized financial results on Slide 16. During second quarter, we recognized a $28 million impairment loss related to certain natural resource assets that we seek to monetize. We continue to execute on our strategic initiatives, and that includes evaluating all non-core assets to ensure we are driving the greatest return for investors. This loss included in other income was offset in part by gains from non-operating property sales and higher investment returns on our corporate-owned life insurance. ","Interest expense on debt was up $22 million due to higher overall debt balance, compared to June of last year. Wrapping up our bottom-line results. Net income was $722 million, up 2%, and diluted earnings per share was $2.70, an 8% improvement. Both of these measures are second quarter record.","Slide 17 depicts our cash flow for the first half of the year. Cash from operations totaled almost $2 billion, generating nearly $1 billion in free cash flow. We are committed to returning capital to shareholders as evidenced by the $1.5 billion of capital returned in the form of dividends and share repurchases, a 36% increase over last year. We are executing on our strategic plan and are confident we will continue to produce improved financial performance that drives shareholder value.","Thanks for your attention. I'll turn the call back to Jim.","Jim Squires","Thank you, Cindy. As the first half of the year demonstrates, we are laser focused on executing today, while planning for tomorrow. And as we have done before, we won't rest when we reach our goals. Each and every member of the NS team is working in unison to achieve our efficiency and growth objectives.","Thank you for your attention. And we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.","Allison Landry","Good morning. Thanks. Just given the current weak volume backdrop and the negative freight indicators and economic indicators, do you have less confidence in the long-term revenue CAGR targets that you set out at the Analyst Day. And maybe if you could also speak to whether you've seen any change in the pricing environment sequentially?","Jim Squires","Good morning, Allison. Let me begin by saying that we are focused on the things that we can control, and those things are delivery of revenue growth. Alan described our modest growth objective in the second half through pricing to the value of our service, and volume growth in select merchandise verticals, which I'll turn it over to him in a minute to describe further.","At the same time, we are very focused on the productivity and efficiency opportunities that we have uncovered through Clean Sheeting and through TOP21 implementation. So, we're focused on the things that we can control and we are very confident that we will hit our goals this year, at least 100 basis points improvement in the operating ratio over last year and 60 by 2021. Alan, why don't you dig in to the outlook a little bit further.","Alan Shaw","Sure. Allison, we remain fully committed and confident in the execution of our strategy. As you know, it's a balanced strategy and that's delivering service growth and productivity. We've got the most powerful Intermodal franchise in the east, which is married to the consumption part of the U.S. economy and the economy continues to move in the direction of the consumer, and the consumer related economic indicators are still relatively strong. We've got a diverse merchandise franchise, which offers many opportunities for growth in the second half of the year.","We're looking for growth in automotive consistent with projections for improved U.S. light vehicle production. We're looking for growth in the crude oil markets. We're looking for growth in sand and aggregates as well due to improved service, and more normalized shipping patterns. Our read of the take is that this is going to offset some headwinds that we're seeing in other markets, such as NGLs and the steel market, and our Intermodal franchise outlook is very consistent with what we're hearing from our channel partners.","With respect to pricing, we continue to see strength in pricing. This past quarter was the second-best quarter and year-over-year improvement in pricing in the last seven years. And we've had seven consecutive quarters of sequential year-over-year gains and pricing in our merchandise franchise. So, we've got a rapidly improving service product. We're building credibility with our customers and we're pricing to the value of that product.","Jim Squires","So, Allison, to sum up, we are determined to realize revenue growth opportunities wherever we can in the second half and for the duration of the plan, and I'd like to turn it over to Mike, if I may just to talk a little bit more about the productivity and efficiency opportunities, which we are also aggressively pursuing right now.","Mike Wheeler","Yes, sure. So, the first thing we're doing is, working on harvest in the opportunities out of the new operating plan, as the new operating plan was put in place. It's uncovered even more opportunities for us to become efficient in take cost out, and that includes an additional tranche of DP trains that will help us as well. The other thing we're looking at is making sure we're really synced up well with the local operating plan, with the implementation of the new train plan and that will also give us opportunity to create some efficiencies while still ensuring that that we give a good service product to the customers.","The other thing we continue to look at is the locomotive fleet. We see some opportunities there in the locomotive fleet, as well as how we maintain the locomotive fleet, what are the opportunities going forward there. And then last, but not least, we are already starting to model the new \u2013 the next phase of the operating plan, which encompasses all our traffic on the network, which we'll plan on rolling out early next year. So, a lot going on to continue to work on productivity and efficiency.","Jim Squires","So, to sum it all up, ours is a balanced plan that positions us for enhanced shareholder value in any environment.","Allison Landry","That's all really helpful and definitely encouraging to hear the pricing comments. If I could just ask one more question on the comp and benefits per employee. Cindy, it was really helpful when you outlined some of the year-over-year factors there, but in terms of sort of thinking about this on a dollar basis or per employee basis. Is this kind of the right range to model this going forward?","Cindy Earhart","Well Allison, yes, thanks for the question. As you've noted, we had really good head start on reducing our headcount. Year-over-year we're down about 1,500 and as I said, sequentially about 1,200. When you look at the reductions that we've made so far in that 1,200, 1,500, about half of the ones we've made conductor trainees. So, obviously they are at a much lower pay rate than you would say our average employee. So, you've seen a little bit of that impact. ","In other words, the take-out it's not quite as high as you would normally think for an average employee. But going forward, we are going to continue to work on head count. You saw what Mike presented in terms of TOP21. The number of train start reductions they\u2019re looking at. So, we're going to continue to push to reduce headcount, not only in T&E, but in all areas of the company, we're looking for additional productivity.","Allison Landry","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Jordan Alliger","Yes. Hi. Good morning. So, the service metrics, many of them are looking good like dwell and velocity pointing in the right direction, which suggests that PSR is kicking in. I'm just sort of wondering, I know you sort of reaffirmed the 100-basis points improvement, but how do you think about how that starts to really dig in and move that operating ratio lower as we move through the second half of the year and into 2020 and beyond, from a timing standpoint I guess more than anything?","Alan Shaw","Thank you, Jordan. The service metrics and the network velocity metrics are trending very favorably and that's something we're extremely proud of, as I guess is obvious. Having just cut over to an operating \u2013 a new operating plan with far-reaching effects on our traffic. So, we've seen that in all of the metrics that you mentioned and, in the metrics, that Mike went through as well. That service platform and the service delivery index goal we've set for ourselves, which we're trending well toward, are the basis of everything we're trying to do, in terms of the revenue and on the expense and productivity side as well. So, yes, we do expect to see. We already are seeing significant opportunities for savings as a result of TOP21 implementation and the Clean Sheeting that preceded it.","Jordan Alliger","Great. So, I mean \u2013 yes, I mean, basically, I'm just trying to get a sense that you know obviously you're literally early days in terms of flipping the switch July 1, but presumably as the metrics improve, operating ratio improves, I mean it's \u2013 that's how it translates from here whether it be headcount whether rents et cetera.","Jim Squires","Yes, of course. And so, we are still expecting to produce an operating ratio at least 100 basis points better than last year for the full-year 2019 and are confident we're going to get there. Now remember that we did have a significant property sale in the fourth quarter of last year and that resulted in a gain and we\u2019re comparing to that fully loaded 2018 result.","Jordan Alliger","Just one more quick question. The Phase II, I assume of TOP21 will include the Intermodal network sometime early next year. While you're doing that network change, will you \u2013 do you expect to continue to be able to push for volumes on the Intermodal network as you're undergoing that portion of TOP21?","Jim Squires","We do, we do. Intermodal has been our volume growth engine and it has been a significant contributor and growing contributor to revenue and bottom line as well. So yes, we continue to expect to grow in that network even as we begin considering how and how much of it two-fold into the TOP21 operating plan.","Jordan Alliger","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Ossenbeck","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask Mike, when you look at the operating metrics, fuel efficiency, got a little bit worse. When you look at GTMs for this quarter was that something that you expected coming out of \u2013 the cut over from the operating plan or was that something else that was going on from a mix perspective? If you look at the other results of some of the class ones this quarter, they start to see some pretty good increases in efficiencies. So, it's not one of the metrics you've talked about too much in the past. I just wanted to get your thoughts on how that trends for the back half and into next year?","Mike Wheeler","Yes. The fuel efficiency, was really not impacted by the TOP21 plan. It was really driven by the drop-off in gross ton miles. So, we've got a lot of initiatives to help drive that. And the coal volumes down hurt that a little bit too. But, yes, we're keeping an eye on that. A lot of initiatives to work on that as well. And that's in our plan.","Jim Squires","Brain, we recognize that we have some ground to make up when it comes to fuel efficiency. Running bigger, heavier trains as a result of TOP21 implementation, very late in the second quarter, early in the third quarter should help with our overall fuel efficiency. And in addition, as Mike mentioned, we have numerous initiatives in the energy management area that we believe will result in an improvement in fuel efficiency going forward.","Brian Ossenbeck","And with the conversion of the locomotive fleet that you see would that be a step change in that function as well?","Jim Squires","That will help.","Mike Wheeler","Yes, it is necessarily it's a step change because this is something that we're going to do over the next several years, but it does help because you're able to handle more tonnage with fewer locomotives.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay, thanks. And then just a quick follow-up for Cindy. Can you give us an update on the head count guidance for the year? I think last time I heard it was down at least 500 for the year. It seems like it's moving along pretty well, but the mix maybe a little bit different with the trainees coming out first and then considering we're looking at a fully loaded comp with land sale gains to get it at last this quarter. What's the outlook for land sales kind of all in, when you look at the back half of the year? Thank you.","Cindy Earhart","Well in terms of head count, you're exactly right. I mean we guided to at least 500 down by the end of the year, compared to the end of the year in 2018. And as I said, we're already down 1,200 sequentially from the first quarter. We aren't guiding to a specific headcount number, but as I mentioned previously, we do expect that headcount is going to continue to come down as we've \u2013 we reduce work associated with TOP21.","We're going to be looking at all areas of the company, mechanical, G&A all of those areas as we continue to push on the productivity. In terms of land sales in operating property, I think we had guided to between $80 million and $100 million with gains for a year and I think that's still a \u2013 I'm sorry, $30 million to $40 million \u2013 hold on one second. $50 million for the year. I'm sorry. And that's still a good guidance for the year.","Jim Squires","Now, Brian, the item you mentioned was in other income was actually a non-operating item and there we did incur a loss...","Cindy Earhart","We did.","Jim Squires","As a result of marking down certain assets. Cindy, why don't you explain what was going on with that?","Cindy Earhart","Yes, we did call out the $28 million loss that was related to some of our natural resource assets, that really relates to one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries Pocahontas Land Corporation, which has been part of our company for \u2013 since the early 1900. As part of just continuing to look at our assets, we determine that that's really not a core asset to our business. And as we've looked at land and other assets that we've had over the years, we just felt like this was an asset that we didn't need to continue to have, it wasn't strategic. So, we decided that we would hold that subsidiary for sale and we wrote it down to fair market value. So, that's what the $28 million is.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay. Alright. Thanks for the clarity there. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Group","Hi, thanks, good morning. So, when I look at the \u2013 I'm going to stick on labor. So, when headcount is down 5% sequentially, labor costs only down 2% sequentially and I get the issue of this trainees, I'm wondering if there's any severance as well in the quarter if you could say. Now, going forward, should we think about the headcount and the labor cost moving more in line with each other? Are the additional headcount reductions more on trainees or more regular employees? And then, so I know you're not giving a specific guidance on headcount, but now that we're through sort of TOP21 and that volumes are weak, do you think we could see a similar reduction in headcount in the second half as what we saw in the first half sequentially? So, a bunch there.","Jim Squires","Cindy?","Cindy Earhart","Yes, Scott. In terms of \u2013 your first question was, in terms of severance. And there really hasn't been any severance related to the reduction of that headcount. Going forward in terms of the mix of employees that will be coming out is yes, it's more of the \u2013 of what you consider sort of average compensation that you've seen. We've got the conductor trainees, we got out early. So, you'll see more of a normalized comp coming out associated with the headcount that comes out going forward.","Jim Squires","And a little bit of that other came out near the end of the quarter.","Cindy Earhart","Yes, exactly. I said about half of that was really related to trainees, about your last question Scott was...","Scott Group","Just given now that we're through TOP21 and given the sort of the weak volume trends. Can we see similar sequential reductions in headcount in the second half to what we saw in the first half, similar?","Cindy Earhart","I would say that we \u2013 as I said before, we're going to continue to bring the headcount down in the T&E side around the work that's going away reducing the train starts. I mean there will be headcount associated with that as well as in other areas, but I've not giving specific guidance on headcount numbers. And we're going to push as hard as we can on that.","Jim Squires","Scott, whether it's additional headcount reductions, whether it's the other things that I mentioned in my opening statement, cost savings and serving the yards local operations, locomotive maintenance, we will push as hard as we possibly can on the efficiency and productivity in the second half and we have a lots of opportunities that we're working on as Mike went through earlier as well.","Scott Group","Jim last quarter you said let's get through TOP21 and then we can talk about yard rationalizations. Can you give us an update on what you're planning to do there? And then just as I think about the model like sometimes third quarter margins better than second, sometimes not. Do you think we can get sequential margin improvement in 3Q versus 2Q?","Jim Squires","Let's start with the yard network. We've already converted two hump yards to flat switch operations coming out of TOP21. And we'll continue to look things over. It really depends on the level of volume under the new plan that's moving through a given yard. Once that volume drops below a certain level, it makes sense to convert to a flat switch operation, as long as you're going to keep it open. But we'll continue to work on that. There may be other opportunities around the network, in addition we're looking over our entire portfolio of local serving yards to see what fits well with TOP21 and what doesn't. In terms of the trend in the operating ratio, again, at least 100 basis points improvement for the full-year versus 2018, fully loaded, that's our goal. And we're confident we can meet it.","Scott Group","Okay. Can I just ask you one last one real quick? You talked about coal RPU being pressured. Was that a comment that you think full year RPU is lower, was that second half lower year-over-year or is that just sequential, I want to put some context around what you said?","Alan Shaw","Yes, Scott, look at the second half of the year. Last year as commodity prices ran up, we were able to increase our pricing on our metallurgical export market. Now, commodity prices are declining. I think the latest I saw was about $178 a metric ton where we were over $200 this time last year, and that's going to put pressure on the pricing in the metallurgical export market. And then overall, Scott, as you know the API 2 remains really weak, it's difficult for US suppliers to participate in that market, unless they're hedged, and so I think that's going to have a negative impact on thermal volumes in the second half of the year.","Scott Group","Alright, thanks for the time guys.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Wadewitz","Yes. Good morning. I wanted to \u2013 maybe a quick follow-on the questions on export coal, and now a bit on TOP21. I apologize if I missed this. There were some overlapping calls, but what do you think on full-year tons for export coal. Did you give a comment on where you expect that to be?","Alan Shaw","No, Tom, I did not give guidance on that. I'm calling for export coal volumes to decline year-over-year in the second half of the year pressured in the thermal markets. And then you heard \u2013 you just heard the commentary on pricing as well.","Tom Wadewitz","Sure. What was the full year mix of thermal and met in your export in 2018? And what did that look like in the second quarter?","Alan Shaw","Generally, it runs about 55% to 65% is mat and we were in that ballpark in the second quarter. Similar to where we were last year.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay. But...","Alan Shaw","The mats team mix was pretty consistent. We had a little bit more mix towards Baltimore in the second quarter of this year.","Tom Wadewitz","I mean given \u2013 yes, given the comment on, it seems like there \u2013 you would expect more pressure on thermal export than on [met export]? Is that the right way to think about it? And does that show up in worse kind of \u2013 or maybe a different mix and sequential decline in second half or how do you \u2013 I guess I'm trying to resolve the comment on weakness in thermal, but the mix not changing.","Alan Shaw","Overall, I think you're right in terms of pressure on thermal volumes and then pressure on metallurgical pricing.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay.","Alan Shaw","And the mix is going to shift in that band that I just gave you.","Tom Wadewitz","Right. Okay. And then a question on TOP21. The framework that you've talked about I think Jim has been along the lines of, we want to execute on the plan, make sure it works, before we take resources out. And I just wanted to get your sense of, is that still the right way to think about it that you've got some amount of resource in the system that you will give a bit more time before you take it out or you've seen enough that you \u2013 it's running well, and you can pretty quickly start taking out the resource whether that's head count more locomotives whatever would be?","Jim Squires","Well look, let me start by saying, we made great progress on resources in the second quarter. Even before we flip the switch on TOP21. So, we got a running start on this. But to answer your question, yes, absolutely, we see further opportunities to reduce resources in all of the ways in which we've already discussed this morning. And now the TOP21 has been implemented and the network is running well and its aftermath. We're going to go after the resources.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay. So, you don't need further time to assess success you say, okay it's working and we can go after it right now?","Jim Squires","That's correct. Once the work is \u2013 once the work is gone, we take the resources out.","Tom Wadewitz","Right, okay. Good. Well, congratulations on the launch on TOP21, and thanks for the time.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Long","Thanks, and good morning. So, I wanted to start with TOP21 and wanted to get some help understanding that different iterations of the plan. So, Phase 1 is under way. It sounds like Phase 2 starts at the beginning of next year, but when will the implementation process be complete across the entire network. And in terms of how this plan impacts the OR, should we be expecting more of an OR benefit in the early stages of TOP21 or the later stages of TOP21?","Jim Squires","Good morning, Justin. As we laid out at Investor Day, we will follow the initial implementation of TOP21 with further refinements. Now, the first target of opportunity will be additional benefits, operational benefits within the remaining merchandise bulk commodities that can be further consolidated into the TOP21 Version 1 operating plan. So, Mike, why don't you elaborate on that?","Mike Wheeler","Yes. So, he almost wants to call it 2.0 of what we implemented. It's gone very well. So, we're taking a look at what are the next opportunities. We talked about how we made a big effort to add more distributed power trains. We did that, but we also knew there was more opportunity behind that. And that's what we're looking at now. So, there'll be some minor iterations of this current plan that we'll model and put in place, add more distributed power that will give us more benefits as well. So, we're kind of taking the opportunity to harvest everything we can find, as we get better and better with this plan and concurrently start working on the next plan.","Jim Squires","And in terms of the pace of our improvement as we have said in 2019 at least to 100 basis points over 2018 and 60 by 2021.","Justin Long","Okay. And secondly, maybe this is one for Mike. I heard you give some numbers on the number of railcars that have been put into storage, but any update in terms of where we are in rationalizing the size of the locomotive fleet. I know you're always make adjustments based on demand, but based on the current freight market and volume environment that we're seeing, can you talk about where your active locomotive fleet is today versus what you would consider to be an optimal level?","Mike Wheeler","Yes, okay. So, we've got about 550 locomotives that we have stored that are available as needed, and I'll remind you that we also sold about 150 units that we've pulled out over the last years as well. So, that's where we're at. So, it's pretty big reduction from the fleet. And as part of what we've talked about taking a look at how the TOP21 plan is working, as well as looking at our yard in local network there is more to come. And we're working on that right now.","Justin Long","Okay. I'll leave it at that. Thanks for the time.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Amit Mehrotra","Thanks. I just wanted to come back to the yield-up discussion, if I could. Jim, when you and the management team unveiled it back in February you and other executives called it an aggressive, but achievable plan, and that was when mid-single digit volume declines were not really kind of in the \u2013 on the horizon so to speak. So, I just wondered if you could talk about how that's impacting if at all the pace in magnitude of the yield-up strategy, I guess over the last few months you've also had a little bit more STB rumblings with respective to some of the ancillary revenue changes that are trying \u2013 aimed to changed behavior with respect to PSR?","Jim Squires","I'll let Alan weigh in here, but let me say that the price increases we have taken and expect to take in the future are based on the value of the service we are providing our customer service with which they in turn can create value in their businesses. So, that's the basis of the price increases and the service is at a very high level and that has enabled us to take the pricing up. Alan your thoughts.","Alan Shaw","It's foundational to what we're doing. Our approach is balanced strategy of converting a great service product in both revenue growth and productivity and you're seeing that in our results. And as I noted, we had just had our second-best quarter of year-over-year pricing increases in the last seven years, and within our merchandise network we've had seven consecutive quarters of improving year-over-year pricing increases. Customers see the improvement in our service product. They know that we're collaborating with them on our changes to our operating plan, they\u2019re part of the discussion and they\u2019re part of the process and they also know that we're providing them with a platform for growth. And so, they want a sustainable supply chain partner that's going to give them the opportunity to grow in the future.","Amit Mehrotra","Right. Yes, no, that makes total sense. And if I could just follow-up on that precise point. There is \u2013 from the pricing perspective, there\u2019s only one rail that we can actually truly kind of calculate what's being realized solely on price or core price. One of the proxy metrics we use at least and this could be wrong or not is revenue per revenue ton-mile, which I think we look at as a proxy for price, so if I look at it on that metric the growth in revenue per revenue ton miles for the company was up about 5% in the second quarter. It actually decelerated from 6% in the first quarter. So, first, is that the right way, we should be measuring your progress with respect to the yield-up plan. And then, if so, can we expect maybe greater gains in that metric as you guys get further along in the process?","Alan Shaw","Amit, that's a proxy for that. It also, as you know the denominator is influenced by circuity and with the TOP21 plan, we're going to benefit from that.","Amit Mehrotra","Okay. Alright, thanks guys for taking my questions.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.","Chris Wetherbee","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to kind of come back to some of the commentary around second quarter operating performance relative to maybe what we can expect post the TOP21 rollout and maybe as we move forward through the PSR plan towards the 2021 targets. Conceptually, if you think about the second half of the year, should we assume that there is maybe incremental operating leverage that you can capture relative to the first half of the year as you've made the big strides on the headcount reductions, but your outlook for sort of volume, maybe a little bit better in the third quarter and fourth quarter and clearly the yield side still remains reasonably strong. I just wanted to get a rough sense that I know the 100 basis points is the target for this year. But when you think about sort of first half versus second half, it seems fair to assume that you might be able to pick up a little bit operating leverage in the back half?","Jim Squires","We did see significant operating leverage in the first half and we expect that trend to continue with our emphasis on pricing to the value of our service, with targeted growth opportunities, modest growth opportunities, but some tailwind there as well. So, you roll it all up for the full-year and we believe that we can achieve that at least 100 basis points improvement on the operating ratio versus last year.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. Maybe, Alan, a question on the Intermodal side. Just wanted to get a sense, I mean, you made some positive commentary around Intermodal and obviously some of that's probably coming from the channel partners. When you think about your book of business stuff, you need to call off the network maybe some lane selection that you need to do. How far along are you on that process? Do you see more incrementally more or less as you move into the back half of the year? I just going to thinking about that in the context of maybe of somewhat better Intermodal outlook for the back half of the year, or at least maybe consistently strong for the back half of the year?","Alan Shaw","Well, Chris lane rationalization for Norfolk Southern is an ongoing process. We have done it every year since 2013, and last year we were able to deliver 18% revenue growth with [rail] rationalization on top of 11% revenue growth in 2017. We are committed to doing this in collaboration with our channel partners and providing them with sufficient notice, so that they can plan accordingly with their customers.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. So, but incrementally first half is just on ongoing process, we shouldn't be thinking about it as sort of more or less relative what we've seen so far in 2019?","Alan Shaw","Typically, we had \u2013 we operate with these \u2013 or we execute these changes in advance of bid season at the beginning of the year.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks very much. I appreciate it.","Alan Shaw","Again, Chris, it's to make sure that we're collaborating with our customers.","Chris Wetherbee","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with AllianceBernstein. Please proceed with your question.","David Vernon","Hi, good morning guys. Alan, I just wanted to follow-up on the confidence around the volume growth coming back in Intermodal in the back half of the year. Is that based on \u2013 so your expectation that the truck market starts to firm up or is there some visibility you have in terms of share shifts within the smaller domestic market, which is going to get you back to growth?","Alan Shaw","It's based on the overall macro environment. We're not \u2013 it's based on conversations with channel partners. You're starting to see some improvement in spot rates, maybe we're at an inflection point. So, that's our read, and once again it's modest, and however, recognize that our international volumes continue to grow. So, when we improve our domestic volumes, then it could easily turn into growth within the overall Intermodal franchise. Once again, we've got the best Intermodal franchise in the east. And so, we're going to be at the forefront of that growth.","David Vernon","And I guess as you think about within the environment right now being a little bit softer on the truck rates side, I think some of the Intermodal providers are talking about how there are lanes where truck is actually priced under [the order door] Intermodal. Is there anything you guys need to do on the pricing side, to get that growth back? Or do you feel like you can kind of yield-up into this softer truck market and still get a volume growth?","Alan Shaw","Yes, we're very pleased with the outcome of the bid season in terms of the rate increases we were able to achieve. Once again it reflects the value of our product and it reflects the strength of our Intermodal franchise. We've got a great franchise, it's a point-to-point franchise, which frankly means, we don't have to make a lot of adjustments to it. There is some cyclicality in the truck market and you can find some lanes out there where the spot rate is under Intermodal. However, we're not going to chase that. We're going to continue to price long term to the value of our product and we've got long-term relationships with our channel partners. They understand that.","David Vernon","Alright. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Seidl","Thank you, operator. Good morning, gentlemen. I'll stick with Intermodal here as well. Can you talk a little bit about the upcoming peak season? Do you expect sort of a normalized peak? And then on the international side, obviously a lot of growth coming there. How much of that growth do you think is just sort of East Coast share wins versus the West Coast or maybe that you just won some business versus your competitor in the East?","Alan Shaw","I think we're looking for a normalized peak, our channel partners are anticipating volumes will start to pick up in August. On the international side, we've got great alignment with the steamship lines that are adding capacity to the East Coast. And that's driving a lot of our growth.","Jason Seidl","Okay. Makes sense. And I have a quick question, you mentioned flooding in KC, I think you said guys said, your line was out for more than a month. I don't seem to recall you mentioning any cost associated with that line being out, I was wondering if you can give us a little more meat on the bone there?","Jim Squires","The impact on expenses was immaterial. We did have some additional capital costs associated with the flooding. Cindy order of magnitude.","Cindy Earhart","Yes, I would just repeat that that we obviously there were costs associated with it, but it was primarily capital and on the expense side, it was not material expenses.","Jason Seidl","Okay. Appreciate the color. Thanks for the time as always.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Walter Spracklin","Yes, thanks very much. Good morning everyone. So, I wanted to come back to the overall volume inflection, positive growth in each of the metrics on the top line, you're mentioning. And I'm seeing minus 4%, obviously minus 4% volume down in the second quarter, you're carload data to-date is I know early in the quarter but minus 7%, I just got to go back perhaps Alan to the question about what are you hearing, and it seems to be across the board in each of that \u2013 each of your segments that are trending down here so far in the third quarter there. What are you hearing from your customers to suggest that not only is minus 7% going to stop dropping, but you're going to see, in fact enough growth to swing you back into the positive territory for the rest of the year or is it any one commodity? Is it a big share win that you've got and secured and you can see in the back half? Just a little bit of color on that would be great.","Alan Shaw","Walter, we are targeting growth in the second half of the year. The majority of that growth will occur in the fourth quarter as I noted in my prepared remarks. Conversations with our customers I just talked with Jason about what we're hearing from our channel partners within Intermodal. And then in the merchandise network we see the crude price differentials creating the opportunity for growth in the second half of the year, because of our flawless implementation of TOP21. We've got the capacity dividend to apply to that. We see improved service, which will allow continued growth in aggregates. ","We're looking for more normalized shipping patterns within our frac sand markets and U.S. vehicle production is \u2013 light vehicle production, pardon me, is projected to increase by 3% in the second half of the year. And we serve more U.S. Auto build production than any other railroad in North America. Our read of the tape is that that's going to offset some declines, where you fully expect to see declines in NGLs, we expect to see pressure within our export coal market as I noted earlier and the metals market has been weakened by low commodity prices, although we're starting to see price increases for hot rolled coil steel take effect and stick.","Jim Squires","So, for all the reasons Alan has mentioned Walter, we do expect growth, volume and revenue growth \u2013 modest volume and revenue growth in the second half. We're all about pursuing the efficiencies that we have uncovered as a result of Clean Sheeting and TOP21 as well. We'll continue to push on all of those opportunities hard in the second quarter, even as we go after the growth that we can find.","Walter Spracklin","And that's great color. I appreciate that Alan and Jim, thanks for that color. And that leads me to my second question. When I look at your TOP21 and kind of compare it to past iterations to PSR. When I look at the 100 basis points that you're guiding to for this year, [60 for 2021], it's a little different from PSR right? I mean PSR is front-end weighted, big reductions in OR and then those are reductions taper off as we get through the plan. What yours suggest is that you're looking for 100 basis points this year, but then accelerating to 220 per year in the next couple of years and that's why I'm struggling a little bit, if you can tie TOP21 in to show why operating ratio is in fact going to double in its pace of improvement in 2020 and 2021 to get to that 60% target, certainly will be helpful.","Alan Shaw","Well, there is more to come. And as we laid out at Investor Day, this will be an iterative network planning process and there will be additional phases of operating plan change and optimization coming. Those will be the basis for further operating ratio improvements, as well as the growth that we can manage for the duration of the planned period into 2021.","Walter Spracklin","Will you be providing guidance again like you did this year for 2020 operating ratio as you get into the 2020 period?","Jim Squires","Well, we'll see. I would certainly expect us to update you on the productivity and SDI service delivery index goals that we laid out for you. We will give you new goals, which are in turn linked to the operational and financial improvements we expect to drive.","Walter Spracklin","That's great. Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.","Bascome Majors","Yes. Volume was down year-over-year in the quarter, but revenue was still up slightly, and margins expanded about a point to drive the income up 4%. Excuse me, operating income. But if you look beyond the financials, the operating metrics were up a lot more, velocity up 20%, dwell down close to 40%. Why aren't we seeing more costs fall out of the system from this more fluid network. I mean, is this temporal challenge is like the stock comp benefit you had last year that hurt the year-over-year comparison in labor? Or is it just a situation that investor expectations around how quickly we're going to see stair-step margin improvement in NS, are those just too high early on here? Thanks.","Jim Squires","We did see TOP21 driven expense improvements in second quarter as Cindy went through in labor, in materials and equipment rents and we would expect those savings to continue and to accelerate in the balance of the year. Now, in the second quarter, those favorable expense trends were offset in certain cases by the comparison to last year. For example, the employment tax refund, we booked in the second quarter of last year, and there were some other things as well. For example, in materials and other that masked the improvements in materials expense. Going forward, we do expect to see additional TOP21 driven savings in all of those categories.","Bascome Majors","Thank you for that. Jim. And last one, I believe it was Slide 10 where you lay out your KPIs, a reiteration of what you talked about the Investor Day with 2019 goals and 2021 goals. You gave some directional commentary about where you're tracking mid-2019, but you don't have hard metrics on the slide. Can you give a little more color about the degree of progress we've made toward the bridge from 2018 to 2019 goals? What looks like a lay-up and what's a bit more stretch from where we see today? Thank you.","Jim Squires","Yes. Thank you, Mike why don't you go through your commentary again on each of those goals.","Mike Wheeler","Yes. So, the service delivery index were as we noted were trending ahead of that and we are on track to exceed the goal. Same thing with T&E and productivity, we're trending ahead of that as well. And so, we feel comfortable about that. Train weight, we talked about it being back-end loaded and as we implement the new TOP21 plan we see some improvements there. We're already seeing some in general merchandise. Locomotive productivity, we are on track to meet or exceed and Cars-on-Line we are exceeding and will be exceeding for the year.","Bascome Majors","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of [KARRIN Russo] with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good morning guys. So, just quickly on some housekeeping items. So, the tax rate came in a little lower than what we had been looking for this quarter. Maybe you could talk about if there was something unique about this quarter and what the expectation might be for the second half and then also if you could give the number on real estate gains for the quarter?","Jim Squires","Cindy?","Cindy Earhart","Effective tax rate was 22.7%, which had some benefits in two pieces really. One, being the benefits of stock-based compensation that hit the quarter. And then secondly, the returns on corporate-owned life insurance. For the full-year, we're expecting that the effective tax rate will be between 23% and 24%. And in terms of real estate sales on operating property, they were not [significant]. We already \u2013 we called out there was non-operating property sales of \u2013 I guess was around $10 million.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then just I wanted to return to this OR question and I feel like maybe we've beat it to death a little bit, but you guys had set out efficiency targets obviously, at the Analyst Day and it feels like volumes have come in a little bit weaker than what most people would have expected, maybe if you could just talk about the extent to which you see your cost structure as moving in tandem with what volumes are because it feels like certainly on OR and also on headcount, you're trending well ahead of your full-year targets, at least through the first half. Should we expect some moderation in the pace of those gains, because it feels like it would be the opposite given kind of the implementation of TOP21 now just starting up in July. Maybe you could talk about the extent to which you see that cost structure is variable with volumes?","Jim Squires","We created ratio based KPIs that Mike has been through. In order to keep us focused on productivity relative to GTMs on the network that was the basic rationale for setting forth our KPIs in that way. And that's why we remain focused on and we're making progress. We're winning there because as Mike went through, we have generated or are close to generating the types of results that will at least meet or exceed the target ratios for 2019. So, we are adjusting the resources in light of the volume trend, thus the intense focus on productivity and efficiency and all of the different areas we've been through.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thanks. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. And I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Jim Squires for closing comments.","Jim Squires","Thank you very much everyone for your time and attention this morning. We appreciate your questions, and we look forward to talking with you next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day."],"16469":["Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) Q4 2012 Earnings Call January 22, 2013  4:30 PM ET","Executives","Michael Hostutler ","Charles W.

Overall volumes fell 1%, as coal volumes declined 13%, but intermodal and merchandise volumes grew 4% and 1%, respectively.","For the full year, revenues were $11 billion, only a 1% decrease from 2011, despite a 17% decline in coal revenue. Don will provide you with all of the revenue details in a few minutes.","The combination of volume decreases, coupled with expense control, resulted in net income for the quarter of $413 million, down 14%, and diluted earnings per share of $1.30, down 8%. For the full year, net income and earnings per share decreased 9% and 1%, respectively. And John will provide you with all of the financial details.","With respect to service, Railroad continues to run extremely well. We have maintained superior service levels throughout 2012 and we saw a continued improvement in our network velocity and terminal dwell during the fourth quarter. These items were a big driver in our ability to maintain an average composite service index at an all-time high of above 83%. And as we have mentioned, an efficiently run network helps in our efforts to keep expenses under control.","Mark will provide you with all of the operating details in a few minutes and give you some more information about our continuing initiatives to drive both productivity improvements and increased service levels across the network.","In 2013, we'll also continue our focus on improving customer service in running our network efficiently. Part of that plan is strong capital investment. And John will provide some details of our planned $2 billion capital program.","At this point, I'll turn the program over to Don and the rest of the team, and I'll return with some closing remarks before we take questions. Don?","Donald W. Seale","Thanks, Wick, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue during the fourth quarter was down $113 million, or 4%, as a weak coal market offset gains in intermodal and merchandise. Declining volumes across most coal segments and lower export pricing year-over-year contributed to a 23% decline in coal revenue. Partially offsetting this decline, intermodal revenue set an all-time quarterly record at $584 million, up 5% versus 2011, while merchandise revenue was up a solid 4%.","Negative price and mix accounted for the majority of the revenue variance in the quarter at $105 million, while volume accounted for $23 million of the overall decline. This impact was slightly offset by higher fuel surcharge revenue of $15 million year-over-year and a positive $25 million lag in the quarter.","Total volume for the quarter declined by 15,000 units, or 1%, with revenue per unit of $1,498, down $50 or 3%. Segmenting total revenue per unit, coal RPU was down 11%, while RPU levels for both merchandise and intermodal were up 2% versus last year.","With respect to volume, total shipments for the quarter were down 1%, as robust growth in domestic intermodal and a modest increase in merchandise nearly offset a 13% decline in coal volumes. Volume growth within merchandise was mixed for the quarter, as solid gains in chemicals and automotive more than offset a decline in metals and construction.","Now turning to our major markets and beginning with coal. Revenue for the quarter of $657 million was down $193 million or 23% for the quarter. Weaker demand across nearly all markets resulted in an overall volume decline of 13%, and a fundamentally weaker pricing environment for export coal contributed to an 11% decline in revenue per unit for the quarter.","Utility coal, which was the largest driver of our decline in volume, was down nearly 42,000 loads or 16%. Volumes in the North were down 19%, while for our southern utilities, were down 13%.","Declines were primarily driven by competition from natural gas, the sluggish demand for electricity in the face of weak industrial electricity usage and mild winter weather. Stockpiles and NS serve utilities have increased by 6 days on average since the third quarter, as coal burn has failed to meet demand.","Export volume was flat for the quarter. Increased steam coal from the Illinois Basin to the river, at an 8% increase in volume through Baltimore, were partially offset by a 10% decline at Lamberts Point. As we've seen in the last 2 quarters, the closure of RG Steel in June continued to have an impact on our domestic metallurgical business, which was down 17% in the quarter. Domestic rail steel production, down 4% in the fourth quarter, was also a contributing factor.","Turning now to our intermodal network. Intermodal revenue in the quarter reached an all-time high of $584 million, up 5% versus 2011, driven by a 4% higher volume and improved pricing. Continued success in highway conversions led to a 9% gain in domestic volume for the quarter.","International volume, down 1% in the quarter, was up 12%, excluding the impact of the Maersk contract loss. Both Triple Crown and premium experienced modest declines in the quarter, due in part to a conversion in equipment types in certain lanes.","Now wrapping up with our merchandise sector. Revenue for the quarter reached $1.4 billion, up $50 million or 4% over last year, driven by a 2% gain in revenue per unit, combined with an overall 1% gain in volume.","Metals & Construction, our largest merchandise segment, experienced a 4% decline in volume, due primarily to reduced iron and steel shipments associated with the RG Steel closure that I mentioned a moment ago.","Along with fewer shipments of natural gas drilling materials. As with the third quarter, we continued to see a marked reduction in active natural gas rig counts in our service territory, which was down 27% versus 1 year ago, reflecting low dry natural gas pricing and excess supply of gas in the market.","Moving to the agricultural markets. Strong shipments of soybeans and feed helped to offset declines in corn and ethanol. Corn volumes, down 26% in the quarter, was driven by reduced long-haul movements to southeastern poultry feeders, due to strong local crops, as well as the closure of 2 ethanol production facilities. And chemicals volume was up 9% for the quarter, due mostly to the increase in crude oil traffic from the Bakken and Canadian oilfields, as we continue to ramp up service to Eastern refineries.","Turning to automotive. shipments were up 6%, as we benefited from a stronger overall market, which was partially offset by the transfer of the Ford Escape from Kansas City to an NS -- not to a non-NS served assembly plant.","And finally, the 1% increase in paper traffic was the result of an improvement in housing-related goods, partially offset by decline in waste materials.","Now concluding with our outlook. The market ahead is mostly positive, but we face continuing headwinds across our coal markets. Competition from natural gas will continue to impact our utility franchise, and we do not expect a material improvement in overall demand for electricity. And with over 50% of the winter now concluded, we no longer expect what we would call normal temperatures for the winter.","With respect to export metallurgical and steam coal demand, we see -- we see continued sluggish demand in Europe, with some improvement in Asia. With both markets, U.S. coals will continue to struggle to remain competitive from a total cost perspective, which makes this market volatile and uncertain and very difficult to forecast. We see a soft, domestic metallurgical market ahead, and we will not clear the RG Steel comp until the third quarter of the year.","Turning to Intermodal. We expect to see continued opportunities for highway conversion, as we launch new service lanes and ramp-up volumes at newly opened terminals. As I mentioned last quarter, we are rolling out over 30 new Crescent Corridors -- corridor lanes this year. And notably, we are doing so without a meaningful increase in train starts, which will translate into further productivity gains. And having now cleared the negative comp associated with the loss of the Maersk contract, we also expect growth across our international intermodal market in the year 2013.","In merchandise, we expect growth in 3 of our 5 business groups in the months ahead, led by chemicals, automotive and housing related materials. And the other 2, Metals & Construction and agriculture, we anticipate flat to modest declines in the first half, with an improving outlook for the second half of the year.","In summary, we expect that the broad markets we serve will generate volume growth ahead despite a challenging coal market. And with respect to pricing, as we've conveyed in past quarters, we remain committed to market-based pricing at levels that equal or exceed the rate of rail inflation over time. Thanks for your attention. And now I'll turn it over to Mark, for the operations report.","Mark D. Manion","Thanks, Don, and good afternoon. Starting with safety. Based on preliminary data, our fourth quarter performance through December stands at 0.80, and our performance for the year was 0.80 as well. That's not quite as good, but in the same range as 2011, which was 0.75. 2011 was our best year ever.","Turning to service. On the next slide, our composite service metric continues to show year-over-year improvement. For the fourth quarter, composite performance stands at 83.4%, our highest quarterly composite ever, and it represents a 9.4% improvement over the fourth quarter last year. The gains were lead by train performance, which has improved 25% versus the same quarter last year. And all the service components, train performance, connection performance and plant adherence, continue to be at or above targeted levels. For the year, composite performance stands at 83.1% and represents a 9.5% improvement over last year and our best annual performance ever.","Advancing the slide to train speed, we reported our highest ever quarterly train speed in the third quarter of 2012, which surpassed our 2009 record, when volumes were considerably lower. And we've set yet another record in the fourth quarter, increasing 3.2 miles an hour, or 15% compared to the fourth quarter last year. We've seen consistent sequential and year-over-year improvement through 2012. For the year, we posted a 13% improvement over 2011.","On the next slide, Terminal Dwell, is the other major component of network velocity, and it also has showed continual improvement. For the fourth quarter, Terminal Dwell was 21.7 hours, compared to 24.5 hours for fourth quarter of 2011, a reduction of 2.8 hours or 11%. For the year, we posted a 12% improvement over 2011.","Turning next to operating efficiencies. As evidenced in the previous slides, the fourth quarter and really all of 2012, was a story of record-setting customer service and velocity. And as we've discussed in previous calls, velocity drives productivity and efficiency. I won't read through the improvements on the slide. But from a velocity perspective, the first 4 items on this list represent annual savings of approximately $40 million year-over-year. Gross ton miles per gallon additionally saved us $17 million year-over-year.","Turning to the next slide. At the end of 2012, we had 258 locomotives stored. In 2012, we operated with 139 fewer locomotives than 2011. By early 2012, we had returned all of our service recovery leased locomotives, which saved us $12 million. At the same time, we've been able to store in-service, ready state locomotives that are higher horsepower locomotives to the extent of 100.","We regard -- with regard to railcars, due to velocity, general demand, seasonal demand and cars awaiting program repairs, we have just over 9,000 cars in storage.","And finally, we have 590 employees currently furloughed. This is comprised of 450 train and engine service employees, either furloughed or on retention boards and 50 mechanical department employees.","On the next slide, looking forward, let's review a few of the productivity initiatives that are currently underway. This is far from a complete list, but merely a representation of the type of projects that we're moving forward with in 2013.","In 2013, we'll continue to advance new and ongoing initiatives that generate either higher network velocities. In fact, the requirement for every initiative is that it either increases network velocity or it reduces cost without negatively impacting network velocity. These productivity initiatives will drive both expense and capital savings.","Now advancing through the next productivity initiatives slides. Through better coordination and because of record-setting performance, our maintenance away production gangs are working more efficiently than ever. Additionally, through improved planning, work associated with these gangs will be more streamlined in 2013 as well. This will reduce both expense and capital, and through these and a variety of initiatives, will allow us to reduce 300 employees through attrition during the year.","Now let's turn to one of our asset utilization initiatives. One initiative involves a more flexible investment strategy for our track structure. This initiative entails increasing the number of years between capital investment in ties and surfacing, or T&S cycles. Disciplined maintenance, along with technology and process improvements, are allowing us to reevaluate and implement more efficient maintenance practices going forward.","Let's turn to another asset utilization initiative benefiting both expense and capital. This one is in our mechanical department. In 2013, we will reduce the number of engine overhauls to the lowest level in decades. The acquisition of new locomotives over many years and our aggressive plans for capital rebuilding of older locomotives at our Juniata locomotive facility have made this possible.","Our continued focus on preventative maintenance is also facilitating this opportunity. Regarding network rightsizing, our increased velocity, as well as improvements in technology, lean engineering and improved processes, are allowing us to take a harder look at our infrastructure and employee base.","Other areas actively being progressed include: Reviews of inefficient work rules; fuel efficiency projects like leader and other technology applications, like Movement Planner. As I mentioned earlier, this is just a sample of the type initiatives that we have underway. For 2013, we are targeting over $100 million in expense savings.","More to come on all these fronts. And now I'll turn it over to you, John.","John P. Rathbone","Thank you, Mark. I'll now review our fourth quarter and full year financial results. Let's start with a recap of revenues.","As Don described, Railway operating revenues totaled $2.7 billion, down $113 million or 4% compared to prior year's fourth quarter record. The components of the decrease are illustrated on Slide 3 and were driven by a change in our coal traffic, which translated into lower price and negative mix and lower volumes. Fuel revenues of $302 million were slightly higher than last year, and we also experienced a favorable fuel lag of $25 million during the quarter.","Slide 4 displays our total operating expenses, which decreased $27 million, or 1% for the quarter. The resulting income generated from Rail Operations was $714 million, down 11%, largely due to the decrease in revenues. Our operating ratio was 73.4%, or 2 points higher than our 71.4% reported in the fourth quarter of 2011.","Turning to our expenses. The next slide shows the major components of the $27 million decrease. And I'll go over each of the components in detail.","Materials and others fell $22 million, or 10%, due primarily to a $17 million reduction in our personal injury-related expenses, as we recognized benefits for improved safety.","Next, compensation and benefits decreased by $8 million or 1%. Reduced employee activities and lower performance-based compensation, partially offset by increased pay rates and higher pension and postretirement costs.","As displayed on Slide 8, fuel decreased $8 million or 2%. Decreased consumption of $21 million more than [ph]    offset the impact of higher prices. Diesel fuel consumption was down 5% relative to a 2% decline in gross ton miles and was achieved by our improved network performance.","Lastly, purchase services and rents decreased by $1 million. Lower engineering and transportation services and lower equipment rents were largely offset by a $15 million charge for Conrail-related casualty costs and certain higher professional and consulting services.","Turning to our nonoperating items. Coal royalties, which are based on production, down $7 million. Other largely offsetting items brought total nonoperating income to $36 million, or an 8% decline versus 2011. Interest expense on debt was up $13 million due to increased net borrowings. Income before income taxes decreased $102 million, or 14%, due primarily to lower operating income.","Income taxes totaled $208 million, and the effective tax rate was 33.5%, compared to 33.6% in 2011. Both periods have lower than our typical 37% to 38% effective rate. 2012 included a $6 million benefit related to the completion of the IRS examination of our 2009 and 2010 federal returns. And 2011, as you may recall, included $11 million in favorable benefits from state tax law changes in that year.","Net income for the quarter was $413 million, a decrease of $67 million, or 14% compared to 2011. Diluted earnings per share were $1.30, down $0.12 or 8%.","Turning our focus to the full year revenues of $11 billion were down 1% versus 2011, and operating expenses decreased 1% or $43 million. The resulting income from railway operations of $3.1 billion, declined $3 million or $89 million. The operating ratio increased somewhat to 71.7% for the year, compared to 71.2% in 2011.","Net income from the year reached $1.7 billion, second only to our 2011 $1.9 billion record. Diluted earnings per share decreased from $5.45 to $5.37 per share. These results reflect a 9% decrease in net income and a 1% decrease in earnings per share. This highlights the effect of our share repurchase program.","As shown on the next slide, cash from operation covered our capital spending and produced $824 million in free cash flow. From free cash flow, we distributed $624 million in dividends. The remainder combined with proceeds from borrowing, supported a $1.3 billion of share repurchases.","We expect continued success in generating free cash flow and in accessing debt markets to effectively support our capital structure. Our priorities are first, reinvesting our business, followed by protecting our dividend policy, which targets a 1\/3 payout of earnings over time; then any incremental cash will be applied to share repurchases, guided by our assessment of market conditions.","Turning now to planned capital spending. We have budgeted $2 billion for 2013, which we expect to fully fund with cash generated from operations. The 2013 budget is 10% below our 2012 capital expenditures.","Excluding federally mandated investments in positive train control, the budget is 14% below last year. Our capital plan has been constructed to support our strategic drivers, maintain the safety and quality of our existing franchise, to improve service quality and performance and to achieve operational efficiencies and productivity improvements and to support business growth.","In line with previous years, the majority of our capital expenditures, roughly 2\/3, will be invested in replacement in core projects to ensure the continued safety, safe and reliable operation of our railroad. This includes improving the condition of our right-of-way, replacing rolling stock and other equipment and complying with safety and regulatory requirements. Another 11% of the budget will be spent on positive train control. The remaining 22% supports projects that promote growth, efficiency and productivity of our franchise.","Categories of our planned capital expenditures are depicted on Slide 19. The decrease versus the last 2 years is primarily in freight cars and facilities and terminals. Freight cars are lower because we do not plan to purchase any new coal cars in 2013. We will, however, continue to rebody existing coal cars as a lower cost option. The reduction in facilities and terminals is due to the fact that we are in the process of completing the last major Crescent Corridor terminal in Charlotte, North Carolina.","We continue to invest in a number of growth and efficiency projects. These include multilevel freight cars to handle increased automotive traffic and new or expanded bulk transport facilities, projects to improve service, velocity, productivity, include targeted infrastructure investments, mechanical service facilities to keep our rolling stock in reliable condition, and further progress in our multiyear project to expand Bellevue yard in Northern Ohio. And as always, investment in technology will drive service improvements and efficiency.","The capital plan fully supports the business growth that Don described, the operating efficiency improvement that Mark discussed, and our long-term strategic objectives.","I'll now turn the program back to Wick for closing remarks.","Charles W. Moorman","Thank you, John. As you've heard, given the ongoing downturn in our coal franchise, Norfolk Southern posted good results for the fourth quarter, driven at least in part by good expense control and a strong operating performance.","As you heard from Don, some of our business group, such as export coal, are difficult, if not impossible to forecast in these uncertain economic times. But we remain committed to continued productivity improvements, as well as making sure that our costs reflect to the fullest extent possible what our actual business levels are.","One of our core strategic initiatives is to lower the long-term cost curves for both of our -- both our expense and capital budgets. And we're confident that we have the people, processes and systems to do just that.","Mark showed you how we're doing that in our operating expenses, while driving even higher levels of customer service. And you can see it happening in our capital budget as well.","To reiterate a couple of examples you've heard. On the capital side, we're committed to using new technologies, which will allow us to maintain our infrastructure at its current high state of repair with lower material cost. Another example is our continuing programs to rebuild our existing locomotive fleet using our superb locomotive shops at Altoona, Pennsylvania. We're also making sure that we spend our capital dollars wisely based on our business levels.","For example, as we've told you before, a large percentage of our coal car fleet is becoming life expired over the next few years. However, given the near-term uncertainty around our coal franchise, as John told you, we chose this year to only continue with a less expensive program to rebody some of the fleet rather than buy any new cars. And we'll make sure that we match our purchases and therefore, our asset base with the business levels in future years.","At the same time, we will continue to invest in velocity and productivity improvements. We'll spend some more money this year to continue our long-term program of systematically eliminating infrastructure bottlenecks on our network. We can see the benefits of this program as we watch our network velocity increase. [indiscernible] by these enhancements. We'll continue to invest in new business development as well. You've heard about the significant Crescent Corridor investments we've made, which now stand ready to help us drive a continued intermodal growth for years to come. But we're also investing in projects across the system to drive growth in our other business groups as well.","Looking ahead, we still feel confident about our long-term ability to grow our franchise at above GDP rates. While coal is clearly the wildcard, our intermodal and merchandise franchises are both well-positioned. And as Don has shown you, we see positive momentum in most areas of our business. We'll stay focused on maintaining and improving network velocity and customer service, while at the same time, running a leaner and more cost efficient operation. Our goal remains what it always has been, to grow our business with good margins by providing a superior service product, and thereby, drive superior returns for our shareholders.","We have a great team and I am confident in our ability to do just that. Thanks for your attention, everyone, and we'll now open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wanted to dig in a bit on this coal pricing. Obviously, down 11%. You said that it was materially weighted towards the export side. So curious how export broke down from a volume standpoint, thermal versus met. And then, also, if you could talk a little bit about mix and how length of haul may have influenced some of the yield deterioration in the quarter, that'd be helpful.","Donald W. Seale","Justin, this is Don. With respect to export first. 75% of our export tons in the quarter were metallurgical coal, 25% was steam. And I would add for the year, the tally was 79% met and 21% steam. That market, as we indicated in the remarks, continues to be challenged with respect to world pricing. We have seen Australian coal to Asia here recently tick up a little bit from 1 60 to 1 70 per ton. So a little bit of encouragement there with the world market improving with respect to settlement in China. On the mix and length of haul, we did have an increase in the quarter of Illinois basin coal going to the river for Convent, Louisiana for export over the Port of New Orleans, that is shorter haul business, it's a good business for us, but it does generate a lower RPU. Also, as I pointed out, our Lamberts Point tonnage was off 10%. Carloads were off 10%, and our Baltimore traffic was up 8%. And our Baltimore exports carry a lower revenue per unit than our longer haul Lamberts Point export. I hope that covers the question.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes -- no, that's extremely helpful. Switching topics a little bit, I wanted to dig in. You called out crude by rail as one of the opportunities as you're looking out this year. It looks like PBF has a contract with you guys that should be increasing this year. And wanted to also get a sense how that pipeline looks as you look out at 2013. By our calculations, it looked like just that ramp alone is like a 30% bump to your current run rate. So curious, as you pick up these different contracts, how excited you are about this opportunity as we look out over the next several months?","Donald W. Seale","Justin, we see a material opportunity in crude oil, and I will confirm that we have executed a contract with PBF for its Delaware City, Delaware refinery. We're very pleased to have that. And we see some significant opportunities for growth in 2013, on top of the base that we built in 2012.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","All right. Well -- and any color on those crude by rail carloads from a yield standpoint, how they compare to the rest of your chemical line?","Donald W. Seale","I can't get into the particulars because these are contract based rates. But I will tell you that those are revenue per unit, unit train moves that are appealing to us.","Operator","Our next question is from Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Don, in the quarter, did you have any revenue from take-or-pay, so liquidated damages in the coal contracts? And if so, how much was that?","Donald W. Seale","We had one entry on a ongoing contract shortfall in volume. And Jake, I think it was in the range of $9 million.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And that would be in the coal revenue line or is it in another revenue...","Donald W. Seale","Yes, in the coal.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So not too big at this point. Okay. And now...","Donald W. Seale","And it's a long-term, ongoing accrual on that, Bill, not just a quarterly accrual.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Okay. And then, as you think about what occurred here in 2012, should we expect that, that will be a driver to sort of coal yields in 2013?","Donald W. Seale","Not a driver, no.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then when you look at sort of the long term here and we look at kind of what happens with coal and I realize Norfolk Southern has a large and very profitable coal franchise. So if coal levels today are kind of steady from here, is it the sort of thing where you can get back to industry-leading margins like you had at one point, or do we need coal to come back in a much bigger way, given the mix effect it has on the overall business?","Donald W. Seale","Bill, I'll segment that question into 2 parts. As you know, our utility franchise is about 70% of our coal volume. And utility business, we were off about 20 million tons of coal for the full year, about 5 million tons in the quarter. We estimate that gas competition, for the year, was about 50% of that shortfall. And then you -- it cascades down into demand that was weaker due to weather, plant maintenance, a couple of small plant closures. So for utility business to rebound in terms of its volume and to help us grow that business back, we need electricity demand to pick back up, we need industrial load demand for electricity to improve, and we need gas prices to move up into the -- above the $3.50 to $4 range. The PRB coal dispatch is at $3, but Central App does not. Even Northern App coal is pressed. So we need to see natural gas prices move up above $3.50 to $4. So that addresses utility. And it's all about demand and it's about gas competition. On the export side of our business, we need a couple of things to happen: One, the world economy needs to improve. China, you probably saw, had a record December, which helped us in our December, as far as export metallurgical and some steam coal. But Western Europe, where 50% of our export coal is destined, continues to be very anemic with respect to its economic recovery. So those are the kind of things we need to see before we will see export coal pricing and see the delivered price of coal improve in the world where U.S. coals are more competitive. As you know, year before last, metallurgical coal prices hit $330 per metric ton in the world market. That gave plenty of room for U.S. coals to compete, with it dropping to $1.60, now at $1.70 on the latest settlement. There's a lot less room for supply chain pricing and the coal price and still be competitive in the market.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So -- sorry, Don, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but just for clarification. So in terms of the ability to kind of get back to industry-leading margins, I suppose all of this was sort of to say what we've got underway here can help get us there. But it doesn't get us all the way. What we really need are some of these things that you listed here to push us back. Is that what you were trying to convey?","Donald W. Seale","No, we certainly need those in addition to the things we're doing from an operational efficiency perspective . For coal, we need the pricing to improve and the market improve to allow for that.","Operator","Our next question is from Peter Nesvold of Jefferies & Company.","H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I'm just going to keep it to one. I mean, it's actually similar to some degree, I think, from the prior question. I think what I'm trying to struggle -- what I'm struggling with right now is how much of the decline in coal volumes actually comes back in domestic business at some point? Sort of point taken, there are a lot of variables, electricity consumption, that gas prices, et cetera. But if we were to say that perhaps roughly, coal tons domestically are down 28% from Norfolk's past peak, if you were to get back to sort of normalized levels of nat gas prices, industrial production, et cetera, how much of that do you think comes back as opposed to volumes that are sort of gone forever?","Donald W. Seale","Well, from the utility perspective, we think that we would see significant improvement in the tonnage levels that we handled in 2012. The 122 million tons that we handled the prior year is certainly not an unattainable target. If we had industrial production improve, if we had natural gas prices move up, we still have the utility generation plants that are base loaded. We have a great franchise in utilities that we serve. And we have great franchises with respect to origin coal coming out of all the basins. So the stage is set if we had all of those other things coming back.","H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Is there any way to kind of quantify it though? I mean, I think you had said, in response to Bill's question, that half of the declining utility was nat gas related. But I suspect that there's also an element of electricity consumption in there as well?","Donald W. Seale","Right. Right. The demand being soft from the industrial usage side, as well as residential demand. And then the weather component that generates a demand component as well.","Operator","Our next question is from Jason Seidl of Dahlman Rose.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Two quick questions for you, I guess. One, sticking on the coal side, you mentioned that 50% of the coal that you guys ship is destined to Western Europe. What percent is destined to China?","Donald W. Seale","We are, Jason, we are currently about 30% to Asia, including China.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","30% to Asia. Okay, but that includes China. Okay, which I imagine is the bulk of it. Next question, jumping back to intermodal, because I'm very intrigued by the increase in capacity in the Crescent Corridor this year, and especially, the comment that you made that you're not going to really have to increase that many train starts to accommodate that. So I guess, I'll ask you the question in a different way. What percent of the business that you're going to be bringing on to these new -- some of these new lanes? There's going to go on existing train sets. Is it going to be 80? Is it going to be 75?","Donald W. Seale","Jason, I'll answer that in a slightly different way. We expect our crew starts to be up less than 2% for intermodal, for all of 2013. And I cannot share with you our specific volume expectation.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","You can just e-mail that, that's fine.","Donald W. Seale","But I will tell you that our expectation is higher than that number.","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Group of Wolfe Trahan.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","So, Don, another one for you, on the coal side. I appreciate what you said earlier about mix. I wanted to see if you can get a little more granular. You gave some great color last quarter about export, met coal rates that were tracking down. I think you said about 25% in the September, October timeframe. I'm wondering if you can give us an update on where we stand on that pricing today? And if you can give us a similar thought on the export thermal pricing as well?","Donald W. Seale","Scott, the pricing environment has not improved materially from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, moving into the first quarter. That glimmer of hope that I mentioned earlier on this most recent settlement might indicate that we have reached the bottom, that the world market may be poised for some improvement. We'll have to wait and see if that is reality. But we continue to see a very soft world market for coal because of the delivered price constraints. That's both on metallurgical and thermal coal. Thermal coal exports from this country, which are heavy to Europe, the API 2 index is such that it's been averaging $92 per ton. And at $92 per ton, many of our mines are out-of-the-money, with respect to being competitive of selling coal into a market with that type of a price.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","That's helpful. Can you give us a little bit of just color on how you're actually pricing the business now? I feel like the met used to be priced annually in April. How is that being priced now?","Donald W. Seale","Well, from April 1 on this past year, we were basically pricing on a spot basis. As we entered the third quarter, we started to price on a quarterly basis, and the fourth quarter was priced on a quarterly basis. And I will tell you that the first quarter is as well. But that doesn't mean that we are not completing some spot deals on the side over and above the quarterly pricing.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Right. So I guess, maybe relative to 28 million tons of export in '12, is there any way of thinking how much business you have -- what percent of that you've got locked in for '13?","Donald W. Seale","No, because frankly, even with the quarterly pricing, we have an indication of potential volumes. But we don't have volume guarantees with that pricing.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay, that's really helpful. And just last thing on the Intermodal side with all of the Clutch [ph] and Carter [ph] coming online. Maybe for Wick or Don, can you talk about how you're thinking about your Intermodal partners and relationships there? And any changes or improvements or anything that you'd like to accomplish?","Charles W. Moorman","Well, there's nothing on the horizon right now in terms of changes or -- of any significance with our partners. We obviously have some great partners on the domestic side: Hunt, Hub and a lot of other folks and then some steamship carriers that we are close to and do a lot of business with as well. But we don't anticipate 2013 as being a year in which there are changes of any kind in our relationship with those partners. What we're really focused on, as Don said in 2013, is taking the opportunity to realize some significant gains on the Crescent Corridor, given the investments that we completed in our new intermodal terminals and our infrastructure improvements.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Maybe just a question going back on to the coal side. Just from a utility standpoint, Don, how should we think about kind of the book of business in 2013? Do you have significant renewals that we should be expecting in '13? Or is most of that book covered at this point?","Donald W. Seale","Chris, we have the vast majority of the book covered. We had one contract that I mentioned in the third quarter that we were addressing. That was about 5% to 6% of our utility tons. We have settled that contract for 2013.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And the rest is just continuing on multi-year deals.","Donald W. Seale","Right.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, I don't know if you can give it to us, but you did last quarter. Just kind of an update on how January volumes from an export perspective are trending. So we got, obviously, the quarter and just wanted to get a rough sense of kind of how to think about that beginning here in the first quarter, if you could.","Donald W. Seale","Well, January is off to a fairly solid start. Volume-wise, our coal continues to be down overall. Up through about the first 18 days, we're somewhere in the range of 10% off year-over-year. Our merchandise business is up in the range of 5% and our intermodal business is up a little north of that, 10% or 11%, in that range. So car loadings are -- the overall car loadings are off to a pretty good start in January. With respect to export, we're continuing to see the boat show up, let me put it that way. And we won't have as strong a January as we had the end of the quarter in December. But we expect a decent export month in January.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Ceraso of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","What is your outlook for rail inflation in 2013? Just a ballpark number. And then in your comment on pricing, you mentioned that you expect to exceed, over time, pricing in excess of rail inflation. I'm wondering if that's an innovation in the language of the phrase over time suggest that there will be periods where, whether it's coal or something else, causes you to trail rail inflation even for a limited period of time.","John P. Rathbone","When we look at rail inflation, right now, I think we would guesstimate it's in the 3% range, looking at labor contracts and other things like that. I think what Don and I would both tell you in terms of our core belief on what we can do with pricing, as Don said it, over the long term, we'll price at or above whatever rail inflation is running. We've seen it in the past. We'll probably see it again where we make it a quarterly hiccup of some kind and not quite make that. But our goal is to do it over the long term.","Donald W. Seale","And Chris, just -- this is Don. To add one other data point. As you already know, I'm sure, the all-inclusive, less-fuel assumption for '13 is 1.4%. It's about 2.2% for the year and the RCAF is somewhere in that same range.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I'm sorry, can you repeat that? What was the 1.4% versus that 2.2%?","Donald W. Seale","The 1.4% is the annual growth in the all-inclusive, less fuel. And the unadjusted RCAF, the annual RAF [ph] is 2.2% for whatever that means.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. But you're thinking, including labor, et cetera, you'll be in, more or like, the 3% range?","Donald W. Seale","That's -- it's our guess right now.","Operator","Our next question is from Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I'll move off the coal topic here. And Don, perhaps focusing on the Met Con business. I know that was an area of weakness out of a franchise that, outside of coal, is progressing along pretty nicely. But with some of the leading indicators now turning in the right direction, your conversations with your customers in that line of business, are you getting the sense that 2013 might see that area coming back a little bit?","Donald W. Seale","On metals and construction, 2 segments. On the steel side, we do see it coming back. Even though in the fourth quarter, total steel production was off 4%. We think that both in the energy market, for pipe, tubular goods, as well as flat-rolled steel for automotive, the outlook is pretty good for 2013. On the construction side, we've got 2 drivers. One, the aggregates market and cement markets for highway construction, along with asphalt, is being impacted by state highway departments not having the money to build highways or to maintain highways, in some cases. So that's hurting the aggregates business. Also, we've seen a 27% decrease in the rig counts for natural gas drilling. And the inputs to that process is frac sand, pipe, drilling pads, et cetera. That business has softened as those rig counts has fallen.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's very helpful. Just a follow-up question now for Mark. There are, obviously, lots of moving parts in each of the different businesses, some doing very well and then coal suffering a little bit. When you look at your headcount plans for 2013, do you have a sense of where you might be in terms of changing headcount? And just a rough view, I think you mentioned, I think 3% was mentioned in wage inflation. I guess, we should pencil that in, in our models for wage inflation but just curious on headcount.","Mark D. Manion","Well, as far as our T&E goes, of course, that's going to move with the volume. But we've made some adjustments where we've actually reduced our T&E headcount here by several hundred, as I mentioned in my remarks. And then in addition to that, we've got projects under way, Walter, where we are going to be pretty much trimming across the board. We've got -- I mentioned we've got 300 people in engineering that we will be reducing through attrition throughout the year. And we've also got projects ongoing in a similar fashion in mechanical. So we're looking at all areas to reduce headcount to the extent we can.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So you think that headcount at the end of the year will be less than where it was at the end of 2012?","Mark D. Manion","It should be.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just as a follow -- just last one here for you, Mark. You talked a lot about the efficiencies, great job in terms of seeing those jobs. So I'm just curious into -- in terms of how much of that is really coal driven, obviously, a different dynamic here with coal haul and perhaps getting some relief as result of that. In other words, if we do start to see this discussion about $3.50, $4 gas price, and we sort [ph] of factor in a little bit higher coal haul, how much of those efficiencies, Mark, do you think you can hold on to that are not coal related and are true productivity enhancements?","Mark D. Manion","The productivity projects, Walter, are really across the board. They are -- these are system-wide. Of course, we've got projects that are going on that are in our coal service area as well, including infrastructure projects, projects connected with equipment. But for the most part, our projects are system-wide projects and are really not -- are not relative to volume per se, such as fuel-saving projects, projects in the mechanical area and the engineering area. Those are more system-wide.","Operator","Our next question is from Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wouldn't want to give you too long of a break from the coal question. So I'm going to jump back to one of those. How do you think about -- Wick, perhaps, you can take this one. How should we think about the magnitude of the earnings headwind you have from export coal? I guess the conclusion I reached from Don's comments is that maybe you keep the tonnage kind of static. You've done some, given some support to the producers. But you probably are facing a bit of a pricing reduction, at least, in the first half of the year on your export business. And that's a headwind in terms of year-over-year earnings growth. Your comps are probably more difficult in the first half than the second. So I don't know, is there any way you can frame that in terms of how we might think of that export coal headwind?","Charles W. Moorman","Well, I think the -- the way I would look at it is that, particularly on a year-over-year basis, as we keep saying, we just really don't know about the volumes. We do have some reasons to think that, as Don mentioned, that export coal -- that the coal itself, the pricing is fairly close to a bottom. Maybe it's turned a little bit. And as the price of high-quality met coal moves up, which it will over some period of time. In fact, that hopefully will provide us some tailwind in terms of our pricing ability rather than a headwind. So looking just at the year-over-year, going basis forward from where we are, I don't know that we see that as quite such as headwind, certainly, as we saw in 2012. Does that make sense? And I think we have other, as Don mentioned, in other business groups, and as Mark mentioned, I think we have some other tailwinds behind us in terms of our overall profitability that we're looking forward to capturing.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Would it be fair, though? I mean, I guess, I think Don you said something about a 25% reduction in export coal transport pricing, maybe that was third versus second or fourth versus third. But if you run at that rate in first half of the year, then there's some kind of a headwind that you do have at least in the first half of the year from the export pricing. Is that fair or am I missing that?","Donald W. Seale","No. Tom, you are -- you're correct. Until we clear the first quarter for sure and then part of the second quarter, we will have an earnings headwind with respect to export pricing. And as the -- if the market improves and as we clear that comp, obviously, we'll see that in improved numbers.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So I mean, is it reasonable for us to think about flat margins next year or improving margins? Or is it just hard to have visibility, given that you don't really know where export going, from the overall business in terms of margin performance?","Donald W. Seale","My guess would be the latter. The visibility is not clear enough for us to really take a stab of that.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt Troy of Susquehanna International.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Question for Don. There's obviously a lot of moving parts and pieces to the Intermodal story at Norfolk. I was just curious, we've been in some form of de-stocking for almost 18 months now, on and off. But given the lackluster peak and the decent holiday sales and a limited window until Chinese New Year, I was just curious in terms of your conversations with the international export -- excuse me, import side of Intermodal. I would have thought volumes would be a little bit better this time of the year, with some post-holiday restocking. What's your crystal ball? What's your conversation with customers indicating in terms of people's restocking intentions, specifically, as it relates to international Intermodal volumes, which have been weak for the rails generally sequentially?","Donald W. Seale","We had a favorable fourth quarter in international, reflecting that restocking and some ILA worries too in terms of labor negotiations. Excluding the Maersk contract, as I mentioned, our volumes for the quarter would have been up 11%. So that's a pretty robust fourth quarter in international. We're seeing that continue pretty much this month. The Chinese New Year comes a little bit earlier this year. And we are seeing that restocking component in the volumes currently. I will tell you that, in terms of the AAR reportings on our total volume, we set a new 52-week high in volume, the week ending December 15, which is highly unusual. We never see a 52-week high in December.","Charles W. Moorman","Don is being mild when he says highly unusual.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Right, I understand. I'm just looking more I guess at the industry rate of growth and port volumes, which I would have thought would have been better and not to undermine your results by any means. I guess, the second piece of my question would be, given the quarter is opening up, given the double-stacking capability and frankly, just given the wage and driver pay inflation, the shortage issues in truckload, the umbrella against which you price Intermodal, is it reasonable to assume that the Intermodal pricing over the next 2 to 3 to 4 years might be better than the last 2 to 3 to 4 years? And if I think about margins in that segment, and we know it's a hard business to make a buck in, but can we think of maybe some small step function of those approaching, what I would consider, your corporate average over that time frame?","Donald W. Seale","That's a very good assessment, and we concur with your assessment. We see an environment that should support the improvement. Truckload capacity is not expanding. The hours of service law will probably go into effect in July that will cost the motor carrier industry 3% to 5% of productivity. And drivers are not becoming more plentiful. They're getting shorter. So a lot of things, a lot of the drivers are set in the environment to support better pricing. And of course, we have invested in a network that we think is going to be very efficient in realizing that opportunity.","Operator","Our next question is from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Wick, I wanted to come back to Tom's question, maybe just to think about it from a different perspective. Export coal is only about 20% of your tonnage mix in the coal business, which is 25% of your revenue. So as we look at what Don laid out, which is pretty favorable trends in Intermodal growth in the merchandise segments. Mark is talking about improved efficiencies. Is that small percentage of your book of business giving you that much contribution that we can't look forward to earnings growth until we get more clarity?","Charles W. Moorman","Well, we don't drill down into the contribution of each component of our business. But it's -- as you know, coal is a very good business for us. And it has, in that regard, some impact on our earnings that's probably a little disproportionate to the actual volumes. So it is -- it's something we contend with. And we have to look at, not only the export coal, where, as Don has outlined, we've seen the -- some negative comps on rates to -- in order for us to remain competitive. But I mean, the other big piece of this is that 70% of our business is utility coal. And that's a substantial headwind right now. And until we see all of the things that Don outlined, more expensive gas, a return to more normal temperatures and an economy that starts to drive increased utility demand, that's going to remain challenged in the way that it has been for the last year. So I don't think you can just look at the export coal and draw conclusions. You have to look at the whole package in terms of our coal business.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And so then, is it fair to say that earnings growth is possible, but you're not going to have a lot of confidence until we get coal comps that are at least flat or even increasing slightly?","Charles W. Moorman","Well, as I -- it's -- I think, as I said in my conclusion, we feel confident, Don has talked about it, in the strength of a lot of pieces of our business. And right now, all we can do with coal is tell you what we see. And right now, unfortunately, for all of us, including our coal customers, who -- whose crystal balls are no clearer than ours, coal is going to be the wild card over the next number of months and maybe for the year or maybe even a little longer. We're just going to have to wait and see how coal does.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Hoexter of Bank of America.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can you talk about your long-term investment -- Intermodal investment needs? You talked about the 4 yards coming online last year. You've got another one and you've kind of talked about slowing your CapEx. So what kind of capacity does the network have right now for utilization of the network?","Charles W. Moorman","Well, we've added substantial capacity, Ken, obviously, with the numbers that you describe. And actually, if you look at it in terms of lifts, which is the way we look at it, just the work we have done over the past year has added the capacity for about 800,000 lifts beyond what we're doing today. And the Charlotte terminal will give us another 115,000, 130,000, somewhere in there. So we have a network today, which has opened up new capacity. And our goal right now is to start moving to fill that capacity without looking at significant new investments in Intermodal facilities unless an opportunity comes along in which we feel that it is justified by the business. And we have the capacity to grow and grow for, as I said, some number of years now. And that's what we intent on doing.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","On the utility settlement in -- the one you mentioned -- Don mentioned at the end of last year, or I guess going into this year's third quarter, did the utility change the volume commitments? Has the environment drastically changed in how the utilities are addressing those contracts?","Donald W. Seale","Ken, this is Don. They changed some of the sourcing assumptions from various basins and also adjusted some volumes based on their projected burn rate.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm sorry, can -- they changed the burn rate and the sourcing.","Donald W. Seale","They changed some of the sourcing assumptions, as well as the overall volume from those basins based on their projected burn rate for 2013.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, just if I can step back maybe and just a big picture here. You're slowing CapEx. You're reducing headcount. Is this -- are you making a statement more than coal in terms of -- in the years past, you've made the commitment that we're going to keep increasing CapEx because we want to show the regulators and the others that, as long as we're increasing returns, we're going to keep going there. So is this kind of sticking to that, as returns have come in a little bit, you pull back everything? Is this a bigger statement about long-term growth than just what you're seeing on the coal side? Maybe you can extrapolate a little bit on that.","Charles W. Moorman","No, I wouldn't read this that way at all. I think just on the coal side, as we said, we're going to be a little cautious this year in coal cars, and we talked before about -- we're going to have a long-term need for that. We'll be able to -- and the fortunate thing is the need is arising as the business is changing, and we'll be able to adjust. But I think what you're -- what our rest of our capital budget is reflective of, is the fact that we have finished a significant set of investments in Intermodal corridor, and the Intermodal corridors are largely finished. We think that positions us very well to grow. And we continue to make investments in other parts of our business, where we see growth opportunities. And we're going to take advantage of a network that's running very efficiently with a high velocity and continue to invest to make it run even better, that provides better customer service, and we've proven to ourselves and shown you, that more and more costs fall out as a result. So I think this is a very -- it's a very solid capital budget. I think it's going to position us to continue to grow, and it's also going to continue -- we'll also continue to run a more efficient railroad.","Operator","The next question is from Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Maybe a little more obscure question on domestic coal. Could you please comment on any PRB coal opportunities, perhaps current magnitude in your outlook for the next few years?","Donald W. Seale","In terms of PRB coal, it's about 17% of our current coal tonnage. Central App continues to be the highest component. It's at 31%. Northern App is about 27% of our sourcing. And Illinois Basin coal for the year was about 20 million tons and is growing very quickly, very fast, as a source for some of the export traffic to the river, as well as utility coal going to utilities with scrubbers.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And can you show the split on PRB? What's -- is any of that export or is that for domestic burn?","Donald W. Seale","It's all domestic utility burn.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Do you anticipate any export in that in the future or is it just too low value?","Charles W. Moorman","No. We are looking at various supply chains for PRB coal that -- where we possibly could be part of that supply chain for export. It's something we are continuing to analyze and review.","Operator","The next question is from John Larkin of Stifel, Nicolaus.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","If you can tolerate just one more coal question here. It was interesting to hear that you've perhaps seen some modification of the minimums included in the contracts. I'm wondering if those minimums have been lowered sufficiently such that the excess stockpiles that exist -- I think you mentioned that the stockpiles actually sequentially had increased from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, whether those minimums are now low enough that stockpiles can be reduced to the levels within, say, 6 to 12 months, such that we can reach, what I would call, steady-state delivery volume. That assumes, of course, that natural gas stays at $3.50 or lower and doesn't get up into that level where Central App and Northern App coal starts to look more attractive.","Donald W. Seale","John, that is a difficult question to answer. I would hope that demand improves to the point where we see the rising stockpile, I mentioned, 6 days higher than the third quarter, where the stockpiles are drawn down. And we reach a steady state that way. I don't think the contracts themselves, the ones we have, will address the stockpile situation. I think demand is going to be the driver for that.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then maybe more of a operationally oriented question here. The increases in network velocity and the decrease in Terminal Dwell, they've both been quite terrific here, certainly, year-over-year. Do you think that the headcount reductions and the amount of rolling stock, both locomotives and freight cars that you've been able to temporarily or permanently park, correlates with the tremendous increase in system velocity and the rate at which you're turning the assets?","Donald W. Seale","Definitely. The velocity has been the primary component. And for this year -- and it depends some on factors that we can't control, weather, most notably. But this year, we don't see any reason why we can't continue our velocity and even improve upon it. But we're not going to see the type of large improvements that we saw during the last 12 months. The improvements will just be somewhat more modest. But we'll continue to get benefit from reduced recrew activity, some reduced overtime on top of what we've seen before and just an overall tighter operating plan. So I see better things in the coming year but not to the large extent that we saw over the past 12 months.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I guess I would have seen -- expected to see a bigger reduction in headcount in the monthly STB filings. It did look like that was dropping enough relative to the great improvements that you've made. I was wondering if that's because the STB numbers include those that are on the retention board.","Donald W. Seale","Yes. Keep it -- 2 things for that. One, keep in mind that as far as headcount goes, to the greatest extent, we're paying people when they work. And like we've talked about before, it's an activity-based thing as far as transportation goes. And so as the velocity of the railroad improved, the fluctuation, that in itself is not going to have so dramatic an effect on headcount. But there were some reductions that took place as far as furlough activity and retention board activity more recently. And that was most likely not reflected in numbers you were looking at, unless it's just been here in the last several days.","Operator","Our next question is from Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird.","Kenton Moorhead - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","This is Kenton Moorhead in for Ben. I had a question in terms of the Intermodal capacity and terminal growth that you guys had. I know that the Memphis terminal had come online in June. Do you guys have any sense for the capacity utilization that you're getting right now in that particular terminal? And then, are there sort of any read-throughs in terms of variances that you would expect on the  Birmingham and Greencastle terminals?","Donald W. Seale","Kent, we have transferred our domestic business from the current terminal in Memphis at Forrest Yard over to Rossville. So all of our domestic activity now is at that ramp. Our international business is over at the original terminal at Forrest Yard. The Crescent Corridor growth for the fourth quarter was about 25%. And Memphis utilization would be in that number.","Kenton Moorhead - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then I had another follow-up question in terms of -- what is your box count growth expectation for the -- your fleet for 2013 or do you guys know [ph]?","Donald W. Seale","We would rather not give a specific forecast for that business. But from Bakken -- from the Bakken crude basin, we expect material growth -- significant growth. Box?","Kenton Moorhead - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Box, sorry, I said -- yes, Intermodal count. That's container count.","Donald W. Seale","Additional Intermodal boxes?","Kenton Moorhead - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, for 2013.","Donald W. Seale","Okay. I'm sorry, I misunderstood the question. We have a -- how many, Deb, do we have? 1,340 boxes in the plant, a modest acquisition.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Kauffman of Sterne Agee.","Salvatore Vitale - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Sal Vitale on for Jeff. Just a quick question on the crude by rail. Seems to be an impressive commodity in terms of growth. Can you give a sense for -- of the 9% growth in chemicals, what was attributed to growth in crude by rail?","Donald W. Seale","Most of the 9% was growth in crude by rail. Plastics traffic was also up, but the majority of that 9% was driven by crude oil.","Salvatore Vitale - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. Would it be reasonable to extrapolate that into the -- into 2013? Or do you think that, that will accelerate or decelerate at some point?","Donald W. Seale","We believe it will accelerate.","Salvatore Vitale - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. Can you give any color on the length of haul of that traffic? Has it been expanding?","Donald W. Seale","Chicago, into the East Coast, into the Philadelphia, New Jersey area.","Salvatore Vitale - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. So I assume that the RPU -- that the yield on that has been attractive?","Donald W. Seale","As we indicated earlier in the call, it is a base of business that is attractive to us, and we're working with refineries, as well as producers in that regard.","Salvatore Vitale - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just a second question, just a housekeeping question. The -- your tax rate was 33.5% for the quarter. I -- we were looking for something like 37%. Did you give guidance of something in the 37% ballpark at some point?","Donald W. Seale","We normally give a guidance of about 37% to 38% out but -- for the annual tax rate. But it fluctuates by quarter. And traditionally, the fourth quarter is a lower tax rate because of either settlements with state tax issues that normally run through the statute of limitations.","Salvatore Vitale - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, understood. So in terms of your guidance going forward, it's still around 37%.","Donald W. Seale","Yes, 37% to 38%. I would -- yes.","Operator","And our final question comes from David Vernon of AllianceBernstein.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Don, you mentioned at the beginning of the call that the MetCon outlook could be improving towards the back half of the year. Could you kind of talk through what you think is the opportunity here, the risk associated with that expectation of volume recovery?","Donald W. Seale","David, on the steel side, I think the energy sector continues to expand. And with hydraulic fracturing and lateral drilling, we expect that sector to continue to expand. We see opportunities for the tubular steel business to grow. And on the automotive side, as you know, automotive production is set to go up again in 2013. In flat-rolled steel, we're well positioned, with flat-rolled producers, cold-rolled producers in that regard. So in steel, we see a fairly good outlook for the year, tempered somewhat by this RG Steel plant closing, which I will tell you that, in the first 2 quarters of the year, on a comp basis, was about 14,000 cars and about $19 million of revenue split between coal and metals. That -- though -- when I mentioned RG Steel as a comp headwind, that's the order of magnitude. Once we clear that June 1, we will see our numbers actually improve further based on what we see for the market. On the construction side, if drill -- if rig counts -- drilling rig counts continue to be down, our frac sand volumes won't go back up as quickly, although we expect, with the energy production escalating and ramping up, that we will see improved activity in 2013 in that regard. The aggregates market and cement market in construction materials is really contingent upon highway construction and commercial and residential construction, which is slated to be better. But the aggregates business for highway construction is being constrained by budgets -- budgetary constraints by state highway DOTs.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then -- and for rolled products, I guess -- and then I'll let you guys get off. For rolled products, is that dependent on drilling activity in the Marcellus? Or are you guys also shipping some rolled product out to the western oil plays?","Donald W. Seale","We are shipping some product out to the West. But I will tell you that the vast majority of our inbound products is Marcellus and Utica.","Operator","This ends the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Charles W. Moorman","Thank you, everyone, for listening in with us. And we look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce Michael Hostutler, Norfolk Southern Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. Mr. Hostutler, you may begin.","Michael Hostutler ","Thank you, and good afternoon. Before we begin today's call, I would like to mention a few items. First, the slides of the presenters are available on our website at nscorp.com in the Investors section. Additionally, transcripts and MP3 downloads of today's call will be posted on our website for your convenience.","Please be advised that any forward-looking statements made during the course of the call represent our best good-faith judgment as to what may occur in the future. Statements that are forward-looking can be identified by the use of words such as believe, expect, anticipate and project. Our actual results may differ materially from those projected and will be subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which may be outside of our control.","Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for discussions of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Additionally, keep in mind that all references to reported results, excluding certain adjustments, that is, non-GAAP numbers, have been reconciled on our website.","Now it's my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern Chairman, President and CEO, Wick Moorman.","Charles W. Moorman","Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. It's my pleasure to welcome you to our First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are several members of our senior team, including Don Seale, our Chief Marketing Officer; Mark Manion, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rathbone, Chief Financial Officer, all of whom you will hear from this afternoon.","Our first quarter net income was an all-time best of $450 million or $1.41 per diluted share. It did include a large nonoperating land sale. But even without the benefit of this gain, we posted our second best-ever first quarter results in revenues, operating income, net income and earnings per share.  In addition, the operating ratio of 74.8% was our second best for a first quarter.","Looking at our top line, revenues for the quarter were $2.7 billion, a decrease of 2% from last year. Overall volumes were up 3%, as increases in intermodal units of 9% were offset by a 4% decline in coal traffic and flat merchandise volumes. Don will provide you with all of the revenue and volume details in a few minutes.","On the expense side, our continued focus on productivity and efficiency resulted in operating expenses remaining flat with last year, and John will review all of those details with you.","The big story for the quarter was the quality of our service. The composite service index improved 50 basis points over last year to 83.3%; system average speed was 24.2 miles per hour, a 3% improvement. This increased velocity created additional capacity, and our network is running as fluidly as I have ever seen it. Mark will provide you with all of the operating details in a few minutes. And as all of you who follow us know, all of these metrics are intertwined.","The fluid network leads to better service and the ability to control costs, and the combination of continued investment in our system, along with the efficient utilization of our capacity, will allow us to grow our franchise for years to come.","Now at this point, I'll turn the program over to Don and the rest of the team, and then I'll return with some closing remarks before we take questions.","Donald W. Seale","Thank you, Wick, and good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter revenue of $2.7 billion was down $51 million or 2% compared to first quarter of last year, as a $131 million decline in our coal market more than offset revenue gains achieved in intermodal and merchandise.","With respect to yield, revenue per unit declined by 5% due to a 13% decline in coal RPU. Merchandise revenue per unit was up $70 or 3%, and intermodal revenue per unit was flat compared to first quarter 2012.","Negative mix in price, mostly associated with export coal, accounted for $85 million of the overall revenue decline for the quarter, and fuel surcharge revenue was down $51 million. On the plus side, higher volume contributed a positive $85 million into the revenue variance.","With respect to volume, total shipments for the quarter were up 3% as strong intermodal gains more than offset declines in coal and merchandise. Merchandise results were mixed as 2 of the groups, Metals & Construction and Agriculture, experienced declines, while first quarter volumes for chemicals and automotive increased year-over-year, while paper volumes were flat.","Now turning to the individual market segments. Coal revenue of $635 million was down $131 million or 17% for the quarter. As we saw in the fourth quarter of 2012, weaker demand across most markets contributed to this decline, along with a materially weaker pricing environment for export metallurgical coal. Our largest decline in volume occurred within the utility sector, which experienced a decrease of 21,000 loads or 9%. Continued reduction of stockpiles, which were built as a result of weak demand in the 2011-2012 winter, was the largest single contributor to this decline, coupled with competition from natural gas.","Overall, this had a more pronounced volume impact at our longer-haul Southern utilities, which were down 16%, while shorter-haul Northern utility volumes declined by only 3%. Export volumes were up 21% in car-loadings and 25% in tonnage for the quarter, due to increased handling of thermal coal and increased met coal shipments through both the ports of Baltimore and Lamberts Point.","In the U.S. market, domestic metallurgical volumes were down 14% for the quarter due to weaker steel production and the continued impact of the RG Steel bankruptcy, which we reported last quarter, a comp which we will clear beginning in the third quarter of this year. And finally, industrial coal volumes was down 10% due to weaker demand and improved equipment efficiency at selected coal-fired industrial plants.","Now turning to our intermodal network. Revenue in the quarter reached $573 million, up $46 million, or 9% over the first quarter of 2012, driven by 9% higher volumes. As depicted on Slide 5, the volume gains in intermodal came from both our domestic and international markets. Domestic volume was up 7% due to continued highway conversions and the opening of new Crescent Corridor lanes in the quarter, while organic growth across our international accounts boosted international volume by 13%.","As in previous quarters, we continued our strong focus on increased efficiency across our intermodal network. During the quarter, 95% of containers in both domestic and international market segments moved on stack cars, a metric which highlights loading efficiency and equipment utilization. This was a 5 percentage point improvement compared to the first quarter of 2012, and in turn, total intermodal crew starts were only up 1% on a 9% volume increase for the quarter.","Now turning to our merchandise markets depicted on Slide 7. Merchandise revenue was up 2%, reaching $1.5 billion for the quarter. This increase came as a result of higher revenue per unit for the quarter, which was up 3%.","Reduced domestic raw steel production, which was down 8% in the quarter, combined with the impact of the RG Steel bankruptcy, contributed to an overall decline in steel volumes of 7%. Aggregate shipments were also down for the quarter due to a weaker highway construction market and declines in frac sand as natural gas drilling rig counts continued to decline in the quarter. This combination of factors led to an overall 6% decline in Metals & Construction volume.","In our agricultural markets, reduced corn volumes to processors and the impact of ethanol plant closures contributed to a 3% decline in shipments, though we saw strong gains in fertilizer and soybeans for the quarter. Fertilizer demand is particularly strong this year due to low carryover grain inventories and anticipated increases in acreage to be planted this spring.","On the plus side, chemicals volume was up 10% due primarily to growth in crude by rail business, which accounted for over 13,000 shipments in the quarter. Automotive volumes were up 2% despite a slight decline in projected North American vehicle production during the quarter. And paper and forest products volumes were essentially flat for the quarter as a rebound in the housing market contributed to an 11% improvement at lumber volumes, which was offset by weaker volumes of graphic paper.","Now concluding with our outlook. The market ahead continues to be mostly positive, but we face continuing headwinds across our coal markets. Competition from natural gas, and flat to declining electricity demand will continue to impact our utility coal franchise. But firming natural gas prices reflect some relief in utility dispatched curves, looking ahead.","With respect to export metallurgical coal demand, we see continued sluggish demand in Europe and slowing shipments into Asia. In the met export market, we've seen some marginal improvement in world pricing. In this regard, we're continuing to price our services on a quarterly basis. And in view of improving world prices, some modest increases were applied for met coal exports starting April 1 for the second quarter. So with that said, U.S. coals will continue to be challenged to remain competitive from a total cost perspective, which makes this market choppy and uncertain at best.","Also, thermal coal exports will face lower yields associated with the weak API 2 index into Europe. In view of these challenges in both met and thermal coal exports, we do not expect our export volumes for the rest of the year to be as strong as those in the first quarter. And finally, with respect to domestic met coal here in the U.S., we see a weaker market ahead until we finally clear the RG Steel comp in the third quarter.","Turning to intermodal, we anticipate a continuation of solid opportunities for highway conversion as we launch new service lanes and ramp up volumes at our newly opened terminals. We also expect continued growth within our international segment, though at a more moderate pace than we saw in the first quarter.","In merchandise, we continue to expect growth in 3 of our 5 business groups in the months ahead led by chemicals, automotive and housing-related materials. In the other 2 markets, Metals & Construction and agriculture, we anticipate flat to modest declines in the first half, with an improving outlook for the second half of the year.","Wrapping up, in summary, we expect that our diverse market base will continue to provide volume growth ahead despite the challenges that we face in the coal market. And we remain committed to market-based pricing at levels that equal or exceed the rate of rail inflation over time as we provide excellent service to our customers.","Thank you for your time. And Mark, I'll now turn it to you for the operations report.","Mark D. Manion","Yes. Thanks, Don, and good afternoon, everyone. Based on preliminary safety data, our first quarter performance stands at 0.72, that's equal to the same period last year. Positive improvements in our safety process has continued to increase our employee engagement and provide a solid foundation for future performance.","Moving to the next slide, our composite service metric continues a trend of year-over-year improvement. For the first quarter 2013, composite performance stands at 83.3%. This represents an improvement over the full first quarter last year, and it's important to point out that this was accomplished despite a more normal winter this year compared to the very mild conditions we experienced last year.","Turning to the next slide, and one of the key components of network velocity, train speed, system average train speed improved 3% over the same period last year.","Turning to Terminal Dwell. We did see a modest increase in Terminal Dwell of just under 1%, but that was driven primarily by a deeper reduction in our end-of-year operations in response to reduced customer demand over the Christmas and New Year holidays that have abutted weekends. However, since the beginning of February, our Terminal Dwell performance has been improved over last year.","Moving on to the next slide. Building on the progress we've seen over the last several quarters, improved velocity and other productivity initiatives are the drivers behind the improvements you see here. Overall, we've reduced crew starts, a significant 5% against a volume increase of 3% and a gross ton mile increase of 4%. As Don referenced, we've been able to manage 9% increase in intermodal volume, with only a 1% increase in crew starts. Coal volumes decreased 4%, but we were able to achieve an 11% reduction in crew starts. And similarly, despite general merchandise volumes being flat, we were able to reduce crew starts by 2%. Concurrently, we've reduced T&E overtime by 9% in addition to a re-crew reduction of 5% over the same period last year. Velocity-driven equipment rents have been reduced 4%, while carloads per locomotive have improved 6%, and gross ton miles per gallon have improved 2%.","We continue to manage our manpower and asset base commensurate with our traffic volumes and improvements in our network velocity. Our active T&E workforce stands at 11,540, a nearly 6% reduction over last year. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 600 employees furloughed or on retention boards within the transportation and mechanical departments. From an asset perspective, we had 239 locomotives in storage, along with approximately 8,500 freight cars. In addition to the velocity and productivity improvements that we reviewed on the previous slide, we will continue to adjust the manpower and asset base commensurate with our traffic volumes. As I mentioned last quarter, we're also pursuing opportunities to rightsize the network.","Turning to the next slide, this is a great example of a rightsizing opportunity, the closure of the Roanoke, Virginia hump operation. Enabled by network velocity, efficiency and changing traffic flows, on February 25, we ceased humping operations at Roanoke. Traffic, once handled at Roanoke, was redistributed to other yards, utilizing existing capacity without impacting network velocity. Along with the projects I outlined last quarter and with additional initiatives like Roanoke, we are solidly on track to meet and exceed our $100 million expense savings target for 2013.","Thank you. And now, John, I'll turn it over to you.","John P. Rathbone","Thank you, Mark. I'll now review our financial results for the first quarter. Let's start with a summary of our revenue. As Don described, our 2013 railway operating revenue of $2.7 billion was the second-highest first quarter revenues on record. Total revenues declined $51 million or 2% compared to last year's $2.8 billion first quarter record. Fuel revenue of $274 million were $51 million less than last year, and we experienced an unfavorable fuel lag of $23 million during the quarter.","Slide 3 displays our total operating expenses, which increased slightly for the quarter. The resulting $691 million of operating income was down 7% compared to 2012, and our operating ratio increased 1.5 points to 74.8%. Both measures ranked as second-best first quarter operating results.","Turning to our expenses. The next slide shows the components of the $3 million increase, and I'll go over each of the components in detail. As displayed on Slide 5, fuel expense increased by $16 million or 4%, driven largely by higher diesel fuel consumption and prices. Diesel fuel usage grew 2% relative to a 4% increase in gross ton miles, a reflection of operating efficiencies and ongoing fuel saving initiatives. Our diesel fuel price for the quarter decreased to $3.19 or 1%.","Depreciation expense increased by $3 million or 1%, reflecting slightly lower depreciation rates, resulting from a recently completed equipment study that partially offset the effect of a larger capital base. The new rates reduced depreciation expense by $8 million this quarter. This favorable effect will continue for the remainder of the year.","Purchased services and rents increased by $2 million, reflecting higher professional fees and increased automotive and joint facility costs that offset lower engineering and hauling services. Equipment rents decreased slightly due to improved network performance, which more than offset the effect of increased intermodal volumes.","Materials and others fell $12 million or 5% due primarily to reduced equipment and railway material usage from lower repair activity which should increase as the year unfolds. Also, for the remainder of the year, we anticipate higher casualty expenses as we lap the favorable personal injury claims development we described in the second and fourth quarter of last year.","Next, compensation and benefits decreased by $6 million or 1%. Reduction in employee activity levels, reflecting the improved productivity and reduced payroll taxes, more than offset $15 million of increased pay rates.","Turning to our nonoperating items. Other income is up $106 million, including a $97 million land sale gain in Michigan. This involved the sale of 135 miles of track to the State of Michigan for high-speed passenger service. Returns on company-owned life insurance were up $7 million, and interest expense on debt was up by $9 million due to increased net borrowing.","Income before income taxes increased $43 million or 7% due primarily to higher nonoperating income, partly offset by lower operating income. Excluding the land sale, pretax income would have been $600 million or 8% lower.","Income taxes totaled $247 million, and the effective tax rate was 35.4% compared to 37.3% in 2012. The decrease was primarily related to a $9 million retroactive benefit from January's tax law changes.","Net income from the quarter was $415 million, an increase of $40 million or 10% compared to 2012. Diluted earnings per share were $1.41, up $0.18 or 15% compared to last year.","As noted earlier, our first quarter record results included the land sale in Michigan that generated net income of $60 million, an increased earnings per share by $0.19.","As shown on the next slide, cash from operations covered our capital spending and produced $344 million in free cash flow. Cash from operations was amplified in the first quarter of 2012 as accounts payable returned to normal levels.","We accelerated credit payments at the end of 2011 as part of our SAP implementation. Our 2013 free cash flow supported $157 million in dividends and $33 million of share repurchases. Last year's results included higher share repurchases, as well as proceeds from borrowings. Our first quarter 2013 share repurchases reflected a cautious approach as we weighed uncertainties in Washington. As the economy continues to grow, for the remainder of the year, we intend to increase share repurchases.","We remain confident in our ability to generate free cash flow and access debt markets. We will continue to prioritize investing in our business, committing to our dividend and applying incremental cash towards share repurchases guided, of course, our economic outlook.","Thank you for your attention. I'll now turn the program back to Wick.","Charles W. Moorman","Thank you, John. As you've heard, Norfolk Southern had a good first quarter this year, with near record operating income and operating ratio even in the face of continued significant weakness in our coal business.","As I've said previously, coal continues to be the wild card in our business outlook, although we do see some signs of stability, with gas prices now at $4 plus per million Btus, slow growth in generation demand and the price of met coal stabilizing and possibly even starting to tick up.","On the intermodal side, we're continuing to see growth in our business, driven in part by the completion of most of our Crescent Corridor infrastructure, along with a great service product. And as Don told you, the outlook for our merchandise business is somewhat mixed, but with some anticipated growth in 3 of the 5 business groups.","In general, we see an economy that will continue to grow, albeit at a slow pace. As I stated at the outset, the other big story at Norfolk Southern continues to be the level of our network operations. As Mark told you, our first quarter 2013 metrics exceeded the first quarter of 2012, even with more adverse weather conditions.","The economies we are recognizing as a result are significant and at the same time, our customers are receiving a constantly improving service product, which will help drive further volume growth and pricing improvement.","As I've stated many times at Norfolk Southern, we believe that superior service, going hand-in-hand with a focus on safety and operating efficiency, are the best ways to grow our volumes and revenues, which in turn will drive increasing returns for our shareholders. We're confident in our strategy and our ability to execute it, and our first quarter results are a strong indication that it's working.","Thanks, and I'll now turn it over to the operator to field your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Ceraso with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color on the decline in the yield in coal, maybe just bracketing how much of that is associated with the change in mix versus how much is the reduction you had to take in price for export coal.","Donald W. Seale","Chris, this is Don. As we discussed in the calls in the past over the last few quarters, our met coal pricing has been adjusted downward to reflect the world market, which, as you know, declined from $330 per ton down to $160. It has improved back up to $170, but we're still in the range of 25% to 30% declines year-over-year in met coal pricing. And we will continue to face those headwinds until we clear part of the second quarter, as we complete the second quarter. Also, with respect to mix, we handled 2 million tons of export thermal coal in the first quarter versus about 600,000 tons of thermal coal handled in the first quarter of 2012. It's good business for us, but it is lower revenue per car -- lower revenue per ton than the met coal, as you know. The other moving parts that I mentioned in my remarks was our longer-haul Southern utility business was down 16% in the quarter. Our Northern utility coal was only down 3%. And as we've discussed in the past, the revenue per car differential of those 2 books of business is 50%. So it's material. One other quick comment, a little color, Chris, hopefully that will answer your question fully, our utility business for the quarter, 31% of that book was shorter-haul utility business in Illinois, Ohio and Indiana and averaged only about 25% to 30% of our normal revenue per unit of utility coal as a whole.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's really helpful. I had just one quick follow-up. Not to give you a hard time, but can you just talk about the rationale behind not buying back stock and waiting to see what's happening in Washington? I mean, you've got a very strong balance sheet. You generated a lot of cash flow in the quarter, and now the stock is 20% higher than it was 3 or 4 months ago. So maybe you've missed out on an opportunity. Can you just take us through your rationale there?","Charles W. Moorman","Yes. As we finished -- as you know, you have to use a planned purchase. And as we look to the fiscal cliff, one of the issues as we slowed down purchases going into the fiscal cliff, because of the way those programs work, we were precluded from entering the market until after earnings release in January. So the whole month of January was basically lost to us as far as purchases, then we've reentered the market. Our intention -- but albeit at a lower rate. And you're correct, you're quite right, we did miss certainly a buying opportunity doing that at very favorable pricing. But going forward, we expect to resume our share repurchases at levels that -- at more historic levels.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Maybe just sticking on coal, could you talk a little bit about where inventory has kind of ended the quarter or maybe where you think we are kind of in April with utilities?","Donald W. Seale","Chris, our utility stockpiles, we ended the quarter with 41 days on average through the network. That's about a 7.5% reduction from the fourth quarter.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And relative to normals, how does that look?","Donald W. Seale","The Northern utilities in our network are normalized now. We are approaching normal throughout the North. The stockpiles have been pulled down. The weather has been colder through the Midwest and Northeast. Our Southern utilities are still marginally above target.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on the coal-to-gas switching or maybe gas back to coal. With prices above $4, I know on the average, and it's maybe a little bit higher in some cases on the breakpoint between the 2, but have you seen any kind of marginal demand come back to coal from gas?","Donald W. Seale","Yes, we have, Chris. The NYMEX delivered price of gas is now $4.25, $4.25 per million Btu for May. And the shoulder months of March and April have been fairly cold, so we've seen demand electricity production continue fairly stronger, at least an uptick in it. So with those gas prices and the pull-down in gas storage, we have seen a marginal dispatch of coal in our network pick up.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to ask you one on the export coal side. I guess if I look at the coal stocks in general, they haven't been so healthy recently, so that would kind of concern you about the coal market. And I'm trying to figure out how to interpret your comments. I think, Don, you said that your pricing on export coal and met would be up a little bit, which obviously is favorable. But it seems like you're also saying maybe tonnage is down. So I was just wondering if you could lend a little more -- provide some more comments on how you look at the met export market and kind of tonnage and pricing in, say, second quarter versus first?","Donald W. Seale","Tom, I'd be glad to. We see the second quarter met coal pricing being marginally better than the fourth quarter and first quarter. There's been an uptick, as I've mentioned, back up into the mid-170s on worldwide met coal prices. The spot increases we took for a quarter, April 1, for the second quarter, I will tell you were very modest. So on met coal, in general, continued headwinds with respect to demand. We do see a little bit of slowing of demand in Asia. So we expect met coal pricing to hold, but we certainly don't see it rebounding. Now with respect to thermal coal, the API 2 index into Europe got as low as $82. It's moved back up to the $86 range, $86 per ton. So it's recovered somewhat. We still see opportunities for thermal coal exports in the second quarter moving through the year, probably not at the 2 million ton level that we handled in the first quarter, though.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So how would you think about the met tonnage in second versus met export in second versus first? Is it kind of similar or what would you think about the tonnage side?","Donald W. Seale","I would say that we see some softening in the second quarter versus the first.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And can you offer an overall comment on pricing? I guess if I look at some of your other yield lines, setting aside coal, you're probably a little weaker than I might have anticipated. Paper and clay was down, chemicals was down, maybe that's mix, intermodal was down a touch. But what do you -- how do you view the overall pricing environment outside of the coal market?","Donald W. Seale","Pricing market remains solid, Tom. Let me take one business group and give you some color in the merchandise area, which may help with your question. And I'll take the chemical group. In chemicals, as I mentioned, we handled about 13,000 carloads of crude oil in the quarter, substantial increase. That's very good business for us. But it is not moving at the average revenue per unit for chemicals as a whole. Also, we had a polypropylene movement out of Chicago that was high-rated that is no longer moving. That will be a negative comp for chemicals at about $6 million per quarter for the balance of 2013. So when you look at chemicals and look at RPU, just those 2 things, if you take those into account, it starts to explain how the RPU looks versus the overall pricing, which continues -- pricing continues to be solid.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Troy with Susquehanna International.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just looking at the coal business, which seems to have stabilized at a run rate of, I don't know, 25,000 to 27,000 carloads a week. That's a far cry from the 33,000, 34,000 you were at several years ago. It seems as if things have bottomed, which, as we know, is the first and the most important step. Is your sense that, that 26,000 or 27,000 run rate, I know there's a lot of moving parts and pieces in it, is it substantial enough baseline for you to move off of and drive the cost savings? I guess you somewhat answered the question earlier with the $100 million target and your confidence around the cost savings there. But maybe if you could just talk about, is your sense that the absolute coal traffic on the network today is roughly where it's going to be, at least for the foreseeable future? And what gives you confidence in your target on the $100 million in expense takeout?","Donald W. Seale","With respect to the -- where the coal market is, it appears to us that we are approaching or we are at the bottom of the trough, possibly. And as you well said, there are a lot of moving parts in that, a lot of changes in length of haul. So as Southern utility coal is down double-digits, 16%, Northern utility coal down only 3%, and then we have a lot of our utility coal as a total moving shorter haul up in the Midwest. It's good business, and we're getting rapid turns on the equipment. So revenue per asset is very high. And as Mark mentioned, we have 4% decline in volume and 11% reduction in crew starts for the coal business. So we are seeing some operating leverage and cost leverage in the way we're managing that book of business. So we think we are seeing a bottom here. One of the things that we also think we're seeing is natural gas production in terms of rig counts going to a level that might support, might support $4 to $5 gas. And if we stay in that $4 to $5 per million Btu gas range, coal is going to dispatch at a higher rate than we saw it dispatch in 2012.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Got it. And my follow-up would be simply the other big piece of the puzzle here in terms of traffic mix being intermodal. To be able to grow volumes 9% on top of, I think you said crew starts were up 1% or so, demonstrates I think -- yes, some of the leverage there. Could you talk about just intermodal network capacity? I know you said you had 95% double stack. But whether it's train length or whether you can drive it through better yard productivity handling and asset turns, how much more Intermodal business do you think you could handle without adding significant resources to the network?","Mark D. Manion","Yes, let me take a stab at this. This is Mark. The -- keeping in mind that, of course, we've got some intermodal trains out there that are upwards at 10,000 feet long. But on the average, those trains are more in the neighborhood of 5,500 feet. So you can see that there are a lot of trains that have a lot of capacity. And when you look at the good story of these intermodal terminals that have been newly built and expanded and we're in the process of growing the business in those, that's just a great opportunity to fill those trains out.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Don, did you mention -- I might have missed this, but where there any liquidated damages or take-or-pay revenues that occurred this quarter that we need to think about as we model forward?","Donald W. Seale","Bill, no, we did not have liquidated damages revenue in the quarter.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Do you expect to have any going forward? Would this be something that will be material enough that we should be modeling it?","Donald W. Seale","No.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then Wick, I'm hoping we can get your views on the trade-off between kind of volumes and price. We've talked a long time in the rail industry about inflation plus pricing. And clearly, Norfolk's having success, kind of winning share, if you will, or getting the volume whether it's from new customers starting on your lines or whatnot. But if we look at the OR metric, Norfolk, for a long time, was sort of top of industry. That slipped a little bit. There's some mix effect there. But maybe you can talk a little bit about price and volume and how you think about that, and getting back toward the top of the industry on margin, how you think about these things. That will be helpful.","Charles W. Moorman","Well, when my good friend, Don and I, talk about the trade-offs between volume and price, we always end up saying, we want both. And I will tell you that we are very rigorous in our thinking about margin and about price, whenever we are pursuing new business or for that matter, renewing a contract with current business. And I think we'll be able to continue to do that in the future, successfully, if at least in part, in substantial part, because we are really giving our customers a very, very good product. And I will say, parenthetically, that over the past year, the number of our customers that I meet, and I meet a lot of them, who have just, without any prompting at all, started to talk about how well we are doing for them is really unprecedented in my career. So I think that we have that capacity to do both. But I do think that you raised a good point and something we've got to -- we have to think about with our franchise, which is that we have a different mix. Every franchise is different. We clearly have a big Intermodal business, which has a different operating ratio, a set of characteristics than coal. We like our Intermodal business. We think there are great opportunities out there, and they're great opportunities at prices and at margins that will ensure that we earn an adequate return and grow our income. And those are the 2 goals that we always have in mind. We have to earn an adequate return, obviously, first of all. But then we want to grow our operating income and our earnings per share, and we see the Intermodal business as one of the levers that we can pull, continue to pull to do so. So in terms of getting to where we rate with other folks, in terms of overall operating margin, I think you have to take mix into account. But I can assure you, we're focused on getting the right price, continuing to grow volume and grow our earnings at good levels of return.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up a little bit here on the Intermodal question. You've painted -- both CSX and yourselves, have painted a nice picture of the conversion opportunity from truck. Many of the factors that have led to that conversion have been around for a while, but we really are seeing a pick up now. And I think it's on the basis of your improved service offering and the capacity you've built out there. When you look at that opportunity, it's still a really big number that you've identified as a potential conversion. Can you talk to us about your strategy on how to convert that over to rail, and is this something that we continue to see high rates in the early days? Or is it more of a longer term, kind of grind away at it over a number of years?","Charles W. Moorman","Well, we think there's clearly a very large opportunity. And let me just kind of take a microcosm of the way we think about the world. You're very familiar, all of you I know, with our Crescent Corridor initiative. That set of initiatives, which includes new capacity and new services, a number of which we turned on early this year, is aimed at a truckload market that today is running between 5 million and 6 million truckloads per year, out moving between the South and the Southwest, to the North and the Northeast. Our initial efforts are targeted at trying to pick up about 1 million of those loads. But when we're successful doing that, we can continue to add capacity. We can continue to add infrastructure. And we think this is a long-term game, in terms of converting truckload traffic to the rails, for all of the reasons that we've talked about before, our -- the issues with the highways and congestion, the very significant issues that many truckload carriers have of finding drivers. Our economies and our emissions and all of the things that make us a -- in many ways to many of our customers, a more desirable way to ship. So we think this is a long-term growth opportunity for us, and we're going to continue to pursue it aggressively.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And as you build density, I think density is a really important part of that game, and I think, whereas Intermodal has been an average contributor from a profitability standpoint, that would indicate that it's going to get, obviously, better than average. Can you talk to us without talking about profitability, I know you're careful around there, but just as an improvement? Is it something that improves slightly compared to historical? Or are we seeing a big step-function in profit improvement as you build density?","Charles W. Moorman","Well, I don't think it's a single big step-function. But there is absolutely no doubt that the more units we put over the network, particularly as we do it efficiently in terms of crew starts and the like, the profitability of the traffic improves. The other thing, and which Don talked to you about, which I think is very important over the long term, is all of the other initiatives on this productivity side that we have involved in our Intermodal network today. Certainly, the more efficient use of equipment is good, and we have seen margin improvement as a result. We have more initiatives out there. So I would tell you that while we're always working on our -- not only the profitability of Intermodal, the profitability of all of our traffic, we will continue to see it rise and certainly, growing volume and manage -- while managing costs will be a significant component of margin improvement.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's great. Just a quick housekeeping, if I may? Mark, you were guiding us down for employee headcount toward the end of the year. You've had a good -- you declined a little bit here again in the first quarter. Is this -- should we consider this to be the staffing level you're comfortable with through the year? Or do we see further declines from this point?","Mark D. Manion","We'll see a little bit more decline as the year goes on. Our T&E probably is going to stabilize at or around the number we are right now. And as I think I mentioned on the last call, our engineering department, we've got an initiative to reduce, throughout the year, about 300 people. So not a lot, but reduction throughout the year from attrition in engineering.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays Capital.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Wick, I just wanted to follow up with some comments that you had following Bill Greene's question there. Obviously, a lot of railroads are targeting improved profitability across North America. But it sounds like there's some different ORs on the business on the East Coast. Does that mean, structurally, that the East Coast carriers just aren't going to be able to see as much improvement as targeted in the other regions of North America for railroad performance?","Charles W. Moorman","No, I wouldn't say that. I think we -- internally, we have targets for improved profitability just like all of the other carriers. The railroads are a franchise business, and every one of these franchises is different in terms of where we go, who we serve and the breakdown of our relative lines of business. But we have good goals for improved profitability, and we're pursuing them. And I wouldn't say that we would compare unfavorably to other folks. The other difference is you're comparing the East to West, is clearly length of haul, and that has some impacts on the financial side as well.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well -- and if maybe I can just follow up on that. Wick, your intermodal pricing -- obviously, there's a lot of mix shifting across your book of business. But we've heard that intermodal rates are just harder to get up in this environment with trucking struggling to get rate increases with their customers. Is this just an investment phase, that we should view Norfolk really building out the density of the network and pricing will come on the back end?","Charles W. Moorman","Well, let me say that, obviously, and I'll let Don comment on it, too, obviously, we're in a slightly different business in most of our intermodal activities, in that we're a wholesale function working with some terrific partners. So that has an impact on pricing as well. And clearly, as you mentioned and Don has shown this to you before, the world of truckload pricing has a big, big effect on what happens in the intermodal world. But Don?","Donald W. Seale","Yes, truckload pricing continues to evolve. We have the hours of service changes that are pending, that more than likely, they look like they will be applied in July. That could take out as much as 5% productivity out of the current truckload driver base, which we think will start to move truckload prices later in this year. Something, though, that hasn't come up in this last couple of questions is, we were talking about highway conversions. But I want to remind everyone on the call that we also have a very healthy portfolio of international business, which was up 13% in the first quarter. Our Domestic business was up 7%. So the international business is very good business for us as well. It is lower revenue per unit because of marine containers, moving in marine containers, than, say, the domestic freight that is generally moving in boxes, supplied by us or one of our intermodal marketing companies. So you have to take that into account, in terms of the overall mix. But I would just remind you that international business continues to expand as well. And we think truckload pricing, with -- especially with respect to Domestic, will continue to evolve, and the hours of service is something you should look at.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Don, if I can just hit on the coal again. Just on the overall pricing, you were down double digits the last 2 quarters. You noted, you comped against the down 20% declines on the export, particularly as you wrap around April. Your thoughts on the back half here, you've got easier comps, or do you still expect pricing to be down double digits?","Donald W. Seale","Ken, good afternoon. As we move through the second quarter and finish the second quarter, getting into the beginning of the third, those headwinds will start to diminish with respect to the year-over-year price comparisons, with respect to met coal. The thermal coal that we're taking on is new business. As I mentioned in the first quarter last year, we only handle 600,000 tons of thermal coal. We had 2 million tons in the first quarter. We expect thermal coal to continue to move, maybe not at that first quarter level, but it will be up compared to last year. And that has a lower RPU that you'll have to take into account with respect to revenue per unit.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Wonderful. And just on the -- following up on the Intermodal side. You noted a lot of new -- I guess with the expansion on the terminals, are these new customers? Are these expansion now that you've got more capacity? Maybe you can kind of walk through a little bit on where the volumes are coming from? And then I -- just a quick one for Mark. I guess, what you do with the locomotives after they're stored for a while, do you eventually just get rid of them? Same with the cars, or do you keep them for volume rebounds?","Donald W. Seale","Ken, on the first question, and then I'll pass it over to Mark on the locomotives. We're seeing new customers enter the lanes that we are opening up, the 34 new lanes with respect to Crescent. And I'll give you an example. We are seeing increased activity from the Southwest into the Mid-Atlantic, as well as Mexico into the Mid-Atlantic, with new customers, new shippers that have not been in those -- that particular point -- set of point pairs with us before. Of course, we've also got business ramping up with existing customers, and those existing customers would be beneficial cargo owners like Wal-Mart, Target, Procter & Gamble, Lowe's, Home Depot, et cetera.","Mark D. Manion","Ken, if I can answer your locomotive question. Our locomotives, that are in storage, essentially fall into 2 categories. One is as a surge fleet, and that's approximately 100 locomotives that are high horsepower, ready-to-go, that we put out there if we need them for business volumes or weather conditions or whatever the situation may be. The balance of the locomotives, for the most part, are your lower horsepower yard and local locomotives. And those are older locomotives that we primarily use for rebuild opportunity. As you may know, we have had an aggressive rebuild program for about 10 years now, primarily up in our Juniata Locomotive Shop. And many of you on the call have seen that facility. It's a really great asset for the corporation. And we take a locomotive that is essentially 30 years old or so, and rebuild it and give it another life for another 20 years. So that's what those locomotives are used for.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wanted to ask, you mentioned that gas has moved up and certainly, that's been a bit of a change and that could be positive on the coal side in terms of dispatches from a utility coal standpoint. But I would think it could also mean some kind of resumption of drilling in the Marcellus, as gas becomes more profitable again. Where is the threshold where you would expect to see some of that merchandise traffic that's falling off, begin to really pick up? And I mean, we saw that hit you guys in Q3. So obviously, the comp probably gets better then, but even before that in Q2, is there an expectation if gas really moves that we could start to see some more activity there?","Donald W. Seale","Justin, this is Don. And our view, in my view, the producers of gas are seeking a realistic market price. And I think that we'll see production coincide with market prices where returns can be generated for the activity of drilling. Certainly, if we see demand continue to pick up, should we see LNG exports, or should we see more alternative uses of natural gas for chemical production and demand pickup, we could see production increase, which in turn would provide us with an uplift in frac sand shipments and additional input commodities to support the drilling. But my view is that the gas producers are looking to produce gas at acceptable returns. And $2.50, which was the average in 2012, was not an acceptable price.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Sure. And we're not there. So what's the price do you think that is kind of the cutoff in terms of that friction point?","Donald W. Seale","As I indicated earlier, I think that $4 to $5 range. We've got a lot of people telling us that $5 average gas may be a settling-out point, ahead. And if that's the case, I think it's good for the economy. We're competitive in the world market, for sure. The chemical industry continues to prosper. And certainly, coal competes much more effectively at $5 gas across all the basins, including Central App on the dispatch curves.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","In terms of train length, on the Intermodal side, I mean, 10,000 feet sounds like a pretty lofty goal. How much of your network do you think you could actually get to that type of a train length? And when you think about the incremental margin ongoing from 5,500 to 10,000 feet on a train, is it right to think that there's very little cost involved with actually lengthening the train out that much?","Donald W. Seale","The -- those longer trains are pretty much reserved for our hot corridor between Chicago and the East. And that, as you probably know, is a double track and in some places, triple track and 4 tracks. For the most part, the rest of our system is pretty well-aligned with a maximum train length of about 8,000 feet, in some places a little bit less than that. And that has to do with the length of our sidings. So we're selective by lane as far as filling out our trains. But keeping in mind that with that average train length of 5,500 feet, there's still a lot of opportunity, including a lot of opportunity in that Crescent Corridor that's gauged along the 8,000-foot range.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it. And thinking about the cost involved with lengthening a train from, let's say, averaged to that 8,000-foot mark, I mean, is there an extra locomotive, a lot more handling involved? How do you think about the additional costs as you lengthen out that train?","Donald W. Seale","No, that's the beauty of it. You still have one crew. In most cases, you've got the same complement of locomotive power. So as we add volume onto trains, it's a real win for us.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's great. And  one last one. Just curious, as I think about this crude by rail franchise that you guys have been building out, it's obviously small. Some of the properties fall in Conrail territory. And I'm just curious how you guys think about the competitive dynamic for any jump ball business that you may go against CSX or and how those competitions will be structured?","Donald W. Seale","Justin, we're looking at our crude oil franchise like we look at all of our business. We're looking to provide very good service to the refineries that we are working with. We're customizing the service, and we're pricing it at levels where it generates the proper reflection of that value for the service. So we're fortunate that we serve multiple refineries in the Delaware, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey area and a couple of down in the Louisiana, Alabama markets as well. So we're looking at it as we look at all business, and we're looking to provide really solid service for the refineries, as well as making sure that we generate the proper value for them.","Charles W. Moorman","Let me build on the point Don is making, too, here, which is this is a business in which competing on service matters because these are very expensive assets that they are employing in terms of the railcars. And if we can provide faster, more efficient service, it means lower capital investment for someone who's providing those cars, and that can be a big factor in this business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen Securities.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","I'm going to go back to intermodal for a moment here. Obviously, you mentioned hours of service. Has some of this growth that you've been seeing in intermodal been because of the hours of service there in the shipping community? And do you expect that maybe to ramp up little bit here in 2Q just before the change?","Donald W. Seale","No, we don't think there's a shift ahead or conversion ahead. We've been experiencing double-digit growth in our Domestic business for the last 3 or 4 years. I think it's more of a function of our Intermodal network and the value of our service across that network and the fact that we're delivering a very good service right now at a very high level.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","And in terms of the pricing, obviously, thinking of truckload as maybe the ceiling, that's been kind of sluggish right now, in that sort of 2% type range. But post the HOS changes, do you think they're going to be an ability for Norfolk to take some of those Domestic Intermodal rates up?","Donald W. Seale","We certainly hope so as trucking capacity and productivity is impacted by the hours of service. And of course, as Wick mentioned, fuel efficiency, highway congestion, driver challenges, all of that remain as obstacles in trucking. And we certainly see a wide range of customers wanting to increase their participation in the Intermodal space. I was going to mention sustainability from an environmental standpoint. A lot of our receivers, a lot of beneficial cargo owners have targets for sustainability to actually put more of their traffic on rail to improve their carbon footprint.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's great color. If I can, one quick housekeeping. I think there's a call-out for a tax item in the quarter. Was that a $9 million retroactive tax gain, did I hear?","John P. Rathbone","Yes, it was, based on the legislation in the past January 2.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Trahan.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","I got one last one on coal. Maybe if we could think about that yield sequentially. So we've got the met rates that you took up a little bit in the second quarter, but maybe the met or the overall export volumes ticking down a little bit, and the domestic volume starting to recover a little bit. Should we be thinking about, just on a sequential basis, relative to that, 18 50 a car in the first quarter, should that be coming down a little bit in the second quarter, or because of taking up the met rates little, that can go up just sequentially?","Donald W. Seale","Sequentially, in terms of revenue per car, it all depends on the ultimate mix of metallurgical coal to thermal coal in the export market. If thermal coal is a little bit better than we think it will at this point, obviously, that will have an impact on revenue per car. I will tell you, though, that the increases that we took on met coal April 1, I used the term modest, and I will reemphasize modest, they're not large enough to start driving revenue per car in a material way.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. And you just say it's too early to know, based on your -- but your sense of exports coming down a little bit sequentially and thermal coming up a little bit sequentially, directionally, does that feel like yields should be down sequentially?","Donald W. Seale","Yes, from the first quarter to second quarter, we think both thermal and met will be at a lower level in the second quarter than we saw in the first. In fact, we think it will be at lower levels than across second, third and fourth quarter for the balance of the year.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","That was a comment on volume there, right, Don?","Donald W. Seale","That's correct.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. And then with the met increases that you put in, the spot rates that we're seeing seem to be, right now, a good amount below the second quarter benchmark. Are your increases holding or you're not able to keep those?","Donald W. Seale","At this point, they're holding.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens.","Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Could you remind me how much capacity the Intermodal terminal expansions will add on the Crescent, in terms of the number of incremental carload that, that will create? And how much of that has already been completed at this point versus what's planned in the next year or so?","Donald W. Seale","We could barely hear that question here. But I think you were asking about incremental lifts across the corridor, specifically the Crescent Corridor?","Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division","That's correct. And in terms of the incremental carload opportunity that, that could create?","Donald W. Seale","We have added, in our terminal network, about 850,000 lifts of incremental capacity. Now a lift, obviously, it generates more than one load over the source -- over the course of the year. Wick had mentioned 1 million loads that we're targeting in the Crescent Corridor. We have adequate -- more than adequate capacity to, obviously, to take that 1 million loads on, plus more.","Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And that's based on the terminal capacity that's come online as it stands today?","Donald W. Seale","Correct.","Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And is there a way of framing up how much these projects are impacting your volumes today? And I guess, I'm trying to get a sense of, if this was a key driver to growth in Intermodal in the first quarter, or if you think the more significant benefit will be felt when this capacity starts to really get filled in the second half of this year and into 2014?","Donald W. Seale","I'll just give you some percentages of growth in the first quarter year-over-year. The Pan Am Southern corridor was up 9%. Our Crescent Corridor volumes were up 7%. The Heartland Corridor was up 20%, and the Meridian Speedway volume was up 15% year-over-year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","A quick question on a couple of expanding sectors. Through week 16, I think motor vehicles, year-to-date, look up over 3.5% and first quarter RPU looked like it's improved more than 5%, both pretty good. Can you comment on your auto franchise expectations for the midterm? As well, do you expect to benefit from the new capacity coming online in Mexico in the next few years?","Donald W. Seale","With the latter part of the question first, we do expect to benefit from the 5 new assembly plants under construction in Mexico. We also expect to benefit from new production that is moving from Japan and from Europe to the U.S. where the U.S. is being used as a manufacturing platform for both the domestic U.S. market, as well as the export market abroad. You probably have noticed or heard that Toyota just announced this week that they're moving the ES300 Lexus production from Japan to Georgetown, Kentucky. We serve that plant at -- for Toyota at Georgetown. So that will be a source of growth ahead. We continue to have dialogue with other manufacturers with respect to potential new auto plant locations. And in addition to that, we've seen major expansions at BMW at Greenville, South Carolina, Mercedes at Vance, Alabama that we serve, as well as Honda at Lincoln, Alabama. So we've got some major expansions with our current automotive production base and more is coming from abroad. And we see good growth opportunities ahead in our automotive network.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And the other sector I want to ask about is housing, finally, improving in some regions. And I think also, year-to-date, you've increased lumber and wood products volume over 13% from the prior year, something like that. The strong improvement -- sorry...","Donald W. Seale","Now 11% up in lumber. Yes.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","A strong improvement, but based on what you're seeing from your customers, you expect this to even accelerate this year? And I guess, not just center-beam, but also in Intermodal boxcar aggregates, et cetera, all across sectors. Can you comment on your expectations for total exposure to housing?","Donald W. Seale","I can't give you a number at the current run rate of our exposure to housing. You've seen that starts are now approximating 1 million, which is a good recovery from a low of 520,000 that was the trough. Certainly, we have a range of products that we handle in housing as it recovers, and it's everything from lumber, plywood, OSB, different products like polyvinyl chloride, on the chemical side, that goes into pipe manufacturing for housing. So there is the range of products from cement, chemicals, aggregates, lumber, that go into housing that would benefit us as it continues to improve. And we're seeing some of that across, not only our center-beam traffic for lumber, but we have a healthy cement franchise, as well as products moving in boxcars.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And do you think the current improvement year-over-year, year-to-date, is representative of what you expect the rest of the year?","Donald W. Seale","We do. If we stay at this start current level of housing start volume, over the 1 million unit level, we see that type of activity we saw in the first quarter, we've got the favorable comps year-over-year, and we will see that level of growth for the rest of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon with AllianceBernstein.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just a quick follow-up on the comp line. There was a $7 million payroll tax in there. Is that just a one-time thing, or is that a recurring thing that's going to be going on throughout the year?","Charles W. Moorman","Tax recurring, that was the railroad unemployment insurance. It was reduced by 1.5%. That affected all of us and, well, affected us by that $7 million, and should not -- it should carry off.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just, Don, a quick follow-up on the coal length of haul. It seemed like you were saying that the longer haul southern utility business was coming down, and that was having a negative impact on length of haul. What else was going on inside of coal that was actually compensating for that because it looks like the overall length of haul was up by about 5% in the quarter, year-over-year.","Donald W. Seale","The export increase of 21% volume, 25% in tons was generally longer haul to the ports. And that was the counterbalance. And then as I mentioned previously, we had another counterbalance in the other way with about 8 million tons of short-haul utility coal up in the Midwest that averaged somewhere in the range of about 60 miles per car.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question for Mark. But Mark, can you provide any update on where we are with the Movement Planner rollout, maybe in terms of like your gross ton-mile coverage and when do you think you'll be fully rolled out there? And has this a component of your efficiency gains, or is that something we'll see in the future?","Mark D. Manion","I think we've seen the kind of the beginning of the efficiencies from Movement Planner still really early because it is fully deployed on 2, when we're working on 3 of our divisions. But we see that being a pretty aggressive rollout as we continue. And we should have that completely rolled out by the end of 2014.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, perfect. And then just kind of 1 other operations questions. But just in terms of network planning, how difficult is it for the network to take on maybe kind of a coal basin shift, let's say, to Illinois, in conjunction with your crude oil business that continues to grow? I assume most of that traffic is kind of East-West. Does that pose any design issues, or do you feel that the capacity is adequate there?","Donald W. Seale","No, absolutely adequate there. And when you think about that lane, we have a tremendous amount of capacity there.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, perfect. And then just kind of housekeeping, any update on CapEx?","John P. Rathbone","We're still talking a little over -- about $2 billion for the year.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Kind of the tail wagging the dog, but when I look at crude by rail, you gave a nice breakdown of Intermodal and how the economics change as you add cars to trains. How much of the crude by rail is moving manifest versus unit train right now? And as you grow this business at 20%, 25%, 30% rates, can you talk about where the critical mass is to where you start moving more on unit train basis?","Donald W. Seale","Our current split on crude oil is about 65% unit train, and the balance is moving manifest. And if someone has a car set, where they have 100 cars, plus, they generally want to move that in a unit train. We don't dictate whether it moves in a unit train or a manifest. The shipper and the refinery, working in concert with each other, does that.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.","Charles W. Moorman","Well, thank you, everyone, for your patience and for the excellent questions. And we look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Katie Cook, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Cook. You may begin.","Katie U. Cook - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Thank you, Rob, and good morning. Before we begin today's call, I would like to mention a few items. The slides of the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the Investor section, along with our non-GAAP reconciliations. Additionally, transcripts and downloads of today's call will be posted on our website.","During this call, we may make certain forward-looking statements which are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from our actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important.","Now, it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's third-quarter 2016 earnings call. With me today are NS's Chief Marketing Officer, Alan Shaw; our Chief Operating Officer, Mike Wheeler; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart.","Our results this quarter, summarized on slide 4, reflect the successful proactive measures and strategies that Norfolk Southern continues to employ as we relentlessly focus on delivering results through efficiencies and asset utilization. We continue our focus on deploying resources to improve service and network performance, while streamlining our corporate assets.","Targeted cost initiatives and the disposition of surplus operating property, combined with the lapping of prior-year restructuring costs, drove a 67.5% operating ratio. This marked an improvement of 220 basis points or 3% compared to last year, as operating expenses came in 10% lower relative to a 7% decline in revenue. We extended the high performance levels we have reliably delivered throughout this year into the third quarter, resulting in a record 68.7% operating ratio for the nine-month period.","As a result of our efforts, earnings-per-share for the quarter increased to $1.55, up 4% compared to last year's $1.49. For the nine-month period, earnings per share increased 8% year-over-year.","Importantly, we have significantly improved network performance as shown by our composite service metric, which was up 8% for the quarter and 14% for the year. These results, in addition to feedback I am receiving first-hand from our customers, confirm what we already know. Our commitment to customer service in tandem with our disciplined cost measures continues to move our company in the right direction.","With respect to network initiatives, Mike will go over our progress in greater detail, but let me highlight that our team has already exceeded the 2016 rationalization goal of 1000 miles, and we'll continue to pursue these kinds of opportunities in the future.","Turning to slide five, as we entered this year we had committed to lowering our operating ratio below 70% for the year, which I am pleased to say we are well-positioned to achieve even with economic headwinds. Our cost savings initiatives will generate productivity savings of at least $200 million for the year, upwards of $250 million in fact, and we will contain capital spending to $1.9 billion, which is lower than our original $2.1 billion plan, as we continually reassess the optimal deployment of capital in this changing economic environment.","Our employees have consistently demonstrated their commitment to reliably delivering superior results in what has been a dynamic and challenging economic environment. We have worked hard to build a flexible strategy, one that stages us well for top-line growth coupled with annual productivity savings, which are targeted for over $650 million by 2020. This team's strong start in 2016 reinforces my confidence in our ability to achieve a sub-65% operating ratio by 2020 and deliver substantial shareholder value.","Now, Alan will cover trends in revenue; Mike will provide more detail on how we're managing the operation, including the progress I mentioned on our line rationalization initiatives; and Marta will summarize our financial results. Then we'll take your questions.","Thank you, and now I will turn the call over to Alan.","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Thank you, Jim, and good morning to our audience. We appreciate your joining us today. So easing economic headwinds contributed to a 3% sequential improvement in revenue. As compared to the second quarter of 2016 (sic) [2015] (5:39), our $2.5 billion in third-quarter revenue represented a 7% year-over-year decline, primarily driven by decreases in energy-related markets and the Triple Crown restructure. The hot summer and sequentially higher natural gas prices softened declines in utility coal, though high stockpile levels continue to dampen year-over-year comparisons.","The Triple Crown restructure enhanced our overall efficiency and profitability, while yielding year-over-year volume and revenue declines since the fourth quarter of 2015. While energy prices improved in the third quarter, they remained below last year's levels and negatively influenced fuel surcharge revenue and several merchandise commodities, including crude oil and natural gas products.","Amid the challenging economic conditions, intermodal remained a bright spot with improved service driving growth in domestic business. Despite pricing gains, revenue per unit declined 3% due to negative mix associated with increased intermodal freight and decreased coal volume as well as lower fuel surcharge revenue.","Merchandise revenue and volume, as shown on slide eight, fell 4% in the third quarter. Our chemicals franchise, impacted by continued reductions in crude oil shipments as well as plant closures and consolidations in our industrial intermediates markets, further declined from the second quarter and was the primary driver of the year-over-year merchandise decrease.","Agriculture was impacted by reduced feed, wheat and corn volume compared to 2015. Automotive shipments were down as a result of a competitive loss, as mentioned on our second quarter call, and production declines at several NS-served plants. A weak pulp board market combined with increased truck competition negatively impacted paper and forest products volume.","These decreases were partially offset by metals and construction volume, which increased year-over-year and sequentially due to stronger shipments of steel and aggregates. As compared to last year, merchandise RPU increased 1%, reflecting positive pricing gains, partially offset by negative mix associated with increased aggregates and coiled steel as well as reduced industrial intermediates and machinery volume.","Turning to intermodal on slide nine, volume declined 1% as year-over-year growth in domestic and international volume nearly offset the declines related to the Triple Crown restructure. Excluding Triple Crown, volume was up 6%, while revenue increased 5%. Despite excess truck capacity, our approved service product drove an 8% year-over-year increase in domestic intermodal business. International volume increased 1% compared to a strong third quarter last year.","Lower volumes of higher-rated Triple Crown freight and lower fuel surcharge revenue negatively impacted RPU, down 7% as compared to last year. Excluding Triple Crown and fuel surcharges, RPU was up 2% in this highly competitive truck price environment, while revenue improved 8%.","On slide 10, coal revenue was down 18% for the quarter, with a 15% volume decline as compared to last year. Year-over-year utility volume continued to be negatively impacted by low natural gas prices and above-normal stockpile levels. Warmer summer weather and sequentially higher natural gas prices improved coal dispatch and utility deliveries as the third quarter progressed, generating 18.4 million utility tons, a 28% improvement from the second quarter.","Future utility volumes will be dependent upon weather conditions, natural gas prices, and stockpile levels. Between May and September, stockpiles declined by approximately 20 days of burn, though they remained 25 days above targeted levels and are expected to impact utility volumes into next year. Assuming normal weather conditions and natural gas pricing consistent with the current forward curve, we expect to handle between 15 million and 18 million utility tons in the fourth quarter.","While there has been recent strength in spot pricing in the seaborne markets, U.S. export supply has been constrained by the impact of bankruptcies and production rationalizations. Third quarter thermal exports through Baltimore declined significantly as tonnage shifted to the domestic utility market. For the fourth quarter, we expect to handle 3 million to 4 million export tons, with sequential increases in thermal coal through Baltimore. Coal RPU excluding fuel was down 2% in the third quarter, with positive pricing offset by the mix of reduced export volume.","Turning to our outlook on slide 11, we expect fourth quarter volumes to be flat or increase modestly year-over-year due in part to somewhat easier comparisons. In mid-November we will cycle the impact of Triple Crown. The fourth quarter of 2015 also marked the start of the unseasonably warm winter that generated access coal stockpiles, the effect of global steel oversupply, as well as the beginning of the impact of increased manufacturing and retail inventories.","Lastly, we expect a lower year-over-year fuel surcharge revenue decline with WTI and on-highway diesel prices close to fourth quarter 2015 levels. Though some coal stockpile correction occurred in the third quarter, we expect the ongoing inventory overhang to impact fourth quarter utility coal volumes. Sustained low oil prices and a narrow spread between Brent and WTI will continue to limit crude oil rail volume.","Though automotive volume for the full year is expected to exceed North American vehicle production growth of 1%, fourth quarter shipments will decline as compared to last year. We anticipate year-over-year service-driven growth within intermodal. We will maintain our focus on improved pricing, reflecting the value of our service product. Overall revenue per unit will be impacted by the ongoing mix headwinds associated with increased intermodal and decreased coal freight.","Our long-term view on both markets and pricing enables us to navigate the current economic headwinds while positioning us for future growth. Marketing continues to work closely with operations and finance, executing on our financial plan amid dynamic market conditions, controlling what we can control, ensuring that resources are in place to support expected volumes and allowing us to take advantage of opportunities for long-term growth.","I will now turn it over to Mike to discuss our operational performance.","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Thank you, Alan. I am pleased to announce we are continuing to operate at high service levels while making outstanding progress on our cost reduction initiatives. As Jim noted, the progress we have made is a testament to our employees and their commitment and focus in executing the key drivers of our strategic plan.","Let me begin with safety on slide 13. While our reportable injury ratio increased in the third quarter as compared to the same period last year, we had an 18% improvement in our serious injury ratio.","Turning to service on slide 14, you see we continued to execute at a very high level, as evidenced by our service composite, train speed, and terminal dwell metrics. This is the second quarter in a row with the service composite above 80%. For the third quarter, our service composite and train speed both improved 8%, and dwell improved 3% versus the same period last year. Overall, our velocity as measured at the car level remains near record levels and continues to aid asset utilization and strong customer service.","What is most encouraging is that we had been able to do this while aggressively pursuing cost-reduction initiatives, as evidenced by our 67.5% operating ratio. The improvements in our service metrics demonstrate our continued commitment to driving productivity improvements and increasing customer service.","Now, on slide 15, these cost-cutting initiatives, coupled with our ability to keep the railroad operating at a high level, continue to result in significant productivity savings. The reduction in crew starts for the third quarter significantly outpaced the decline in volume, and we have continued to improve our re-crews, overtime, and train length. Through the third quarter, we have achieved our highest average train length on record. Even with this significant improvement in train length, our velocity has been roughly the same as our record levels of 2012 and 2013. Together this resulted in improved employee productivity.","Turning to slide 16, in our previous call, we said we would give an update on our network rationalization efforts. We have been going at this in a very deliberate way, with three separate strategies tailored to the specific circumstances with the goal of maintaining or improving service to our customers while reducing our costs and investments needs. To that end, the most visible way we are changing the network is getting a short-line carrier to operate lower-volume segments. We have completed one large transaction with the West Virginia secondary and another transaction is in process. This benefits NS by enabling us to improve capital allocation, continue to serve the customers, and maintain our network reach.","As illustrated on slide 17, we are also concentrating flows on fewer routes. For example, we idled one of our steepest and most difficult to operate lines in the coal fields by rerouting coal trains onto our main line, which had excess capacity. To retain flexibility, the old route was left in place for now in case there is a business rebound. We have done this at several locations, even outside the coal network, and are continuing to identify opportunities across the system.","Lastly, on slide 18, even if we decide to continue using a route, we have found it is possible to reduce speeds without effecting customer service. These are our secondary mainlines. By reducing speeds, we can extend the life of track without affecting safety and delay reinvestment needs. We also realize some modest expense savings as well.","This is a new strategy for NS, and reflects a willingness to reexamine our business model in the face of economic realities. Using our full toolkit we have already exceeded our 1,000-mile goal for 2016, while velocity and service have remained near our historic highs.","I will now turn it over to Marta who will cover the financials.","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter results showed continued strong cost control in the face of modest overall volume decline.","Let's take a look at the financial details, starting with operating results on slide 20. While revenues were down 7% on 4% lower volume, operating expenses declined by 10%. The 67.5% operating ratio for the quarter was a 3% improvement over last year's third quarter, and the operating ratio of 68.7% for the first nine months with an all-time record.","Slide 21 shows the expense reduction by income statement line item. Every category of cost was lower in 2015, a result of targeted expense reduction initiatives and the lower volume. Additionally, the comparison was affected by last year's restructuring costs, particularly in depreciation.","Now let's take a closer look at the components. Slide 22 highlights the major drivers of the variance in compensation and benefits. While the overall net change was relatively small at $11 million, it contained some offsetting items.","First, with regard to employee count and employee hours, the efficiency improvements in the first half of the year continued, as overall head count was down over 2,400 employees versus last year and was down slightly sequentially. This reduced head count, along with lower overtime and fewer re-crews, resulted in $47 million of year-over-year savings, and the associated payroll taxes were favorable by $5 million. We also had $9 million in lower pension expense. These items helped offset increases in incentive compensation of $39 million, wage inflation of $14 million, and health and welfare rate increases of $12 million.","For the remainder of the year, we expect head count to remain relatively flat sequentially. With regard to incentive comp, wage rates, and health and welfare costs, we expect to have similar year-over-year increases in the fourth quarter as we had in the third quarter.","Slide 23 depicts purchased services and rents, which was down $65 million or 14% year-over-year. The largest reduction was attributable to $37 million in decreased Triple Crown costs. Recall that the curtailment of Triple Crown operations was effective on November 15 of last year, so our fourth quarter variance for this item will be about half this amount. Also contributing to the reduction in this line item was $7 million of lower equipment rents. This was due primarily to the improved velocity Mike described, and we expect this benefit to continue into the fourth quarter.","Next is fuel expense as shown on slide 24. The $40 million or 18% decline in fuel cost for the quarter was largely a result of lower oil prices, which decreased the price per gallon by 12%. We also had lower consumption due to the lower traffic volume.","Slide 25 details our materials and other category, which decreased $54 million or 22% year-over-year. This improvement reflects $28 million of gains on the sale of two operating properties. Next, reductions in material costs totaling $15 million were primarily for locomotives and freight car materials. And the last variance on the slide is principally due to moving costs associated with last year's Roanoke office closure.","Turning to non-operating items on slide 26. This too was affected by the prior-year comparison, as we had a large gain on the sale of a non-operating property in the third quarter of 2015. Somewhat offsetting this decrease were higher returns from corporate-owned life insurance.","Moving on to income taxes on slide 27, the effective rate for the third quarter was 34.8% versus 37.6%. The lower effective rate was related to the increased life insurance returns as well as to the effects of stock-based compensation and several other smaller items. For the full year we now expect to have an effective income tax rate of roughly 36%.","Summarizing our third quarter earnings on slide 28, net income was $460 million, up 2% versus 2015, and diluted earnings per share were $1.55, 4% higher than last year.","Wrapping up with year-to-date cash flows on slide 29, cash from operations was $2.3 billion and free cash flow was a little over $1 billion. With respect to capital returned to shareholders, we have paid $523 million in dividends and repurchased 603 million of our shares. We remain on track for full-year capital spending of $1.9 billion and share repurchases of $800 million.","Thank you for your attention, and I'll turn the program back to Jim.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Thank you, Marta. Let me close by saying that the focus, agility and determination of our team are readily apparent in our performance this year. As we move forward we are well positioned for growth opportunities longer-term and confident in our ability to drive shareholder value.","And with that, we will now open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you, and good morning, everyone.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Good morning, Jason.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC","I guess I wanted to start off with sort of your RPU, and you mentioned in the coal business, RPU I think was negatively impacted a little bit by a mix shift away from some of the export. But I think in your commentary you also said that sequentially as we look to 4Q that we should start seeing a pickup on some of the thermal exports. Should I assume that that's going to positively impact your RPU reported when we see the fourth quarter numbers, all things being equal?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","No, Jason, the thermal coal typically goes through Baltimore, which is a lower length of haul for us. And so I want to make it clear that, while we will enjoy the increase in the coal through Baltimore and that growth, that will be a drag on RPU...","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. No, that's good clarification. Also, you guys noted you are ahead of schedule here in your, let's call it network rationalization, I know you have that pending stuff down in Delaware that you're doing. In terms of how it flows through the income statement, I'm assuming there's very little, but it's probably more on the CapEx side. Is that the right way of looking at the 1,000 miles that you've done already? And is there potential that you exceed that \u2013 I think the original mark was 1,600 miles ultimately that you looked at?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Mike, why don't you take that question?","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Sure. Yeah, Jason, you are exactly right. There is some modest expense savings, but the main driver is it allows us to reallocate capital, and going forward we plan to meet our goal for 2020, and we're going to keep looking for opportunities and if there's more we'll take them.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Jason, the short-line strategy is about putting the right player on the field for the business, too, and serving the customer. And that's really what it's all about. There are some benefits financially as well, but this is really a strategy to provide the best service provider we can for the customer.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC","And in terms of that ultimate number of 1,600 miles, is that something that you're likely to exceed now, or is it just, that's what you identified and that's it?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Just technical correction, it's actually 1,500 miles is the goal.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC","1,500, sorry.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","But we're on track. We are making great progress and we think there's definitely more to come.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you, guys for the time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Good morning, Scott.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Alan, I wanted to just follow-up on the coal price \u2013 the coal RPU first. Are you seeing any of the pick-up in met export yet? And just given that the much higher, the benchmark, how quickly can you start raising your met rates, and do you plan to do so?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Scott, I'll address the first question. Initially we're going to see a slight uptick potentially in export met in the quarter. Most if not all of our uptick is going to be on the thermal side. As I noted in the comments, it's somewhat restricted by production, and the producers need to have some sort of comfort level that the prices that are out there now are sustainable.","I don't think anybody believes they are going to stay at $200 per metric ton, but if they can get some sort of visibility that the prices are going to be at a level where they can bring back production, that will encourage more business \u2013 more production, and more business on us. We've taken a look at some of our export pricing in the fourth quarter, and we anticipate doing that again in the first quarter dependent upon market conditions.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","So given that of \u2013 a little bit more shorter length of haul export, that's lower RPU, a little bit more met, and then sounds like higher met pricing, in aggregate, would you think that coal RPU is flat, up, down sequentially?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","I think in the fourth quarter the shift of more lower length of haul thermal coal through Baltimore will offset pricing increases that we have.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, got it. And then, Marta, just one for you on the operating ratio. I think at some point earlier this year you talked about kind of hoping for a sub-70% OR each of the second through fourth quarters. Is that still the way to think about the fourth quarter?","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yes, we're still expecting sub-70% OR in each of those quarters.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you, appreciate it.","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Scott, I'd like to clarify a point. As I was talking about the offsets, I was speaking sequentially, not year-over-year.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Danny C. Schuster - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, good morning. This is Danny Schuster on for Allison. Thank you for taking my question.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Good morning.","Danny C. Schuster - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","I just wanted to ask how your same-store core pricing looks sequentially versus last quarter, and how we should think about that over the next quarter or two here?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Sure. Alan?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Sure. Danny, we're continuing to get traction in our pricing, and we are negotiating pricing in excess of inflation. As we've noted before, we are facing some limitations in the upside due to loose capacity in the trucking market.","Danny C. Schuster - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, great. Thank you. And just wanted to follow up on some of your commentary on slowing speeds on secondary mainlines. How much longer do you think you can extend the life of the track, and how much of a dent cannot make in your overall maintenance infrastructure spending on an annual basis looking forward?","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Well, it really doesn't extend the life of the track. I mean, we are going to have that track, because it's part of our network reach always, and we'll have it maintained at the right level for the lower speeds. But it does \u2013 but it does allow reduced maintenance levels over time.","Danny C. Schuster - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, good morning.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Good morning, Chris.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I wanted to ask about sort of the progress on the productivity side, so $250 million I think is the target now. I just wanted to get a rough sense of maybe how we think we're sort of progressing towards that $250 million? And maybe some initial thoughts on 2017, whether you should see this sort of a linear progression towards the $650 million or so over time, or just how we kind of think about the progress there?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Chris, let me address first the $250 million that we're currently targeting for the full year. We increased our outlook there from $200 million last quarter, reason being we found that even with the sequential uptick in volumes in the third quarter, we were able to hold the line on resources and did not incur additional overtime. In fact, year-over-year, overtime was again down considerably. Similarly, employee head count declined modestly sequentially; we had been forecasting flat.","So that's the source of the \u2013 some of the additional productivity pickup in 2016. Marta, why don't you address 2017? We'll come back you with a more robust outlook on productivity and across the board in January when we report our fourth quarter earnings, but...","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Right. Mike and his folks are working now on our specific productivity initiatives for 2017, and as Jim mentioned, we're going to give you more details on our January call. We do expect to keep pushing on that, and they were \u2013 worked very hard this year, especially in light of the overall decline in volumes in the year, to accelerate as much of the productivity improvements as they did into 2016.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful, that's great color. And then as a follow-up, just thinking about some of the network initiatives that you guys are undertaking and maybe some of the outsourcing into short-line or sales there, in terms of operating property gains on sales, should that be something that will be part of the calculus as we move forward? Is that something that might be recurring, or is it sort of more a little bit more one-time, you know, you see that it's a little bit lumpier here and there in various quarters? Just want to get a sense of maybe how to think about that bigger picture as you go through your process.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Sure. Those gains on sale do tend to be lumpy, and \u2013 so that, you know, there's a certain level of gains that we have experienced over the course of a year, but quarter-to-quarter it can vary quite a bit. We don't see the opportunity to recognize gains there from sale or disposition of operating properties, so much as a result of the line rationalization program; rather an initiative to just identify and dispose of surplus operating property. And so that's what we booked in the third quarter.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. So not necessarily core to the bigger picture productivity targets that you have?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Right. Right.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Thomas Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, good morning. I wanted to ask you, you've commented a little bit on pricing but wanted to see if you could give perspective, I think one of the other railroads talked about \u2013 obviously, UNP talked about some, I think market challenges they said, in the coal and international intermodal markets. It was a little unclear whether that was increasing rail competition, or whether that was kind of structural pressures from customers. Are you seeing anything in those two markets where you'd say, the utilities are pushing us harder and we can't really resist, or change in container shipping line, the consolidation, Hanjin bankruptcy, if that's having an outsized impact on your pricing?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Let me comment on the question more broadly, and then I'll turn it over to Alan for the specifics. Alan mentioned loose truck capacity. Competition is alive and well, and we're facing intense modal competition. Nevertheless, with our service levels where they are, with the service product that we're offering, we feel confident that we will be paid for the value of our service rendered. And let me let Alan address the specific market that you referenced.","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Sure. You know, our price plan is consistent across all markets. And within coal we've talked about taking a look at the export pricing, ex-fuel surcharge; even though we had a pretty negative mix within coal, our coal RPU was only down 2% in the third quarter. Within international intermodal, we are continuing to line ourselves with folks who are adding capacity to the East Coast, and while the Hanjin did create a slight impact to us, we're taking a long-term focus on our pricing, because we have a better service product and we know service is key and core to our focus on pricing.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great, thank you. For the second question, I just wondered if you could give a comment an incremental margin perspective in 2017? I mean I guess if we go back to \u2013 it's tough to know what volumes are, but if they're up a couple percent it seems like you'd be positioned to put a very strong incremental margin, maybe better than the kind of normal 50% we think of, just given the cost take-out, given capacity in the system. Is that a reasonable conclusion, that if you get a couple points of volume you might do a lot better than the typical 50% incremental next year?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Tom, I think we'll defer answering that question to January, when we'll come back to you with a more comprehensive outlook, including our expectation with regard to productivity, operating leverage, inflation and so forth. One thing I think worth flagging, though, is some rather extraordinary inflation factors next year, in particular health and welfare benefit costs. Marta?","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yes. We do expect that next year \u2013 as Jim said, we'll give you the total amount for the compensation and benefits, its expected inflation, in January, but we do already know that we're going to have higher inflation in the union medical.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Right.","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","And with regard to your incremental margin question, it really does depend on if we have growth, and as Mike and Jim have both said, with services positioning us to get that growth, if we have growth we will have incremental margin improvement in all of the categories. But recall that we have the incremental margin hierarchy which, dependent on where the volumes come, the order is \u2013 the most incrementally margin positive is merchandise, then coal, then intermodal.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you for the detail. Appreciate it.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning everyone. Jim, can you talk to the commentary around slowing network speeds? I mean, I understand that on your secondary lines you could get some more capital out of it, especially if your volume's down. But I think generally when we've looked at significant OR improvement for other rails, it's been driven primarily by getting velocity up in the network. So is that the real long-term strategic vision, that in aggregate we want to have speeds lower or higher?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Well, definitely higher, and I think Mike emphasized that. The great thing about what we're doing is that we are able to slow down our trains in some parts of the network, without slowing network velocity overall. So it's a very targeted initiative. It does result in cost savings, primarily from longer maintenance cycles, on those branch lines. But overall network speeds are up, and that's where we want them to stay.","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","And just remember, these secondary mainlines do have lower speeds originally before we reduced the speed. So it's not like our main lines that have the high speeds. So reduction in speed wasn't that significant, but it is in the capital reallocation. So that's why \u2013 because of that, we've still been able to keep our network velocity high, like I said, at the carload level at our record levels.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And, Jim, sorry, I'm really stuffed up here. But can you talk a little bit about terminal rationalization? Because I do think that might be where some difference is between getting velocity higher, versus what the East Coast railroads have been able to do in the past. And I know when you launched your new plan you'd called out terminal rationalization as a piece of that opportunity.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Sure. Absolutely. And that's something that we're going to continue to look at, and there may be opportunities there. On the other hand, we want to maintain a certain level of customer service. We've underscored the importance of that several times. And having a robust classification yard network is one component of providing good service in our merchandise franchise.","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah. I'll just remind you that we did reduce one of the pump terminals out of our network this year, earlier this year, and then also one of our other pump terminals we've reduced the throughput, and therefore the cost, about half. So we continue to look at that, but all in light of making sure we keep the service product at the high levels.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Morning, everyone. Jim, I think you mentioned that you continue to price above inflation. Do you have any thoughts on what inflation's looking like for next year?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Again, we'll defer an answer to that until January and give you our outlook there. It's obviously an important piece of the puzzle. But we did want to flag one inflation item in particular, that health and welfare benefits cost increase should be substantial next year. So that's a bit of a headwind, and there are some other things that are in play as well on the inflation front, but let us defer a complete answer until January.","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yes. And generally speaking, like we did this year \u2013 this year we gave for 2016 an overall comp and benefits inflationary increase of 3.5%, and the other expense categories are generally in line with inflation that you see in the rest of the economy.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Understood. And just as a follow-up, given some of the changes you are making to the network, both with the rerouting as well as the short-line outsourcing, are you kind of fundamentally rethinking some of your end markets and where your growth comes from over time, and maybe, like some other rails, deemphasizing coal a little bit and focusing more on intermodal?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","No, I think we are continuing to focus on opportunities for growth wherever we can find them. We are intent on growing this company in the years to come, and want to have a solid platform for doing that across our different lines of business. Now naturally, the line rationalization opportunity is greater in some parts of the network than it is in others, particularly in the coalfield, and we've been through in past quarters what we have done specifically by the way of line rationalization there. But the end markets are what they've been, and the growth opportunities are what they have been as well. Alan, do you want to add a little color to that?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah. I would suggest that markets are dynamic, and so are we. So we are going to manage to the changing markets that we see. We are going to put a good service product out there that our customers value, and our customers' customers value, in an attempt to pull more business off the highway. That could be in an intermodal container, it can be in a gondola, it can be in a boxcar, it can be in a hopper.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks, and good morning.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Hi, Justin.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","You talked about productivity of $250 million this year, but could you comment on how much of that amount is coming from restructuring Triple Crown and restructuring the coal network, or does that productivity number exclude those items?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","It excludes those items. So we don't count as productivity the restructure \u2013 lapping of the restructuring costs for Triple Crown, for example.","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Right. So the \u2013 if you look at the change from having had the restructuring charge last year to this year, we don't have that difference in the productivity improvement. We have ...","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Okay.","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","... the benefit of running a more profitable, a more focused Triple Crown network and a more focused coal network. So the benefits after the changes are in productivity, but the variance due to the restructuring charge is not in that number.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","And with regard to the line rationalization initiatives, the productivity benefit there comes from reduced labor costs, from materials, maintenance expenditures, et cetera. So the line rationalization initiatives are not in it of themselves a productivity producer, but they spin off lots of productivity benefits in the forms I just mentioned, and others.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Okay, great. That's helpful to clarify. And secondly, I know you aren't giving too many specifics on next year, but I was wondering if you would be willing to share any initial thoughts on how you believe volumes could trend in 2017, and maybe just directionally, it might be helpful if you could walk through some of the commodity groups where we could see meaningful moves, either up or down?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Okay. We can do that, bearing in mind that we'll present that in the context of an overall outlook in January. But Alan, talk about what we're seeing right now in terms of volume ups and downs next year.","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Certainly. I'll provide a broad overview, and then we'll be back with you on our January call. Intermodal, we continue to see growth in that franchise. Once you strip out the year-over-year impact of Triple Crown that will become readily evident. Ex Triple Crown and fuel surcharge in the fourth quarter, our intermodal revenue was up 8%.","Coal is another one, and I want to make it perfectly clear, we had some very strong sequential improvements in coal in the third quarter, and coal in the fourth quarter is doing fine for us. Coal dispatch in the East right now is a load follower, and so it will be heavily dependent upon the weather. If we have a warm winter like we had last year, we're going to be in the same position in January as we were in January of this year. So that's why I think it's prudent for us to speak in more detail with you on our January call about volumes.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Okay, great. And any thoughts on general merchandise as well?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Merchandise is going to have some puts and takes in it. Energy continues to be pressured, so we'll probably have some negative comps within our crude oil franchise. We're continuing to monitor steel capacity, plant utilization and steel pricing. That could potentially have an impact. So that's \u2013 we'll provide more color on the January call.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Great. I'll leave it at that. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your questions.","Kenneth S. Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Good morning. Just a clarification real quick. Marta, you had mentioned some asset sales had declined below the line, but then above the line, in operating income and other, you had an increase of $29 million this quarter. Just can you detail when and where you would put that above the line?","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yes, So as you know, Ken, and I think you and several others \u2013 of your colleagues had mentioned this over the years, there's historically been diversity in the industry of where land sales are. Over time the industry has moved to where almost everyone has the operating land sales in operating expenses, and then the non-operating ones down in other income. And so that's what we're doing here, too. The reason why I called it out this quarter was because it was so large.","Kenneth S. Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great, I just wanted to clarify that. Thank you. But \u2013 I know you're not giving too much detail on 2017 yet, but maybe just in general terms, Jim, can you talk about your thoughts on cash, and more specifically CapEx, given the reduced line maintenance and PTC kind of rolling over. Do you look at CapEx dropping down to, I don't know, 15%, 16% of revenues, or do you have some general thoughts on where you think CapEx goes?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Sure. We would expect to peg CapEx at 19% of revenue next year, and for 2018 as well. That's our current thinking on the level of CapEx, reflecting the continuing spend on Positive Train Control through 2018. After that, our plan is to reduce CapEx to 17% of revenue. That's obviously something we're going to continue to monitor, and we want to make sure that those investments are generating appropriate returns as we go through the plan period. But right now, that will be our plan, 19% for the next couple of years and then 17% thereafter.","Kenneth S. Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So no real roll-off, given any of the, I guess, cost-savings or line rationalizations, in your view, for the next year or two?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","We're going to stick to the 19% of revenue for the next two years.","Kenneth S. Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","We'll generate some savings from the line rationalization program, but we would expect to deploy that capital elsewhere.","Kenneth S. Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Yes. Thanks very much. So I want to come back to the land sales on the operating results, Marta. I know when you had given us some guidance around materials and other last quarter, and your operating ratio, you were giving us $10 million reduction in materials and an OR that would actually be up slightly in the third quarter. Yet with your land sale you're actually down $54 million and your OR was better, so it seems like it was really driven by the land sale.","So my question is, you pointed us to sub-70% for fourth quarter, is that contingent or at what level of land sales would you expect to go into that number, and so should we still be looking at a $10 million reduction in the fourth quarter materials? And is your \u2013 and I think, Jim, you mentioned your longer-term targets are not including land sales, but I'm just curious whether you'll be giving us guidance on what the operating land sales will be in 2017?","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","So the \u2013 let me take that in two pieces. First of all, the materials guidance was for decline of $15 million in the third and fourth quarter. And so materials did come down $15 million. You are correct that the land sales is something that is variable, and so we didn't forecast that. And so the other biggest increase in that line was the land sale gains. And even without any land sale gains \u2013 and the timing of those are variable, so there may or may not be some in the fourth quarter, but even without the land sales gains we think we'll be below 70% OR in the fourth quarter.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","So looking into 2017 and beyond, we will update you on any and all land sales of which we are aware at the time, but granted it's difficult to forecast the timing of closing in a lot of cases, as with non-operating property. You pretty much have to \u2013 you have to close before you book the gain, and timing of closing can be uncertain. So when it happens we'll make sure we let you know, and if possible in advance.","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","And I will say that historically these haven't been very significant. In the last couple of years they've ranged between $10 million and $20 million for the whole year. So $28 million in one quarter is large, which is why we called it out. But certainly Mike and his folks, and Alan and his folks in the real estate side, are looking to monetize any surplus assets after they've analyzed it to make sure that it doesn't have other opportunities for us, now or perhaps in the future.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Okay. And did I hear you, it's below 70% excluding any land sales for fourth quarter for OR, is that right?","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Correct.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then you mentioned some of the rerouting operations. What point do you decide \u2013 you mentioned you are keeping them open for now, contingent on whether volume will come back. At what point do you decide this is a structural or kind of a permanent business level on those lines, and decide to in fact close down those operations? How much OR improvement and synergy or efficiency can we get if you start closing down some of these reroutings that you've done to date?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","That's a judgment call. And we do abandon lines from time to time, on a fairly small scale. Every year we have line abandonments that we undertake. The savings \u2013 the additional savings would be rather modest from going from mothballing to outright abandonment, because for all intents and purposes we're not spending any money on a line that has been mothballed, as we went through earlier.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much for the color.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your questions.","Brian Adam Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes, hi, good morning.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Good morning.","Brian Adam Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","I just wanted to ask you about fuel surcharges and \u2013 within the contracts, to the extent you made progress during the quarter, transitioning from WTI to on-highway, and maybe just add on to that, to the extent that we do see a rise in fuel prices, how much incremental fuel costs might you have to absorb before you start to see those surcharges start kicking in?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Alan, why don't you take the question about the trend in the fuel surcharge mechanisms, and then Marta, maybe you can comment on the leverage aspect.","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","First and foremost our focus is on price, when we renegotiate contracts. And so we're not going to give up on price to change a fuel surcharge program. We have reduced our revenue that is tied to a WTI-based fuel surcharge from about 53% to slightly below 40% at this point.","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Okay. So with regard to the effect on the income statement, our fuel surcharges in the third quarter were down $46 million year-over-year, and our fuel expense line was down $40 million. You can see that that was a $6 million compression in the \u2013 in our operating income.","Brian Adam Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got it. I guess just as fuel may start to rise, how high would that need to go \u2013 I mean how much additional expense might you absorb before seeing a meaningful contribution from the fuel surcharge?","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","As we discussed in the past, our primary trigger in the merchandise area, which is largely where that 40% Alan mentioned still on WTI, the primary trigger point is 64. So as prices rise from where we are now, the closer they get to 64, each of those we will have that compression similar to what I described there. And so one way to look at it is to examine the change in WTI and OHD that we had, third quarter '15 to third quarter '16, and then see what that did to our fuel surcharges. And then you can extrapolate from there, depending on how you're forecasting oil prices to go up in the future.","Brian Adam Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got it. If I could just sneak one quick one then, just on pension, if you snap the line today, can you give us a look at what '17 looks like from a headwind or tailwind perspective?","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Well it's possible with -- if you snap the line today with interest rates where they are, we would have some increase in pension expense. But as you probably know, the interest rates for making those calculations are determined as of the end of the year. So once we see what interest rates are at December 31 we will get an estimate for our pension expense for next year, and we will provide that information to you on the January call.","Brian Adam Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your questions.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning. Just curious any thoughts or considerations with regard to weather, third quarter or fourth quarter impacts? Thanks.","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah, we \u2013 as you know, we had hurricane Matthew strike our southeast area on October 6, and fortunately we were able to get our network back up very quickly and provide service back to our customers. Really pleased about that, shows the resiliency of our network and really shows the planning and coordination that we put in, into place in advance. From a cost standpoint the impact is really immaterial, very, very minor.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks. And just curious about the automotive segment as we look into 2017. I realize you're not providing any material guidance, but just thoughts and considerations as we move into next year in that segment? Thanks.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","What are you seeing there, Alan?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Well, we are closely aligned with North American vehicle production, and so as that goes into 2017, is kind of how our automotive volume goes. We're going to be closely monitoring the energy markets, we're going to closely monitor steel markets and retail inventory levels throughout the holiday season as we look into our volumes for 2017.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning. Thanks for getting me on the call here. Just to go back to the network initiatives, I know you said your velocity and services have been maintained and that's important to the network overall. But from an actual head count perspective, I think Mike you mentioned a few actions that were taken, but can you give us an actual impact on head count that these network initiatives on the rationalization of 1,000 miles, and what 1,500 would do \u2013 can you give us an impact on head count? Because if you look at the five-year plan, you're looking at 65% of the savings coming from comp and benefits.","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah. Well, just remember these are our secondary mainlines, so we don't have as many folks maintain those as our core mainlines, so that's why I talked about modest expense savings. But as we continue to rationalize, we will have some head count reduction, but it will not be at large, significant levels. But I'll just say that we are on track for the head count reductions we've got in our 2020 plan.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then Alan, a quick one for you on intermodal. You talked about that, the modal competition from truck and taking share off the highway. Of course it's a very loose market right now, so how are you balancing that business and trying to get volume while maintaining price for the longer term, as you mentioned? And I guess, what's your expectation for the truck market and when it gets tighter? And what really drives that? Is it the ELD or is it something else?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","The key determinant for us and our growth has been an improved service product within the intermodal franchise, so that's how we're balancing, that's where \u2013 we and our customers are taking a long-term view of our capacity and the benefit of our service product, which is how we're focusing on price. With respect to the trucking market, we do anticipate that it tightens next year, potentially towards the latter half of the year with the implementation of ELDs and a normalization of inventory levels \u2013 that's one of the reasons I referenced that earlier \u2013 it'll probably be at a higher \u2013 the new norm is probably higher than it has been in the past, but we still think that a reduction in the inventory sales level is warranted, and would ultimately benefit volumes for us.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for your time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your questions.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up and wonder if you could add some color on the short-lining approach you guys are taking. Are you guys actually selling assets at this point, or just hiring a short-line operator to do some of the feeder moves, if you will? And is this \u2013 and is there any union implications that we should be worried about, as far as your expansion of that program going forward?","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","So these are all leases that we've done. We've been doing leases for many years now, that's how we do the short-line program. And no, we work very well with our organizations on these leases and don't expect any impact there.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","The unions are okay with sort of shifting the work over to the lower cost operators?","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","I didn't say that. I don't think that they're okay with it. They understand where we're going and they understand that it's not a big part of our network. It's very small, and typically we give them the opportunity to either go with the short line or come work with us, because they are great assets that we'd like to have, but it's their choice. So that's how we work through that.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And then Marta, maybe just as a quick follow-up, I think you talked about a sub-70% OR in 4Q. That would imply a little bit of an acceleration on the rate of improvement on the margin line. Is there anything specific that you would point out to as driving that, or is that just a function of the moderation in volume against what you guys have already executed on the productivity side?","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Well, it includes a continuation of the efficiencies that Mike and his team have been able to get out. And one thing I will make sure everybody remembers is that the fourth quarter of last year had restructuring costs, and so that was one thing that elevated the operating ratio in the fourth quarter of last year.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.","Thanks very much, and good morning.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Good morning.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.","I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how you balance service versus cost efficiency? That concept has come up a number of times. I noticed that the service composite has improved meaningfully on a year-over-year basis, but it's been pretty stable at 80% on a year-to-date basis. So just curious if that's a service level that you're consciously managing to, or is there room for that to continue to go higher even as you achieve productivity gains?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Well, we think we're at a pretty steady state in terms of composite metric right now. Which by the way we would characterize as a network performance metric. We are also measuring and managing to customer service metrics directly in each of our different lines of business. The two go hand-in-hand, we watch network performance metrics and in the field we manage to them. But at an enterprise level we're also obviously very focused on customer service metrics, direct measures of customer service as the customers see them.","But our strategy overall is to reduce any and all spending. Wherever we see an opportunity to reduce spending, we will. However, we are going to seek to maintain a consistent level of customer service.

Please proceed with your question.","Donald Allen Broughton - Avondale Partners LLC","Good morning, everyone.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Good morning, Don.","Donald Allen Broughton - Avondale Partners LLC","Most of the good questions have been taken, so I'll ask one of the housekeeping questions. Perhaps I missed it in your opening comments, Marta, but can you give us a little bit more insight on the tax rate? How sustainable is that, because that was certainly a good almost 300 basis points less than I was looking for?","Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yes. We did have a under 35% tax rate in the quarter, which was lower than we had been guiding to, and that was primarily due to corporate-owned life insurance, which \u2013 when those returns come in, they are not taxable. And so that affects the effective tax rate in the quarter that those returns are booked. And then the other main reason was stock compensation.","I mentioned those two in my prepared remarks, and there a couple of other items were smaller. One of them is tax credit. If you'll recall last year, Congress passed the extension of the tax credits in the fourth quarter of last year. So those were all booked in the fourth quarter. Since they extended them into 2016 when they did that, then we've been able to do those in each of the quarters it gives us a lower effective rate throughout the year rather than getting booked all at once.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Katie Cook, Director of Investor Relations for Norfolk Southern. Thank you. Ms. Cook, you may now begin.","Katie U. Cook - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Rob, and good morning. Before we begin today's call, I would like to mention a few items. First, slides of the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors section. Additionally, transcripts and downloads of today's call will be posted on our website.","Please be advised that during this call, we may make certain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially from those projected. Please refer to our Annual and Quarterly Reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important.","Additionally, keep in mind that all references to reported results excluding certain adjustments, that is non-GAAP numbers, have been reconciled on our website in the Investors section.","Now, it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern, Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Katie. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Norfolk Southern's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With me today are our Chief Marketing Officer, Alan Shaw; our Chief Operating Officer, Mark Manion; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart.","Earnings for the quarter were $1.49 per share, which was 17% lower than last year's record of $1.79 per share and included $0.08 per share of expenses related to restructuring initiatives.","The results also reflect softness in the commodities markets, most significantly in coal, where our revenues were down 23% in the quarter. Alan, Mark and Marta will cover the various moving parts of the quarterly results momentarily, but before delving into that, let me highlight the progress we made on some longer-term initiatives during the third quarter.","First, we began restructuring our Triple Crown Services subsidiary. With the restructuring, Triple Crown will focus on transporting automobile parts while NS will work with other supply chain partners to bring non-auto parts business into our conventional intermodal network.","Second, our headquarters consolidation initiative is mostly complete with employees formerly in Roanoke, Virginia now working in Atlanta or Norfolk. This initiative allowed us to combine some functions while reducing management head count and G&A expenses from having three back office locations. It will give us a more cohesive and focused approach. For example, in sales and marketing where all managers not in the field are now co-located.","Third, we completed the acquisition of the Delaware and Hudson Railway Company's line between Sunbury, Pennsylvania and Schenectady, New York from Canadian Pacific on September 18. This relatively small scale but highly complementary transaction gives us full operational control of an important network segment and greatly enhances our ability to serve markets in the Northeast. Implementation has gone very smoothly. These three long-term initiatives are in addition to our ongoing and continual efforts to improve service, asset utilization and returns.","In that regard, I'm pleased to report that service improved in the third quarter and we are in good shape moving into the fall season this year with the onset of winter weather just a few months away. As you will hear from Mark, key resources like crews and locomotives are reasonably well-balanced with demand right now, while at the same time we are looking hard at underutilized assets in some parts of our network.","Now without further ado, I'll turn the program over to Alan, Mark and Marta, and will return with some closing comments before taking your questions. Alan?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Jim, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you taking the time to join us today. There are four significant factors influencing our 2015 revenue. First, fuel surcharges are the primary driver of the revenue decline we have been discussing since the first quarter.","The third quarter marks our largest expected quarterly drop in fuel surcharge revenue with a $255 million decrease. Second, low commodity prices and the strength of the U.S. dollar adversely impacted volumes of coal, steel, frac sand, crude oil and export traffic. We estimate that almost 50% of our revenue base is tied to commodity pricing or foreign exchange rates. Additionally, inventory builds have softened freight shipments since the second quarter. Despite these challenges, international intermodal, automotive and natural gas products all had large gains in the quarter.","Third, increased truck capacity, low diesel prices and service levels reduced the pace of highway conversions in 2015. We expect truck capacity to tighten, which coupled with continued improvement in rail service and Norfolk Southern's network reach, will allow us to secure additional demand moving to rail.","Fourth, we've employed solid pricing as demonstrated by gains in our revenue per unit excluding fuel overall and for all three primary business groups. We achieved these positive results despite negative mix associated with declines of several commodities previously referenced and increased international intermodal.","Our continued focus on pricing has allowed us to improve total revenue per unit excluding fuel each quarter this year despite continued negative mix. During contract negotiations, we focus on both price and the fuel surcharge program for the best overall long-term result for Norfolk Southern recognizing that the average duration of our contracts is in excess of three years. We have emphasized market-based price increases and will continue with this focus reflective of the long-term benefit of rail transportation.","The strength of our diverse network including our intermodal and automotive system, transfer terminals and alignment with our short-line partners and the customers they reach gives us the opportunity to continue to provide ripe opportunities for growth. Our service continues to improve and as it does, and as aggregate demand strengthens, thereby negatively impacting trucking availability, we anticipate a return to strong domestic intermodal conversion in tandem with pricing strategies that are sustainable.","As our business mix changes, we continue our focus on the bottom line by evaluating our network for opportunities to increase earnings per share. A good example of these strategic structuring efforts is our recently completed acquisition of the D&H South Line, streamlining operations in the Northeast and offering a more service competitive product.","Similarly, we recently announced the restructuring of our Triple Crown subsidiary which will reduce revenue beginning in the fourth quarter but is expected to be accretive to our bottom line next year and allows a more efficient use of capital.","Turning to the third quarter results on slide three, our revenue declined $310 million primarily due to a combined $342 million decrease in coal and fuel surcharge revenue. Focusing on our coal franchise, revenue declined by 23% due to a decrease in fuel surcharge revenue followed by lower export and utility coal volumes. Utility reductions were driven by materially lower natural gas prices that impacted the dispatch position of coal plants on our network. This, combined with stockpiles above target levels, led to a 10% decline in our utility market to 22 million tons, above our previous guidance of 20 million tons per quarter.","Export coal tonnage of 3.5 million tons was challenged by weak macroeconomic conditions, low benchmark prices and the strong U.S. dollar. While risk in this market exceeds that of utility, we continue to guide to 3 million tons per quarter through 2016. Our domestic intermodal volume declined 5% due to network service challenges, lower fuel prices and increased truck capacity.","Domestic intermodal pricing remains strong and despite short-term truck capacity increases and softer truck spot pricing, we maintain a long-term projection of continued pricing gains and conversions to rail due to the value of the intermodal product as service improves. Driver availability, hours of service and electronic logging devices have positively influenced pricing, leading shippers to lock in capacity for next year. Our international intermodal volume grew by 9% due to growth at both East and West Coast ports as well as freight shifting from the West to East Coast ports, taking advantage of our network reach and alignment with shipping partners.","Closing with our merchandise markets, the strong dollar and low commodity price environment negatively impacted steel, frac sand, crude oil and export grain. Conversely, strong consumer spending assisted with gains in automotive, ethanol, construction materials and plastics. Lastly, volumes of natural gas liquids improved due to increased fractionator activity on our network and domestic grain shipments grew due to regional crop opportunities.","Moving into the fourth quarter, we anticipate volume declines in our commodity and export markets. Sequentially, most of these markets will remain flat compared to the third quarter, although steel has the potential for further decline and export coal will likely be closer to our guidance of 3 million tons. These continued declines in commodity prices and the Triple Crown restructuring will lower fourth-quarter volumes compared to last year with the year-over-year rate of decline expected to be similar to that of the third quarter.","Next year, we will clear the negative comps in the utility franchise which was influenced by significantly higher natural gas prices and stockpile replenishments in 2014. We continue with our guidance of 20 million tons of utility coal per quarter. As stated earlier, the Triple Crown restructuring will allow Triple Crown to focus on its auto parts business with NS working with our shippers and channel partners to convert as much of their business as possible to the conventional intermodal network although the footprint of Triple Crown differs from our conventional network. As Triple Crown provides a door-to-door retail service, the restructure is expected to negatively impact intermodal revenue per unit although be modestly accretive to earnings next year. Reduced fuel surcharge revenue will continue to be a headwind in the fourth quarter although we will lap this comp after the first quarter of next year.","Long-term, we will continue to focus on market-based pricing gains while better aligning our fuel programs with expenses. Despite the headwinds mentioned, our customers understand the value of rail transportation and as service continues to improve, we have the opportunity for market-based price increases and to grow our franchise. We expect growth opportunities in our consumer base markets that include intermodal and automotive as well as housing and construction-related commodities, ethanol and basic chemicals.","We also expect the impact of inventory builds which will have a dampening effect in the fourth quarter will lessen by the first quarter of 2016. Norfolk Southern sits at both ends of the economic spectrum, production and consumption. This diversity has helped us during economic downturns and is a continuing strength of our franchise. Today, we are seeing growth particularly in automotive and the international side of intermodal. The strong dollar is a challenge as is macroeconomic weakness overseas which contributes to lower aggregate demand. Regardless, we are well positioned in multiple strategic markets for growth.","As we move forward through the fourth quarter and into 2016, we will continue to partner with our customers to pursue strategic solutions that capitalize on market opportunities that create efficiencies and improve network productivity, while generating growth beneficial to the bottom line.","Thank you for your attention and I will now turn the presentation over to Mark.","Mark D. Manion - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. This morning I will update everyone on our operation which continues to trend positively. Specifically, we've seen year-over-year as well as sequential improvements in our service composite, speed and terminal dwell. While we still have work to do, we are encouraged by these results. But first, let's take a look at our safety.","Our reportable injury ratio was 1.05 for the first nine months of 2015 as compared to 1.19 for the same period last year. The train incidents for the first three quarters of this year were 143 versus 154 over the same period last year. Grade crossing accidents through September 2015 were 255, down from 286 over the same period in 2014.","Turning to our service composite performance, we see services returning at a steady pace. We are optimistic we will continue to experience improvement as our resources are largely in place. With regard to manpower, we have a sufficient crew base. In the third quarter, we added about 200 T&E employees. We have modulated our hiring based on volume and we now expect our T&E count in the fourth quarter to be flat with the third quarter.","With regard to locomotives, we have a sufficient number of locomotives to handle our business and furthermore, our locomotive availability continues to improve due to improved velocity. Lastly, our operating plan in connection with our new yard expansion in Bellevue, Ohio is fully implemented and is benefiting us across the system.","Turning to the next slide, we see train speed and terminal dwell are improving as well. Our speed for the quarter improved 3% year-over-year and our dwell has improved 6%. These system improvements are important, and it's also important to note we have seen solid improvement on our Chicago to Harrisburg line. This line handles the highest volumes on our system with a heavy concentration of intermodal. Our third quarter premium intermodal speed for this route is nearly what it was in 2013, and recently that speed has actually exceeded 2013 levels.","In addition to the efficiencies we're seeing with our improving operation, we're continuing to make strategic reductions associated with our decrease in coal volumes. We have made manpower reductions at our Lamberts Point Coal Pier as well as in the Central Appalachian and Northern Appalachian region which encompass all of operations not just transportation.","Furthermore, we continue to make changes to some of our coal routes with the most recent affected lines highlighted on this map. We have also reduced capital spending on branch lines where we've seen lower coal mine production. These contractions to our employee counts and infrastructure have been a result of our continual efforts to match our level of investment to a changing marketplace.","With that, I will now turn it over to you, Marta.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Slide 2 summarizes our operating results for the third quarter. As Alan has already discussed, the 10% decrease in revenues was largely related to lower fuel surcharge and to lower coal volume. Operating expenses in total declined by $134 million or 7%.","Expenses benefited from significantly lower fuel prices but were unfavorably impacted by restructuring costs. The net result was an 18% reduction in income from railway operations and a 69.7 operating ratio for the quarter.","The next slide shows the major components of the $134 million or 7% decrease in expenses. As I just mentioned, fuel was the primary driver of the overall reduction, and favorability in the compensation and benefits category also contributed to the decline.","Before we get into the detail of the operating expenses, let's take a look at the effect of the restructuring costs on slide 4. The first column shows the Triple Crown related charges. As Alan described, our Triple Crown Services subsidiary will, beginning in mid-November, be refocused exclusively on its auto parts business. Therefore, the bulk of the road rail equipment used by Triple Crown will be surplus at that time. The $26 million shown as accelerated depreciation is the third-quarter charge for Triple Crown equipment.","Turning to the Roanoke closure costs, they totaled $10 million in the quarter and consisted primarily of moving and office space expenses, which are reflected in the materials and other and in the purchased services line item. These costs added $37 million to the quarter and impacted the bottom line by $23 million or $0.08 per share. Going forward, we expect these two items to total $45 million in the fourth quarter with Triple Crown restructuring costs of $36 million and Roanoke office closure costs of approximately $9 million.","Now let's take a look at the major expense line items. As shown on slide five, fuel expense decreased by $166 million or 43%, the majority of which was driven by lower fuel prices. Slide 6 details the $26 million or 4% decrease in compensation costs. Bonus and stock-based compensation expenses were lower by $51 million resulting from the decline in financial results.","We expect fourth-quarter incentive compensation will be about $20 million lower than last year. Pay rate and payroll tax increases, as we discussed in the second quarter earnings call, began to moderate after July 1 and they were up $17 million and $9 million respectively. And lastly, we continue to run with a somewhat higher level of training and that expense was up $6 million.","Next, materials and other cost decreased $3 million or 1%. Material usage, primarily associated with locomotive and freight cars, declined by $10 million. We also had lower derailment expenses. However, these items were partially offset by the aforementioned restructuring costs.","As shown on slide 8, depreciation expense increased by $39 million or 17% due largely to the effect of accelerated depreciation of Triple Crown assets and also as a result of our larger capital base. As Jim mentioned, we completed the acquisition of the D&H line during the quarter and this increased our capital base by $215 million.","Turning to slide 9, purchased services and rents were up $22 million or 5%, reflecting higher costs associated with equipment rent, engineering expenses and the Roanoke closure. As noted by Mark, velocity and terminal dwell have continued to improve, and we expect these expenses decline sequentially in the fourth quarter.","Other income reflected on slide 10 rose by $7 million or 22% aided by $19 million in higher gains from sales of property offset in part by decreased returns from corporate-owned life insurance and lower coal royalty.","Slide 11 depicts our income tax accruals and effective rate. The 37.6% third quarter rate is in line with our full-year guidance of 37.5%.","Wrapping up our financial overview on slide 12, net income decreased by $107 million or 19%, and earnings per share was down $0.30 or 17% inclusive of the $0.08 of restructuring cost.","Thank you and I'll now turn the program back to Jim.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Marta. As you've heard this morning, further softening in the commodities markets weighed on our third-quarter results and it has tempered our fourth-quarter outlook as well. We now expect fourth quarter volumes will decline versus last year at a rate similar to our third quarter results.","This year obviously has been a challenging one. We didn't deliver the kind of improvements you and we expect. But looking to 2016, we are confident that with a reasonably stable economy and our own intense focus on service, returns and growth, we are poised for better results.","Thank you for your attention, and we are now happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Thank you. Our first question is from Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Tom Kim - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning and thanks for your time here. Obviously this is an encouraging set of results and we're certainly pleased to see the improvements on the cost side. I wanted to ask just a first-off question with regard to some of your cautious comments around the nearer-term demand outlook. How do we reconcile that with some of the increased training costs and your head count expectations nearer-term?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Tom, let me answer that first. Obviously we have some short-term headwinds in terms of the trend in commodities and business conditions generally, offset by continuing strength in some of our consumer markets. But our strategy is designed to carry us through economic cycles because it focuses on fundamentals. First, service; excellent service will allow us to increase prices and reduce cost. And second, return on capital because we are a very capital intensive business and every dollar that we spend must have revenue and profit generation potential. And third, growth. We do want to grow our topline and see opportunities to do so even in a so-so economy. We'll do that first through price increases; second through volume growth, utilizing existing assets; and third and only as necessary, growth through capacity additions. So that in a nutshell is our strategy. We think that will carry us through changing business conditions.","Now let's talk about the short-term resource picture. As I mentioned, we view key resources, crews and locomotives as essentially in balance with demand as we see it today. With that said, we are going to be nimble with resources and if business conditions change so will our resource strategy. Now, Marta, why don't you talk a little bit about the specifics around head count trends and other efficiency-related spending?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","All right, sure. So Tom, we had earlier guided that we thought we would increase head count about 1,000 for the full year. But as Mark said, we're now up about 800 from the fourth quarter of last year to the third quarter of this year. As Mark said, we now do not think we're going to add that additional 200 for the end of the year so we think we're going to stay flat through this year. And looking into 2016 as Jim just described, we think that's the right level for the company.","Tom Kim - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And just on that point if I could ask maybe a bit of a longer-term question. As we've looked through your head count and overall productivity, we've seen volumes effectively peak around 2006 and volumes even against last year's levels are still below that prior peak. But your overall head count levels are still at the 2006 levels. And I guess I'm wondering is there something structurally that's changed in your book of business that requires more head count per carload or does this present perhaps an opportunity to improve productivity? And you kind of alluded to the fact that as velocity increases, you potentially have room to be actually driving productivity further. So if you could just maybe elaborate a little bit more about the longer-term outlook for us because as we think about your OR, we certainly think and hope that there is opportunity to continue to drive that down. But one of the areas I've been looking at is just on the labor productivity side and it looks like you have room there to improve. And I just wanted to get your perspective on how do I think about the longer-term opportunity there, carload to employee head count? Thank you.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Great line of questioning and we are absolutely focused on productivity and as the network velocity continues to increase, we will have opportunities to reduce head count relative to the volume trend. Now, Mark, why don't you comment on that?","Mark D. Manion - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I'd be glad to and we actually started modulating our hiring on the T&E side particularly back last summer. So we've been hiring more to attrition levels ever since mid-summer and anticipate that will continue to go on, again, based on \u2013 dependent on the business volumes. But as our velocity continues to increase, there are just great things that happen with that. And aside from the customer service side which is favorably impacted as well, but those velocity increases really help us on the cost side and it helps us reduce our employment, it helps us reduce our overall asset base.","We will have the advantage of picking up more locomotives as a result of that. Our expenses decrease as our asset turns increase. And another thing that we see is re-crews go down and in fact they have been going down. Even third quarter, they were down \u2013 re-crews were down 6% and we'll continue to see that trend. Our overtime was down on the T&E side, not overall, but I think we'll continue to see favorable trend on the overtime piece as well. So we'll see that in fourth quarter.","We will continue to see that going into next quarter and even things like our engineering department. As our fluidity improves, as our velocity improves, we can be more scheduled with our engineering department. They get more track time. They get out on the track when they need to be. They don't accumulate the overtime they otherwise would. So in short, improved velocity just drives a lot of good things when it comes to cost reduction.","Tom Kim - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I appreciate that detail. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your questions.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First, I was wondering if you could talk about the decline in domestic intermodal and particularly relative to your main competitor which saw a 15% increase in the business. So, what I was wondering is if you could quantify or help to frame any potential share losses there and whether you expect to fully recapture those volumes and over what period of time?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Alan, why don't you take Allison's question on that?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Allison, the story for our domestic intermodal franchise is one that I highlighted earlier. It's been fuel, it's been truck capacity and it's been a service product that is not conducive to shifts to rail. That's going to get fixed and we're already seeing improvements in our velocity in our intermodal and we're starting to see an uptick in our intermodal volumes. And on the domestic side, certainly on the international side, we've seen great strength this year with more volume through the East Coast and our alliance with our shipping partners who are adding more capacity from the Far East to the East Coast and we expect the same next year. So we feel very good about our intermodal franchise going forward both domestically and internationally.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And my follow-up question on coal, thinking about the RPU on an ex-fuel basis being up slightly year-over-year, could you talk about some of the dynamics there that pushed that to the positive side of the ledger? Was it mix, was it the lapping of rate cuts on the export side or a shift to fixed\/variable contracts?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure Allison. Actually we've experienced negative mix within our coal franchise as we had a 37% decline in export, which as you know tends to be longer haul which is effectively a proxy for RPU. So despite that we've gotten increases and it's \u2013 increases in our RPU. Although very slight, it is a positive and we're going to hold onto that. But it's a function of our long-term pricing strategy in the coal markets and we feel very good next year because we're not going to have that negative comp in coal with respect to the utility franchise that we did this year.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Barnes with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your questions.","John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. A follow-up question on the domestic intermodal side. In terms of the service that you're providing and I think I'm hearing you say that you're not in a position yet where you're offering a truck-like product. Is that harming you more on the length of haul? I mean, are you still very competitive on the longer stuff but it's putting pressure on the shorter length of haul where at higher diesel fuel rates you were becoming more competitive?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","John, let me comment on our domestic intermodal strategy briefly and then I'll let Alan address the specifics of your question. We certainly do want to grow our domestic intermodal business and we have a service product that allows us to do that today. Can we be even better and attract even more freight from the highway? Absolutely and that's our goal. Now with that said, our growth strategy in domestic intermodal is a combination of volume growth and pricing. Pricing is absolutely critical in that franchise as it is elsewhere. And so our strategy is to grow that business as with our other businesses through price increases, through volume growth using existing assets to the maximum extent possible and last, through increases in capacity but only where necessary. Alan, what about the specifics of John's question?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","John, to your question with respect to if there's a difference between length of haul and our ability to retain business or grow business through fuel, we have not seen that.","John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, all right, no worries. And in terms of network realignment, I guess just from the standpoint of you own more of your \u2013 I'm thinking more on the coal export side, you own more of your assets there, whether it's the coal loading facilities and things like that. If we are now looking at a more permanently impaired export market, how aggressive can you be on realigning the cost around the export side of the business? And are there assets to shed, things along those lines that maybe better align those resources with the current volumes and then maybe even a little bit longer outlook which again looks to be maybe a bit more impaired? Thank you.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","I'll get Mark to comment on some of the specific moves we've made in our coal franchise following up on his commentary. But let me just say we have fixed assets in our coal network as we do throughout our company and we are looking hard at which of those is underutilized and we will continue to do so. We have substantial fixed assets devoted to our coal franchise in the form of tracks and freight cars. One thing we can do and have done already is to begin working down the size of our coal car fleet and we can redeploy locomotives. So that's a fungible asset. This is a notoriously volatile market. We don't believe that we've seen the best days of export coal. We think that the commodity cycle eventually will turn and those assets will be fully deployed again. Mark, talk a little bit more about what we're doing in the coal fields.","Mark D. Manion - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, more current day, we are actually \u2013 we've furloughed or are in the process of furloughing about 150 people and that is across all the departments and operations including transportation, mechanical, engineering. We have, as I mentioned in the remarks, we've got lines that we have more recently either taken out of service or have pulled back on the investment for those lines. We continue to scrub Central App as well as other areas in our coal franchise. But let's also keep in mind that we've got areas in our coal business where we've had some nice activity going on and continue to have promise for the Illinois Basin coal. So it's a bit of a mixed bag but we will continue to scrub that Central App in order to ensure that we are reducing our cost commensurate with the level of activity out there.","John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks for your time.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead with your question.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thank you. I wanted to focus a little bit on intermodal. Clearly, you've admitted you needed to get the service levels back up but it seems like that's happening. So that should be a good thing for freight as we head into 2016. However, longer-term, how do you think about investments in that network profitability of that division as it takes over a larger percentage of the business hauled?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","It's good business, it's a growth opportunity and it has been the volume growth engine of the company for years and that's likely to continue given secular trends in trucking. With that said, we're going to be very judicious with our investments and make sure that they are revenue and profit maximizing which is one of the foundations of our strategy. That applies to the domestic intermodal business as it does to all other businesses we operate. We should talk a little bit about international intermodal. That's a real bright spot right now. So Alan, why don't you expand on that a little bit?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","So as we discussed, it's grown in the upper mid-single digits for the year. We anticipate a continued growth along that level in the near-term future as more volume matriculates over to the East Coast from the West Coast and folks with whom we've aligned are adding capacity into the East Coast and it allows us to build a lot of revenue density in our trains and so it makes for very efficient movement. And so it's \u2013 we're excited about that and the growth opportunities and the returns that that provides.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC","Is there any way to quantify how much of that freight that moved over to the East Coast is sticky and how much either went back or will go back after this year?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, some of it has definitely gone back. There is absolutely no doubt about that but still East Coast volumes are up. And as the Panama Canal widens, we're going to see even more larger ships hitting the East Coast which are going to need to make multiple ports of call to discharge their cargoes. And so that's going to have a benefit for the ports that we serve all up and down the East Coast.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC","Are we going to see more on dock rail at some of the ports do you think as that business comes in?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","At least one of the ports has announced that, an infrastructure plan for that.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. Gentlemen, thank you for your time.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning. I wanted to see if \u2013 Mark, I think in the past you have talked about productivity targets and I know with big change in volumes that it's an operating leverage effect. But what do you think the kind of productivity number is that you might achieve this year and how would you frame that opportunity for next year in terms of how you would define productivity? I think in the past you've said something around $100 million. So, I wonder if you could offer some thoughts on that topic?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","I'll take that one, Tom. We absolutely have productivity opportunities as we've been through this morning and as the network picks up speed, we will start to throw off a lot of productivity. And we're also working on a number of business process initiatives and capital utilization initiatives that should lead to productivity benefits. All of that should add up to a sizable offset to volumetric and inflationary pressure on our expenses particularly next year when operations are really humming.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Let's see, and then, in terms of coal, how do we think about the \u2013 I think you commented, Alan, that coal stockpiles are above target. I don't know if you could comment on maybe how far above target and whether that's a source of risk to your 20 million tons per quarter view that it's possible a couple quarters you run below that to get the stockpiles down and then you get back to that 20 million tons a quarter. But just some thoughts on coal related to stockpiles.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, that's a good question, Tom. We've actually seen stockpiles decrease in this quarter even though we exceeded our guidance by about 10%. So while stockpiles do have an impact, it so far has not negatively impacted our ability to hit our targets. Right now, Tom, we're estimating that stockpiles are about 15 days above target. I would say about five days in the South and about 25 days in the North.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your questions.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, thanks. Another one here on coal. It looks like the tons per car increased significantly in the third quarter up to about 112. Can you give us a sense what's driving that? Has this been the result of changes in the network or is this merely business mix because we haven't been at this level for a long time.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","We are always focused on tons per car because we \u2013 in the coal network, we are paid by tons. And so any time you can improve the revenue density on a coal train, it's very beneficial for us. One of the factors that impacted the improvement in tons per car immediately in the third quarter was a continued decline in export volume. Metallurgical volume to the ports typically has a lower tons per car than utility volume.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. I guess we should be thinking about something around these levels looking forward given some of the challenges that are impacting the export book of business?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","To the extent that mix stays the same, yes. To the extent that we're continuing to work with our producers to get the optimum load level on the number of cars per train, then we'll improve the profitability of the individual trains.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, that's really helpful. I guess turning it over back to intermodal as well as the pricing, we've been hearing a lot about truck capacity having loosened up which has negatively impacted the overall spot market from a pricing perspective. Obviously with Norfolk, we are seeing better service across the network with the velocity having ticked up here as well as the service composite improved, but how confident are you that we can see kind of further improvement in pricing or just maintaining the level of pricing looking out to next year given a tough volume environment outside of the coal franchise as well as some weaker truck pricing that we're seeing in the marketplace?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Can you clarify? Are you asking about pricing in intermodal or overall?","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just overall pricing just given what we're seeing in the trucking marketplace with capacity having loosened up, somewhat offset by service improvement. How are you guys thinking about the ability to maintain current pricing or potentially improve it as we look forward?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","We feel good about it and we feel good about what we've accomplished so far, recognizing we have room to grow. Our RPU ex-fuel has grown each quarter of this year, and our customers are taking a long-term view of this and they are recognizing the long-term value of rail transportation, and frankly, when service is back to where we want it to be, and we're making great strides to get there, then intermodal is a very easy sell even with a tightening between the truck market and intermodal pricing.","And lastly, I'll add that we're taking a long-term view of this. And as Jim talked about, we're going to grow via price and we're going to grow via utilizing existing capacity. And any additional investment that would require is going to have to generate an acceptable level of return.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Service led price increases are a key component of our strategy, and that applies to our domestic intermodal segment as well as all other segments of our business.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Rob, as you know, spot pricing has gone down in the trucking industry but contract pricing is still up year-over-year. Now it's moderated but it's still up because shippers are concerned about long-term truck capacity. So that certainly plays into the thesis for the value of rail transportation.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Appreciate the thoughts.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Matt Troy with Nomura Securities. Please proceed with your questions.","Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks and good morning, everybody. I just wanted to ask about coal, specifically related to your 20 million ton per quarter run rate going forward guidance. It would imply something flattish with what you saw in 2015, a little bit more optimistic than the other railroads.","Just wondering if you could help us maybe from a bottoms-up perspective how you get there, how much of that might be under contract, because I am contrasting it with some pretty dire commentary from CONSOL and Peabody and other coal companies yesterday and earlier in the week about the outlook for domestic coal. So I'm just wondering, be it mix shift, be it certain contracts you've secured, how you're confident that the coal volumes at 20 million tons per quarter will be flattish in 2016. Some help there would be great.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. So we've \u2013 if you think about the current natural gas environment, most of the conversions from coal to gas have already occurred \u2013 would have already occurred. So natural gas I know right now is close to $2 per million BTU, but the futures curve for next year is about $2.65 on average, which is pretty similar to where we were in 2012. So we can model our volumes at the plants and the units that we serve versus 2012.","We also know that most of the near-term environmental headwinds associated with MATS, we've already been impacted by that and so that's not going to be a headwind going forward. Now longer term, the clean coal plant will potentially have an impact, and we are working with our customers to try to completely understand that and run scenarios within our own planning horizon. But through 2016, based on our conversations with our customers and modeling how their plants performed in 2012, we feel good about our volumes of 20 million tons per quarter.","Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Understood. I guess my follow-up would be just if you could provide \u2013 Triple Crown has had an interesting evolution under the Norfolk umbrella. If you could just refresh us in terms of the rationale for the restructuring, the focus on auto parts and your commentary was interesting on how it would be mildly accretive next year. Can you just help us get from where the thought process was on Triple Crown say a year or two ago to why this restructuring makes sense and tactically what's going to drive that accretion or efficiency or productivity relative to those assets? Thanks.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","The strategy involves focusing Triple Crown on what Triple Crown does best, and that's transport auto parts and re-channeling with other supply chain partners non-auto parts business into the conventional intermodal network where those customers and that volume can enjoy maximum efficiencies.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Matt, you'll recall Triple Crown was originally an auto parts network.","Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Right. So this is just after a little bit of scope creep, it's just doubling down on the core competency of the business...","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","It's going to improve our capital utilization by re-channeling as much of the other business, the freight all kinds, into our existing intermodal network where we already have the capacity.","Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Understood. Thank you for the time.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your questions.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Wanted to \u2013 I think in the past you have recently talked about potentially volume increases in 2016. I guess I just wanted to get a sense in light of what your view is on the fourth quarter and some of the challenges shorter-term in the business, how should we think about that? Is your thinking changing at all? Obviously you've given us the view on coal. I just want to get a sense the rest of the business how you think about it for 2016 as the setup is right now?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Absolutely. We still feel very good about 2016. Our volumes year-to-date are down 1.2% in an environment where we've had 20% declines in our utility coal franchise, 35% declines in our export coal franchise and we haven't been able to attract highway conversions to our intermodal network. We're going to clear all of that next year. There is some underlying growth in international intermodal. We've talked about the automotive franchise is doing very well for us. Consumer goods are doing well. So once we clear some of these very visible comps or headwinds into next year, then you are going to see, we are all going to see the benefits of the underlying growth in some of these other markets.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, that's helpful. As a follow-up, just switching to the pricing side, you mentioned earlier the focus on fuel surcharge adjustments and having to work through the book of business as it comes up for renewal. If you could just give us an update on how that process has been playing out, receptivity of customers, which I'm guessing is never great to a rate increase and potentially a surcharge in there. But I want to get a sense what are the puts and takes and do you have to give it all in pricing in order to get the fuel surcharge and how you prioritize those?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Chris, you bring up a great point. We prioritize price first and we always will. So we are not going to give up on price just to shift to another fuel surcharge program. Over time we're going to be working with our customers to align our fuel surcharge program more closely with expenses and also importantly take the volatility out of it. It's a lot more difficult to do in this environment where the WTI-based fuel surcharge, which is on about 50% of our business, is out of the money.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And the progress to that, it's sort of a multi-year effort is my guess?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Correct, and it would certainly be benefited as oil prices increase.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","All right. Fair enough. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Yep.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, thanks. Morning, guys.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Scott.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Just first thing real quick, Marta or Alan, did you guys give like a composite mix number on the quarter?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Scott, are you referring to the trend in mix in overall RPU?","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Yes.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Or are \u2013 okay, so what is the change attributable to mix in total RPU?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","It's a slight negative overall.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Just a slight \u2013 and that's because the export coal went down a little bit, so slight negative. It's almost flat.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you. In terms of coal again, there was a pretty nice sequential increase in coal yields. Can you help us explain that, Alan? I'm not sure if there's any liquidated damages in there or if that's mix and then just how to think about that going forward on a sequential basis, the coal yields?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","We \u2013 certainly we've had negative mix associated with export, so that has been an impact. We've had more utility South volume which tends to be a longer haul for us and so that has propped up the utility yield.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","And with your comments about stockpiles in the South being closer to target than the North, would you expect that mix to Southern utilities to continue?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","We feel good about our Southern utility franchise going forward. The North is sitting frankly right on the Marcellus natural gas play, so spot natural gas prices are very low, even below the Henry Hub published numbers. So the opportunity exists for a greater percentage of new South than new North going forward than we've had in the past.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then just last thing, I want to go back to the head count question from earlier. So we have seen all the other rails implement some pretty meaningful head count reductions and your head count was up sequentially. I certainly understand your service metrics weren't and didn't improve as quickly as some of the others. But now that the service is improving, I guess I'm just not sure why you don't have an opportunity to take out a good amount of head count like we've seen all the other rails do as their services caught up.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Well, as Mark mentioned, we have a small opportunity \u2013 maybe the size you're talking about, a big opportunity, we had a small opportunity and we took it incrementally. In the fourth quarter, we think we are going to be flat. And really, Scott, what we're looking at in 2016 in terms of productivity is not so much because as we said we've guided towards level head count next year, so it's not so much the head count but it's the cost of those individuals. So he pointed to the fact that we have costs now such as re-crews and overtime, things like that, lack of track time because of the system velocity.","So it's the price per hour if you will that we think is where we're going to get the most productivity next year. As we've said a couple of times, we believe absent a significant decline in volume which we do not foresee now, that we think that the head count level where we're at now in the third quarter is a good run rate for 2016.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","And, Marta, you think that you can see savings on a per employee basis even with higher incentive comp next year?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Yeah. Well, higher incentive comp, I'm looking at separately. So this year's incentive comp is down. Assuming financial results are better next year, that will be up. So absent the things that are stand-alone like incentive comp and pension and post-retirement, that sort of thing, the actual cash cost to the employees per person we think will go down next year.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Alex Vecchio with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.","Alexander Vecchio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, there. Thanks for the time. I hate to beat a dead horse but just back to the resource topic, specifically for the fourth quarter you guys are expecting total volumes to be down about 3%, in line with the third quarter which would imply sequentially about down 4% yet you are not expecting to reduce the head count. Can you just speak a little bit more specifically to the fourth quarter itself and why the carloads are going to come down but the head count you don't expect to?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Listen, we're going to be nimble with our resource strategy and I said that earlier. And if we see volumes deteriorate beyond where we think they are headed, then we certainly will begin addressing the labor side of the resource equation. But we're also focused on maintaining and improving service and that requires a certain level of employment. Moreover, we think that we came into this a little bit leaner than others and therefore we have a little bit less to shift.","Alexander Vecchio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Alex, I'll also add that there is always a sequential fourth quarter decline in volume associated with holidays. So while that doesn't impact the year-over-year comps, you are preparing a sequential and so that does have an impact.","Alexander Vecchio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And, Jim, back to the service levels, I think a few quarters ago you were talking about expecting them to get back to \"normal\" by the end of the year and they certainly have shown improvement recently here. But it looks a little bit still a ways away from the 2012, 2013 levels in terms of the metrics we see on the train speed and dwell. Can you maybe talk to \u2013 do you still expect the service to get to the normalized levels by the end of this year or maybe it might take a little bit longer into next year at this point?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","You're right. We haven't made the kind of progress we said we would make on service as measured by network velocity and dwell, the metrics you see or internally. But we have made substantial progress and we are in a lot better condition now than we were a year ago. Using our internal metrics, our composite metric is more than 10 percentage points above where it was last year at this time and trending well versus a downward trend last year. So we feel very good about where we are in terms of our service and our intermodal premium trains are running extremely well. The network is in overall much better shape. We still have a ways to go and we will continue to push on that composite metric and get velocity up too. So that's our strategy. It's taking a little bit longer for us to get there than we had thought but we are well on our way.","Alexander Vecchio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That makes sense. And just lastly a housekeeping question here for Marta. I think you had mentioned earlier in the call you expected purchased services and rent expense to be down sequentially in the fourth quarter. I was wondering maybe if you could maybe give us a little bit more quantification of how much you expect that bucket to be down sequentially?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Well, we don't give guidance on specific dollar amounts but what I will say is we had a little \u2013 two things mentioned there is we had some service related costs in purchased services because we didn't quite get the velocity we had hoped for the quarter. So we had that in purchased services and in equipment rent to the tune probably of about $6 million, $5 million or $6 million in addition to the service related costs we had in compensation and benefits. And the other item is after the November 15 or November 18 Triple Crown changeover, the Triple Crown dray costs are in that line item. So they will, as the business transitions over to intermodal, the dray part costs will be in purchased services.","Alexander Vecchio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you for the time.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your questions.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Good morning. I know it's been a long call. Jim, congrats on the Chairmanship and Mark, good luck in your upcoming retirement. Just maybe some clarification on a couple of coal comments. Alan, you talked about clearing the deck. I just wanted to clarify to your answer before, do you have any more MATS or CSAPR closings that are mandated in 2016? And then is the 3 million tons run rate what you are looking for on the export side? Is that \u2013 I know you kept mentioning the 20 million tons on the domestic. Are you looking at the 3 million tons to hold through 2016 on the export side?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Ken, we've got about one or two plants, smaller plants that will be impacted by MATS so it's not going to have that much of material impact on what we're doing in our coal franchise next year. On the export side, yes, we are continuing to guide to 3 million tons a quarter, although I'll tell you that has more risk associated with it than utility guidance. And we're, as I know you are, we're watching the worldwide indices and the spot market for Queensland (1:02:23) coking coal is now down in the low $80s per metric ton.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. So even with the prices which doesn't really make sense to ship, you are still \u2013 thoughts are that it kind of holds at these levels? Just are there contracts that lock that in? I just want to get some idea of what level of confidence you have in that or is that just an aggressive or conservative view?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","To which are you speaking?","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","To the 3 million ton outlook on the export side?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think that has downside risk to it.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then, lastly, Jim, just stepping back and there have been a lot of questions on employee and head count and efficiency. Your last sentence there, you kind of noted that you came into this a bit leaner than others in the downturn. Maybe just get your thoughts internally on the operating ratio at 69.7, finally moving below 70 but now the industry has moved far ahead, your peers are now over 500 basis points better in the third quarter. You now have three carriers at or below 60. Do you step back and kind of think about maybe something needs to be overhauled or completely changed in the way you've been operating to adjust that operating ratio? Just as the peers are moving, it looks like farther away on that metric, just what do you think needs to be done?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think we're going to make a lot of progress on the operating ratio and we have the ability to lower the operating ratio significantly and we're confident that we can do that. Do I think we're going to post a 53 operating ratio next year? Probably not. Hats off to those who are at that point already. But with that said, we have a lot of progress that we can make on our operating ratio. We are keenly aware of where we stand in the peer comparisons and we are determined to improve our performance both in terms of a lower operating ratio and higher earnings.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. So you don't step back as now in the Chairman\/CEO role and say wow, we need to either gut programs or overhaul something? I mean I see the stuff on Triple Crown but there's nothing that you see as needs to be overhauled to really make fundamental changes to get that lower?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Nothing is off the table and we are having far-ranging strategic discussions inside the company right now. So we could certainly entertain different approaches to sizing our asset base relative to our revenue and income generation potential. That's a strategy that takes a while to deploy and deserves careful consideration because any strategy that starts hiving off significant portions of the asset base entails the risk of revenue loss. So we need to be very thoughtful about that but certainly we are open internally and talking about different ways to run this company and are determined as I said to reduce the operating ratio and grow our profits.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Is there a certain level of OR if the industry approaches that you fear more regulatory insight or overhang?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think the \u2013 look, the industry's view and I think it's the right view, is we need to generate substantial profits and returns in order to justify reinvestment. We are a very capital intensive business. We have major reinvestment needs and the only way that's going to happen is if we generate adequate returns. So that's our focus. I think it's a compelling argument in the regulatory arena. Don't cap our returns otherwise you will see reinvestment decline and I don't think anybody wants that.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Jim, Appreciate the time and insight. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks and good morning. I wanted to start maybe following up on that last question. I wanted to ask about CapEx. It sounds like there are several areas where you are improving capital efficiency. So with that in mind, how do you expect your CapEx to trend next year, is there an opportunity on an absolute dollar basis for CapEx to be down in 2016?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Absolutely. Now bear in mind that CapEx in 2015 includes the D&H acquisition at or around $200 million. So barring a similar transaction next year, that would come off CapEx and we do believe we have room to bring CapEx down beyond even that component. So yes, look for somewhat lower capital spending next year from us.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Any initial kind of order of magnitude that you are thinking about or is it still too early?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'll say this, it is early and we haven't completed our capital budget for 2016 yet. But in my view the kinds of capital spending that we've been putting up relative to revenue or cash flow is not something we want to continue to do and we do see a need to bring CapEx down relative to sales and relative to cash flow. And that's our plan starting next year.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Okay, great. And maybe as my second one, I wanted to ask another one on pricing. So as we look into 2016, do you think the magnitude of core price increases will look similar to what you've experienced this year or with uncertainty in the industrial economy, do you see downside risk to the current pricing environment?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Price increases are a key component of our strategy. We absolutely intend to increase our pricing commensurate with the value of the product that we are offering in the marketplace. So there will be no letup in terms of our emphasis on price increases as a driver of revenue and profit growth.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. I'll leave it at that. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.","Brandon Robert Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Well, good morning, everyone. I know it's been a very long call, so I'm just going to keep it to one. But, Jim, it's kind of along the lines of what Ken was just discussing with you here. I mean, I know you're talking about OR improvement but it just feels like maybe your franchise is a little bit more levered to higher commodity prices. I mean, previously you booked some profits in your fuel revenue which have obviously gone away.","You've historically made a lot of money in the coal markets. I mean, coal has gone from 30% of your revenue now down to 17%. And I know you think that things are going to be stable but natural gas prices are even lower this year. So how do we just put all this together? I mean, if natural gas stays here, if we don't get a rebound in fuel prices, how do you aggressively attack the OR with some of those headwinds?","And speaking to the CapEx side or even the asset side or restructuring, why not get more aggressive on restructuring the coal network? I mean, again, it is down significantly from where it was even three years or four years ago.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Well, you're right. We're a commodities hauler. So, you heard Alan say 50% of our loads are commodities based and so it definitely is more challenging in this sort of commodities environment. But that doesn't mean we don't have any opportunities. We are going to continue to push on revenue growth as Alan went through.","Fortunately, we have a pretty diversified franchise levered to commodities as it is. We still have other opportunities to grow. We're going to push on those. We're going to be very judicious with our spending. We're going to watch our capital very, very carefully and focus on again service improvements, return on capital and good growth.","Brandon Robert Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your questions.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning and thanks for making some time here at the end. I know it's been a pretty long call. So my question is basically just on the coal network rationalization. If you can just give a little bit more context of \u2013 obviously it's been going on for 18 months or so. 300 miles have been taken out of service or restricted.","Can you just give us a sense of how much of the network has been analyzed at this point? You mentioned the labor savings obviously taking some assets, but you're still abandoning them. So I'm assuming you're going to have to have some maintenance expense with that.","So, if you can try to quantify that for us, that would be helpful and also how you approach that in general? Is this a proactive type of analysis where you get out ahead of volume cuts or you just take it as the mines start to slow down?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","It is a proactive approach. And I would characterize what we have done as a good start. There are maybe other opportunities as well. We are very actively analyzing all opportunities to rationalize our asset base, particularly in the coal network. And there may be other rationalization opportunities ahead.","But by the same token, we do want to retain the ability to handle coal volume which we think we will garner in the future. So we're not throwing in the towel on our coal business. We are going to continue to be a coal hauler now and in the future, and we want to make sure we have the assets on hand to do that.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And just a quick follow-up. Is there any sense you can give us in terms of how much the network has been looked at, at this point in time and any savings rule of thumb per mile taken out that you're able to realize?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","We've focused up to this point on the Central App network in particular, as Mark went through. The savings will be meaningful, and we'll see those both in terms of expense savings and capital avoidance.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for your time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your questions.","Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. Real quick on the Triple Crown transition, can you give an update on the transition of the non-auto business? I know that we're coming up toward the November 15 service cut first.","And then second, what was the logic in keeping the auto parts business intact?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'll take the last part of that because that goes to the strategic rationale for the transaction. I'll let Alan talk about what's happening in terms of the re-channeling. Triple Crown started out as an auto parts hauler and that is where they really excel. And the technology that we will continue to deploy in that service works really, really well in the lanes where they will continue to haul the auto parts. So that's their forte, and we made the decision to keep them going in that area while looking to rechannel the other freight. Alan?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","We are working with our channel partners. I'll reiterate what I said before because I don't want expectations to get too high, is that almost on purpose the Triple Crown network did not overlay the conventional network. So it doesn't necessarily operate in the same lanes. So it's going to be difficult to matriculate a bunch of the business over to our conventional network, but it's still accretive to earnings and it still represents an improvement in capital utilization.","Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Appreciate the time.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your questions. Mr. Kauffman your line is open for questions.","Jeffrey Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Sorry about that. Hey, guys. Congratulations in a tough environment. Most of my questions have been answered, but let me come back to Marta on capital spend and free cash. I think it was you, Jim, that said you could see CapEx lower next year. You want to get back to a more normalized spend. Including D&H, kind of what are we looking at in terms of CapEx this year and how do you think about CapEx say over a two-year, three-year period longer-term? Where do you think it should be?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","I'd like to respond to your free cash flow point first, and I'll let Marta talk about the trend in capital spending. Our free cash flow has been somewhat subdued this year, and we're going to turn that around next year as well. The formula for that obviously involves higher net income, bonus depreciation if that occurs. It's the absence of the D&H transaction affecting capital expenditures and it's a somewhat lower non-D&H related CapEx. So all of that gives you much more robust free cash flow we believe next year.","Jeffrey Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay, Marta?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Yes. Jeff, so with regard to our capital program, at the beginning of the year we announced a $2.4 billion capital program. When the volumes didn't come in exactly with what we had been forecasting, we lowered it by about 5% or $130 million. And then \u2013 and of course this year we have the $215 million that Jim described. So going forward you should think about levels more like the original $2.4 billion minus the $130 million, and as Jim said, we think the absolute number in 2016 will be lower than that normalized level this year.","Jeffrey Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","All right. And just to follow up on that, you have increased the share buyback this year. With the stock down at these levels, is there a better use of free cash after capital spending than shares right now?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","We certainly have deployed both borrowing capacity, cash on hand, and free cash flow for share buybacks this year, and we see good value in our shares. We'll continue to use excess free cash flow over and above our dividend and available borrowing capacity for that purpose in the future.","Jeffrey Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","All right. Well, congratulations, guys. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead with your questions.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. And thanks for making time here. Just kind of thinking broad brush here with the headwinds that might be with the Triple Crown business migrating off and obviously the export coal decline next year, would you expect volume overall to be positive or negative coming into 2016 off of 2015?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, David, it's \u2013 we still have the potential for growth next year. I think it's going to be more targeted towards the second half of the year.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So, more flattish, maybe up a little?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","In aggregate. And then, I guess, Marta, as a question for you, in terms of that lower rate of volume growth next year, do you think that lack of volume driven productivity may offset some of your ability to recover the efficiency-led costs or the inefficiency added costs of the last couple quarters and some of the things around Triple Crown?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Well, we'll definitely be pushing on efficiency next year. And Triple Crown is going to be one of the reasons how. As Alan said, those \u2013 the moves that move on the intermodal network should be more efficient than the shorter road rail trains we were running some of this year.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I mean, it just seems like the operating income decline relative to the 3% decline in RTMs is pretty significant from a volume leverage standpoint, which would seem to indicate that if you've got a flatter volume year next year it may be tougher to get some of that leverage to fall through or some of those efficiency savings to fall through. Am I thinking about that right or is there \u2013 or do you think there is going to be a strong prospect for organic earnings growth in a flat volume year?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Well, one thing to remember for next year is this year thus far we've had, all three quarters so far this year we've had service-related expenses and some weather-related expenses in the first quarter, but they cumulatively total about $82 million. So, year-over-year, we don't expect those to recur in 2016. So that will begin our productivity improvements and we expect to increase on that.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your questions.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning and thank you for your time. My first question relates to coal royalties. We've seen them contribute about $0.04 this quarter. When are they up for renewal and please remind us whether they relate mostly to domestic utility coal or other areas as well? Thank you.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","It varies by contract with respect to the duration, but much of our coal royalties is associated with metallurgical coal.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","I'm sorry?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Much of our coal royalties is associated with metallurgical coal.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Metallurgical, okay. All right. And then my second question comes back to fuel surcharges versus coal price. You've commented on this call and recent other calls that your customers have been unwilling to give up fuel savings without a value exchange in terms of core price, and on your end you said you are unwilling to do that.","So, is it best for us to model core price increases offset by some negative mix and then leave surcharges unchanged into 2017 as the forward curve suggests? Thank you.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Model \u2013 can you say that point about \u2013 did you mention 2017?","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Yes, in the sense that on the current forward curves your surcharge programs are out of the money for some years out. And so, if right now that change is not occurring and you're saying you are needing fuel prices to go higher for that to happen, should we assume that there is no change on the fuel surcharge and just model core price increases?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay, I get your point. Yeah, it will be easier to accomplish this as or if WTI prices go up but it also gives us the opportunity to push price.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And your feedback from customers so far, can you tell us a little bit about that?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Which?","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","What your customers...","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Can you help me understand, Cleo...?","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Yes. It's about how discussions are going in terms of getting core price because in my understanding that conversation is still tough as you are trying to get core but they don't want to give up the fuel. So how is that all netting out?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","That's a good point. Negotiations with customers with respect to price are always tough but they do recognize the long-term value of rail transportation. There is a pause right now in demand in some commodity markets.","Jim talked about how 50% of our revenues are tied to commodity or foreign exchange. That's a short-term pause. Inventory drawdowns we believe will be complete by the end of this year and shippers are trying to line up capacity for 2016 and 2017 which is why you see in the trucking market spot prices declining but contract prices still moving up although moderating.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And is it true that at this time of year you are already starting to discuss the book for intermodal for next year? How is that going given your improvement in service in terms of setting up prices for next year? Thank you very much for your time.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","In terms of filling up what, Cleo?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","The book.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","The book...","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","In terms of...","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Our intermodal contracts aren't necessarily at the end of the year so we always have a mix of contracts, whether it's commodity or customer base, that are up throughout the year. And so certainly we are discussing contracts for the remainder of this year and next year and we are pushing price and the long-term value of rail transportation.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. Appreciate your time.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","And Cleo, if I could mention one more thing on the fuel surcharge revenue you asked about for modeling for next year, don't forget that in the first quarter of this year we still had a somewhat elevated level because the month of January benefited from the lag when oil prices were higher.","So each quarter of this year you've seen declining absolute numbers of fuel surcharge revenue. We expect that to continue and have declining fuel surcharge revenue in the fourth quarter. So I just wanted to put that out there for when you're modeling 2016.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you, Marta.","Operator","Thank you.

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Katie Cook, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. Ms. Cook, you may now begin.","Katie U. Cook - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Kristine, and good morning. Before we begin today's call, I would like to mention a few items. First, the slides of the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors section. Additionally, transcripts and downloads of today's call will be posted on our website.","Please be advised that during this call, we may make certain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially from those projected. Please refer to our Annual and Quarterly Reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important.","Additionally, keep in mind that all references to reported results excluding certain adjustments, that is non-GAAP numbers, have been reconciled on our website in the Investors section.","Now, it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern, Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's fourth quarter of 2015 earnings conference call. With me today are our Chief Marketing Officer, Alan Shaw; our Senior Vice President Operations, Mike Wheeler; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart. Mark Manion is also with us for his last analyst call after a very successful career. Mark has been instrumental in helping cultivate the best employees in the industry. He has also been at the forefront of promoting safety programs, as a critical component of a well run business. Mark, thank you for your devoted service.","With Mike Wheeler's assumption of the Chief Operating Officer role on February 1, our senior leadership transition will be complete. Since last June, when I took the reins as CEO, my team and I have been single-mindedly focused on shareholder value. We have responded to a dynamic marketplace and changes in the economic landscape by driving change, while building on Norfolk Southern's strengths.","In conjunction with our leadership transition, we have already completed many key initiatives, while simultaneously launching a new five-year plan, centered on disciplined cost control and profitability to produce sustainable returns for shareholders. I'm eager to share details regarding our team's plan, but first, I want to briefly address the fourth quarter and full year results.","2015 was marked by weak commodity markets and the strong dollar. That had an adverse impact on Norfolk Southern and the railroad industry as a whole. Norfolk Southern earnings for the fourth quarter were $1.20 per share, which was 27% lower than last year's $1.64 per share. Earnings for the full year were $5.10 per share, which was 20% lower than last year's record of $6.39. Alan, Mike and Marta will go into more detail on this shortly.","It is against this challenging macroeconomic backdrop that our team has aggressively executed on a number of key initiatives to build a strong foundation for sustainable shareholder value creation. The core of our strategy is this, maintain a high level of service to promote operational efficiency and growth, while rightsizing resources to reflect the changing nature of our top line.","Here are just a few of the things my team and I have already done to further this strategy. First, we return service to previous high levels, supporting cost control, asset utilization and growth.","Second, we took action on G&A, closing and putting up for sale our office building in Roanoke, Virginia, while consolidating or relocating approximately 500 back-office jobs. We also streamlined senior management, eliminating three senior management positions.","Third, we restructured an underperforming subsidiary, Triple Crown to sharpen our intermodal strategy and boost profit.","Fourth, we completed the acquisition of the Delaware & Hudson South, giving us full operational control of an important network segment in the Northeast. The transaction has been well received by our customers.","Fifth, we cut capital spending by $100 million last year to adapt to the shifting economic environment, and we are committed to reducing it further if necessary. And sixth, reacting to changes in our coal business, we completed an initial round of line rationalizations in the coal fields, the closure of a major coal terminal and the consolidation of two operating divisions in West Virginia and Virginia.","Now let's turn next to the elements of our strategic plan beginning on slide five. This plan begun on June 1, 2015 when I became CEO and announced on December 4, is the result of a comprehensive evaluation of our business model, in particular our cost structure and top line growth potential. The plan is built on disciplined cost control and asset utilization. It is also designed to generate over time revenue growth through pricing and increased volume in service-sensitive markets where we have made significant investments and having well established market presence.","The plan is dynamic allowing us to evolve as required given an ever-changing world. Overall, we expect to achieve annual productivity savings of more than $650 million by 2020, growing from an initial $130 million in 2016, by improving the consistency and reliability of our service and running a faster, more efficient railroad.","Turning to our revenue plan on slide seven. Well, our expectations are modest for 2016. Revenue growth from pricing and volume increases is one component of our strategic plan. We have been deliberate in our analysis, developing a detailed bottom up roadmap to growth over the next five years. The plan is conservative and flexible in nature and gives us the ability to adjust to changes in the economy.","Slide eight shows that over the five-year period, we expect revenue per unit to grow approximately 2.5% on a compound annual basis through 2020, supported by pricing levels exceeding CPI. Consistent with our past experience, volume will grow relatively in line with GDP as growth in intermodal and other consumer-oriented products offsets coal headwinds.","Turning to slide nine, I will now detail our expert expectations for each major revenue group. We expect coal volume to decline in 2016 and then stabilize.","Overall our core forecast is more conservative than estimates from the Department of Energy and other independent experts. We believe growth in our merchandise lines of business will attract the economy overall, increasing generally in line with GDP. And we are calling for intermodal volume to increase at a rate better than GDP, with compound annual growth of about 4.5%. This will be driven primarily by tighter truck capacity and improved domestic service levels.","It will also reflect our close alignment with international steamship lines that are adding capacity in Norfolk Southern-served markets as they shift from West Coast to East Coast ports.","Now turning to our expense reduction and cost control plan. As you see, on slide 11, our strategy is to provide industry leading service to drive the operating ratio lower. We are committed to achieving a sub-65% OR by 2020, but we won't stop there.","Once we achieve this initial goal, we intend to take our operating ratio even lower by focusing relentlessly on four things: head count, locomotive productivity, fuel efficiency and our network footprint, all while supporting quality service for our customers.","Moving to slide 12, the current backdrop of low commodity prices and a strong U.S. dollar has created significant headwinds that affected 2015 results across our industry. Our plan will help offset some of these headwinds, actively managing to market dynamics, both downside and upside, in a timely manner.","Right now, given current market dynamics, we are aggressively bringing down over time, head count and our locomotive fleet size. We are also pushing on fuel efficiency, closing or scaling back operations in yards and terminals and rationalizing secondary lines. All of this is being done, so that we can achieve target levels of profitability while maintaining strong service, and the potential for future growth. Even given challenging future market conditions, we believe we can achieve a sub-65% operating ratio by 2020.","We have the right team and the right plan to address the current headwinds and deliver superior value as we move through 2016 and beyond.","With our improved service, we have achieved a faster railroad, specifically year-over-year we achieved a 17% improvement in train speed, and a 21% improvement in terminal dwell. These improvements across our network will lower costs while enhancing our service offering and the value of our product. A faster railroad is, simply put, a more profitable railroad.","Turning to slide 14, our plan is designed to optimize resources and accelerate growth through a variety of disciplined expense control initiatives in compensation and benefits, purchase services and rents, materials and fuel. We expect to achieve annual expense savings over $650 million by 2020, growing from an initial $130 million in 2016.","Starting with compensation and benefits, service improvements, traffic shifts, network rationalizations and cutbacks in yards and terminals will enable Norfolk Southern to reduce head count in 2016 and beyond, building on initiatives we began in 2015 to right size the network. We expect this to result in annual productivity savings of $420 million by 2020.","Now to purchased services and rents. We are projecting annual savings of $70 million by 2020 through reduced equipment rental and lease costs, lower payments for third-party switching, leveraging the recent expansion of Moorman Yard in Bellevue, Ohio and lower trackage rights and haulage payments.","As you can see on slide 15, we expect materials to deliver approximately $80 million in annual savings by 2020 through more productive locomotive maintenance programs and replacement of older, less reliable locomotives. And finally Norfolk Southern plans to cut fuel expenses by approximately $80 million per year by 2020 through rationalization of our locomotive fleet and full implementation of fuel management technology.","In conclusion on slide 16, we believe we have the right strategic plan to streamline operations, accelerate pricing and growth, and enhance shareholder value. The plan leverages our core competency in providing fast efficient service, while improving network efficiency and consolidating operations. Importantly, through disciplined cost control, we believe we can achieve the expense reduction goals outlined in this plan and even more. To be clear, if market conditions worsen more than anticipated, our plan has flexibility built into it so that we can achieve additional cost savings.","We are also committed to a capital allocation strategy that returns significant capital to shareholders. Over the past 10 years, Norfolk Southern distributed nearly $15 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends that increased steadily at a 17% compound annual rate. Our plan targets a dividend payout ratio of 33% over the longer term and share repurchases using free cash flow and borrowing capacity.","I'll now turn the program over to Alan, Mike and Marta, who are just as committed as I am to successfully executing our plan. They will provide more details on our 2015 results and our 2016 outlook and I will then return with some closing comments before taking your questions. Alan?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Jim. Good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us today. I would like to begin by expressing our commitment to the growth plan, Jim just reviewed. It is a multi-dimensional sustainable plan with a focus on a differentiated service product that the market values, driving pricing and volume growth while improving shareholder return.","Moving to slide two. I'll provide some perspective on our 2015 top line performance. Annual revenue of $10.5 billion declined 10% compared to 2014, with fuel surcharges and coal accounting for the decrease. Fuel losses of $852 million were the result of decreased oil prices. This negative comp will sharply decline in the first quarter, as January 2015 was the last month West Texas Intermediate exceeded the average fuel surcharge trigger point.","Overall, 2015 was a challenging year with low commodity prices and strong U.S. dollar conditions, which consistently deteriorated each quarter and largely continued unabated. Despite this environment, we did experience upside revenue growth in our merchandise and intermodal markets, excluding fuel. We also posted record revenue in our agriculture franchise and record volume in both chemicals and intermodal.","On slide three, our fourth quarter results were impacted by decreased fuel surcharges, low commodity prices, unseasonably warm weather and high retail inventories. Volume declined in all three of our major business segments. Reduced fuel surcharges and co-revenue combined for 84% of our overall revenue decline. Despite these challenges, positive pricing offset the negative mix impact of several commodities, driving sequential growth in RPU less fuel for each of the last five quarters.","Moving to coal. Warm weather and lower natural gas prices resulted in declines in utility coal shipments. Export coal met our 3 million ton guidance for the quarter, but continued to be challenged compared to prior year due to global oversupply and the strong U.S. dollar. Our first quarter target is 2.5 million to 3 million tons, with the added uncertainty in the market. Excluding fuel, RPU increased for coal due to positive pricing and increased longer haul utility volume in the South.","Slide five depicts the record high temperatures in our service area that impacted utility coal shipments later in the quarter. In the second quarter and third quarters, our utility coal volumes met guidance and had settled into the low natural gas environment. Similar volume trends existed in October and November; however the warm weather significantly decreased December deliveries. Stockpiles are 40 days above target, which we anticipate will reduce first quarter volume to 15 million tons. The inventory overhang is projected to continue into the second quarter, once stockpiles return to target.","We project utility volumes in the range of 17 million to 19 million tons per quarter, assuming normal weather patterns. As we turn to intermodal, we've restructured our Triple Crown franchise, effective November 2015, with business winding down earlier in the quarter, as customers implemented alternative plans before the effective date. This equates to 4% in volume decline and 6% in revenue decline for intermodal.","While the Triple Crown restructure will have a negative impact on both volume and revenue in 2016, it will be accretive to our bottom line and improve capital utilization. Excluding Triple Crown, intermodal fell 1% for the quarter. This decline can largely be attributed to increased truck capacity and high retail inventory levels.","As the quarter progressed and service was restored to previous high levels, we experienced volume gains in some key accounts. These improvements will have a positive impact on our domestic franchise moving forward.","Lastly, pricing gains throughout the year increased revenue per unit by 4% when excluding Triple Crown and fuel. Consistent improvement in contract pricing creates confidence that this trend will continue and is supportive of our growth plan.","Our merchandise markets were impacted by low commodity prices, a strong dollar and high inventory levels, reducing demand for metals, export grain, crude oil and lumber. On a positive note, automotive posted a 9% increase in the quarter exceeding North American vehicle production growth. We also experienced strong growth in natural gas products, as well as ethanol.","Losses in higher rated commodities created a negative mix impact on RPU. However, strong pricing led to RPU less fuel growth of 2%. NS volumes as reported to the AAR, declined by 6.7% in the fourth quarter in line with other Class I's. Eliminating the impact of the Triple Crown restructuring. NS volume declined 5% during this period.","Concluding with our outlook, the impact of the warm weather on our coal franchise, on certain commodity prices and continued high retail inventory levels, create headwinds for volumes particularly in the first quarter. Coal volumes will be impacted as utilities work down high stockpiles.","Commodity price declines and foreign exchange pressures will affect our merchandise franchise. Volumes in our intermodal franchise will be impacted by the Triple Crown restructuring. Although, improved service and reach will benefit our conventional intermodal and automotive networks, pricing increases accelerated throughout 2015, with the strongest pricing in the fourth quarter benefiting our top line through 2016. The impact of lower fuel surcharge will subside in early 2016, and we are actively converting to programs with less variability and greater alignment to expenses.","Our longer term objectives include the continued diversification of our traffic base, a key to maintaining a strong franchise. Service-sensitive business is Norfolk Southern's fastest-growing segment is evidenced by our automotive and intermodal franchises, which grew at a 7% CAGR excluding Triple Crown over the last five years. We have the best-in-class network and with return to service levels, we expect volume growth in these markets, mitigating some risk associated with commodity-based products. Domestic intermodal will benefit from our service product and increased regulations in the trucking industry. International intermodal will grow as a result of our network reach and our alignment with shipping partners adding capacity on the East Coast.","In conclusion, a balanced franchise, disciplined market base pricing and an improved service product allows our management team to aggressively respond to a changing economic environment. We are confident in our pricing and volume growth plan, developed in concert with operations for our customers and their specific service needs and the unique market opportunities presented by our network.","Collectively we manage this flexible plan to adjust resources as volume levels fluctuate to drive targeted financial results. Next, Mike will describe our improved service levels, which increase the value of our product and generate volume growth.","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Senior Vice President-Operations","(24:16-24:25) substantial improvement (24:25-24:29) in 2015. Today we are taking the next step in strengthening our company from an operational and financial perspective.","Let me begin with one of our core principles on slide two, which is involved in all of our decisions, safety. We achieved a 14% decline in reportable injuries and even more importantly, a 19% reduction in serious injuries over 2014. We're proud of our position as an industry leader in safety and our commitment to safety will not waiver.","Turning to service on slide three, another of our core principles. As laid out here, our composite service performance continued to improve throughout the fourth quarter. Importantly, the performance of this comprehensive metric remained strong into the first quarter of 2016, positive change is underway. Our goal is to maintain this level of service, which we believe provides the optimal balance between delivering a high service product to our customers, while running a low cost operation.","We are confident we can continue to provide this level of service, as we implement our strategic plan to run more efficient and more profitable railroad. On a recent service note, NS achieved our most successful peak season ever for our premium accounts with respect on-time performance and total volume handled.","Looking to slide four, we continue to deliver significant improvement in our train speed and terminal dwell metrics, which are leading to improvements in our locomotive availability and efficiency of our car utilization. Specifically, year-over-year for the quarter, we achieved a 17% improvement in train speed and a 21% improvement in terminal dwell.","As we've said before a faster railroad is a less expensive and more profitable railroad. These improvements will translate directly into cost reductions, increased revenue and improved margins. And as a result, increase value for our stakeholders, including better service for our customers.","(27:11-27:17) increased our focus on using our existing resources for the (27:19-27:23) near our historic high service levels, we will continue to right size our resources, implement (27:31-27:58) productivity savings from our better service and efficiency initiatives in 2016. The five-year plan was developed by my team and we are committed to delivering results.","On slide six, we have continued the process of rightsizing our manpower to match the current environment, while the majority of these reductions have also taken the form of furloughs in the Transportation Department. We have also taken steps within our engineering, mechanical and network and service management departments.","On the locomotive side, aided by both our high velocity and an industry-wide reduction in volumes, we are currently storing high-adhesion road locomotives, and in addition, have removed units from our yard and local fleet. We did this through rightsizing against current volumes and fine tuning our local operating plan.","We are also progressing with our DC to AC rebuilds, which will allow us to replace our aging Dash 9 locomotive fleet at a significant discount purchasing new locomotives. We anticipate these reductions in our fleet to lead to lower maintenance and repair costs, while reducing future capital requirements and improving the reliability and fuel efficiency of our locomotive fleet.","As Jim outlined for you earlier on the call, and as you can see on slide seven. We are also taking a disciplined approach to reducing our operating costs. We recently announced that we are combining our Pocahontas and Virginia Divisions, which will reduced a number of operating divisions by close to 10% and will result in a reduction of division level supervision and back-office functions.","We are also progressing with our plans to reduce from three operating regions to two. We are adapting rapidly and consistently. We are also idling our Ashtabula, Ohio coal terminal and we'll concentrate our Lake coal volumes at our Sandusky, Ohio coal terminal. We have however, retained all the business as part of this move. As mentioned in our last earnings call, we are continuing to rationalize investment in coal routes in Central Appalachian. We are ceasing operation on portions of our West Virginia Secondary between Columbus, Ohio and Charleston, West Virginia, which will result in a 250 mile reduction in maintained right-of-way. In all, we will rationalize our secondary line network by 1,000 miles this year and 1,500 miles by 2020.","In closing, I want to emphasize that we are laser focused on ensuring Norfolk Southern has the most efficient and appropriate operating plan, which will streamline operations, while driving growth and profitability.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marta to walk you through the quarter's financials.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Thank you, Mike. And good morning everyone. Slide two summarizes our operating results compared to last year's record setting quarter. As Alan already discussed, revenues declined by $352 million or 12% as a result of the lower fuel surcharge revenues and lower volume. Operating expenses decreased by $103 million or 5% aided by continued low fuel prices, but partially offset by restructuring cost.","The net result was a $249 million or 28% reduction in income from railway operations and a 74.5% operating ratio for the quarter. Restructuring costs added 2 points to the operating ratio. As was the case in every quarter of 2015, fuel prices had a significant impact on our operating results and so we've summarized the net change on slide three.","Taking a look at the top of the slide, the line graphs reflect the comparative WTI prices for 2014 and 2015. As you would expect, the quarters with the biggest gap had the largest reduction in fuel revenue. Also note that we were below most of our WTI base trigger points throughout 2015.","Looking ahead to 2016, the forward curve projection for WTI is well below out most common trigger point of $64 a barrel. So the remaining on-highway diesel base surcharges should correlate more closely with our fuel expense this year.","Now, let's take a look at operating expenses. I'd like to pause here and note that our team has been aggressively seeking to reduce to operating costs, while maintaining a well run service oriented railroad. We've taken specific actions to reduce cost in the near-term, and will continue to reduce cost in a manner consistent with the five-year plan Jim described earlier.","In the fourth quarter, we decreased expenses by $103 million. Most of the decline was due to price as I just discussed, and we also had net reductions in purchase services and in compensation and benefits. These reductions were partially offset by increases in depreciation and in materials and other.","Before we look at the specific expense line items, let's turn to an update on restructuring cost. Slide five summarizes the expenses which are related to the significant downsizing of our Triple Crown operations and to the closure of our Roanoke regional offices. The net effect of these costs reduced fourth quarter results by $0.10 a share.","As shown on the following slide, our restructuring efforts had a significant impact on depreciation expense amounting to $37 million and resulting from the disposition of over 5,000 RoadRailer units. The remaining $10 million increase is associated with the growth in our asset base.","Slide seven breaks up the components of our change in fuel expense. We've already covered the price related component and the consumption decline is related to the drop in traffic volume. As Mike has already explained, we expect our fuel efficiency metrics to improve in 2016.","Slide eight depicts purchase services and rents which were down $12 million or 3%, reflecting the November 2015 secession of service in most Triple Crown lanes. As you know, this door-to-door service includes a significant amount of drayage and terminal operating costs, most of which went away after November 15 and accounted for an $18 million reduction. Partially offsetting this decline were the aforementioned restructuring cost and somewhat higher equipment rents associated with the increase in automotive traffic. Looking ahead to 2016, we expect purchase service costs to decline due to the Triple Crown restructuring.","Turning to slide nine, we experienced a $12 million or 2% decrease in compensation costs. Lower incentive compensation of $41 million, combined with $13 million of reduced overtime was partially offset by increased pay rates of $13 million, a labor agreement lump sum payment of $13 million and $4 million of severance cost associated with the restructuring.","In 2016, we expect continued reductions in overtime as well as a 4% decline in average head count year-over-year. On the other side of the equation, we expect wage and medical cost inflation up about 3.5% and a more normalized level of incentive comps.","As shown on slide 10, the materials and other category increased by $27 million or 12%. Casualty claims costs were $20 million higher due to favorable personal injury development in the prior year, combined with case specific accruals required in 2015.","Turning to income taxes on slide 11. The effective rate for the quarter were significantly lower at 31.1% versus 35.3% in 2014. This was largely attributable to three factors; the passage of the Tax Extenders Act in late December, which extended certain tax credits, the completion of an IRS audit and the effect of the state tax law change.","Wrapping up our quarterly overview on slide 12. Net income was $361 million, a decline of a $150 million or 29% and diluted earnings per share were a $1.20, down 27% compared with the prior year. As a reminder, restructuring costs lowered these results by $31 million or $0.10 per share.","Turning our focus to the full year on slide 13. Revenues were 10% lower than those in 2014, and expenses declined by 5%. The resulting income from railway operations of $2.9 billion was a 19% decline, which led to an increased operating ratio of 72.6% and a decrease in earnings per share to $5.10. Restructuring costs lowered these results by $58 million or $0.19 a share and added about 1 point to the operating ratio.","Slide 14 summarizes our full-year cash flows. Cash from operations for the year was $2.9 billion, covering capital spending and producing almost $500 million in free cash flow. With respect to stockholders' returns, we repurchased $1.1 billion of stock and paid over $700 million in dividend. In 2016, we plan to resume repurchases at a rate of about $200 million per quarter.","Moving on to this year's capital budget on slide 15. We plan to decrease total spending to $2.1 billion, similar to the renewed effort on aggressively managing our operating cost, we're also taking a more disciplined approach to capital spending. We are prioritizing capital allocation to our core network, and to projects that will fuel key areas of long-term growth. We believe this approach will enable the maintenance of high service levels as Mike described, and support the areas where Norfolk Southern will grow in the long-term, thereby maximizing our return on invested capital.","As you can see from the pie on this slide, spending on our right-of-way including roadway and infrastructure is roughly in line with recent years, whereas equipment spending is lower. We've reduced freight car purchases, but increased locomotive acquisitions in keeping with the strategy Mike outlined relative to a younger fleet and lower maintenance cost.","And with that, I thank you for your attention and I'll turn the program back to Jim.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Marta. As you've heard this morning, our results reflect the current challenges in domestic and global markets, but looking to 2016 we are poised to achieve significant annual expense savings without compromising the company's ability to secure volume and revenue growth opportunities. We are executing a clear strategic plan to drive profitability and growth, and we expect to achieve an operating ratio below 65% by 2020. As a management team, we have the right people in place to deliver superior shareholder value through execution of our strategic plan.","Before we move on to the Q&A portion of this call, I want to address recent developments with respect to Canadian Pacific. As you know, our board of directors has carefully reviewed and rejected three separate unsolicited proposals.","The board and management team are committed to doing what is in the best interest of the company and all NS shareholders. That said, I want to ask that you focus your questions on today's call on our fourth quarter and full-year earnings, as well as our strategic plan and the additional information we disclosed today.","With that, we'll now open the lines for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to ask about your assumption from mix in the roughly 2.5% revenue per unit guidance that you outlined. So I guess, should we be thinking about pricing in the roughly 3% range and maybe negative impact of mix of about 0.5 point any color you could provide that will be helpful. Thanks.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Thanks for the question. I think you have the basic formula about right. I'll turn it over to Alan in a minute. But let me say the big picture here is growth in intermodal volumes and lower coal volumes. And that has, as you point out, a negative mix impact overall. However, more than offset by pricing at a rate above inflation as we went through. Alan?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Allison, we are completely focused and committed to disciplined pricing moving forward, reflecting the value of our service product. But we don't anticipate the sharp negative headwinds in fuel surcharge revenue, coal and steel and frac sand and crude oil that we've had in the past. So we're going to focus primarily on growing our service-sensitive business and reflecting the long-term value of that business with our pricing. And we've been able to achieve five consecutive quarters of RPU growth ex-fuel and we believe that will continue.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, great. And my follow-up question, thinking about the $420 million of savings on the labor line, what are the specific head count expectations that are embedded within that? And could you give us a sense of what you're thinking about what that might imply from a GTM per employee or a carload per employee perspective?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Well again, I'll turn it over to Mike to talk about the specifics on the head count, but we're looking for roughly 2,000 fewer positions by 2020 and 1,200 fewer positions and about a 4% decrease in our overall workforce in 2016. So, Mike, you want to get into the specifics there a little bit?","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Senior Vice President-Operations","Yeah. So, it is driven by the 2,000 head count reduction by 2020 as well as aggressive over time reduction by 2020, and we've already started that in 2016 and seen some good headways. And as we've said, that's about a 4% reduction for this year in our head count and we would expect that to translate directly into the gross ton miles per revenue.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Vecchio with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Alexander Vecchio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So, Jim, I realize the forecast for coal to decline at a 1% CAGR is more conservative than some other estimates out there, but naturally a 1% decline over the next five years would suggest that the mix headwind from coal decline from a profitability standpoint would moderate pretty drastically versus what you've experienced over the last few years.","So my question is, if coal volumes do end up declining, kind of closer to the mid to high single digits, as they have been over the past few years, do you still believe you'll be able to achieve your OR and EPS targets?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","What I'd liked to do is turn it over to Alan in a minute to give you some of the detail on how we built up the coal volume forecast, which as you point out, we do believe is conservative based on independent experts. But let me just say this about our plan, it is a dynamic flexible plan. If we do not see the growth in revenue because our coal volumes trend worse than we're expected or for whatever the reason, we will push even harder on the cost side. It's a flexible plan, we can dig deeper on the costs if we have to; we are intent on achieving the results we have outlined today.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Alex, we know that coal volume will decline in 2016, and that's reflected in most indices. And then what we've done is we have looked at our individual plants, our individual customers, and then anchored that against independent experts. And we have come up with what we believe is a conservative plan going forward. Yes, there is risk; there is no doubt about it. But at gas price levels where they are today, coal-to-gas switching in our service region is effectively saturated. And so we do feel good about our coal forecast going forward; it's more conservative than outside experts, but we will adjust accordingly if we see the market dynamics change.","Alexander Vecchio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then my follow-up. So, you've given a lot more detailed guidance, which is great, and you've spoken a bit more specifically to your expectations for core pricing. I was wondering if maybe you'd be willing to begin disclosing more specifically your same store sale, core pricing metrics on a quarterly basis, as other Class 1s have been doing? And maybe if you could provide what that figure was in the fourth quarter? Thank you.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Listen, let me just say this. With the leadership transitions here, everything is on the table, and we are certainly considering changes in a variety of areas, including our disclosure policy. Alan, you want to comment on the same-store sales number in the fourth quarter?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","It was above rail inflation. And we are going to continue to get improvement in that as we realize the full-year benefit of the contract rate increases that we negotiated with our customers this year. Also with a sharply declined fuel surcharge overhang, we'll see better improvement in RPU throughout the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning. And thank you for the detail on the five-year plan, that's helpful. Wanted to see if you could give me, this is probably for Mike or Jim, what broadly speaking, are some of your assumptions on train length and train starts over the five-year period? I guess, typically we think of train starts is driving costs and head count. And likewise, what you do on train lengths, that's an area that you can drive productivity. So are there any kind of broad thoughts you can provide on how you think those two parameters may move over the five-year period?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Well, first, train lengths are obviously an important driver of productivity, and fewer starts per train is also an important driver. And Mike, why don't you talk a little bit about the specifics there.","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Senior Vice President-Operations","Yeah. So, on our train length, this last quarter, as well as last year, our train lengths were at our historic highs. And they were at our historic highs at the same time that our service levels were at their historic highs. So we feel pretty good about that going forward. Now, having said that, we continue to tactically look at what are the opportunities to run longer trains, and we do that daily and we got a team looking at that intensely.","And we're also looking at strategically long-term, looking at longer trains and what we're doing there is, reviewing our operating plan and we continue to fine tune it to optimize the operating plan and it will allow us to not only run longer trains, but reduce our car miles and reduce handlings, and those go hand in hand with increased efficiency. So, we \u2013 while we feel like we're in a good place, we do see opportunity going forward.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","I mean, maybe I should ask it a little bit differently. Is \u2013 do you have specific targets for change in train lengths that are part of the broader productivity plan? Is there a plan that you improve it 10%, 20% or is that not one of the key drivers in your five-year plan?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","No, it's not one of the ones that we put a specific metric on. We plan to improve it, but we don't have a target for that.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then I don't know, if I can get kind of a follow on or a different topic. But is there any implication for a long-term CapEx within the structural changes. If you take out 1,500 miles of track, does that help you get a lower CapEx number in the longer term?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","It does, it does. And that's one of the benefits of reducing the network footprint from the 1,000 miles of rationalization we're looking at this year and fully 1,500 miles by 2020. That does bring your CapEx down with respect to those lines and there were some expense benefit from that as well. And we are also looking at \u2013 trying to contain CapEx at a lower level overall than it has been at in the last several years.","We pointed out again that we reduced CapEx last year, that was appropriate given the circumstances. This year's capital budget starting out is a double digit slower than last year's and that we'll continue to be flexible with CapEx as market conditions require.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you for the time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. So I wanted to follow up on the head count, because I guess you are talking about a 7% reduction in head count from here. It strikes me though that volumes were down 7% in the fourth quarter and your head count was up 2% while all the other rails had head count reductions in that 7% range. So it feels like 7% head count reduction is kind of just a catch up to what other rails have just done to respond to the weak volumes and if we're thinking about like real productivity savings. Why isn't there like a lot more head count potential here? Because that's where we can get the most confidence and visibility to real margin improvement, and it feels like there should be potential for a lot more and I guess I'm just not sure why we can't see that.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","All right. Well, first let me just \u2013 we started at a lower level of head count overall. We built head count somewhat last year to get our service back up to where it needs to be. It's there, and now we can begin to modulate head count down. 1,200 fewer employees through a combination of attrition and furloughs this year would represent a 4% reduction in our workforce overall year-over-year.","And we've given you the cost savings we expect from the attrition and the furloughs and other actions on comp and benefits. That's a big piece of the overall $650 million in productivity annualized by 2020 fully $420 million.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then, just on the cash flow just for a minute. When do you think you can get back to kind of the historical 16%, 17% of revenue on CapEx. I guess a follow-up to what Tom was just asking. And then Marta, any thoughts on why you're slowing the buybacks in 2016?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Well, let's talk about CapEx first and I'll let Marta cover buybacks second. We're targeting about 19% of revenue through the completion of PTC, which takes us through 2018. After that, we intend to bring CapEx down to around 17%. We think that's a level of reinvestment, given other assumptions it generates an adequate return for shareholders, an excellent return for shareholders in fact.","Marta, why don't you talk about the buybacks?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Okay. In the share repurchases we discussed, we're beginning at a run rate this quarter of $200 million, which would imply right now $800 million for the year, and that's very much in line with what we've done over the last 10 years, we'd averaged about $1 billion. So some years a little bit higher, some years a little bit lower. We finished 2015 at $1.1 billion, so we're comfortable with that level of guidance for now.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","And I do want to point out Scott, our board is very focused on buybacks right now, that's a big part of our strategy, it has been in the past, as we went through. We have kicked out to shareholders fully $15 billion through buybacks and dividends in the past and we will continue to buyback our shares.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Barnes with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for the time. I just want to go back to coal for a second, because I think, we're struggling a little bit with the numbers in terms of kind of the growth outlook. I mean, if I assume that 2016 is going to be down something similar to what the other rails are talking about, let's say it's a mid-teens type of decline this year, regardless of whether or not your franchise is less at risk to more switching on natural gas or something like that. You're still implying something like mid single-digit compounded annual growth from like 2017 through 2020.","I think that when you look at the change in the Eastern utilities portfolio, whether it's the introduction of more nuclear or what have you, that just seems like a big number, a big target out there for growth, I mean and certainly that's a growth number not stabilization. So can you just talk a little bit more about, how you start to see that upswing, and where this kind of CAGR of down one kind of fits with, something that looks like, it's more up mid-single-digit in the out years?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","We are not looking for growth in golden out years. So, 2016 is another leg down in coal volumes and after that we see stabilization in the coal volumes and I will let Alan return to the specific assumptions that underlie that. But let me just reemphasize that ours is a flexible plan. We know this is a tough environment in which to talk about growth, and that's why we're so focused on cost reductions, on maintaining excellent service, and on safety.","If we do those three things, we will have a successful 2016 and we will continue to drive on those three things as hard as we possibly can beyond 2016, and we expect the results to offset any decline in volumes or revenue that we might experience contrary to our expectations.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. We know that much of the coal decline this year is the result of the warm weather, and with coal dispatching behind natural gas, it is much more volatile with weather conditions. We're very clear that our guidance, once stockpiles normalize, is dependent upon normal weather patterns. We also know that the opportunity for coal to gas switching in our specific service region, and particularly in the southeast is muted going forward. But to be clear, we are not looking for growth in our coal franchise. We expect it to decline, we're going to manage it very closely and continue to manage the resources that are applied against it.","John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And what assumption have you made for coal shutdowns within the franchise in that forecasted amount?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Most of the additional natural gas plants that have been announced in the southeast are not targeted at specific NS plants. Up in the PJM, there is more crossover and there is more risk, and we've taken that into account that there is a specific plant in the southeast, that's been taken into account in our franchise too. So it comes in conjunction with looking at the announced natural gas plant additions in the next couple of years and talking to our customers about it. So, we do have some of it in there more predominant in the Northeast.","John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. All right. And then, my follow-up question. Thanks for the color. My follow-up is, you talked 1,500 miles of track disposal. I know you guys sell real estate every year. So, you kind of know how to do it, but my question on track disposal going forward is, it seems like a lot of this is going to be stuff that maybe it doesn't have a lot of value left to short-line rail. There is not enough volume originating on that particular track.","So, I'm curious. I mean, should we expect lower proceeds from track sales going forward, just because there's less value on them? I mean, are these going to be turned into really nice bike paths or something like that or is there still some value to be had to a short-line? Is there still enough volume originating on that 1,500 miles, if there is some value there?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","I think the way to view this, John, is not as a real estate transaction or a real estate strategy, but as a network optimization strategy. And it's a mechanism by which we can bring down future capital spending associated with these lines as we had said, and also to some extent reduce expenses. And Alan, do you want to elaborate at all on the customer effects of some of this, the short-line potential? Some of this maybe \u2013 may be Delta short-line.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Some of it will be Delta short-line, so, we can continue to handle the business. And the ultimate goal is to ensure that with a short-line handle, we do not increase the cost to the supply chain.","John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks for your time today.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to touch on sort of the broad volume outlook for 2016. So, understanding sort of where you guys are thinking about coal, but when you think about the entire book of business, how should we think about that in 2016? It sounds like the first quarter is going to be tougher, but how does it look after that?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Certainly, it remains a challenging macro environment. Alan will go through the specific assumptions for 2016. But again, let me say, this is why we are so focused on cost savings, on maintaining service and on safety. Those will be the three pillars of our success in 2016. The growth will come; this is a long-range plan, and over the course of five years, we do expect to grow. And we all know how powerful growth and pricing can be for the bottom line in the long run.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","The largest headwinds that we have right now with respect to near-term volume are, coal inventory levels and retail inventory levels. Once those get worked through, we do see some growth, because we're coming off a year in which we had minimal growth. We have a very strong intermodal franchise, our improved service product is going to direct more of that business back to our lines and our \u2013 the domestic sector as we move into the second half of the year, we have a lot of strength in our international franchise that once retail inventory levels are normalized that will pick up, and we have strengthen in our automotive franchise.","So, we do have some franchises that have opportunities for growth. We had a record volume in chemicals last year, and we had record volume in intermodal too despite the Triple Crown restructuring. Also note that Triple Crown will have a negative impact on volume comps, particularly for the first three quarters of the year. But we do feel that as we progress through the year, and as we take advantage of our service products and as inventory levels whether in retail or in coal normalize, we're going to start to see significant improvement.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. But you're not predicating that that outlook for 2016 on volume growth, it sound like that?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","No, there is certainly opportunity there, but we're watching it very closely, because there is a lot of uncertainty around commodities and a lot of uncertainty on when, particularly the retail inventory levels get reversed.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Sure, that's helpful. Appreciate that.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","We're actively managing it with operations, to make sure we're sizing, our resources appropriately.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's great. And just a quick follow up if I may, just on the fuel surcharge side. Marta thanks for the incremental details that you've been giving us, in terms of fuel surcharge. As you see the WTI program, sort of bottom out here in January and then going forward, how should we think about the headwind to operating profit, you've sort of laid that out in the slide, just kind of curious if there is a view that you can give us for 2016, when you think about that, sort of what's included in terms of either a headwind or sort of neutral impact from the fuel surcharge to profit in 2016? Thanks.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Okay. So, as Alan described, in the first quarter, that's the \u2013 the first quarter is the one that will have the toughest comp compared to 2015, because recall that the first quarter of 2015 in January, some of those WTI, once we're kicking in. So, we had $163 million of fuel surcharge in the first quarter of 2015. So, year-over-year, the biggest decline that we will see, we expect if the forward curve stays like it is now, will be in the first quarter.","Nevertheless, for all of the year, for all of the quarters, we expect to have a much less net operating profit effect, because our fuel expenses will be going down more commensurately with our fuel revenue, if we stay in this oil price environment.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks for the time guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. So Jim, I know you said at the outset that you don't really want to talk about CP, but I'm getting plenty of emails here from investors that would like to discuss it. So I guess in that context, I just want to respectfully ask, we've heard from these plans from Norfolk over the years that you guys always target peer margins, but we now have Canadian National, Canadian Pacific, Union Pacific all in the low 60%s even cleaned up for the currency benefits of North.","And we're still struggling with the coal guidance. I think there was a question earlier about how do you get through negative 1% CAGR when you're guiding 15% down this year? Clearly, 4Q was a pretty challenging year even after you take out the restructuring charges. And I don't think that we would argue that any of those big railroads that are running at a low 60%s OR right now are in some sort of unsustainable or less safe operating condition than they were when they were running back in the 80%s or even 90%s OR.","So, with your plan to drive about $600 million, $650 million of productivity improvements in the next five years in CP's plan, which I would argue is backed up by a management team that has demonstrated the ability to do this in a very quick fashion, I think CP's plan is close to $1.2 billion over the same timeframe.","So, what is it about your business that you feel CP does not understand that makes shareholders better off with $650 million of improvement versus a low 60%s OR and a $1.2 billion improvement plan?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","So, we've outlined a plan today to get to a sub 65% operating ratio by 2020. And as I said, we won't stop there. There is more we can do. We're going to continue to drive our operating ratio, as low as we possibly can go with it. It's a good plan, it's a balanced plan, it contains a major component of cost cutting and we understand the need for that. That's absolutely critical, it's a flexible plan.","If we don't see the growth, we will find additional ways to reduce expenses. It's a specific plan, it's the right plan for our markets, our franchise and our customers.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Well, as a follow up then, so are you saying that $1.2 billion of improvement is just nowhere near attainable and the timeframe that they've laid out, can Norfolk ever get to a 60% operating ratio or is that just off the table for your network?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","As I said, 65% is the starting point for us, that's what we've said, we're going to try achieve by 2020. We may be able to go faster, we'll see. After we reach 65%, we're going to continue to drive it lower.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Troy with Nomura. Please proceed with your question.","Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. I was just wondering, if you could help us with the economics of the Pocahontas Division, now that's being consolidated? Just curious, if you could size the magnitude of the royalties, will your disclosure change with respect to how it's presented and how much of a headwind that might be and the timing of that headwind, as it runs off?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","So, I think Matt, we're talking about two different things here. The division consolidation that Mike went through reflects a strategy to reduced G&A, streamline operations and streamline the organization. The core royalties you referenced, appear in our other income, as part of rental and other income. Marta, maybe you could give us a run rate on that?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Yes. As you've mentioned, those have been decreasing of course with the decline in coal prices. So, Matt that will continue to be reported in other income and depending on prices \u2013 and depending on coal prices that will continue \u2013 perhaps continue to decline. So, that's reflected in our charts, in our book that we put out and they were down $4 million in the fourth quarter and $14 million for the full year.","Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","But the divisional reorganization in and itself has no affect on...","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","I am glad you asked that question, because with both of them having our cooperation that handles the core royalty is being called Pocahontas and the division being called Pocahontas, we don't want any confusion there.","Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Understood. Thank you. And just as my follow up, you mentioned share repurchases, that's a big part of your plan and you gave us the targeted payout ratio of 33% and the return of $15 billion to shareholders. Just curious, maybe Marta, what are the guard rails in terms of balance sheet leverage or capital structure with respect to credit rating or leverage ratios, you're comfortable pushing up against in order to drive share repurchases over time? Just want to refresh on where you think Norfolk is comfortable with respect to some of those credit metrics? Thank you.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Thanks. As you know that share repurchases is just one part of our total capital allocation policy. It is a very important, as Jim mentioned our board is very focused on it. What we are doing is, we are making sure that we stay within our credit ratings band, but we want to make sure, we leverage as much as we can of that, and that's what we have done buying back over \u2013 little over 1 billion a year on average over the last 10 years.","So, right now our expectation is that we will stay within that band and push as much of our free cash flow into share repurchases combined with the appropriate amount of leverage.","Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","But, just trying to get specifically as we think about modeling, you are willing to lever up more than where you are today? Is there an upper band that you think is acceptable?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","As our sheet grows and as our profits grow with this five-year plan that Jim has described, we expect to grow our share repurchase program with it.","Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. I guess, Jim, as a clarification for your 2016 OR guidance, you guys highlighted a bunch of track mile sales, as well as the Roanoke office. So I would imagine it's going to be sold. Should we be contemplating that there is some? Could you clarify to the extent that gains are incorporated in that sub-70% OR guidance that you're targeting for the full year, because obviously it's a tough volume backdrop, and there'll be some mix headwinds as well, as we lookout to this year?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","So, speaking specifically to real estate sales, gain on real estate sales including any gain we record on sale of the Roanoke office building would not be included in operating income, but would be below the operating income line in other income. So that would have no impact on the operating ratio.","And the proceeds from any line sales I think would be rather minimal in conjunction with the restructuring or rationalization of the 1,000 miles we've referred to. There could be some proceeds from that, but again, the main focus of that is reduction in capital spending, and to some extent, expenses going forward.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Understood, and I appreciate that clarification there. I guess, getting back to Tom's earlier question with regard to sidings. In asking it a little bit differently, could you give us a sense of what the siding capacity is today across your different franchises and it what the train length currently stands at?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Mike?","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Senior Vice President-Operations","Yeah, sure. Most of our sidings form the railroad are 8,000 feet long. As we build new sidings, and we've built a lot of new sidings over the years, and we've built some up in the 10,000-foot, 11,000-foot, 12,000-foot range, so we've got a lot of siding capacity out there relative to the size of the trains we're running now. Our intermodal trains are running around 6,000 feet on average; a lot of capacity there. And the rest of the overall network is in the 5,000 feet to 6,000 feet, so we have got plenty of capacity on our sidings out there.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yeah, thank you for the time this morning. So when framing your targeted expense reductions, I want to confirm that we should use 2015's GAAP results as a baseline and better understand how we should incorporate what are natural volume driven OpEx fluctuations and general expense inflation to those numbers going forward?","So since volume and sensitive cost should be down in 2016, is your $130 million productivity target for the year \u2013 is that fully incremental to the cost savings that you naturally see from lower volumes? And maybe longer term, as volumes return to growth per the plan, how should we compare that rise in volume-driven expense and the broader cost inflation you'll see to your longer term target for $650 million in savings over five years?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So first, comparisons are to GAAP results in 2015, so the cost savings that we have outlined are in relation to GAAP reported earnings in 2015. And Marta, why don't you take us through the dynamics of the productivity and other elements of the question.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Yes, they are compared to GAAP. The $130 million in savings does not include the benefit of the restructuring cost. So if you're looking year-over-year and you're looking at total expenses, you would expect a decline of $130 million plus the $93 million of the restructuring costs that we had. Otherwise, it's all in there, the pluses and the minuses.","So I mean if we have growth, if we have volume growth you're exactly right. We would have incremental expenses associated with that volume growth and that would not be in the $130 million.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Understood. And maybe from a high level, just looking at the guidance to get below 70% OR this year. If I plug the 70% OR into consensus revenues, it looks like something around 10% year-over-year EPS growth on your 2015 GAAP base of about 5% to 10%. Is that the bogey that we should be looking at or is there something underlying maybe consensus revenue is too high or something else that we should be thinking about before using that as kind of our sense of your internal targets here?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Look, we say sub 65% operate \u2013 excuse me, sub 70% operating ratio in 2016 is our goal, and that's what we're working toward through whatever combination of growth or lack thereof, and expense savings. If we're heading into a recession, obviously the degree of difficulty gets that much higher, but we are committed to this goal and we're pushing hard to achieve it.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","And I will point out too that ,and Alan can elaborate on this, but I would point out too that while we're expecting volume declines in coal, that's not the case for all of our commodity groups.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","We'll pivot if we need to as well. And if we need to pivot harder on costs we will certainly do that. We're not going to sacrifice our service, but everything else is on the table, we'll cut whatever we need to cut short of hurting service.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","I guess just a follow up on that, if volumes do come in, kind of as you expected is something approaching the double-digits on your GAAP earnings base the question for this year? Or is that within the range of possibilities in your view?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","I mean, you can do math on the EPS effect of driving the operating ratio below 70%.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","All right. Thank you for the time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you operator and good morning everyone. First question has to do with your CapEx going forward. Obviously with shutting down some of your lines that you had with coal and looking at the shutdown, I think, what did you say, you have 1,500 miles of track, rearranging some of your locomotive needs and car types, where is the new mix going to be? Is the mix going to change in terms of what you're investing in as we look in Norfolk Southern in 2020 versus 2015?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Well by 2020, we will be done with PTC, and so you will see that roll out. You'll see more focus on core investments in our core network; that will certainly be part of the equation all the way out to 2020. We will continue to invest in locomotives and equipment and other structures and other critical aspects of the infrastructure. So other than the absence of PTC, no major change in the mix of our investments other than perhaps greater concentration on core lines.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. That's a good clarification. And, Marta, just to get some clarification for 2017 kind of in relation to everyone trying to pinpoint an EPS number for you, you talked about your tax rate dropping down. It sounded like there were several items that hit it, but it sounded like some of these items might be continuing into 2016 here. What should we look at in terms of your tax rate for the year?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Yes, you're correct about that. The Tax Extenders Act also extended the credits already for this year. So we would expect \u2013 in prior years, we've guided to an effective tax rate about 37.5%, but for 2016 we think it will be more like 37% even.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC","37% even? Okay, thank you so much for the time as always.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Good morning, Jim, Marta, Mike and Alan. If we look back at the plan on page eight, you see a lot of revenue growth, and I just want to understand in this slower growth market, you're expecting pricing to scale up to 2.5% from zero over the last few years. Your volume growth to accelerate \u2013 and I don't know \u2013 it says 2015 to 2020, so I don't know if you're counting 2015 and 2016 within that CAGR, which would be a pretty big upside for 2017 through 2020. But does that set up for trouble, I guess more importantly how much of the 65% is built on revenue top-line versus the costs that you've laid out?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","In the plan, revenue growth is an important driver of operating ratio improvement and bottom line improvement as well. And right now it's a difficult environment in which to pitch growth, we understand that. And that's why we're so focused on cost savings, right now. Cost savings, keeping our service at the current level and running a safe railroad are our top priorities in 2016 and we will do what we need to do to achieve the results. That's the other thing to appreciate about the plan; it's a flexible plan, a dynamic plan. If we need to pivot to a different strategy, we certainly can and will.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. But is there a limit of how much in that 65% is tied to the top line versus your cost? I'm just trying to understand at least for the base case that you've set so as things change, we can kind of understand what shifts need to be taken on maybe more aggressive cost-cutting? Is the plan based half on top line, half on costs, or as it is right now?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","There are elements of both in the plan. It's a balanced plan. We think it's the right plan for our markets, our customers and our franchise. It does assume some volume growth, and pricing as well. Now, Alan feels confident about the pricing potential here. The volume growth is obviously a bit more of a wildcard. We think we have the opportunity to grow volume over this five-year period. Pricing coupled with even modest growth is an important driver of bottom line performance for us, and everybody else in the industry. If we have to pivot to a different strategy and take the expenses down even more aggressively, we will.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. And if I give you follow-up on Triple Crown, Alan, maybe just a little bit on volumes. Why did the Triple Crown, when you shut it down, volumes not turn back to intermodal? Did it lose to truck or are they still in transition? And then, I guess ultimately, why was it eliminated? I presume because it wasn't additive to margins. So, just want to understand that shift in the business, why you weren't able to recapture it in kind of different ways, whether it's through third-party or what have you?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Ken, that's a good question. We've worked with our channel partners to get as much of it back as possible. But almost by definition, the Triple Crown franchise was set up not to compete with our conventional intermodal franchise. So there's not a lot of overlap. It's not yet fully defined how much we'll move back into our intermodal network. And frankly, Ken, we're seeing some move into our merchandise network too, which once again underscores the benefit of our improved service product that our merchandise network can compete for Triple Crown business.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Remember...","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So it's still on transition, is what you are saying? Because it seems like a lot of obviously that opportunity \u2013 was it lost again to truck or is it still moving around?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Ken, most of it will ultimately be lost to truck.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Because our conventional network does not run in a lot of the lanes that Triple Crown ran in.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","The important takeaway here though is, as we have said, despite the volume decline, we expect the restructuring to be accretive to earnings modestly.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Helpful. Thank you very much for the time. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks, and good morning. I wanted to just follow-up on the 2016 volume question to be clear on that front. Is your guidance for a sub-70% OR assuming that volumes are down this year? And if so, could you talk about the magnitude of the volume decline you're expecting?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","The volumes are currently in play right now and it's a tough start to the year, no doubt about it. If we're heading into a recession, this is going to be a tough slog for everybody. We will pivot to additional cost cutting if we have to, we \u2013 the sub-70% operating ratio is our goal and we're going to do whatever we possibly can short of going into recession and that makes life difficult for all of us, for sure. But, sub-70% is our goal, we are working hard to achieve it through a combination of expense reductions and whatever volume and pricing increases we can manage.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Got it. And, maybe to just follow-up on the OR target for 2016. So, you highlighted in 2015, the OR was 71.7%, when you exclude the impact from Roanoke and Triple Crown, is there any way to frame up how much of the improvement, half of that base, you expect in 2016 just from the strategic changes you've made if you total up the impact from Roanoke, Triple Crown and some of the other changes in the coal network?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","So again, remember, we're comparing to GAAP results including the restructuring charges in 2015. That gives you a head start on lower expenses right there in 2016, but that doesn't factor in the $130 million in productivity savings we're looking for.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And one last quick one on that. Marta, sorry if I missed it, but D&A obviously has taken a step up. What's your expectation for D&A this year?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Pardon me. What did you say?","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Depreciation and amortization.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Depreciation.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. That was up in part, because of the Triple Crown restructuring.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Yes. Yes. So, depreciation, when you exclude the restructuring charge, was up $10 million in the fourth quarter. And so, we would expect a similar amount in each quarter \u2013 to increase it in each quarter in 2016.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Very helpful. Thanks for the time.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.","Thanks very much, and good morning. So, your service metrics improved quite significantly in Q4, but it looks like a lot of that was pretty backend loaded. So, from a cost perspective, even though your T&E overtime was down, and your recrews were down. It would seem like you wouldn't have realized that full benefit in Q4. I was just wondering if you could help us to think about that particular issue?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","That's true. That's true. We did not see the full benefit of the service improvements in terms of expense reductions in Q4. Mike, talk a little bit about the trend and what we expect in the first quarter.","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Senior Vice President-Operations","Yeah. If you look at the service metrics through the quarter, they did improve each month through the quarter and it was near the end of the quarter that we got back to our historic highs, which is what we're currently operating at. And that's why we feel like the productivity savings we've got going forward are going to be very, very achievable, because we did get to that level now.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.","So, do you happen to have what T&E overtime and recrews would have looked like year-over-year in December, as an example?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Hang on just a second.","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Senior Vice President-Operations","So, what's the question?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","What did it look like in December to give us a run-rate for first quarter?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Just for T&E. I gave the whole $13 million for the entire quarter, Mike, was the reduction in overtime. And so, what we're saying is that occurred disproportionately.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Right, right.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","In December, so.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Right, right, correct. We don't have that broken out just by December.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.","Okay, that's fine. But it was back-end loaded?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Correct. Yeah, it was back-end loaded as the improvements happen sequentially each month through the quarter.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.","Right, that's all my questions. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, good morning, everybody. And thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to dive a little more deeply into the rationalization of the coal network, which I guess will net 1,000 fewer truck miles this year and 1,500 in total through 2020. Are there any regulatory hurdles that have to be negotiated through here especially this year, as you're talking about taking so many miles out of the system, particularly if there is an abandonment that is required, given that maybe some of these lines are going to be attractive to short run or regional railroads?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","First the 1,000 miles we are targeting in 2016 and the 1,500 miles by 2020 are not limited to the coal network, that would be across the entire expanse of our network. Now a lot of that will be in the coal fields for sure.","Second in general, these line rationalizations would not require regulatory approval, because they will not be full-scale abandonments.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And then I think you called out the continuing program to convert DC locomotives over to AC locomotives. Could you give us a sense for, how many locomotives are involved in that program? And what the savings per locomotives would be relative to purchasing new AC locomotives?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","It's an important program, very important part of our long-term capital strategy for locomotives. Mike?","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Senior Vice President-Operations","Yeah, so if you kind of look at the run rate, you have to look at it pretty far out, because we've got about 1,200 of these Dash 9 locomotives that are starting to hit the age, where you got to do something with them. So we'll be doing these 1,200 locomotives over the next 10, 10-plus years. And the cost to rebuild is about half the cost of a new locomotive and we get a great reliable locomotive with increased tractive effort. So we're pretty excited. And the early indications are really, really positive on the test results.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So order of magnitude on the savings per locomotives maybe in the neighborhood of a $1 million, $1.5 million somewhere in that range?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Capital versus buying new?","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes.","James A.

Most of my questions at this point have been answered, but let me come back to Marta with a detailed question. When you're talking $2.1 billion of CapEx, that's a gross CapEx number right, not a net CapEx number?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","That's correct. That's all of our capital for 2016 and the components are in that pie that was in one of my slides.","Jeff A. Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay.

Please proceed with your question.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey good morning. Alan, just a question for you on the fuel surcharge program. It says you're \u2013 here on the slide deck that you're shifting from WTI to diesel. I guess the first question is, are you expecting to get a 100% of the fuel revenue that you lost through these new fuel programs or will we also be seeing some of that recovery in the lost fuel revenue in core price?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","We're going to see much of the recovery in core price, because new fuel surcharge programs are paying pretty low also and as we compete with modal competition, their fuel surcharge programs are low too. So, we're focused primarily on price. We do not want to give up price to move to an on-highway diesel fuel surcharge program, but we are making progress in that arena.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And as far as kind of the progress you are making like is it the number of years to get that lost fuel revenue back as core price? Is this like a three-year, five-year, one-year, like how long do you think this is going to take to kind of reclaim some of that lost value that you had from the design of the surcharge program?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah David, it's a multiyear program for us, because our contracts average a term in excess of three plus years. So, that's one hurdle to getting it done immediately. The other hurdle is the volatility in the commodity prices. And our \u2013 once again, our commitment to focusing on price and not given up pricing just to move to another fuel surcharge program that may also be out of the money.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, Marta, maybe just as a quick follow-up. The $200 million a quarter or so that you're going to do through buybacks, are you planning to add more leverage this year or is this all going to come organically from operations?","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","We'll add leverage in keeping with the size of our balance sheet. I mean, you can see if you look over our past few years of our balance sheet, you can see that we're borrowing up to about 2.5 times EBITDA. So, we're going to keep our balance sheet strong, keep within our credit ratings band. So, it will be a mix of using the cash that we have on hand, the profits from operations and leverage.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. So, we should expect some added leverage this year then?","Marta R.

Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","... there is about $246 million; the remainder is about two-thirds, one-third core and growth.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Perfect. And then, I'm curious. So, why does that 17% of sales, feel like the right spend number by 2020, I mean you've got PTC falling off, you're going to have 1,500 miles of mainline that will be rationalize, service creates latent capacity, all the heavy lifting on intermodal has long been done by that point and your loco plans really focus more on rebuild. So I mean why wouldn't that number potentially be a lot lower than 2017. And I guess I just want to be comfortable that you and the Board are really focused on maximizing free cash flow and not necessarily OR or EPS?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Of course. Of course, we're very focused on free cash flow and free cash flow equals cash from operation minus capital spending. So from that standpoint, lower capital spending is better. But we do certainly have a lot of replacement needs going forward. And it's a very asset intensive business we're in here. And we expect to continue to aggress to invest appropriately prudently, but responsibly to keep that investment in great shape for our customers.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","So real quickly to that point though, I mean you're spending call it, $600 million for growth this year. So is that about how much capital you need to spend to simply grow the business 2% to 3%?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Well I think, by 2020 the growth capital starts to moderate and probably before then, in fact. As you know, we have built out a best-in-class intermodal terminal network, we're in the final stages of completing that terminal network, that takes some of the pressure off the growth part of CapEx. It's conceivable, we could bring CapEx down further that certainly would be healthy from the standpoint of free cash flow, but we also want to make sure that we are investing responsibly for a safe and efficient operation.","Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance","Yes. And I think you should consider that 17% to be just a general guideline. And not a \u2013 not to exceed sort of thing, not (96:20).","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Perfect. Thank you guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning, and thank you for your time. My first question is about the flexibility of your five year cost reduction plan. Where is the high flexibility you see? Please help us understand where is the highest opportunity for cutting costs like you said without affecting services. Maybe by highlighting, where do you think your network offers more opportunity versus peers and then in case demand is lower, what kind of pivoting do you have in mind? Thank you.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","So, we went through the categories of cost savings. We're targeting in the $650 million. Labor is the biggest contributor and then, reduce fuel consumption in the car fleet and locomotive maintenance. Additional cost savings would come from all of the above. We would be seeking to call each of those cost levers even harder, if we have to. And we would be seeking additional cost savings as well through adjustment of our network in kind of long-term down volume scenario.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Appreciate that. And then, my follow up relates to intermodal. This quarter, we saw pricing down about 2% ex-fuel. Can you help us understand what drove that, was it new business, was it renewals with existing customers, some mix impact? And then, if you could share with us your outlook for present volume growth this year for domestic and international, I would really appreciate that. Thank you.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Alan?","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Cleo. The reason why we saw the decline in pricing or RPU ex-fuel for intermodal in the fourth quarter was the Triple Crown restructuring. If you strip that out, RPU ex-fuel for intermodal was actually up 4%. Reflective of the pricing actions that we've taken throughout the year.","Our customers are committed in the intermodal network to long-term growth and they understand that we need to be able to invest in their \u2013 in the network to accommodate the growth. And so we're taking a long-term view of this. We're accelerating pricing across all markets, as we push to a disciplined market based pricing approach.","Intermodal will be taxed in the first half of the year, due to the Triple Crown restructuring, but as we bring back more domestic business with our approved service product and continue to benefit from shifts to East Coast ports. We expect volumes in our intermodal franchise to improve throughout the year.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Ben Hartford with Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks for fitting me in here. Take a look at that, that five year outlook for intermodal, the 5% annualized growth. I'm assuming that domestic intermodal you're expecting to exceed international. One, I want to confirm that. And then, two, if that's the case, kind of implied upper single digit annualized domestic intermodal volume growth going forward. I mean is it safe to assume that your outlook \u2013 your intermediate term outlook for intermodal domestic, intermodal really hasn't materially changed, despite the fact that crude now is close to $30 as opposed to $100 about a year ago. Any perspective on that, that'd be helpful. Thank you.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Compared to the compound annual growth rate for our intermodal franchise in last five years, we actually do see a slowing of growth. Alan give us a little color on that.","Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Ben. Frankly, it's consistent with the rest of our five-year plan, it's conservative. It is less than what we've had in the past, but it's a number at which we can continue to push price and continue to encourage additional business on our lines, as trucking regulations are implemented in the last half of 2017, it's going to tighten capacity in 2016. And so that will be a spark for domestic intermodal growth. And we've talked frequently about the strength of our international franchise, and a continued shift mix from West Coast to East Coast ports, and our strategic alignment with shipping partners who are adding capacity to the East Coast.","Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. So, in that 5% outlook, do you have assumed domestic intermodal volume growth exceeding international?","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","It approximates, and so we feel like there is a level of conservatism in our plan.","Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. Mr. Squires, I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for concluding comments.","James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you all for questions today, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Clay Moore, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Clay.","Clay Moore - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Thank you, Rob, and good morning. Before we begin, please note that during today's call we may make certain forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important.","The slides of the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors Section along with our non-GAAP reconciliation. Additionally a transcript and downloads will be posted after the call.","Now it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman President and CEO, Jim Squires.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's third quarter 2018 earnings call. Joining me today are Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer; Mike Wheeler, Chief Operating Officer; and Cindy Earhart, Chief Financial Officer.","Starting with our financial highlights on slide 4. We delivered another quarter of record financial results. Income from operations was over $1 billion, an increase of 14%. Net income was $702 million, up 39% over the prior year. And earnings per share was $2.52, a 44% increase.","The operating ratio of 65.4% is a third quarter record for our company and marks the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating ratio improvement. As 2018 draws to a close, we are poised to achieve another year of solid OR improvement and strong bottom line results.","Given the progress we've made in the last three years and the likelihood we will meet our current financial goals well ahead of schedule, we are moving forward on the next round of initiatives to drive shareholder value. We look forward to briefing you on these new initiatives and the associated financial targets at our upcoming Investor Day on February 11 in Atlanta Georgia. Please save the date.","Now to provide further insight into our third quarter results, Alan will cover trends in revenue. Mike will give you additional color on the state of operations and Cindy will detail our financial results.","I'll now turn the call over to Alan.","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide 6. The success of our market approach is clearly demonstrated by sustained growth revenue, revenue per unit, and volume. This quarter marks the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue gains, with seven quarters of strengthening RPU and eight quarters of volume improvement. For five consecutive quarters we achieved steady year-over-year increases in RPU less fuel which is hugely important to operating income.","We have succeeded despite the negative mix impact of continued strong volume growth in intermodal with balanced and consistent RPU increases in all three of our business units. The increase in intermodal RPU coupled with productivity improvements consistently enhances intermodal profitability, auguring well for the future given that intermodal remains one of the fast growing segments of the freight market.","The strength of our multifaceted plan generated revenue, RPU and volume growth across most markets in our intermodal and merchandise business units. Our balanced focus on margin, price and volume continues to produce revenue growth, benefiting our top line as well as operating income.","Slide 7 highlights the results of our plan that generated 10% revenue growth in the third quarter. This gain was the product of sustained volume improvements, higher pricing and increased fuel surcharge revenue. In merchandise we achieved record revenue, RPU, and RPU excluding fuel in the third quarter. Volume growth was led by gains in ethanol and crude oil. RPU grew year-over-year for the tenth consecutive quarter, highlighting our emphasis on pricing.","For the fourth consecutive quarter, intermodal achieved record revenue with two consecutive quarters of 20% year-over-year growth. This increase was generated by records and volume and RPU less fuel. A strong economic environment coupled with a tight truck market continues to drive demand for Norfolk Southern's intermodal franchise, resulting in significant growth. Pricing gains led to substantial improvement in RPU less fuel and RPU during the quarter.","Coal revenue was up 3% in the third quarter with positive pricing and export volume growth that was partially offset by declines in our utility market. Our strategy delivered strong results in the third quarter with revenue and RPU increases in every business group, underscoring our commitment to competitive pricing as well as our ability to capitalize on market conditions. The continued strength and improvement in our top line metrics illustrates the confidence customers have in our approach.","Moving to slide 8. Our outlook for the fourth quarter remains positive. We expect revenue and volume to improve with continued strength in consumer demand and the industrial economy leading to growth in intermodal and manufacturing markets including automotive and plastics. The favorable differential in oil prices is expected to increase volume in our crude franchise.","Coal volumes are projected to be up year-over-year in the fourth quarter, driven","by growth in both the utility and export markets. Similar to the third quarter, we anticipate fourth quarter utility volumes to be in the 15 million to 17 million ton range. Export volumes are expected to remain in the 6 million to 8 million ton range.","Pricing to the value of our product remains a key element of our strategy and we expect that strategy to deliver year-over-year improvement in RPU in the fourth quarter. Our balanced strategy and franchise have positioned us for growth, allowing us to expand with both our existing customers and new customers, maintain a sharp focus on productivity and capacity and deliver results for our customers and shareholders.","We are integrated in our customer supply chains and consistently work to understand their markets, partnering for their success and enabling long-term value for NS shareholders. This sustained and balanced approach to both revenue and income growth is delivering results and we look forward to a strong finish in 2018.","With that I'll turn it over to Mike for an update on our operations.","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Thank you, Alan. We are pleased the velocity of our railroad continues to improve while handling record volume for a third quarter as well as achieving a record third quarter operating ratio for the company.","Moving to slide 10. Our reportable injury ratio for the quarter improved year-over-year and sequentially. The safety of our employees and the communities we serve continues to be our top priority and where we focus a lot of attention. Our service levels are improving as evidenced by our service composite, speed and dwell all improving sequentially. Additionally, our network velocity as measured at the car level is currently near our highest levels for this year. All four measures are currently pacing at or ahead of our third quarter performance.","Turning to slide 11. In addition to improving service for our customers, we're also driving improvement in our efficiency. A record third quarter train length helped drive an all-time record crew productivity for Norfolk Southern. Specifically, we handled 5% more volume with just a 2% increase in crew starts. We also achieved an all-time quarterly record for fuel efficiency. All of these factors combined to help us achieve a record third quarter operating ratio as well as an all-time record OR for the first nine months of the year.","Turning to slide 12. To drive further improvements in the velocity of our operation, we are undertaking the development of a new operating plan. The first step is to streamline the railroad which will allow us to move assets faster and create capacity for our customers to grow. This process, something we refer to as Clean Sheeting, starts in the terminals and local serving yards where cars tend to accumulate as they navigate the first or last mile of their trip. The goal is to increase fluidity by reducing car inventories, accomplished in part by increasing service frequency for customers. We also work cooperatively with the customers to create efficiencies in service. We are encouraged by the results we have seen so far as Clean Sheeting underpins our new operating plan going forward.","As seen on slide 13, our new operating plan will be built on key principles. As mentioned, it starts with Clean Sheeting which will drive car level velocity higher and lower cars online. This will allow us to build more blocks of traffic in the local serving yards that can be picked up by a through train, bypassing the major classification yards. We will also work with our customers and short line partners on additional blocking opportunities. The blocks will be integrated into the system using different train types and drive further velocity improvements and efficiency.","Lastly, we are continuing to evaluate our assessorial program to ensure high asset utilization and capacity for growth. We will provide more details on these operating plans at our upcoming Investor Day in February, including our expectations as to the value we are creating through the new operating plan.","I will now turn it over to Cindy who will cover the financials.","Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Thank you, Mike, and good morning. As Jim said earlier, we've delivered another quarter of record financial results. Let's take a look at the details starting on slide 15.","As Alan discussed, we had strong revenue growth of 10%, which when combined with the smaller increase in expenses resulted in the second consecutive quarter of income from railway operations up over $1 billion, 14% higher than last year. We also achieved a record third quarter operating ratio of 65.4%, improving on last year's results by 110 basis points. Just as a reminder, 2017 results have been recast to reflect the required reporting reclassification of certain pension and post-retirement costs.","Slide 16 illustrates the component changes to operating expenses. In total, operating expenses increased by $152 million, or 9%, primarily driven by higher fuel prices and volume-related costs. Fuel rose by $76 million, primarily due to higher prices which added $65 million. Consumption was up 4% over the prior year relative to the 5% increase in shipments.","Purchased services and rents increased $73 million or 19%. About half of the increase was attributable to higher expenses for purchased services including volume-related increases, additional transportation and engineering activities, as well as higher technology costs. Higher equipment rents expense reflected slower network velocity, the cost of additional short-term locomotive resources, as well as the growth in traffic volume. We expect about half of these additional equipment rent costs to come out in the fourth quarter.","The materials and other category increased $38 million or 23%. Last year's gains on the sale of property were approximately $36 million more than the current year. We have also incurred increases in derailment related expenses and additional costs associated with the ongoing relocation of our dispatchers to Atlanta.","This year also includes higher locomotive material usage costs due to more locomotives in service. These amounts were partially offset by $20 million of rental income associated with operating property, which you will recall is now included in this expense category.","Finally, compensation and benefits decreased by $46 million or 6%. Incentive compensation was $45 million lower than in the third quarter of 2017, based on the timing of accruals, which were a headwind in the third quarter last year.","Reduced head count levels saved $10 million over the same quarter last year. Headcount was approximately 320 positions fewer than in the third quarter of 2017 and down about 100 sequentially.","Consistent with the first two quarters, lower health and welfare rates also resulted in savings of approximately $8 million versus last year. Overtime and recrews added $15 million of costs.","And moving to slide 17, you can see a summarized look at our record third quarter results. Income before income taxes increased 14% and we achieved record third quarter net income of $702 million, up 39% from last year. Diluted earnings per share was also a third quarter record of $2.52, a 44% improvement year-over-year.","Wrapping up our financial overview on slide 18, free cash flow for the first nine months was a record $1.6 billion and over $2.9 billion has been returned to shareholders via a 19% increase in dividends as well as share repurchases through both the previously announced accelerated share repurchase program and our ongoing open market purchase program. Our share repurchase programs underscore our confidence in the business as we continue to drive growth and create shareholder value.","I'll conclude my remarks by saying the third quarter financial results demonstrate our continued commitment to deliver on our strategic plan objectives and to drive ongoing improvements. Thank you for your attention and I'll turn the call back to Jim.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Thank you, Cindy. Guided by the strategic plan we announced in late 2015, thanks to the hard work of our management team and employees we have consistently achieved the results we promise shareholders. This year we are on track for another year of OR improvement and strong bottom line growth and we are confident we will make further progress next year and beyond.","In the last few months, we have begun overhauling our railroad from top to bottom, leaving no stone unturned in the quest for efficiency, growth and shareholder value. As we revamp how we operate, we will listen to our customers and find new ways of meeting their needs. We will use our knowledge of our company to innovate from within. We will bring in outsiders where they have experience or skills we lack. We will collaborate with our supply chain partners and others to learn their best practices and, yes, as you just heard from Mike, we will implement PSR principles where they lead to a better result for customers and shareholders. All of the above, we are open to all good ideas that will advance customer service and shareholder value regardless of the source.","In summary, we are excited about the momentum we have today and intend to deliver on our promises in the future as we have in the past. We look forward to announcing new financial targets at are Investor Day in February and to showing you the path we will take to get there.","Thank you for your attention. We will now open the line for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question is coming from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. It's certainly great to hear about implementing precision railroading. Jim, just on one of your last comments you mentioned that you guys are trying to implement it as long as it improves customer service and enhances shareholder value. So is there anything that maybe you see in PSR that may not fulfill those two initiatives?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Well, Allison, as I said, ours will be an all of the above approach to improving customer service and productivity. We will implement PSR principles where they can allow us to better serve our customers and shareholders along with ideas we get from our customers, our supply chain partners, from those both inside and outside the company today.","We will endeavor to implement a new operating plan while minimizing service disruption. And we're not going to sit out growth while we do so. This remains an environment very conducive to growth and we're determined to capitalize on it.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Just, I guess, thinking about that. Does that tell us that maybe you're not fully embracing it? Like we've seen at CSX? And perhaps maybe you're taking a similar approach as Union Pacific. Is that a fair way to think about it?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","We're looking at everything out there including elements of PSR that are complementary to our strategy. So it's too soon to go into the specifics of our new plan. We will give you those specifics in February along with the new financial goals, but suffice it to say, our goal is to produce a railroad that provides a more consistent service product at a lower cost.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, great. And then if I could just get in my follow-up question. Could you help us to frame or quantify how much the network inefficiencies cost you in the quarter? I know that there were some elevated equipment costs and some derailment costs and, of course, the network velocity and whatnot. Maybe if you could help us to understand what the impact of that was in the quarter? Thank you.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Sure. Well, we did have some lingering service-related busts as we indicated we would last quarter. Cindy can give you some more specifics on the individual line items. But despite the additional expenses we were able to produce another quarter of year-over-year operating ratio improvement and significant incremental margin from the growth. Cindy?","Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Sure. Allison, you're right. We did continue to have some network velocity costs. We have not quantified those really since the first quarter. We do continue to see them come down somewhat. You did see some elevated equipment rent. As I pointed out in my comments, we expect about half of the increase of what you saw in equipment rents to come out in the fourth quarter. And we expect velocity cost to continue to come down as the service improves.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thank you so much for the time.","Operator","Next question comes from Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company.","Jason Seidl - Cowen Securities","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I want to switch it up and talk a little bit about intermodal here for a minute. Obviously, you've been growing in that area and that's part of your growth plan going forward. We're still in a fairly tight truck market right now, but as you guys know that changes over time. Can you talk about the plan and how much it's predicated on trucking capacity being tight out east and what Norfolk can do to grow that even in, let's say, a flat truck market as opposed to a tight truck market?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Alan, I'll let you take that one. Let me say, though, that intermodal has been a consistent grower for us through tight and less tight truck markets. Alan?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Jason, we've grown our revenue in intermodal year-over-year for eight consecutive quarters. And as Jim notes, that includes a very loose truck market at the end of 2016 and early 2017 and then what we're experiencing right now. We're very encouraged by what we're hearing from our channel partners with respect to the outlook for next year.","We still expect truck rates to go up. We still expect intermodal loadings to go up next year and there is a gap there between intermodal pricing and truck market pricing that we're going to lean into and to be able to price into.","Jason Seidl - Cowen Securities","And I'll link this to your new operating plan. And I understand the details will be given at the Investor Day, but how crucial is the new operating plan to continuing to grow intermodal? And even more importantly, continuing to realize the price for your services?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Alan?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Jason we have a great intermodal franchise. And we run a lot of point-to-point trains in that franchise. And we're working very closely with our customers and within the operations division on improving the productivity. And you're seeing that reflected in bottom line results. And we're going to continue to focus on price. We've talked earlier about the cadence of pricing opportunities within intermodal would last well into 2019. We still expect that to occur and we're going to continue to focus on productivity.","Jason Seidl - Cowen Securities","Appreciate the comment, as always.","Operator","Our next question comes the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks and good morning. So I was wondering if you could talk about the timing and scale of implementing this new operating plan. Just wanted to get a better understanding of how we should think about the rollout and, as you go through this process, would you be open to the idea of bringing someone in with PSR experience in some of these operating principles? Or do you feel confident with the team you currently have in place?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Justin, let me take the second part of that question and then I'll let Mike talk about the sequence of events. Obviously we are going to give you more detail on the new operating plan in February. We have brought in those with PSR experience and we will continue to do so, recognizing that we don't have a monopoly on good ideas and that we can benefit from the perspective of those outside the company who have implemented PSR principles and other best practices. Mike?","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yes. So talking about our plan, we are currently doing the Clean Sheeting now. We're currently out across the railroad looking at our local serving yards and terminals and working with customers in how we get that done. And we will be doing that for several months now.","And at February at the Investor Day, then we'll start telling you about what we're going to do with the operating plan that's been developed from the Clean Sheeting that we've done across the railroad. But there'll be different cadences to this. We're going to do certain changes to the operating plan, get that in place, get the benefits of that across the supply chain and then we'll take another step forward, harvest some more benefits. So it's going to have cadence too where we do some, do some more and continue to get the benefits.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And secondly, it seems like one of the areas of focus in the new strategic plan will be reducing equipment on the network. You mentioned cars online. Do you have any initial thoughts on how locomotives and rail car needs could change over the next couple of years? Just curious what you see as the targeted size of your equipment fleet relative to where it is today?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","We'll give you more information on those kinds of targets in February. Obviously, better locomotive and freight car productivity will be key elements of the plan. As Mike went through, one of the big goals is to drive down cars online and increase overall network velocity. That implies significant productivity in both locomotive and freight car categories.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. I'll leave it at that. Thanks for the time.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, operator. Hi, everybody. So I fully appreciate, I guess, the time it takes to form and communicate a new operating plan. So we can certainly wait until February for that and I look forward to that. But a plan I think is probably devised with some specific targets in mind or some philosophical view about what the returns in the business should be either on an absolute basis but probably more appropriately relative to what the benchmarks are achieving in the space. So I know I asked this exact same question last quarter. So forgive me. But Jim, as you think about what the company is managing to now actively, are there any structural reasons for the profitability in Norfolk Southern to be any different than CSX in kind of over a mid- to long-term timeframe?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Our financial objectives in the next long-range plan will be the same sorts of objectives that we have driven toward in the current long-range plan, i.e. both top line growth and, of course, earnings growth through a combination of revenue and margin improvement. The latter being critical to financial success in our industry. We certainly recognize that and will be pushing hard for significantly lower operating ratios in the next plan.","We will also be focused on return on capital. That too is a critical metric in our industry. The railroads being a capital intensive business, we focus heavily on return on capital. So you will see objectives in each of those categories in February and I can assure you they will be aggressive goals. We're working hard on them and putting in place the specific initiatives that will allow us to drive shareholder value.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you for that. And then just one follow-up for me. Last quarter you and Cindy talked about the balance sheet being evaluated to have an optimal capital structure. I fully understand the operating plan takes maybe a long time to formulate, but the balance sheet action should be, I think, relatively straightforward given your communications with the credit rating agencies. You did raise some debt. You did an accelerated share repurchase relatively recently. Is that all we should expect on that front or should we expect some communication or can you update us now on where you think the optimal leverage for the company is?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","I'll turn it over to Cindy for her thoughts on financial strategy, but let me say again what we have achieved thus far. In 2018 alone for the year-to-date, $2.9 billion in capital returned to shareholders via a 19% increase in dividends and the ASR normal course share buybacks. Cindy?","Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","We will continue to evaluate the balance sheet. But I will say that, as we said, in the last quarter that we feel pretty comfortable with the credit bands that we're in and kind of sitting in the middle of that range. We will continue to look at it and we continue to talk about that and we'll update you again in February. But for now I think we're comfortable in that range.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Okay, guys, thanks so much. Good luck with everything, appreciate it.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, thanks, good morning guys. First wanted to start on the pricing side. Alan, you kind of mentioned a little bit of what was going on in the intermodal side. I think you also mentioned some improvements on the coal side too. But as you take this, start to think about 2019, presumably there is sort of a bigger percentage of your contracts that may come up in the earlier part of 2019.","Just want to get a sense of maybe how we should be thinking about the momentum? Is there an opportunity to get better price in 2019 or some the factors that you're kind of seeing now potentially with volume decelerating, at least growth decelerating a bit, will that have an impact? Just want to get a sense of maybe how you're thinking about the setup in the context of the new operating plan you're doing, will pricing will be a greater tailwind in 2019?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Chris, great question. Pricing is going to be a key component of our plan moving forward, as it is now. The price that we secured in the third quarter was the highest level that it has been in six years and we set a quarterly record for price within our intermodal franchise. As I've noted, we see a lot of strength and support for pricing moving well into 2019, particularly in truck competitive markets. Coal pricing is going to be dictated by seaborne coking coal prices, which right now remain elevated, and natural gas prices which right now are fairly strong. There's a lot of strength in our truck competitive markets. And so we continue to see opportunity and momentum within pricing for our intermodal and our merchandise franchise.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, okay, that's helpful. And then just maybe a detail question here, when you're thinking about head count, I guess maybe putting the new operating plan aside for the time being. As you're thinking about the next quarter or two, maybe this is a question for Cindy, how should we be thinking about the cadence of head count growth or contraction? You've had a nice deceleration here. Volume growth continues to be pretty decent. Just want to get a sense of where you're getting to the point where you feel like you might have to start adding resources either sequentially or year-over-year?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Cindy?","Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Sure, Chris. So if you looked at head count and said we were down about 300 year-over-year and down about 100 sequentially. We were hiring T&E in the third quarter. And we had actually increases in our T&E head count, but we were able to reduce the areas other than T&E to kind of keep that number down or relatively flat.","Going into the fourth quarter, we expect to continue to be hiring some T&E, particularly in our main corridors, but we will also continue to try to manage the non-T&E head count. So you can expect to see it flat, maybe up slightly into the fourth quarter. And then into 2019, we'll talk a little bit more about that as our plans come together.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Flat to up sequentially in 4Q. Just want to make sure I'm clear on that?","Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yes.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question is from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. So with regards to the new plan, have you started it now or is it something that you formulated and you plan on implementing and telling us about on February? Just trying to understand whether the results are something we can see on a continuous basis or is it something that kind of starts at a certain time in the future?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","We have begun implementing the Clean Sheeting part of the new operating plan. So yes, that has been underway for some time now. We've been going across the railroad from location to location Clean Sheeting as Mike has described. And we'll continue to push hard on that until we have laid the foundation through the Clean Sheeting process for a new operating plan for the network.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","And part of prior plans at other railroads entailed a fairly significant head count reduction and quite a change in the infrastructure within each of the organizations and we've heard \u2013 you would have seen very significant reductions in number of hump yards and so on. Your approach in the past has been a little bit more balanced, I think you've termed it, Jim. Will this plan be more aggressive on head count reduction and infrastructure changes or continue to be more on the balanced site?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Labor productivity being a key component of overall productivity and a necessary component of further progress on the operating ratio, we will be focusing on that element of the plan. Certainly, as we grow out the new operating plan we would expect to achieve greater labor productivity as well as asset productivity through fewer locomotives and freight cars out on the network.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","But is that incremental, or in prior plans we've seen 30% reductions in labor force. We've seen 75% reductions in number of hump yards. Improvement could be a little bit or a lot. I'm trying to get a sense of are we incremental improvement? Or is it along the lines of these other very significant changes in infrastructure and labor force?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","We'll give you more details in February. But as I have said, we do expect to put some aggressive ambitious goals out there for the operating ratio and for further overall financial improvement. Labor productivity and asset productivity, network productivity will be absolutely part of that and will be necessary to achieve those goals.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, thanks. Morning, guys. Can you give us any sort of hurricane impact in the quarter and any sort of guidance on incentive comp year-over-year for the fourth quarter?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Okay, Mike, why don't you take hurricane question and then, Cindy, talk a little bit more about incentive compensation.","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah, we weathered the hurricanes really well. Hurricane Florence came on land and we were able to restore our main lines pretty quickly, within 24 hours. We did have some of water impact around New Bern that we had some of our bridges underwater, but we were able to use short lines to re-route traffic to some of our major customers. So Hurricane Florence was really a short-term impact to us. We got the railroad up very quickly.","And same thing with Hurricane Michael, it moved across our network pretty quick. We were responding right behind it as it came in, pretty much removing trees and putting generators out at signals and grade crossings, and again, got the railroad up very quickly.","So both storms that moved right through our network, we were able to recover quickly. And really that's a testament to our engineering folks who staged a lot of equipment, assets, generators out in the right locations so that we could recover quickly and we did. So we had very minimal impact and were able to get the railroad up very quickly.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Cindy?","Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yes. In terms of the cost of the hurricane, I mean I think all of our preparation work really paid off. And the costs were really not significant at all in terms of the hurricane. On your second quarter around incentive comp, you'll recall and I said in my comments that third quarter of 2017, we had a large incentive comp adjustment. We did an adjustment in 2018 in the second quarter.","Going into the fourth quarter, it will really depend on the company performance as to whether there's any sort of adjustment to incentive comp. So we'll just have to wait and see how we do as the fourth quarter continues.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","But nothing obvious on the year-over-year comp good or bad for 4Q, Cindy?","Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.","No, nothing.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then, Jim, you mentioned that you've brought in some precision railroad in people. Can you maybe add a little bit more color there? Is it senior people? Is it people in the yards, just how many people? Just maybe a little bit more there would be helpful.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Well, we have people on the ground with PSR experience assisting us as we move through Clean Sheeting. We also have people who are advising us on the new plan as we put it together, the new operating plan, the new strategic plan, with that kind of a background. So we feel we have covered the bases and, as I said before, we know we don't have a monopoly on good ideas. We are open to best practices including but not limited to PSR.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","But are you sort of open to adding to the C-suite or executive levels if appropriate?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","I have total confidence in my team. And I believe that we have what we need in that team to deliver the results that we will lay out for you in February, just as we have delivered the results for you up to this point for the last three years.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you, guys. Appreciate the time.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, good morning, everyone. Alan, wanted to come to your revenue outlook because it looks like you have pretty bullish comments across your three segments here, merchandise, intermodal and coal. I just wonder if you could balance that in the context of the looming tariffs on a lot of Chinese goods that could be implemented in January. Have you have heard any concerns from your customer base around what's upcoming in 2019?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Brandon, what we're seeing is a little bit of inventory stockpile or inventory pull-ahead. However, you take a look at the macro data, the inventory sales ratio remains flat and at a pretty low level which indicates the demand for product is pretty strong. You take a look at manufacturing in September was up 5.1% year-over-year, the strongest gain in almost eight years. Retail sales in the third quarter were up 5.9%. So the economy remains very strong. The tariffs add some uncertainty to what our customers are thinking, however the underwriting economy as represented in the macro numbers is very strong, which gives us a lot of confidence in our volumes and our revenue in the fourth quarter and well into 2019.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay I appreciate that, Alan. And then, Jim, maybe a little bit more strategic one. And I don't want to focus necessarily on your competitor. But if CSX were to run at a significantly lower operating ratio and we've seen them improve system velocity, and I know it's not defined the same anymore. But is that a concern for you if you can't get your cost base down equal to your competitor? Is there a lot of traffic that potentially could be at risk as you look out over the next couple of years?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Well, let me state what I think is the obvious. We are focused on enhancing value at Norfolk Southern, leveraging our franchise and we have for the last three years fulfilled our commitments to shareholders. Think about it, think back. Over 500 basis points improvement in the operating ratio in three years, double-digit EPS growth, ahead of schedule on both of those metrics, which we laid out three years ago, substantial shareholder value delivered.","So we will continue to push for the best possible result at Norfolk Southern. We're very confident in our prospects and we'll give you the details on the new plan in February.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, Jim. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Turan Quettawala with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your questions.","Turan Quettawala - Scotiabank","Yes. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I guess just talking a little bit about PSR here. One of the other things that does happen is quite a bit of an improvement in CapEx. And you talk about obviously reducing cars online and so on and so forth. Should we assume just sort of directionally that CapEx should be going down here going forward or do you think it is sort of stays aligned little bit?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","We believe that 16% to 18% of revenue is an appropriate range for capital spending. We believe that's necessary in order to sustain our franchise and to invest for growth. In addition, we have significant expenditures now and on the horizon for locomotives. We're in the middle of a substantial locomotive conversion program and we intend to continue layering in new locomotive acquisitions as well.","Turan Quettawala - Scotiabank","Okay. Thank you. And I guess just one more. I don't know if it's possible to give some early indications on coal here for next year just on the export side. Obviously, this year has been pretty strong on export coal. Just wondering do you think there's potential for further growth in the coal franchise in the export side next year?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Certainly, the seaborne prices have increased as the year has progressed. And if that holds into next year and coal production comes online, then, yes, we could see growth in our export coal franchise next year.","Turan Quettawala - Scotiabank","Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your questions.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yeah, good morning. We've seen some pretty credible press reports about you relocating your headquarters from Norfolk to Atlanta. This morning you just announced a February Investor Day to be held at Atlanta. I know this isn't a done deal, but can you talk high level. Is this synergy play just to get management closer to the operating team, a local talent pool play or really just more about cost reduction? And maybe just a little bit about the real estate situation that's creating this opportunity and whether or not you'd expect that to be net cash positive to your investors?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","We are considering headquarters relocation to Atlanta as has been reported in the press. It is not a done deal. A number of aspects of the relocation still have to come together for it to become a reality for us. The impetus for headquarters relocation is alignment and teamwork. It's our belief that we will function more effectively as a team, we will be more aligned if we are in one place.","We do own property in Atlanta which we have been seeking to sell for some time now. And that would be one aspect of headquarters relocation that would need to be resolved before we do it. And we will certainly report to you as we report our results, any real estate gains that might accompany that transaction.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, good morning. So I wanted to ask you about I guess the broader review on the approach on PSR and so forth and the financial target. As you in February, as you think about that backdrop, how much does a review of probability of the segment play in? I think a component we've tended to see with PSR at other railroads is you look through the book and say, okay, maybe this is a piece of business we're not making a lot of money on. We can see some of it go away or we pretty significantly change the service that we offer. So I'm just wondering is that part of which are you doing here in PSR or the other strategic? Or you think the volume you have is good volume and you don't need to see some of it move away?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","What you have described, Tom, certainly is a part of the strategic review that we have underway. Now that's something that we do all the time. We're always looking at our book of business and seeking to optimize its profitability by one means or another. So that's ongoing. That's not necessarily new, but yes, at a high level, we are doing that as part of the new long-range plan. Alan?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Tom, you see us continue to take a look at our intermodal franchise. And we have announced some lane closures over the last year, year and a half, and yet still have shown eight straight quarters of volume improvement. Those actions and the productivity improvements that they generate as well as the pricing opportunity has really helped us improve the profitability of our intermodal franchise and allowed us to reinvest in it. As Jim noted, this is an ongoing effort across all of our business units. So it's nothing new, it's part of good housekeeping that we do every day.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, good, that's helpful. And then maybe just one on the current dynamic in the truck market, how that affects you? I think, it's hard to tell, it seems like broader freight backdrop is pretty strong. That said, do you see evidence of softening in the truckload spot market, maybe not so much on the contract side. Have you seen some kind of wrinkles of weakness coming in? And how do you think about the kind of how tight things are and the outlook for pricing going forward?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Tom, our channel partners have indicated to us that they're expecting a very strong fourth quarter. And with consumer confidence being at an 18-year high, we expect that to continue well into 2019. Our contract structure will allow us to continue the momentum with pricing. So we're very confident about volume opportunities and pricing opportunities in the truck competitive environment for the remainder of this year and in next year.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Right. Okay. So you really haven't seen signs of weakness?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","No.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you for the time.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your questions.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Good morning. Jim or Mike, I guess, I just wanted to understand what changed through your process and maybe mindset here as you kind of step over to this Clean Sheeting PSR process. You've always talked about this is the right plan for you in terms of focusing on top line growth. And I guess maybe just to understand, is this kind of an evolution of that same plan? Or a complete overhaul and looking at your peers saying we need to shake that up? And I guess within that, Mike, I don't know if you want to maybe walk through the process of Clean Sheeting in terms of what you've been doing so far?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Well, Ken, let me respond first and then I'll turn it over to Mike. Certainly, we are looking to change the way we operate. That's necessary. The network has evolved over the years. It's time for a major network overhaul, an operating plan overhaul anyway. So that's something that we are focused on as a natural development in the life of the network, if you will. It's time for that kind of a bottom-up review of how we operate.","So certainly the underpinnings of it are organic in that sense, driven by our customer base, our mode of operations up to this point, and the need to continue to push productivity and efficiency while preserving the capacity for growth. Mike, a little bit more about Clean Sheeting?","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah. This is evolutionary. As Jim noted, we've optimized our networks in the past and now we're going to take the next step and optimize them together. But Clean Sheeting is really a deep dive at our local serving yards and the nodes to that area. And we bring our service design folks in. We bring our customer service folks in. We bring marketing folks in. We look at all the local service schedules and we make sure they're synced up as good as they can with the main train network.","We talk to customers about how we get traffic in and out of their facilities quicker, get them through our yards quicker. So it's a deep dive at all of these nodes across our network which are the local serving yards. And it's a pretty intense work that we do. We do it over several weeks and then we come out of there with a better, more efficient operating plan and you saw some of the results we showed you.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So does it go so far as to just looking at improving the performance at those yards? Or does it step back in terms of the Clean Sheeting in terms of your network structure, right? So when you look at the peer now that's I guess ripping up the hub and spoke concept of intermodal. I know, Alan, you mentioned closing some lanes, but does it structurally change how you think about even the yards themselves?","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","So what happens is after the Clean Sheeting is done then you're able to put the train plan network in a more optimal fashion where you get the benefits of what you've done with Clean Sheeting. Does that answer your question?","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. No, appreciate the time. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. It'd be great to get a sense for \u2013 one of the tenets of your plan here is that you're going to be integrating some of the other segments into the merchandise network. I'm assuming you're talking about intermodal and merchandise. Exactly how separate have those networks been running to-date and can you give us some sense of how much of the networks are actually going to be integrated.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Mike, you want to take that one.","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yes. So our multilevel and intermodal networks have pretty much been integrated for several years. And Alan noted the productivity we've got out of those. So those have been integrated. Merchandise has been optimized and developed on its own. And then the bulk network's kind of been mainly its own separate network. So those are the three separate networks. We have done some integrating of different parts of that but not at the level that we're looking at for the next operating plan.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And I guess as you start to think about putting the premium traffic in with some of the carload traffic, is that going to have an impact do you think on the services that you're actually able to offer to the marketplace as opposed to having one, two, three day a week service? Are you going to be able to offer a broader set of service as well as we move through the next couple of years?","Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yes, absolutely. This is intended to make sure we actually provide more service to the customer. So yes, that's what we expect.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","The frequency of service certainly can increase under this new operating plan we believe. Our goal, as I said earlier, is to achieve this with a minimum of network disruption. That doesn't mean service won't change to some customers however. It will. It will. There will be different service parameters in some cases. Our goal is to provide a more consistent lower cost service product.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I guess just within your markets, Jim, right obviously in the Eastern part of United States I would imagine that getting to a more frequencies on a day a week basis would give you a significant advantage relative to truck. Is that right? Or am I thinking about that wrong?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yes, that is true and that also can result in cost reduction because of the increased velocity of the network.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey good morning, thanks for taking the question. Maybe just go to Alan on domestic coal. You mentioned in the slides in the prepared remarks there was some increasing demand on utility coal. Could you give us a sense of where the stockpiles are, what the winter setup looks like from a network and equipment perspective? And then just any outlook with natural gas here, cracking above $3 for the first time in a long time?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Good morning, Brian. Stockpiles have largely declined over the last year. In the North they're at about 50 days. They've declined about 30 days in the last 12 months. And in the South, they're at about 65, 66 days and we estimate they've declined about 22 days within the last year. And so you see that setup for increase in demand for our services in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of next year. Obviously with natural gas prices closer to $3.25 or $3.20 that helps too because, as you noted, that's up about $0.22 per million BTUs to where it was this time last year.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, got it. And then on the export side, I know you gave some color on that already. But was there any impact from the hurricanes as they came through the network? I know you don't really have any storage capacity at Lamberts Point, but is there any sort of catch-up that you would expect to hit the fourth quarter?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","We had a force majeure within our coal fields for about three days earlier this month as a result of the hurricanes. And so you'll see a little bit of catch-up associated with that. We also did some maintenance at our Lamberts Point facility as well. So we fully expect that, assuming good production, that export volumes will ramp up sequentially week-over-week as the quarter progresses.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Alan. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our final question is from the line of Matt Reustle with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.","Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions here. Just first on the PSR initiatives. Can you differentiate how much of this is an opportunity for you to just improve your own results, how well you run your business, versus how much of this is something that you need to do to bring down the cost structure to fend off competition as the trucking market eventually does recover and as your peer in the East has brought down its own cost structure?","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","We believe that by implementing best practices developed from within, developed with our customers in our consultative process, developed with our supply chain partners, and including our PSR practices can lead to both a better and more consistent service product and a lower cost structure.","Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. And then just quickly on crude, seeing a nice pick up there. Are most of those barrels coming in from Canada? Or are you seeing any split between the Canadian mix versus the Bakken mix and if you have contracts or you're part of the contracts tied to those barrels?","Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Yeah, Matt, most of our increase in crude oil volume is the Western Canadian select, which as I'm sure you're aware is very much in the money. There is a great arbitrage opportunity on the East Coast for that. So that's where we're seeing the volume growth. We expect it to continue in the fourth quarter and continue well into 2019.","So we're optimistic about our volume outlook for the remainder of this year, whether it's in coal or intermodal or merchandise. And we expect that to continue in 2019 both for demand for our product and our ability to price.","Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I'll turn the floor back to Jim Squires for his closing remarks.","James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.","Thank you, everyone, for your questions today. We're excited about the momentum we have. We intend to deliver on our promises in the future as we have in the past. We look forward to announcing new financial targets at our Investor Day in February and to showing you the path we will take to get there.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Hostutler, Norfolk Southern Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Hostutler. You may begin.","Michael Hostutler ","Thank you, and good afternoon. Before we begin today's call, I would like to mention a few items. First, the slides of the presenters are available on our website at nscorp.com in the Investors section. Additionally, transcripts and MP3 downloads of today's call will be posted on our website for your convenience.","Please be advised that any forward-looking statements made during the course of the call represent our best good faith judgment as to what may occur in the future. Statements that are forward-looking can be identified by the use of words such as believe, expect, anticipate and project. Our actual results may differ materially from those projected, and will be subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which may be outside of our control.","Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for discussions of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important.","Also, keep in mind that all references to reported results, excluding certain adjustments, that is non-GAAP numbers, have been reconciled on our website in the Investors section.","Now, it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern Chairman, President and CEO, Wick Moorman.","Charles Wick Moorman","Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. It is my pleasure to welcome you to our Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are several members of our senior management team, including Don Seale, our Chief Marketing Officer; Mark Manion, our Chief Operating Officer; and Jim Squires, Chief Financial Officer. All of whom you will hear from this afternoon.","I am very happy to report that Norfolk Southern had another outstanding quarter. Our results included second quarter records for both revenues and income from railway operations. Diluted earnings per share of $1.60 represent an all-time high, and the operating ratio of 67.5% equaled our best-ever quarterly performance.","Beginning with the top line, revenues for the second quarter rose 1% to $2.9 billion. Similar to the first quarter, volumes were up 1%, despite a 12% decline in coal traffic. The overall volume increase was led by double-digit growth in automotive, as well as domestic intermodal. And as usual, Don will provide you with all of our revenue details in a few minutes.","On the expense side, we reaped the benefits of improved rail operations, which provided for higher asset velocity, larger roadway maintenance windows and reduced equipment usage. These allowed us to hold down cost increases in wages, purchase services and equipment rents, as well as providing a high level of customer service.","Jim will give you all of those financial details a little later.","With respect to service, we were able to maintain our superior service levels from the previous quarter, as the second quarter composite service index remained at 83%.","In addition, we handled a 1% increase in traffic volumes with a reduction in crew starts of 2%, and Mark will give you all of those details in a few minutes as well.","On all fronts, we continue to strive for improvement. Our capital program and technology initiatives, both of which should benefit future quarters and years, are on or ahead of schedule and meeting our return expectations. Our cash flow is strong, and it enabled us to pay $308 million so far this year in dividends, an 18% per share increase versus 2011.","We've also repurchased 12.3 million shares for a total of $850 million through the first half of the year. And these items are clearly indicative of our belief in the continued success of Norfolk Southern.","I will now turn the program over to the team, beginning with Don. And I'll return with some closing remarks before we take your questions.","Donald W. Seale","Thank you, Wick, and good afternoon, everyone. During the second quarter, our diverse portfolio of markets generated record second quarter revenue of $2.9 billion, up $8 million versus second quarter 2011 despite a weaker coal market.","Both our merchandise and intermodal networks achieved all-time revenue records, up 9% and 4%, respectively, while coal revenue was down 15%, driven by declines within the utility sector.","Revenue per unit at $1,597 was down $7 or less than 1\/2 of 1% compared to last year. Total volume grew by 1%, or 12,400 units. In terms of yield, our merchandise sector posted another all-time record of $2,576 per unit, up $115 or 5% versus 2011.","3 of the 5 business units, which comprise merchandise, set all-time highs: Paper, Chemicals and Automotive.","Revenue per unit within intermodal was down $3, as a result of increased volumes of shorter haul local eastern highway conversions and lower fuel surcharge revenue.","Revenue per unit in coal declined by 4% in the quarter due primarily to increased market competition in our export market segment and a record level of shorter haul export coal via the Port of Baltimore, along with higher volumes of lower revenue per unit steam coal exports.","In total, revenue per unit for the quarter was down $7 per unit.","With respect to volume, as shown on Slide 4, total volume for the quarter was up 1%, or over 12,000 loads, as intermodal and merchandise gains offset weaker coal volumes. Continued double-digit volume gains within domestic intermodal, which was up 10%, resulted in a 5% increase in total intermodal shipments for the quarter.","The 4% volume increase in merchandise was led by gains in Automotive, Metals & Construction and Chemicals, which more than offset the 3% decline in Paper.","Now, drilling down into our major markets, starting with coal. Revenue for the quarter of $755 million was down $138 million, or 15%, due primarily to a 12% decline in total coal volume. As shown here, we were able to reduce coal transportation crew starts by 14%, outpacing the 12% volume decline, thereby creating positive operating leverage in our coal network.","Breaking out our coal market segments on the next slide. Utility coal, which is the largest driver of our overall decline in the quarter, was down 21%. Utility volumes were impacted by competition from natural gas, as well as reduced demand for electricity due to milder temperatures.","Export volume posted a 6% gain for the quarter. Reduced metallurgical coal volume through Lamberts Point, which was down 6%, was more than offset by a 27% increase in total shipments via the Port of Baltimore. Volume through Baltimore set an all time monthly record during June, and hit a new quarterly high as well.","New export steam coal also drove volume gains for the quarter, as steam coal rose to 30% of our total export volume in the quarter.","And finally, domestic metallurgical volume was up 2%, as continuing demand for automotive steel was offset by reduced volumes of iron ore due to the recent closure of RG Steel in Warren, Ohio.","The next slide depicts the relative length of haul across our coal book of business and the respective percentage of total coal volume accounted for by each market. As I've indicated previously to you, there's a market difference between length of haul for our northern and southern utilities, with the latter averaging about 200 more miles than the former. And while our export business represents the longest length of haul for any of the coal markets, volume changes across various export segments impact overall revenue per unit.","For example, steam coal exports and Port of Baltimore traffic have lower revenue per unit characteristics than met coal exports via Lamberts Point in north.","Now let's turn next to our intermodal network. Intermodal revenue in the quarter reached $563 million, up $23 million or 4% over second quarter 2011, driven by 5% higher volumes.","As shown on the next slide, our volume increase in intermodal came mainly from double-digit gains within our domestic market segment, which was up 10%, or over 39,000 loads for the quarter, due primarily to highway conversions.","Premium volume was up 3% due to increased demand, while the International segment declined 1% as volume reductions associated with Maersk were partially offset by growth across our international customer base.","As with the first quarter, we saw significant improvement in the stacking of containers across our network. In the second quarter, 87% of all containers moved on stack cars, which was a 10-point improvement compared to the second quarter of 2011. This helped to create additional capacity and efficiency across the network. We also achieved noteworthy efficiency improvements in intermodal crew starts for the quarter, as we handled 5% more volume with 3% less intermodal crew starts in the quarter.","In our domestic book of business, we continue to convert freight from the highway to our key intermodal corridors. During the second quarter and the first half, volume increased 22%, along our Crescent Corridor. We also experienced a significant increase in business over the Heartland Corridor, which was up 27% in the quarter.","And our business over corridors reaching the Gulf and New England markets were up 14% and 3%, respectively, for the quarter.","Along those same lines, we are pleased to announce that the first of our new Crescent Corridor terminals opened its operation July 1. Our new Memphis terminal is open for business and will soon be followed by Birmingham and Greencastle, both of which are scheduled for completion later this year.","The new Memphis facility will substantially increase our capacity in this strategic market, which will accelerate highway conversions into our Crescent Corridor. It also holds solid potential for East Coast import shipments as well.","Now wrapping up with our merchandise sector on the next slide, revenue for the quarter at merchandise reached $1.6 billion, up $123 million or 9% over last year.  As I mentioned earlier, this was an all-time revenue record for our merchandise business, surpassing the record that was previously established during the first quarter. A 5% gain in revenue per unit, combined with a 4% volume increase, led to a 9% overall revenue growth for the quarter. And merchandise crew starts were up 2% versus the 4% increase in volume, again, representing improved operating leverage across this book of business.","In terms of the market segments within Merchandise, Automotive, which was up 16%, led the volume gains for the quarter. Project growth with several manufacturers, along with higher auto sales, helped drive our performance.","With the average age of light vehicles in the U.S. now nearing 11 years, pent-up demand has been fueling new car sales, which were up 22% during the month of June, 16% for the quarter, and we're now on page for an annual rate of 14 million units in sales.","Now let's turn to our Industrial Product segments. In Industrial Products, improved domestic steel production and project growth drove steel volumes up 5% in the quarter. And miscellaneous construction volumes were up 16%, due mainly to continued strong demand in materials associated with natural gas drilling.","Chemicals volume was up 3% for the quarter, due to new crude oil business from the Bakken and Canadian oilfields, as well as a 5% gain in shipments of plastics. For the quarter, agricultural volume was approximately 150,000 carloads, essentially flat with last year. Corn volume was down 16%, which reduced shipments to several poultry and ethanol producers, while the increased feed volumes were up 19% for the quarter, offsetting the decline.","Our Paper segment was the only Merchandise sector to experience a volume decline for the quarter. Reduced shipments of municipal solid waste, along with weaker volumes of pulp and graphic paper, were responsible for the majority of this decline. This was partially offset by lumber, which was up 6% in the quarter.","Now concluding with our outlook for the rest of the year, we expect that utility coal volumes will continue to be impacted by high stockpiles. And to the extent that natural gas prices remain at historic lows, the overall market demand for utility coal will be affected. But with much higher temperatures across our utility network and with some mitigation in natural gas prices recently, we're beginning to see some customers add train sets and increase orders of coal. In fact, over the last month, the estimated average stockpiles in our utility network have declined by 14%.","We expect domestic met coal to show moderate strength ahead as demand for steel to support auto production continues into third quarter. The growth in this segment will be tempered due to the closure of RG Steel and the unfavorable comp associated with that event.","In our export coal markets, we see weaker demand ahead in Europe for both steam and met coal, while opportunities in Asia should help offset this softness.","Within our intermodal sector, conditions remain favorable for continued highway conversions. The opening of our Memphis terminal on July 1, along with other terminal openings later this year, will support higher volumes ahead.","In addition, shipments with key international and premium customers are expected to drive growth going forward, which will mitigate the unfavorable comp in international over the second half of the year.","Finally, the outlook for our merchandise business remains largely positive, as growth in crude oil and plastics and continued demand for automotive and energy-related transportation help drive volumes higher. In terms of the agricultural sector, as I'm sure most of you have already noted, the USDA recently lowered projected corn yields by 20 bushels per acre, which is a 12% reduction from their previous forecast.","Intense heat and drought conditions across the Midwest have taken a toll on crops, and we will continue to monitor harvest conditions, but at this point we expect a weaker fall grain harvest.","And now to summarize, we remain optimistic that our diverse franchise will generate volume growth ahead despite headwinds in coal and ongoing economic uncertainties.  And we remain fully dedicated to providing industry-leading safety and service to our customers, while realizing market-based pricing that equals or exceeds the rate of rail inflation.","Thank you for your time. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark for our operations report. Mark?","Mark D. Manion","Thank you, Don. Good afternoon, everyone. Starting with safety, we ended the second quarter with a ratio of 0.73, that's an 11% improvement over the second quarter last year. We continue to keep employees focused on safety and service.","Reduced injuries and accidents and safe on-time delivery is a winning combination for our employees and customers. Our employees gain improved quality of life, we reduced our costs, improve our operating performance and gain business. Our workforce continues to drive these improvements with their commitment to safety and service.","Turning to service, as expressed in our composite service metric, for the quarter, we posted a composite performance of 82.9%, an 8% improvement over the same period last year. The improvement is led by train performance, but all the service components, train performance, connection performance and plan adherence, showed significant year-over-year improvement.","We have continued the gains we saw in the first quarter. Improved resource availability has improved network velocity, operating performance and service, continuing the trend we've seen for the last several quarters.","Performance remains at historically high levels not seen since the second quarter of 2009, but with 27% more volume.","Turning to the next page, measures of network velocity also reflect improved operations. Train speed for the second quarter improved 2.6 miles per hour, or 12%, over the same period last year. Like the service composite, we're approaching our record-setting 2009 velocities but with significantly more traffic.","Terminal Dwell, the second major component of network velocity, also showed continued improvement in the second quarter compared to the second quarter last year, a reduction of 2.3 hours or 10%, outpacing even our 2009 performance.","Turning to the last page, those improvements in network velocity are reflected in continuing improvements in productivity and asset utilization. Compared with the second quarter last year, train and engine service overtime has been reduced 16%, re-crews have been reduced to a sizable 31%. Equipment rents have reduced as a whole, with a portion of equipment rents driven by velocity, has been reduced by 9%. Locomotives in service have been reduced by 4%, fuel consumption reduced by 2% and gross ton miles per gallon improved 1%.","This quarter, and in fact, the last 3, punctuate the importance of having the right resources in place to run the network. As we've seen, when properly applied, those resources drive service and velocity. Our customers receive both superior service and productivity is driven to the bottom line.","And now, I'll turn it over to Jim.","James A. Squires","Thank you, Mark. I will now review our financial results. Similar to the first quarter, we set second quarter records for most measures and all-time records for our operating ratio and earnings per share.","Let's start with our second quarter operating results. As Don described, our railway operating revenues for the quarter totaled $2.9 billion, up $8 million compared to the second quarter of last year. These results include a $61 million favorable fuel surcharge lag effect.","Railway operating expenses decreased to $51 million or 3% for the quarter, reflecting improved operating efficiencies and effective cost control. Income from railway operations totaled $934 million, up $59 million or 7%.","Our operating ratio, aided by the fuel lag, was 67.5%, a 200 basis point improvement. Both measures reflect second quarter records, and our operating ratio set an all-time quarterly record.","Turning to our expenses. The next slide shows the major components of the $51 million net decrease. As displayed on the following slide, the $22 million decrease in fuel expense was due to reduced prices and consumption. Our average diesel fuel price per gallon was $3.15, 3% lower than last year, as fuel prices fell throughout the quarter. Diesel fuel consumption decreased 2% relative to a 1% increase in volume and a 1% decline in gross ton miles, a continuation of the favorable productivity gains we shared with you last quarter.","Next, materials and other, decreased by $17 million or 8%, reflecting more favorable personal injury claims development and lower materials spending. Compensation and benefits decreased by $15 million or 2%.","Looking at the major components of this decrease on the following slide. First, employee activity levels were down $17 million due to reduced maintenance and a more fluid network.  Second, health and welfare costs were $7 million lower, primarily reflecting favorable experience in our agreement with labor premium rates. We anticipate that this favorable second quarter rate-related experience will be offset over the remainder of the year or largely related to the increase in our employee base.","Third, payroll taxes decreased $4 million. And these favorable results were partly offset by increased pay rates and higher incentive compensation. Purchased services and rents decreased $13 million. Similar with first quarter, we've benefited from the reduction of equipment leases and lower equipment rents due to network velocity improvements.","Reduced haulage expenses were offset by increased costs associated with higher intermodal volumes and professional consulting fees.","The 8% increase in depreciation reflects our larger capital base, and is consistent with first quarter's results.","Turning to our non-operating items. Higher interest expense on uncertain tax positions was partially offset by net increases in other miscellaneous income items. Interest expense on debt was up by $9 million due to increased net borrowings.","Next, income taxes totaled $319 million, and the effective tax rate was 37.8%. Income taxes in the second quarter of 2011 were $239 million, with an effective rate of 30%.","The higher effective rate primarily reflects the absence of 2 favorable prior year items. First was the resolution of an IRS examination of NS' 2008 return and review of certain claims for refund totaling $40 million. The second was for state tax law changes that reduced deferred tax expense by $19 million.","Net income and EPS comparisons are displayed on the following slide. Net income was $524 million, a decrease of $33 million or 6% compared to 2011. Diluted earnings per share was $1.60, an all-time record, exceeding second quarter 2011 by $0.04 per share or 3%.","Lastly, as displayed on Slide 13, cash from operations for the first 6 months was $1.7 billion, down slightly from last year. Operating cash easily covered property additions. Free cash flow, plus net borrowing activities, provided for share repurchases and dividends. Cash and cash equivalents equaled $356 million at the end of the period.","Thank you for your attention. And now, I will turn the program back to Wick.","Charles Wick Moorman","Thanks, Jim. As you've heard, Norfolk Southern produced excellent operating and financial results for the second quarter, the product of our continuing operation of the railroad high service levels, along with strength across many of the segments of our diverse and balanced franchise.","Obviously, our results were particularly strong in light of the continuing substantial decline in our utility coal franchise, which is a large and profitable component of our book of business. Mark and Jim have already discussed the benefits of operating the railroad at its current levels. And we feel confident that we will continue to do so as coal volumes return and as our other business grows, even in the face of significant network disruptions such as the storms that we experienced across the mid-Atlantic state a few weeks ago.","However, as important as those operating benefits are, perhaps even more important are the service benefits to our customers, as we make shipping on Norfolk Southern an even more attractive option.","But, as well as the railroad is running today, we're still not satisfied, and we have plans underway in terms of the new capacity, technology and process to drive asset velocity and service delivery at our company to even higher levels over the next few years.","Looking ahead at the third quarter and second half, Don has already outlined our outlook for continuing weakness in our coal business, as well as where we see opportunities in other areas of our franchise. Stepping back a little more, we remain concerned about the broader economic landscape. While the data is not completely clear, there is a growing belief that the U.S. economy is slowing a little, and it does seem clear that Europe has slowed even more.","Combining those factors with some moderation in growth in China, as well as issues like the upcoming fiscal cliff and sequestration, makes our always hazy crystal ball even more murky than usual. That being said, while the short-term outlook may be cloudy, we remain very optimistic about our longer- term prospects. We have a great franchise, and we're investing in smart ways to make it even stronger. The new Crescent Corridor intermodal terminals are a terrific example of building facilities that will provide a significant competitive advantage for us and set the stage for even more growth in our intermodal network.","Technologies like LEADER and UTCS are now starting to pay dividends as well. And as I mentioned earlier, we see other opportunities to speed up our networks and enhance our customer service even further.","We are also optimistic about our ability to grow over the longer term. Our combination of superior service and network abilities, along with project-driven growth, should enable us to drive our merchandise and intermodal businesses to growth at higher than GDP rates, and at pricing levels that continue to meet or exceed the rate of rail inflation.","As for coal, the weather will normalize, and gas prices will eventually go up. And we're optimistic about the prospects for continued growth in export thermal coal in the near term, as well as for export metallurgical coal over the longer term.","Our goal remains what it always has been, to manage the company as effectively as we possibly can through whatever economic conditions exists, with a focus on efficiency, customer service and returning value to our shareholders.","We have a great team at Norfolk Southern, and I'm confident that we'll continue to do just that. Thanks for your attention, and I will now turn it over to the operator to moderate your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Dahlman Rose.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions. One on the coal front, you talked about some new export steam coal. Could give us a little more color about that, remind us when this started, and about how much, in terms of tons, it added this quarter?","Donald W. Seale","This is Don. We handled right at 2.5 million tons of steam coal in the quarter. To kind of give you the color of this, in the first quarter, we only handled 9% of our export for steam. And it ramped up to 30% export steam coal in the second quarter, sequentially.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I guess I will stick on coal a little bit here. You talked about how you had a couple of customers that were taking train sets, and then you saw stockpiles decline. I mean, it's still going to be a challenging 3Q, I assume, for coal based on some of your commentary. But sequentially, can you give us some flavor on what you're expecting for the sequential utility coal outlook compared to 2Q?","Donald W. Seale","Well, certainly, it's going to be a challenging second half. Stockpiles are still above target, as I've mentioned. It is encouraging that we're seeing natural gas back to $3.11, $3.12. If the hot weather continues, I think we will see that rate probably continue to go up for gas as demand continues to go up for utility generation. So in all, it's really based on the weather for the rest of the summer, and the shoulder months that we're going to see in September, October as to whether or not coal, utility coal, really starts to move late in the fourth quarter, mid fourth quarter or it gets geared up for early 2013.","Operator","Our next question is from Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Thinking about your coal franchise, your East Coast competitor is talking a bit about utility coal in the East having moved from base load to surge. And their mix of utilities served is quite a bit different than yours. And I'd love to get your take on how you see the next couple of years playing out in terms of the shifts that we've seen this year, and how that's going to translate, in your opinion, on a go-forward basis? So I guess, to rephrase, is the East now completely in a surge from a coal power generation standpoint? Or do you still feel like the majority of the utilities you guys serve are base load coal?","Donald W. Seale","Justin, this is Don. We see strongly that our coal utility generation is base load. It's certainly not surge capacity. In that regard, with the heat that we've had from -- starting the second week of June up through the current period, we're seeing all of our coal-fired utility plants run as base load. And we're being advised by our customers to that regard -- in that regard.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, I guess, the second question I want to ask you guys, on the automotive side, obviously, that's been one of the bright points in the U.S. economy in the first half of this year. You stated the case of an old fleet on the road, which is something that we've heard quite often. But more specifically, when you talk to your customers and you look at the plants on your line, how do you see the back half of the year shaking out from an auto standpoint? What kind of volume growth are you guys budgeting as you think about that? And is there any -- are there any cracks in that armor that you guys are seeing at this point in time that would lead you to believe there's any risk in that?","Donald W. Seale","At this point in time, with a run rate on sales of about $14.1 million and total production approximating 15 million, we think the second half is poised for good growth in the automotive market. If housing continues to move up in a marginal way, which it is right now, we're even seeing some increased demand for utility trucks and pickup trucks associated with that sector. So it's encouraging. We certainly don't see a significant leap in housing, but it's encouraging to see it move from an annual rate of about 650,000 to about 760,000. And the reason I'm mentioning housing, it does have a positive support for a segment of some of the automotive business and [indiscernible] demand in the age of vehicles.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Trahan.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","So Don, with the total yields pretty flattish, I'm wondering if you could help kind of give us some color on the impact of fuel and mix in the quarter so we can try and get a bit of a better sense of what underlying pricing is in the quarter?","Donald W. Seale","The year-over-year increase in fuel revenue, Scott, was only $4 million for the quarter. So it was marginal with respect to the delta year-over-year. We did have a lot of moving parts with changes of length of haul across all of business. In intermodal, and let me take that first. In intermodal, as I've mentioned in my comments, we continue to have increased local Eastern highway conversions that tend to be shorter haul, profitable business but lower revenue per unit. And also, I would remind everyone on the call that our fuel surcharge in intermodal is based on an on-highway diesel fuel, which is subject to weekly changes and has no lag. So we saw on-highway diesel fuel expenses decline from the first quarter to the second quarter, which impacted revenue per unit, along with the mix of traffic. So that's intermodal.","In the green business, in our ag business, I mentioned, which -- deals were flat on 150,000 cars. Then we hauled less long haul corn traffic to ethanol producers and to feed mills, but we handled more-- 19% more feed, finished feed, to the river, for river terminals, which is shorter haul, attractive business but a different set of characteristics than long-haul unit train corn. So -- and then on the coal side, I mentioned the moving parts with respect to revenue per unit. Certainly, market competition at the export market is more intense this year than it was last, obviously. Second, we set a record at Port of Baltimore, which is shorter haul, attractive export coal. Thirdly, we handled more lower revenue per unit steam coal, attractive but lower revenue per unit than met coal. And then finally, in the coal sector, which I did not mention in my prepared remarks, is that we got an increase in shorter haul utility business in the Midwest, both from Illinois Basin source coal, as well as Powder River Basin coal coming to us over the St. Louis Gateway, terminating in Illinois. That's a lot of moving parts, but it should give you a pretty good feel for some of the RPU drivers.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","That's very helpful. So it feels like overall mix was a headwind of a few percentage points. But overall, pricing kind of in that, maybe in the 3% to 4% range, which feels like a deceleration from where we've been in the past few years. I don't know if you think that, that's a fair characterization. But if so, what do you think is driving the relative deceleration in pricing, not just for you but from we've seen from some of the other rail reports so far?","Donald W. Seale","We feel that we're still pricing equal to or in excess of the rate of rail inflation, which is running between 2.5% and 3%, north of that. So we're comfortable where we're pricing. Frankly, we have not seen a deceleration per se. But one would have to say that the market is not quite as strong as it was this time last year, or anything for transportation or just basic market demand.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay, that's helpful. And just last thing, Don, the slide with the length of haul in the coal segment, that was really helpful. Any chance that you have the numbers for the percent of volume for each of those segments for the year-ago period?","Donald W. Seale","Yes, those percentages on the slide show, we can give you that data, we just didn't include it in the slide. But, yes, we can give that to you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of William Greene with Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I'm curious what you think about the idea that the weakness in coal, is there a silver lining here? How much of that is in fact the driver behind the productivity gains that you saw? So if coal remains weak, is there an argument for sustainably better margins, which is actually kind of remarkable given how profitable we all think coal is?","Charles Wick Moorman","Bill, I'd say that no, we don't look at it that way. In any particular business segment, we obviously adjust to the extent that we can in terms of train operations, if business goes up or down. Don mentioned that we were able to reduce crew starts in coal by 2 percentage points more than the volume loss. But no, I don't -- looking at Mark. Mark, I don't think you would say that?","Mark D. Manion","No, I wouldn't. The only place where it would have some effect is it frees up more locomotives. But we've got plenty of locomotives anyway. So that would be the only real...","Charles Wick Moorman","Yes, if we were tight for resources, really tight for resources, you would see an acceleration and velocity in the network. But we're operating the network at a high velocity, anyway.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, okay. That makes sense. Wick, on the last call I sort of asked you about the idea of deregulating coal, just given the competition with natural gas. And I know that's sort of probably way in the future if it ever happened. But given that it's still a largely regulated commodity domestically, is there a case for raising pricing now that we've had this decline in coal? Because I would think that the assets that are dedicated there really haven't moved that much, and yet obviously, you're earning far less on that business. Does that make sense, or is that just so tone deaf in the market that it doesn't make sense?","Charles Wick Moorman","Well, Bill, when I heard your suggestion last fall, the 2 words that sprang to my mind were pure genius. And in fact, we had some conversation about that. I think in a rational world, that is an argument that can make some amount of sense, given the dynamics of natural gas, the ability of the utilities to do a lot of switching and sourcing, where they want to generate power. Having said that, I think that from a practical standpoint, it's not an argument that would go very far.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And so is there an argument, though, in this regulated world that the lower level of volume means we need more price?","Charles Wick Moorman","I think we would have to watch that play out in the regulatory arena before we could answer that.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan Chase.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to ask a question for you, Don, on export coal. It sounds like you think you're going to see weakening in both steam and met in the European market, which is your primary market. So how does that -- should we translate that to a decline year-over-year in export coal in the second half, or am I overreading your comment on a weakening European demand?","Donald W. Seale","We're very concerned about Europe across-the-board, with both met and steam. As I mentioned in my comments, and you've seen the record increase in imports into China, they were up 60% for the first half of this year, all-time record. As I've mentioned, we believe Asia will help us offset most of the softness in Europe, and we expect our export coal in the quarter -- in the third quarter to be positive.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. So export ton is positive year-over-year in the third quarter?","Donald W. Seale","Yes.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Let's see, on the -- let's see, the comp and benefit side, you had, let's see, which slide this is, there is a breakdown on that, and you showed employee activity levels, rated favorable, about $17 million year-over-year. Is that -- it sounds like that's primarily a function of running your railroad well, and train speed is up and so forth. Is that number something that you can see? If you put up the same slide in third quarter, fourth quarter, could we see a favorable benefit like that recur? Or is there something unusual about that, it would only be applicable to the second quarter?","James A. Squires","Tom, it's Jim. What we think, we'll see a continuation of that trend. That's a pure byproduct of more efficient operations and higher velocity out on the railroad, and we should see that sort of benefits sustained through the rest of the year.","Donald W. Seale","We saw it in the first quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee from Citigroup.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Maybe just a question on the mix within export coal. I know you saw, seemingly, a pretty strong ramp-up on the thermal export side through Baltimore. I guess, based on your comments and kind of on the back of Tom's question about exports in the third quarter, should we assume a continued acceleration of thermal as a percent of total exports as we go forward? I guess, trying to get a sense of how that looks, maybe even just through the first couple of weeks of July.","Donald W. Seale","Well, we see it continuing to grow. I would not want to comment with respect to the percentages, but we expect it to continue to grow.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So that certainly will be part of the growth driver of export, total export tonnage as you look into the third quarter?","Donald W. Seale","Yes.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful, I appreciate it. And then switching gears onto intermodal side, Don, you mentioned some of the puts and takes on length of haul and growth in the Eastern half of the U.S. I guess I'm just curious how the pricing dynamic with truck kind of looks in the Eastern half of the U.S., particularly in the second quarter? Did you see any kind of pressure on the margin, as fuel prices kind of came down at all? I guess I just wanted to get a little bit more color on that, if I could.","Donald W. Seale","Well, we're certainly seeing a competitive truck market. But their cost pressures over and above fuel continue. And that's something that's getting us additional support in pricing in intermodal, in that market. One of the things that we're watching very closely is the age of the Class A tractor fleet, and it's now back to a 1999 level over 6 years old. And Class A tractor sales are off by double digits, so as much as 20% over the past quarter. So truck capacity, as well as truck costs, are still pressuring that sector, which is enabling us to continue to defer to prices that are acceptable to us.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just one quick stat, if you do have it. Do you have a sense of what the growth on the intermodal side, what's going on existing train starts as it stands right now? I know you gave the double stack percentage, but I'm just curious, I'm guessing most of it, but I'm just kind of want to get a sense there.","Donald W. Seale","Yes, what we are continuing to focus on is increasing the percentage of our total container traffic that is stacked, double stacked. And we've got our network completely cleared. We've mentioned that in previous calls, we're about 97%, 98%, cleared across the network. And we're taking advantage of that. So we're improving the efficiency of intermodal train service, and that enabled us to reduce the crew starts by 3% against the 5% increase in volume.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Peter Nesvold with Jefferies & Company.","H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess, I'm down to just a couple here. Can you quantify what the impact to yields was from fuel both overall, and then maybe, specifically, in the intermodal piece?","Donald W. Seale","Jim can address the lag in fuel.","James A. Squires","Sure. The lag effect was $61 million favorable in the quarter. And remember, what we mean by lag effect, that's a metric that captures the effect of the 60-day look back in the fuel surcharge mechanism. So it's strictly a timing phenomenon quarter-to-quarter, sequentially. The increase in fuel surcharge revenue on a year-over-year basis was just $4 million, as Don mentioned.","H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Any material difference between what they look like in intermodal versus the other parts of the business? I mean sometimes, the intermodal will reprice faster.","Donald W. Seale","In intermodal -- this is Don. As I mentioned previously, the lag does not apply, because we're using on-highway diesel fuel expense changes weekly to govern that as opposed to West Texas intermediate oil prices for the lag.","H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got you. And what's left on the buyback?","James A. Squires","We are down to a relatively small amount of remaining authorization on the buybacks. But we'll certainly be seeking and will expect to obtain approval from our Board of Directors for additional buybacks authorization.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Ceraso from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I have a question about inflation and productivity. I think you said railroad inflation for you is running in the low 2s. Can you think about productivity on that same basis? It looks like you generated an awful lot of productivity in the quarter. Relative to that, let's call it 2.5%, would you say you're on pace to do 3% or 3.5%, or what level of productivity do you expect to achieve this year?","James A. Squires","Chris, the tricky thing about measuring this productivity-- the productivity component of margin changes is isolating what is true productivity from investments in business processes or in technology, for example, and what is operating leverage from changes in traffic mix, in particular, the growth in general merchandise we saw in the second quarter. So because of that, it can be a little tricky to sort out. We're a little reluctant to quantify exactly what is the productivity aspect of that. But we are confident that we saw productivity and operating leverage both in the quarter, and we went through and tried to quantify some of the areas. In particular, we saw those dollars savings and compensation benefits and equipment rents and purchase services and fuel, for example.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And was there a tweak in your commentary about price? I think in the past, you'd said greater than rail inflation, and today, greater than or equal to. Or am I making that up?","Donald W. Seale","It was the same.","Charles Wick Moorman","Yes. We've said at or above -- I said meets or exceeds, and that's the language that we've used for a long time.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can you just, Don, talk through on the international coal side? You mentioned all the mix changes. Is there a difference in profitability between your terminals? Should we look at -- I know you're not going to give exact numbers, but if you look at growing that steam at Baltimore versus met at Lamberts, should we look into any profitability difference within that?","Donald W. Seale","Ken, I was asked the question last quarter about which of those we would prefer to handle, and I answered it both. Both segments are attractive for us. Certainly, steam coal is lower revenue per unit, because the market is different than metallurgical coal. It's still attractive business for us. And of course, Lamberts Point versus Baltimore, there's a mileage differential with respect to mine to port transportation supply chain. Again, attractive to us, just a different characteristic of the haul.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So if we look at your yields on the coal side, it came in down 4% on a revenue per car basis. Just to clarify that, was there anything going on in the domestic utility side that adjusted that? Or is that more a mix basis from the international export side?","Donald W. Seale","Ken, the international export was a big component. As I mentioned, we also had some Midwestern utility coal that was shorter haul, that also moved in the quarter in substantial volumes. One moved from the Powder River Basin going into Illinois over St. Louis to a utility, several moves from Illinois Basin originations. Our Illinois Basin originations were up 18% of our book -- or 12% of our book, excuse me, 12% of our book in the quarter. So that business continues to ramp up. And we had some moving parts associated with that.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But just to clarify, there were no, then, domestic price adjustments?","Donald W. Seale","Correct.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, just on the intermodal side. Can you talk about the capacity that you are adding with the new yards? And how quickly we can see that growth ramp up?","Charles Wick Moorman","Well, we're adding a substantial amount of capacity. If you look across the entire book of business, as you know, we measure terminals in terms of lifts. And that's not always directly equatable to carloads. But we're certainly adding, over the period of the next 1.5 years, a number of hundreds of thousands of lifts in terms of capacity. In terms of the ramp-up of business, we certainly don't expect it to be a cliff. We expect to bring these facilities online. As we bring the facilities online, we'll start to introduce new services. And we hope to grow quickly there. But it will be growth, I think, that we look forward to starting to realize in 2013.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Jim, if I could just come back to your comment about the $61 million fuel lag benefit. If I'm hearing you correctly, that's just the difference between the price of fuel you're paying for in the quarter and what you're recovering, right?","James A. Squires","That's correct.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So is that something we should assume a pretty similar level for the third quarter then, from a lag perspective, right?","James A. Squires","No, I think if you look at the trend in WTI, we'll see probably a neutral lag effect. There might be a little bit of a tailwind in the very early part of the quarter. But given the overall trend, we would expect it to be flat.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then I think you mentioned on the compensation side, and this comes back to an earlier question, that there was some rate realizations in the quarter that you didn't expect to continue. Can you just help us from a modeling perspective how to think about headcounts and wage inflation per head going forward?","James A. Squires","Okay. So just working down the changes in compensation and benefits expense in the quarter and thinking about how those are going to trend for the rest of the year, we covered employee activity levels that we would expect to see from the higher velocity more efficient network a continuation of that trend. Then, health and welfare benefits, I mentioned in my remarks, were favorable in the second quarter. But that one, we would look to turn around in the second half. And not to a major degree, but we would expect to see year-over-year increases in the second half in health and welfare premiums. And then, let's see, other items are relatively immaterial, I think the changes for the rest of the year. Pension and other post-employment benefit costs, retiree medical benefit costs will probably somewhat unfavorable on a year-over-year basis in the back half. Incentive compensation was modestly unfavorable in the second quarter. And that one, we would expect to turn around and perhaps be favorable within comp and benefits in the second half, partially offsetting the increases in some of the other items.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess if I could hear you maybe focus on the run rate in the second quarter, then when we were in the first.","James A. Squires","Probably, something along those lines. One other I should mention is the wage rates. We're going to see in the second half the effect of the July 1 wage rate reset on the agreement side. That was in effect in the first half as well. However, the -- it was masked somewhat by accrual changes we made last year as we were getting close to the finish line on the collective bargaining agreements last year. So on the agreement side of wage rates, year-over-year, we didn't see any increase in the second quarter. That flips in the second half, and we start to feel the effects of the wage rate increase that take effect July 1, sort of a blended 3%, 3.3% increase in the second half.","Charles Wick Moorman","If you look at our employee counts, they were stable, actually down just a few folks sequentially over the first quarter. We would anticipate in the second half that we might start doing a little hiring in our mechanical and engineering areas. We're looking that over. We know we're facing some significant attrition, that we're going to have to make up for, try and get ahead of just a little bit. And we also want to make sure that we're adequately staffing some of the very good capital programs that we have underway. But we don't anticipate anything really meaningful in terms of headcount changes.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Matt Troy with Susquehanna.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I wanted to ask about pricing, specifically, Don. How much of your pricing for next year, or how much of your business is currently under contract? And a derivative on that, how much of your pricing overall is tied to RCAF x fuel?","Donald W. Seale","Matt, the latter part of your question, first. Very little is tied to RCAF. It's de minimis at this point. The second thing is that we usually run with about 2\/3 to 70% of our business under contract. And at this point for next year, we're about 60% priced in.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. So when we think about that RCAF component being de minimis, even looking at RCAF x fuel, because if you look at the mechanism, there is a deceleration or deflation in pricing lift on how we define rail inflation, which the railroads use to benchmark pricing. You don't think that the deceleration in the RCAF x fuel metric is having a significant drag on pricing today up there?","Donald W. Seale","No, I don't, Matt.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And my second question, I think we all look at very similar economic metrics, market metrics on the dashboard of where the economy is going. I was just curious to hear your take on direct conversations you've had with your customers around their expectations around peak season. It's obviously shaping up to be lackluster to date. It's still early, but I'm just trying to get a sense of expectations of the cloud, and at least the press and Wall Street tend to be a little bit more alarmed about larger ahead of the trend? What you're really seeing from people that are actually moving stuff or expect to move stuff for a living about peak?","Donald W. Seale","That's a great question. The last week of June, closing out the quarter, we saw an all-time high in our intermodal loadings, about last week. And on the international side, for the quarter, if we back out the Maersk comp, our international volume would've been up 11%, as opposed to being down 1%. So we're seeing some fundamental strengths in the international business. And of course, the domestic business, as I mentioned, was up 10%. So looking on through the second half and into the fall, we believe that the traditional fall peak has been evened out. It starts earlier in the summer, because inventory carrying costs are so low. And more companies are taking inventory through the summer, into the fall. So we don't expect a traditional fall peak. We'll see a moderate increase in the fall, but we think a lot of that activity has already begun.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","So the caution there or skepticism we're seeing in the market, you're not really -- you're not having that permeate your customer conversations yet? It's more just slow growth, low growth, but not expectations for deceleration, is that fair?","Donald W. Seale","Yes, the slow growth is what we're hearing.","Charles Wick Moorman","Yes, I will say that we are hearing more and more, as you are, everyone is, some of the concerns that I was talking about earlier, as we get closer to the end of the year, any uncertainty growth, I think, more and more of our customers are getting a little more nervous. But no one seems to be taking definitive action yet in that regard.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just following up on the intermodal question here. And you pulled out the Maersk to give a good comp. And just wondering if you could go an extra level here, and look at what kind of traffic has come over to your system as a result of your very timely investments in double stacking and your corridor initiatives with a view to -- if how much is left if you're thinking, are we 90% done now that double stacking in this year is the lift we got from that? Next year, lapping those comps, we won't see as much? Or do you have, like you mentioned, you have some more initiatives planned, are we looking at a continuation of above normal growth in intermodal as a result of the initiatives that you're putting into your intermodal network?","Charles Wick Moorman","Well, as you said and as Don pointed out, we continue to invest in this network. You saw all of the growth rates that Don mentioned. Some of those, for example, Crescent in particular, are also still fairly low basis. We're making a lot of investments in major new intermodal terminals, and we have a very strong belief that we're going to have a service level that is going to be well-received in the marketplace, and we know there's a lot of traffic out there. So we don't see ourselves as 90% into this by any means. We think there is a lot of growth, and we're going to continue to invest to capture that growth. And as you've pointed out, Don's comp is an indication that even our investments in infrastructure out of the ports, the Heartland Corridor, investments we made to serve Savannah and the other ports, are continuing to pay dividends for us.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Absolutely, I completely agree. Switching gears a little bit, and over to Mark now, I guess, is last recession, there was obviously a response that you made to the downturn that rightly or wrongly criticized in terms of how quickly Norfolk Southern reacted to the downturn. Now I'm seeing in your discussions, at least, already talking about operating leverage and so on with the lower volumes even further, further lower crew starts and so on. Are you approaching the thought or the aspect of a weaker economy differently than you did in '09? And can you shed some color on the differences, if, in fact, you are looking at it differently?","Mark D. Manion","I think we are looking at it a bit differently. And you can see that in the second quarter, we were real conscientious about our cost control. And we will continue to be so coming up here in the second half. And the improved velocity helps in that regard, improved velocity helps us to reduce costs. It helps us control our overtime. It even helps us with our inventory control. So we've got a lot of things working to watch our costs very closely, and we're certainly going to do that in the third quarter.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Any changes to your furloughing strategy at all?","Mark D. Manion","Yes. Actually, what we have done is we have actually moved away from so much furlough. In fact, as we speak, we have got literally a handful of people that are furloughed. And instead, we've got a process in place where we will subsidize, if you will, some of the compensation for people that are not working as much as they would like to. And on many of -- not all, but on many of our extra boards that don't turn as quickly as they would with more robust business, we will give them the equivalent of about 4 days a week pay to the extent that they're not already getting that. So we are spending some money. And we feel like it's money really well spent, because it keeps those people active with railroads so that we do have them available when business turns up. And as you know, when you furlough, you're really rolling the dice as to whether people are going to stay with you, and then you've got rehiring costs and training costs and a lot of inefficiency associated with people that leave the railroad. So that's a pretty significant change.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Am I reading to that strategy as being perhaps cost might not come down as much during troughs, but better suited to capture rebounds? Is that a fair assessment of that strategy?","Charles Wick Moorman","Mark is exactly right. And it's a very good question. And I think that you have put your finger on one of the issues, which is that a lot of where we are doing, what Mark described, are places where we currently have weakness in our coal franchise. And if we continue to have a hot summer and gas prices go up in mid fourth quarter, which isn't far away, our customers, once they start shipping substantially more coal, we want to be ready to handle that coal.","The second thing that I think is different this time is that recall that our merchandise business has been strong. Our intermodal business has been strong. And we have to be very careful as we think about furloughs and cost reduction activity that we don't impact the rest of the network. Just because one very significant piece, but by no means the majority of the activity, is impacted, we really like, and our customers really like, the way the railroad is operating right now, the service we're providing. So Mark and his team are being very careful to make sure that we're not having negative impacts. Now this is compared to 2009 where nothing was up. Business went away across the entire franchise. When that happens, you take very different actions.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research","I think most of my questions have been asked. I wanted to ask you something, just really general. This is the second, if not the third, summer in a row where we sort of run into a soft patch in June, July. And so setting aside utility coal, I just wonder, as you look at your traffic patterns, talk to customers, what this year feels like last year? And what strikes you to think that maybe there's something different this time?","Donald W. Seale","This is Don. We really, fundamentally, don't see a lot of difference this summer versus last summer, other than the fact that gas prices continue to trend downward on the coal side and has impacted the utility coal franchise. Certainly, the ongoing news coming out of Europe, which seems to not get better but is continuing to be very concerning, that's different this summer than last. But from our customer perspective, I think in a macro sense, everyone is concerned, and Wick has certainly highlighted this, on a macro perspective, the election, the fiscal cliff, the uncertainty associated with that, that's all a backdrop that we didn't have as much of that last year. Other than that, customers have order books that are fairly stable.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research","Okay, that's helpful. And a very quick one. When you referred to opportunities in Asia to offset the weaker demand you're anticipating in Europe for met and steam coal, is that a met or steam comment into Asia or both?","Donald W. Seale","Both. We're handling both into China, Korea and Japan.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Anthony Gallo with Wells Fargo.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Intermodal question. The percent of containers that are stacked, you said 87% this quarter, 77% year-ago period. What do you think that was a couple of years ago? And if we look out 12 to 18 months, is there a theoretical cap on that?","Donald W. Seale","I don't have the number where we were 2 or 3 years ago. We can certainly go back and take a look at that. As far as the theoretical cap, at some point, we reached an optimum level where car supply is optimized with stacking. And we wouldn't want to reposition cars or generate an additional activity to get another 0.5% or 1% of stacking. I don't think we're near that point yet. We're very encouraged by the efforts we have that are generating the results that you see here in the quarter.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And if I try to think about the components that impact your intermodal margins, where does stacking stack, for lack of a better term? How does that rank? I know there's length of haul, there's RPU, but where does this piece fall into intermodal margins?","Donald W. Seale","Double stacking is the most cost-effective means of transporting both international and domestic containers. It generates the lowest cost per mile in our network for intermodal.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker with MorningStar.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Your productivity improvements slide cited a number of improvements like T&E overtime and re-crewing, curious, if these are due principally to lower coal volume or if other operating improvements contributed as well?","Donald W. Seale","Principally, the driver behind these things are the improved velocity on the railroad. And we essentially saw that in a larger way beginning about 7.5, 8 months ago and have every intention of keeping it up for the rest of the year.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And overall velocity number, we see the velocity is up in more sectors than just low volume coal segment?","Donald W. Seale","No, the velocity is across -- it's across the system. I mean, keeping in mind that we are handling, with the exception of some real defined business in the coal fields, we are calling all the different business groups on the same track with the same crews and the same locomotive power. So it's a systemwide thing.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","You mentioned pricing in excess of real inflation during the period. I might have missed this, but could you provide corn sort of the same railroad price increases maybe exclusive of coal?","Donald W. Seale","No. We do not provide that type of number.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","All right, let me try again. How about your observations on housing-related carloads perhaps, in particular if you're seeing any increased lumber similar, perhaps, Don, for similar regions more than others? So I guess, this is sort of a directional flow type of question.","Donald W. Seale","Our lumber business for the quarter was up 6%. So we're seeing from a lower base, obviously, a recovery mode. But it is encouraging that we're seeing that. And certainly, the Mid-Atlantic to Southeastern states, we're seeing probably a little more of a rebound in the Mid-Atlantic right now in terms of our lumber business versus the Atlanta market, for example.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of John Larkin with Stifel, Nicolaus.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I think Don mentioned that there was a fair amount of oil beginning to move from the Bakken and from Canada. Could you talk a little bit about how big that opportunity could be over time? Whether the Utica Shale is well-positioned around your network to perhaps generate some additional volume of this type? And whether your growth has been constrained by lack of available tank cars?","Donald W. Seale","Not necessarily. That's a great question. We see a significant growth opportunity in crude oil franchise from both Bakken and the Canadian oilfields. It's just beginning to ramp up. So it's early in the first inning with respect to that market. I will make a comparison for that market to the Marcellus Shale. Our Marcellus Shale input business was up 36% in the second quarter after being up over 50% in the first quarter. So the Utica Shale business adjacent and under Marcellus, as you know, will be the next tranche. And we do see a lot of leverage and opportunities with distribution facilities that have gone in that is supporting Marcellus when Utica ramps up. The tank car question, tank car rental charges have gone up significantly, and they are short. But as you know, a lot of tank cars being built in Mexico add to the fleet. So as this business continues to build, we'll see the tank car supply match up pretty quickly.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Are these very long-haul moves that ultimately end up either on the East Coast or on the Gulf Coast?","Donald W. Seale","We are handling predominantly Chicago gateway trains that run to the East Coast refineries, so relatively long-haul. But unit train in nature and not necessarily a revenue per unit that would equate to the average for chemical traffic, for example.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Got it. And maybe just a final question, it would be great if we get Wick's assessment of whether we'll ultimately see a delay in the deadline for the installation of PTC, number one. And then number two, do you have any reason to believe that something onerous might be coming out of the STB on the competition issue here in the next couple of months?","Charles Wick Moorman","The answer to your first question is yes. We will ultimately see a delay, primarily because, and this is something that we've been saying now for some time, we're just not going to make the deadline for the rail network. And that is not because of a lack of investment, as you know, our investment this year is close to $250 million, or a lack of effort. It's just a question of the scope and complexity and the very new nature of this technology. And as I say about this, ultimately, the laws of physics will prevail, and we'll get a delay. And I think more and more, the folks on Capitol Hill understand the issues and understand what's going on, and understand that we are making every effort to get this technology ready to go and to have it operate in such a way that the rail network can operate with the appropriate reliability.","In terms of your second question, the STB, yes. I got so upset thinking about PTC. The -- right now, there's a lot of speculation that they're going to do something this year on competition. I remain an optimist that they're not going to do anything that is damaging in any meaningful way to our industry. I think the STB understands that the rail industry is a tremendous success story in terms of its ability to reinvest, grow capacity, as well as do a lot of hiring. They see us putting enormous amounts of money back into our infrastructure, to grow even more. And it's a business model that works, and I think they will be low to do anything which might substantially impair our continued ability to earn an adequate return and to invest.","Operator","Thank you. We have no questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Moorman for closing remarks.","Charles Wick Moorman","Thanks everyone for your patience, and for joining us today.

With me today are several members of our senior team, including our President, Jim Squires; our Chief Marketing Officer, Don Seale; our Chief Operating Officer, Mark Manion; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart.","Norfolk Southern\u2019s earnings for the quarter were $1.17 per share compared with $1.41 last year, which as you will recall included a land sale that added $0.19 per share. Of course, our results during the quarter were impacted by the severe winter weather, which adversely affected both revenues and expenses. This year\u2019s results also included a deferred tax benefit related to a state tax reduction. Don and Marta will provide additional details in their remarks. Looking at our top line, revenues for the quarter were $2.7 billion, a decrease of $49 million or 2%. Overall, volumes fell 1% as declines in merchandise more than offset the growth in the intermodal units. Expenses were down 1% despite the added costs from the winter weather.","On the service side, we also saw the effects of the adverse weather as our favorable trends from last year were temporarily reversed in the first quarter. While our velocity and terminal dwell metrics deteriorated in the first quarter, we have seen them improve in the recent weeks and expect these trends will continue as we enter into spring and warmer weather. Mark will provide the details of the first quarter operating results.","At this point, I will turn the program over to Don and the rest of the team and I will return with some closing remarks before we take your questions. Don?","Don Seale","Thanks, Wick and good morning, everyone. First quarter revenue of $2.7 billion was down $49 million or 2% compared to first quarter of last year, as the $94 million decline in our coal market more than offset revenue gains achieved in intermodal and merchandise. Negative mix and price accounted for $38 million of the overall revenue decline for the quarter and lower volume due primarily to severe winter weather conditions generated a negative $32 million in revenue variance. On the plus side, higher fuel surcharge contributed a positive $21 million in revenue year-over-year.","Turning to revenue per unit, merchandise RPU showed the greatest increase due to continued growth in chemicals, increased fuel surcharge revenue and pricing gains. Intermodal RPU showed a marginal increase of 1%, despite a slight decline in fuel surcharge per unit. As a reminder, intermodal fuel surcharges are tied to East Coast highway diesel prices rather than West Texas intermediate crude. Coal continues to be impacted by negative mix effects related to the decline in export coal volume. In total, revenue per unit for the quarter for our book of business was down 1%.","With respect to volume, turning to the next slide, total shipments for the quarter were down 1% as intermodal gains were unable to offset declines in Merchandise, and especially in coal. Within all of our markets extreme winter conditions across the network impacted customer production levels, as well as equipment cycle times which suppressed overall first quarter volume.","As shown on Slide 5, the impact of severe winter weather was concentrated in January and February, with March showing a fairly strong recovery. Mark will fill you in on the details of the operational challenges faced during the winter, but clearly severe weather in the quarter depressed certain economic activity and shipments in the first two months of the year in particular.","Now turning to the individual market segments, coal revenue of $541 million was down $94 million or 15% for the quarter. Within the utilities sector, volume declined by approximately 21,000 loads or 10% while volumes to southern utilities held pace with first quarter 2013 volumes. Volumes to northern utilities declined by 17%, primarily as a result of a contract loss. Export volumes impacted by a continued weak pricing environment were down 23% for the quarter due to reduced metallurgical coal shipments both through Baltimore and Lambert\u2019s Point. Domestic metallurgical volumes were down 16% as a result of reduced customer demand related to plant shutdowns or production curtailments. And on a positive note, industrial coal volumes were up 9% as a result of new business gain.","Now turning next to our intermodal network, revenue in intermodal in the quarter reached to $596 million, up $23 million or 4% over first quarter of last year, driven by a 3% higher volume. Domestic volume was up 4% due to continued highway conversions and customer specific growth, while organic growth across our international accounts increased by 1%. As weather and network operations improved in the quarter, we had two record breaking weeks for intermodal shipments in the month of March.","Now turning to our Merchandise markets, on Slide 8, Merchandise revenue was up 1% reaching $1.6 billion for the quarter. This increase came as a result of higher revenue per unit for the quarter which was up 3%. Iron, steel, and scrap metal shipments were impacted by sourcing changes and a weaker overall market for scrap metal. Declines were partially all set by gains in track sand and cement shipments leading to an overall 3% decline in metals and construction volume in the quarter.","In our agricultural markets, strength in our corn and wheat markets was unable to offset declines in fertilizer volumes compared to strong 2013 level comps and ships and sourcing patterns reduced volumes of feed products due to the return of normalized soybean availability in the new crop. On the plus side, chemicals volume was up 10% due primarily to growth in crude by rail which accounted for over 20,000 shipments in the quarter as well as gains in liquefied petroleum gas volumes. Automotive volumes were down 6% as weather related issues across the U.S. rail network impacted empty multi-level equipment supply and reduced loading capacity. And paper and forest products volumes were down 5% for the quarter with weaker volumes of graphic paper and waste shipments.","Now let\u2019s conclude with our outlook for 2014. We see ongoing growth opportunities in our Intermodal and Merchandise markets, while the coal market continues to present both challenges and opportunities. On the plus side for coal, extreme winter weather patterns improved the demand for utility coal with stockpile days at Norfolk Southern served plants falling an estimated 34% from December.","Additionally, natural gas prices are projected to be higher in 2014 creating orders from utility for additional spot coal volumes. We now expect our utility business to be flat with 2013 in spite of the year-over-year loss of about 4 million ton contract loss in our northern utility network. In the export market we continued to see depressed export coal volumes and pricing due to lower commodity pricing and increased foreign competition. And in our domestic metallurgical markets we expect reduced volumes as a result of plant closures and sourcing shifts.","Turning to our Intermodal markets, our outlook remains bright there as we continue to add attractive freight to our new corridors and terminals. The South Carolina Inland Port opened in the fourth quarter of 2013 and our new Charlotte terminal officially opened in December 2013. Highway conversions and growth with our international shipping partners represent ongoing opportunities and we will remain strongly focused on delivering the superior intermodal service and efficiencies across our double stack intermodal network.","In our merchandise markets, we anticipate continued strength in crude by rail as well as shale-related liquid petroleum gas shipments. Frac sand and other materials used for natural gas drilling in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions are also expected to increase. Within our metals markets, U.S. steel production is projected to expand by an estimated 5% during 2014 due to increased steel usage in the auto sector and the recovery in construction market.","In automotive, automotive production will continue to grow as North American light vehicle production is projected to increase by 3% to over 17 million vehicles in 2014. Also as the national rail network improves velocity in the days ahead, we expect deferred auto volumes to be shipped, which will bolster overall automotive volumes ahead. In our agricultural markets, with the favorable grain crop and stronger ethanol market, we expect ongoing growth in these market segments for the balance of 2014. And finally, within our paper and forest products markets, we continue to be challenged by the contraction of graphic paper consumption, but see favorable conditions for lumber and related wood products with projected improvements in the housing market.","In summary, we expect our merchandise and intermodal markets to generate overall revenue growth ahead with a better outlook for utility coal, while export coal continues to present challenges. And as we recover from the abnormally harsh winter, we are focusing on returning service to 2013 levels or better, which our customers expect and deserve. We will also continue to employ market-based pricing that equals or exceeds rail inflation to support significant investments in our infrastructure and service delivery capabilities and we will remain laser focused on developing new markets by working collaboratively with our customers throughout our network.","Thanks for your time. And I will now turn it over to Mark, who will provide you the specifics of our first quarter operations. Mark?","Mark Manion","Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter operations were a weather impact story. The series of winter storms across our service territory has been well covered by the media. So, there is no need to give you a blow-by-blow timeline here today, but you will see the impact has been felt in safety, service and productivity. Our people however have done an exceptional job keeping our operations going through at all. Many of them worked in extreme conditions and I would like to acknowledge particularly the commitment of our transportation, mechanical and engineering forces and even our operation support staff in Atlanta, who never missed a beat during an ice storm that pretty much shutdown the city.","Looking at our safety performance, we saw an increase in the injury ratio from 1.17 for full year of 2013 to 1.37 for the first quarter of 2014. This is tracking the same numbers we experienced in the second half of 2013. Some of the increase is, no doubt, due to the operating conditions over the period and we did see an improvement in March, as weather began to improve. We continue to focus on a transition, behavior-based approach to improve safety and to secure full engagement and commitment from all our employees in reducing injuries. Training for our entire company will be completed by the end of the second quarter.","Train incidents were flat at 2.4 incidents per million train miles for both full year 2013 and the first quarter 2014. Crossing accidents increased slightly from 3.6 per million train miles for full year 2013 to 3.9 per million train miles in the first quarter. And again, the increases are related primarily to storm-related occurrences.","Training to service performance, after two years of very strong service performance, the recent shocks from severe winter weather and the resulting reduction in network velocity have had a significant impact on service this quarter. The composite service metric, which combines train performance and connection performance, dropped to 73.4% reflecting slower train operations and increased dwell time at terminals in the areas impacted by weather.","On the next slide, slower train operations are reflected in train speed, which was 22.3 miles per hour for the first quarter 2014, while higher than in 2010 and \u201811, below the high performance levels in 2012 and \u201813. Velocity drives many of our operating efficiencies and is our key area of focus in our recovery from the impact of weather issues in the first quarter.","Looking at terminal dwell, the impact of extreme temperatures and record snowfall took a toll on locomotive availability in the first quarter resulting in a higher bad order rates and a slower overall network velocity. Consequently, terminal dwell in the first quarter increased to 25 hours. Again, much higher than the record performance over the last two years.","Moving to the next slide, we have talked before about the relationship between network velocity and operating efficiencies. As you would expect, the weather and the resulting slowdown in our network had a negative impact on many of our key measures of operating efficiency in the first quarter. Volumes were down 1% from the same period last year. Crew starts were down 4% due in part to reduced volumes, but also due to train annulments and combos made due to power availability. T&E overtime increased 9% and recrews increased 5% due to slower over the road operations. Carloads per unit declined 3% due primarily to reduced train length requirements caused by extreme cold temperatures. And diesel gallons per 1,000 gross ton miles increased 4% partly because engines were left running during extremely cold temperatures to avoid freeze damage. With improving weather we are seeing improving trends in some leading measurements and would expect that this will also be reflected in network velocity over the coming weeks.","On the next slide, the impact of weather on our locomotive fleet has been particularly difficult, while weather related issues pushed the bad order ratio to higher levels. We started seeing improvements in mid-March with bad order locomotive counts declining, shown here as the blue line. Similarly as the red line indicates, we have seen trains held for power decline. The reduction in the bad order ratio and the increase in power availability will continue to drive reduction in terminal dwell. The next graph depicts the number of road train recrews.","With improving train speeds, the number of trains that have to be recrewed has come down substantially in the last few weeks. And looking at train speed, as you can see it\u2019s been improving since mid-February, up about 6% and the improvements should continue. Similarly, dwell is down 14% since mid-February and we expect this metric to continue to improve as well. With the winter finally behind us, we are confident that we will continue to see improvement in all of our operating metrics and we are still confident that we will achieve productivity savings of about $100 million for the full year.","Thank you. And now I will turn it over to Marta.","Marta Stewart","Thank you, Mark. Let\u2019s take a look at the first quarter numbers. Slide 2 presents our operating results. As Don described, railway operating revenues decreased by $49 million or 2%. Operating expenses decreased slightly by $25 million or 1% in spite of significant additional weather related costs. The resulting first quarter income from railway operations was $667 million, a decline of $24 million or 3%. The operating ratio increased 40 basis points to 75.4.","Slide 3 summarizes the major types of weather related costs. As Wick mentioned and as you saw in Mark\u2019s presentation the harsher winter weather this year slowed down the railway. This loss of velocity along with additional direct costs to keep the tracks clear and our equipment running drove expenses higher in the areas of overtime, fuel and material services and rent. We estimate severe weather added approximately $45 million to our first quarter costs, about equally distributed among these three groups. Now let\u2019s go to the details of our operating expenses. The next slide shows the components of the $25 million net decrease in railway operating expenses. As you can see, the overall decline resulted from a reduction in compensation and benefit costs.","Slide 5 details the $40 million or 5% decrease in compensation costs. Post retirement medical and pension related expenses declined by $32 million. On our fourth quarter earnings call in January, I mentioned that pension and retiree medical accruals would decline largely due to strong equity returns and a lower discount rate. During the first quarter, we amended our retiree medical plans to provide for fixed contributions to help reimbursement accounts. As a result, since the company contribution is now limited, we expect a further reduction in our accruals.","We now project expenses for pension and post-retirement benefits to be about $40 million lower per quarter for the remainder of 2014. Also contributing to the decrease in compensation costs were reduced labor hours, resulting primarily from lower traffic volumes and fewer trainees. Additionally, medical costs for active employees declined due to fewer employees and a lower premium. These three areas of reductions were somewhat offset by increased pay rate and weather-related over time costs.","Moving on to purchased services and rents, our cost decreased by a net of $1 million, reflecting a variety of offsetting items. While lower locomotive and freight car lease costs and reduced professional fees benefited expenses, these were largely offset by increased weather-related costs and higher intermodal volume related expenses. Next, depreciation expense increased by $10 million or 4% reflective of our larger capital base. As you can see on the left hand side of the slide, net properties have grown by about $900 million since this time last year.","As shown on Slide 8, fuel expense rose by $3 million or 1%. Because of the cold weather, consumption during the quarter increased 3% even though traffic volume was down slightly. Lower prices partly offset this headwind as the 2014 first quarter average diesel fuel price was $3.10 per gallon versus $3.19 in the first quarter of 2013.","The materials and other category, showed on the next slide, increased by $3 million or 1%. Once again, the weather affected our costs with a $9 million spike in locomotive and freight car maintenance materials. This rise was somewhat offset by lower environmental related expenses while personal injury costs were even with last year.","Turning to our non-operating items, other income net was down $109 million, or 81% due principally to the absence of the $97 million land sale gain, which benefited the first quarter of 2013. Lower coal royalty and lower return to our corporate and life insurance also contributed to the decrease. Interest expense on debt was up $10 million related to the debt we issued last year.","Next, income tax has totaled $186 million and the effective tax rate was 33.6% compared to 35.4% in 2013. The lower effective rate in 2014 was due to a $20 million deferred tax reduction resulting from a tax law change in Indiana. As you may recall, last year\u2019s effective rate included a $9 million reduction from tax law changes.","Slide 12 displays the net income and EPS comparisons. Net income was $368 million, down $82 million or 18%. Diluted earnings per share was $1.17, down $0.24 or 17%. As I mentioned moments ago and as shown here in light blue, last year\u2019s results included a large land sale. Excluding that gain, this year\u2019s net income is 6% lower and earnings per share is 4% lower.","Wrapping up the quarterly overview, cash from operations was $588 million covering capital spending and producing $207 million in free cash flow. We distributed $167 million in dividends and $50 million in share repurchases. Cash and short-term investments at the end of the period totaled $1.5 billion.","Thank you. And I will now turn the program back to Wick.","Wick Moorman","Well, as you have heard, we had what I would describe as a solid quarter given the weather across our service territory. While we did incur some additional expenses in our train operations year-over-year, our people did a terrific job of keeping our operations fluid under very trying conditions. Their resilience and the resilience of our network is evidenced by the metrics which Mark showed you indicating that our operations are improving steadily.","It will take us several more weeks to achieve the service levels that we maintained last year and our progress will be at least partially dependent on the state of the rest of the North American rail network, but we are confident in our ability to reach those levels and continue to recognize operating productivity savings for the balance of the year. As Don told you, we also see strength across much of our book of business for the balance of 2014, coal continues to be the wildcard with utility volumes more stable, but export volumes more uncertain. We are optimistic that overall economic conditions will drive continued growth in most of our other business segments.","Our goals remain unchanged to offer superior levels of service to our customers through highly efficient and effective operations and in doing so to continue to drive superior returns to our shareholders. We have a great team at Norfolk Southern and I am highly confident of our ability to do just that.","Thanks, and we will open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Hey Don, can I ask you to talk a little about the intermodal markets, we all know we have a tight truck market, how much is the lag before you feel like you can start to take advantage of this both in volume and price terms?","Don Seale","Good morning, Bill. With respect to truckload capacity and truckload pricing, we are seeing encouraging trends as you well know in the first quarter. And also as you know, a lot of our negotiations by our third parties and intermodal parties, our partners are negotiated in the first quarter for the year. So we are encouraged by where truck capacity and truck pricing is right now and we think we will get some uplift in intermodal pricing as a result of that as the year takes place.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Wick can I ask you a question about the STB, we have got some hearings coming up where they will address revenue adequacy, what should we expect or what can we hope for, what will you guys be trying to get across to them in this\u2026?","Wick Moorman","Well, I am not sure we know exactly what to expect. They have scheduled this hearing. We will certainly, as an industry and as Norfolk Southern, be making the case that revenue adequacy needs to be considered in terms of the long-term replacement costs for our industry rather than just the way it\u2019s computed today. And we will also certainly be making the case that to the extent that we have been able to earn better returns as an industry over the past 10 to 15 years we have taken those earnings and invested very heavily in all of our networks with the result being that the industry is in far better physical condition than it was some years ago. Our service levels are far better. We are taking a lot of trucks off the highway and we are accomplishing a lot of things that are good for the country as well as our industry. So I think we have a great case as we go into this and we will be making it very vigorously.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Does the experience of the first quarter suggest that there are choke points in the system that require more investment do you have to up CapEx?","Wick Moorman","Well, I think that the experience of the first quarter was certainly considerably out of the ordinary. We did see issues as you know, as everyone has commented, we certainly saw issues around Chicago, but I will say that we saw issues on other parts of our network and at other interchanges as well. And there is always the need for more infrastructure and more investment. I think that what the first quarter also made the case for is that the last thing in the world that we need to be doing right now is looking or having conversations about the possibility of decreasing our capacity through things like opening new interchanges, which are in fact not effective interchanges. So, I think there were some cautionary tales in the first quarter. I think there will be a lot of learning on the part of all of the carriers, but it certainly argues that the rail industry needs to continue the course that it\u2019s been on for the past 10 years of constant investment in infrastructure and capacity and service.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Yes. Alright, thanks for the time.","Wick Moorman","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. With the improvement in the merchandise and intermodal segments which are generally thought of as having pretty solid incremental margins, do you think that within the context of an improving industrial environment, you can return to roughly 60% contribution margins similar to what you saw in 2013 or we need to add resources in terms of headcounts or equipment to handle the volumes that you are anticipating?","Wick Moorman","Allison, it\u2019s a great question. I think I would tell you that right now, we feel pretty comfortable that we have the resources that we need to add the volumes that we are anticipating this year and out years without adding significant resources. We have invested a lot in over the past number of years in adding capacity and reducing pinch points on the network. We monitor our train and engine forces and mechanical and engineering forces very closely and do a lot of modeling to project what we are going to need based on our traffic forecast. We have a good locomotive fleet. We are adding more locomotives this year. We have a well-maintained fleet. So I think that we are pretty comfortable that we are not going to need significantly \u2013 any significant addition of resources to handle the business that we think is coming our way.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Okay, great. And then as a follow-up question, you mentioned that you are seeing pretty strong growth in your \u2013 in LPG movements. So, I just wanted to ask what you think sort of the longer term opportunity set for Norfolk is in terms of potentially moving NGLs from the Utica or Marcellus down to the Gulf Coast?","Don Seale","Allison, we see continued strong growth opportunity in NGLs. Our first quarter volume was up 42% in that business. Now, some of that was weather-related, but we see continued opportunities both in Marcellus and Utica, not only for shipments to the Gulf, but shipments within our network from the south to the north and a developing export market for butanes and propanes as well.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Okay, very interesting. Thank you so much.","Wick Moorman","Thanks, Allison.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Hey, thanks. Morning guys. So, wanted to ask about coal yields a little bit. First, I am not sure if you mentioned it, were there any liquidated damages of note in the quarter? And then Don, can you help us think about the direction of coal yields either year-over-year or sequentially from the first quarter. So, lot of moving parts with export maybe getting worse less northern utility coal, maybe that\u2019s positive for mix. I am not sure if you guys had to lower export rates further in second quarter given the lower benchmark. So, like you said a lot of moving parts, if you can give some color there, that will be great?","Don Seale","Very good question. And the key word there is a lot of moving parts. In terms of the mix within coal, as I mentioned we had a decline in our northern utility base, while our southern utility business was flat. And then the export business, I will tell you our thermal business held up year-over-year better than our metallurgical coal, which is higher revenue per unit. So within coal, within the export segment, we had a negative mix effect of less metallurgical shipment activity and stable thermal coal activity. With respect to the liquidated damages, we did not have any material LDs in the quarter. So \u2013 and your other questions about pricing, our pricing was relatively stable on export coal sequentially from the fourth quarter through the first quarter. I will tell you that the metallurgical market has deteriorated further since the fourth quarter and moving through the first quarter. And we are taking a look at that with our customers and we are continuing to try to keep our customers, our met coal and thermal coal shippers competitive in their markets to the extent that we can actually impact that. And with world markets and currency exchange activity being what they are, that\u2019s a difficult task for us.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Do you think we should expect some pressure on coal yield sequentially then because of that?","Don Seale","First quarter to second quarter on met coal I think we will see some pressure on yield.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Okay. And then just second question the labor costs, particularly given weather, just really impressive, how do we think about headcount down 4%, comp per employee down 1% going forward, can those run rates continue all year?","Wick Moorman","Well, we obviously pay a lot of attention to that in terms of trying to manage our headcount. I think that as we look at additional volumes in the year, you may see some slight addition to our train and engine workforce. We still have a number of folks furloughed. We would like to get them back clearly if we can get them in the locations where we need them. But I don\u2019t see any significant pressure to increase headcount other than in that regard I am looking at Mark. Mark?","Mark Manion","No, that\u2019s absolutely right. And with the \u2013 there has been a lot of good work done in the engineering, mechanical areas with some reduction through attrition and we may see a little bit more of that but it will be pretty steady through the rest of the year.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","And on the comp for employees side?","Wick Moorman","Well, the comp for employee is what it is for the \u2013 by contract, so.","Marta Stewart","Well, I think looking at it in total Scott, there is the two pieces. Of course the wage rate, as Wick mentioned that would put it up and then the pension and post-retirement, the pool that goes the other way.","Wick Moorman","Right. And Marta has given you the run rate on that and then I am trying to remember what the contract wage increase this year is 3% plus or minus. That\u2019s baked in, so that\u2019s the way we would look at it.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Okay, alright, great. That\u2019s good to know. Okay, thanks guys.","Wick Moorman","Thanks Scott.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup","Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just a question on sort of the volume opportunity as you move here into the second quarter, how much do you think you maybe left on the table revenue wise because of the weather in the first quarter that maybe gets made up and how do you think about the cadence of potentially making that up, does it happen all in the second quarter or do you sort of see this sort of play out over the course over the next two quarters or so?","Don Seale","Good morning, Chris. Good question. As I mentioned in my comments, we started to see a recovery in volumes in March relative to January and February. We did our best to estimate what the weather impact was on total shipment activity and our network versus what we expected in the first quarter. We came to a number of about 30,000 shipments that were not handled as a result of the weather. Our best estimate is that we will handle about 12,000 loads of deferred business to make up that. So if you look at average revenue per unit in the first quarter across the book of business we are talking about $18 million to $20 million of make up.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then I guess just thinking on the other side of the income statement on the cost side, Marta I think you mentioned $45 million of costs associated with weather, as we are sort of ramping up and getting fluidity back to the network in the second quarter, do you see any of that linger around, do we have to kind of worry about any incremental costs as you get increased ramp back up and getting those volumes sort of moving through the network again?","Marta Stewart","So, I don\u2019t really think so, except for the small ramp up in T&E employees, which Mark and Wick described, the rest of the expenses that we incurred on that $45 million were just related to the weather and so they are mostly gone now. And as Mark reiterated, I mean his group is still expecting to stay on target for their productivity, improvements for the second through the fourth quarter. And so we are still expecting to actually reduce expenses in many of the operating areas.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much for the time. I appreciate it.","Wick Moorman","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead with your question.","Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company","Real quick here, when I am looking at your intermodal network, we are seeing obviously a lot of tightness in truckload, continue here into the second quarter. Where are you at in terms of capacity and do you think you will be expanding the network in terms of adding any facilities this year?","Don Seale","Good morning. With respect to the intermodal capacity as you most likely know we completed most of the credit activity with respect to new terminals and expanding levels by the end of 2013 and with Charlotte being the last facility that was opened in December. So, we have very good capacity throughout the network and we are focused on filling that network up with quality revenue with respect to new shipments. I will tell you that in the first quarter, our Crescent Corridor volumes were up 10% and our Heartland Corridor was up 9%. So, we are pleased with the volume growth activity in the quarters, but we have sufficient capacity to grow over the next four to five years before we actually start layering in additional investment.","Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company","Okay, that\u2019s fantastic color. That\u2019s what I was getting at. And I guess my follow-up question, Marta, you mentioned you had a tax gain in the quarter, but you said that was due to a tax law change. So, I am assuming that is going to impact us going forward, can you give us a little more color around what we should expect?","Marta Stewart","Well, Jason, that was actually deferred taxes. And so I am glad you asked that question, because it doesn\u2019t go forward. What it is, is the State of Indiana changed their laws and said beginning of 2016, they are going to reduce their state taxes. So, what we have to do at that time is adjust our deferred taxes that are already on our books. So, that\u2019s a one-time thing. That adjusted the deferred tax liability. So going forward for second through the fourth quarter, I think we are still looking at our normalized about 37.5% effective tax rate.","Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company","Fantastic. That\u2019s what I was getting at. Alright guys. I appreciate the time as always.","Wick Moorman","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs","Good morning. Just want to ask with regard to intermodal, are you seeing any signs that suggest that intermodal might be inflecting? I mean, obviously lot of this good growth is coming from the highway to rail. And international seems to be still challenged, I am wondering if you are seeing anything to give us some prospect of recovery in that side?","Don Seale","Good morning. With respect to international, I think we had a consumer demand impact in the first quarter, particularly in those first two months of the first quarter. We saw our international shipment activity pick up materially in March. It continues to pick up materially in the range of about 7% in April. So, we think international growth this year is going to be fine. And of course, highway conversions in the domestic segment will continue.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs","Okay, great. And then can you comment on what percentage of your intermodal is up for renewal or is exposed to spot?","Don Seale","As of today, we are at about two-thirds of our book of business for intermodal that\u2019s priced for 2014. So that leaves us that 32%, 33% about a third that are subject to further price activity. And I will tell you a lot of that\u2019s in our EMP container fleet.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs","Okay, that\u2019s great. Thanks a lot.","Don Seale","You are welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays","Hey, good morning everyone. Wick, I wanted to ask a more longer term question, you have had a few years here of declining coal revenues and your top line growth hasn\u2019t been as impressive as some of your western peers or Canadian peers. And obviously, the margin improvement for the other carriers outside of the East Coast has been pretty robust. Is this finally the turning point when Norfolk can start to see some pretty robust return improvement as well? I mean the top line outlook from Wick sounds pretty impressive and coal is a third less than what it used to be now.","Wick Moorman","Well, I think as we said earlier, we do feel good about our volume prospects and our business prospects going forward. We hear similar comments from our customers. So, on that side, as you said I think we are optimistic. In terms of margin improvement, something we have been focused on for a long time. And you can see some of the results in terms of what we have been able to do, in terms of controlling expenses and doing additional things on the productivity side. The characteristics of railroads are different, depending upon the service territory and the west doesn\u2019t always look like the east, but I will say that we are very, very focused on growing the top line and bringing more and more of that to the bottom line every year. I feel good about all of the initiatives that Mark and his team have underway. I feel very good about the service levels that we are offering to our customers and so we continue to be optimistic.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays","Well, I appreciate that. And as a follow-up, Don I mean given the outlook and what you are sharing from your customers right now, do you think this is the time where NSC is going to see growth above GDP for the first time in a couple of years?","Don Seale","Certainly I think in our Intermodal markets, in our Merchandise markets across the segments we have an opportunity this year to do just that. Coal is going to be the wildcard and we are very encouraged with respect to utility coal, we think it\u2019s going to be better than what we thought it\u2019s going to be in December, for sure. The export coal market has deteriorated in general and we are not as optimistic about that, so that will be a deflator in volume. But in the Merchandise and Intermodal segments, we feel optimistic and encouraged.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays","Alright, I appreciate it.","Wick Moorman","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Long - Stephens","Thanks and good morning. My first question I had I was wondering if you could talk about your access to equipment as it relates to both locomotives and freight cars, are you comfortable with the equipment capacity you have today or is that something that could be a potential limiting factor to your volume growth as you look out over the remainder of 2014?","Don Seale","We feel \u2013 we do feel good about it. We are in good shape. As Wick said a little bit ago we got \u2013 we received 25 locomotives the first quarter, we have got another 50 coming in the second half and we are sized in good shape for all of our rolling equipment, so we feel good about it.","Mark Manion","Just to add a comment, we do want to see our utilization of the equipment continue to improve as the national network improves its service. We have been impacted in terms of equipment supply by slower cycle times during the first quarter. I mentioned automotive equipment. We also had some other impacts with metals equipment, things like that. So as the networks recover and ours ramp up we will see more capacity in our equipment fleet by nature of turning the cars at an equal cycle to last year or better. ","Justin Long - Stephens","Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And as my second question, I think I have heard you say recently that on the intermodal side you expect volume growth could be in the 5% to 10% range, as you look out over the next several years, could you talk about how much of that you expect to be driven by conversion activity versus just growth in your existing customer base, is it 50-50 split or what does that look like?","Don Seale","Well, we generally don\u2019t project what we think the volume increases will be over time. I will tell you that the highway conversion opportunity is a large opportunity, with a lot of shipment and revenue moving over the highways. So we still see that as the number one opportunity for growth ahead. And we, of course, we will continue to see organic growth with our international customers based on consumer demand and consumption as well. And growth with existing domestic customers, so by far the largest growth opportunity is highway to rail.","Justin Long - Stephens","Okay, great, I will leave it at that. I appreciate the time.","Don Seale","Welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America","Hi. Good morning, if we could just step back a little bit on the \u2013 Don, you mentioned that mix and pricing were down. And I know you went into detail before on the coal side, but was mix a bigger issue or did we see actual pricing contract a little bit. I just want to understand the kind of the contributors here given obviously a low inflation and I guess a portion tied to inflation indices, but just want to understand how do you look at pure pricing in this environment?","Don Seale","Yes. With respect to the overall price mix equation, mix was the driver. We did not have any price degradation. As I mentioned in our export coal markets, price was essentially equal with the fourth quarter sequentially to the first quarter. Mix within coal certainly was a driver as our Lamberts Point metallurgical shipments were off by about 30% close to that or 23% was the actual number. But when you look sequentially, we saw metallurgical coal drop off from the fourth quarter to the first quarter and we saw thermal coal set this table, which thermal as you know has lower revenue per unit, which drives negative mix. Also in a larger sense of the overall book, as we continue to grow intermodal shipments and coal shipments are down, that\u2019s the ultimate in negative mix. So I know you will keep that in mind, but no, we did not have any change in our pricing structure. We did have a lot of impact on the mix side.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America","Yes. I meant more, you already went over the coal, I meant more in the other stuff, so in terms of \u2013 within any of the other commodities like you explained in coal, were there any other major things, I guess like \u2013 as you mentioned on the intermodal side outpacing coal, but was there anything on the merchandise that would mask some of that change as well?","Don Seale","Yes.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America","Whether it\u2019s longer haul shifts?","Don Seale","Yes. Let me give you a couple of examples. And we are going to see this throughout the year with our agricultural market. Last year as you know, we had a crop that was robust starting August\/September, but the comps are coming off of a year, where we had a drought. And we had very, very suppressed corn supply. So, we were hauling long-haul corn over the Chicago gateway into processors at Decatur, Illinois into the Southeast. Now, with the grain crop being good from September\/October of last year that has reverted back to normalized patterns, where we are gathering trains to Decatur that are 75 to 100 miles long as opposed to bringing that corn over Chicago from Iowa and Nebraska. So, that\u2019s a great example of \u2013 that\u2019s going to continue as normalized patterns replace unusual patterns for grain shipment. So that\u2019s negative mix in the ag market.","In terms of other merchandise activity, I will tell you that our crude oil was up about 60% in the first quarter in our chemical group. And while our chemical group had good performance with RPU and volume, as we have indicated in the past, our crude RPU is less than our chemical RPU on average. So, it is a negative mix driver within chemicals. So, not to go on, but yes, there is a lot of moving parts mix overall. Again, merchandise was not positive, it was negative. And it certainly was negative in coal. And as we add more intermodal to the overall book of business, that is a negative mix indicator quarter-to-quarter.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America","That\u2019s a great one and that\u2019s exactly what I was looking for. Just I guess two quick ones together, but on export, I know you tend to shy away from giving forecasts, but could you see given where the market prices are now, could you see that a sub 20 million ton year given the pace of declines? And then I guess a quick one for Marta, you have got a $1.5 billion on hand, any comments on what your plans are for that?","Don Seale","Again, on the export we are just going to have to see how it progresses. It is a very, very unstable market right now because of foreign competition. Foreign demand in China was softening. You know all those factors, I am sure, but we will just have to see how it progresses.","Marta Stewart","And on the cash level that we have, we do have a lot of cash on hand, $1.5 billion as you noted. And we still have our same order of spending, which is Wick mentioned first of all is investing in business and then dividends and then share repurchases. And the amount is somewhat elevated, because we had two debt issuances last year trying to capture the low interest rates, which we didn\u2019t know would last so far into this year, but other than that, other than a little extra carry that we have from that, we still are going to continue our strategy of trying to over the long-term get our debt structure set up, so that we have a good weighted average interest rate for the company.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America","I appreciate the time. Thanks for the insight.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. My question I guess is on the regulatory side with regards to crude by rail up here in Canada, they just released indications today that they will be requiring the DOT-111 cars to be pushed out of service in a two to three year timeframe. That seems like a little bit quicker than I think the industry was expecting in terms of the cycling out of the DOT-111s, do you see that as impacting your business in crude, talking to your crude by rail customers you were to change partners, is 2 to 3 years going to put a strain on the car manufactures to be able to bring in the new generation of those same cars and therefore limit the potential upside that you see of the volume growth in crude by rail going forward?","Wick Moorman","Well, it\u2019s certainly an issue and we had heard that there would be something coming out along the lines you mentioned in Canada. I think that we going to have to remain \u2013 it remains to be seen what the regulators do down here in terms of the phase out of the 111s if it\u2019s a very rapid phase out it\u2019s clearly going to be an issue. There are a lot of tank cars being built to the 12-32 standard right now, there is clearly going to be a change in that standard at some point or another as well and I think we are all just watching to see what happens. But it\u2019s very clear that if the regulators aren\u2019t thoughtful about what they are doing and looking at how we can get enough of the newer cars into the fleet that it could be a limiting impact on the shipment of crude by rail. So we will just watch and see what happens in the U.S. and what the regulators come up with. But it\u2019s clearly something to be concerned about and watchful about.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets","In two to three years would qualify as that very limiting timeframe?","Wick Moorman","I would have to go back and look at the projected production of the current car standard. But as I have said, that standard will change as well. But I think that timeframe would probably present some problems for us.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets","Yes, thanks for that. My second question I guess is more on the longer term, I guess Marta you mentioned investing in your business is the first order priority. If you take a step back and I know you did this with your intermodal business a number of years ago and looked at pinch points within your Southern corridors and decided to invest in there to expand your double stack capacity. If you take that same kind of approach and I don\u2019t know if Mark, you are the best one to answer this, if you look at your pinch points, I got a sense from Wick that perhaps Chicago, and correct me if I am wrong is not as big a problem for you as it was at least in terms of the commentary, sounded like the Canadian rails and Burlington Northern are suffering a little bit more from Chicago than the others. If you take a step back, where are your pinch points and where could we see any let\u2019s call it meaningful capital dollars going towards in terms of those pinch points?","Mark Manion","Yes, well as far as Chicago, we have faired pretty well in Chicago actually. When you say pinch points, when I think about that, we have been for \u2013 what since like 2004, 2005 we have every year very deliberately been investing in additional infrastructure. And these days, with the kind of tools that you have in order to really identify the spots that will make the difference to you. We added a little bit of double track. We linked in sidings. We added sidings. We put in crossings. And you put them in the areas surgically where it really gets you a lot of bang for your buck. And so we have done that every year for at least 10 years. And when you do that over a period of time, it\u2019s got to be effective of really ramping up your capacity. So that\u2019s something we have really enjoyed as far as helping us with fluidity. And we will continue to do that, so that\u2019s a very good thing. So at this point, I wouldn\u2019t say that we have any spots that we are really particularly worried about. We are looking, with the computer modeling we do, we look out three years and we try to look out a little further than that.","But realistically speaking, we look out three years with our modeling and we anticipate where those areas are. That\u2019s what we will continue to do. And our latest project that we have got on the books, Bellevue, that\u2019s a significant spend. And we are virtually doubling the capacity up at Bellevue, because the forecasting tells us and what we are currently experiencing is that that\u2019s where a lot of traffic wants to go, up in that Northern Ohio area. So, that will be a big help to us. So, we will keep planning ahead and spending accordingly to try to alleviate pinch points before they come.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets","Alright, looking forward to seeing the Bellevue operation there in September.","Wick Moorman","Great. Love to see you up there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","John Larkin - Stifel","Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to circle back on the loss of the, I think you said 4 million ton Northern Appalachian utility contract. Wanted to understand if the coal is moving maybe by water, whether that was a natural gas substitution situation or whether the coal supplier changed or whether it was an aggressive pricing action on the part of a rail competitor?","Don Seale","Good morning, John. Its PRB coal coming over Chicago and it was rail-to-rail competition.","John Larkin - Stifel","But you don\u2019t think that\u2019s indicative of a heating up of a price competition in the utility coal market?","Don Seale","We don\u2019t see that as an indicator of that, but obviously it\u2019s a competitive market and we continue to monitor all conditions in the market.","John Larkin - Stifel","Got it. There has been a lot written in the press here lately about the possibility of a West Coast strike, the port workers out there perhaps shutting things down around mid-year. Have you seen shippers begin to take steps to protect themselves perhaps by shifting more freight to East Coast or is that underway currently or is it too early to make a call on that?","Don Seale","John, we think it\u2019s too early to make the call with respect to the ILWU negotiation on the West Coast. But I will say that we are continuing to see robust growth in our all-water international service to the East Coast. And that\u2019s been an ongoing trend, as we have reported previously, but we are seeing robust growth over our East Coast ports.","John Larkin - Stifel","And just to follow along on that, any thoughts, perhaps new thoughts on what may happen when ultimately the Panama Canal is finished and the larger vessels can proceed through the canal to the East Coast ports?","Don Seale","Well, we know that, that will take place late 2015 maybe early 2016. Now, in the ensuing time, we are seeing more activity with the larger vessels coming through the Suez Canal to the East Coast ports, that can accommodate the large draft vessels like the Port of Virginia, Norfolk or Baltimore, those are the two that can do that right now. Chinese production is changing with labor cost and productivity changing in China and we are seeing more of those goods coming to the U.S. from Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Malaysia. And as that shift in production continues, we expect the Suez activity to continue to grow to the East Coast. We are seeing very solid signs of that today. So, bottom line, the Panama Canal completion, it will be material with respect to being able to handle the larger vessels. We expect to see more large or Cape-size export coal vessels, for example, go through the Panama Canal, but the question mark is just how \u2013 what kind of an impact it will make on containerization and containerships with that shift in production.","John Larkin - Stifel","Thank you very much.","Wick Moorman","Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank","Hey, thanks for taking my question. As a quick follow-up to John\u2019s questions about the potential for a dockworker uncertainty on the West Coast as that contract comes up for expiration toward the middle of the summer, can you give us a sense of what customers have been saying to you, Don, about their expectations for bringing the imports in or are they indicating they are planning on bringing freight in early as a contingency plan?","Don Seale","We do not have a strong indication that there is a ship ahead taking place, but with the strength of our April international numbers, we would deduce from that, that we are seeing some activity that might be related to a shift. We are just not being told that yet by our customers.","Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank","Yes. They typically hold those cards pretty close to their chests. Mark, as a follow-up to an earlier question about the operating leverage potential across your network, could you give us a sense of how much train lengths can extend on average across your merchandise network before you will have to start adding additional train starts?","Mark Manion","Well, we have had some pretty good success actually in the first quarter with adding to train length and we actually on the Merchandise side we have added a little bit, about 3%, on the Intermodal side we added about 5%. And there is still a lot of room. And of course the trick \u2013 the balancing trick here is you got some trains out there that are 10,000 feet long and you got others that are 5,000 feet long. So we make our networking people, they do a good job and they make a deliberate effort to try to work with marketing and try to increase train length where we can. And right now where we have got our Merchandise trains somewhere in that 5,000 foot little bit less average length, in nearly all cases we can go up to at least 8,000 feet. So there is a lot of room to go there and that\u2019s what we will continue to do.","Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank","That\u2019s all from me. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Mims with FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","John Mims - FBR Capital Markets","Great. Thanks guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here at the end. There has been a lot of questions on intermodal, but let me beat that horse a couple of more times. When you look at the growth that you anticipate with the Southern build-out of the Crescent Corridor and the South Carolina Inland Port or Charlotte, etcetera, is there a negative mix issue that we should be aware of from a shortening length of haul. I know you are optimistic about core pricing increasing with truckload, but do you see length of haul shortening given where the growth is coming from?","Mark Manion","Well, certainly as we continued to convert highway business within our local East network, we are seeing length of haul opportunities that are below our average today. And also we are seeing projects like the Inland Port in South Carolina where we are using double stack efficiencies to run dedicated trains between the Port of Charleston and Greer, South Carolina. That is well below, that\u2019s in the 240 mile, 250 mile segment, well below our average length of haul of about 740 miles. So we are going to continue to see opportunities with double stack technology using a network that\u2019s 98% clear for double stack where we can convert highway business that has length of haul and RPU characteristics that are below the average, but are highly accretive to what we are doing financially.","John Mims - FBR Capital Markets","Right. So lower RPU but in line incremental margins for that trade?","Mark Manion","Equal or greater.","John Mims - FBR Capital Markets","Equal or greater, okay. And then I heard recently, I was talking to some of the container manufactures that the 53 foot box backlog and demand outlook for 2014 is very robust, probably the strongest in years, can you talk a little about what you are buying in terms of boxes for the EMP fleet, the growth that you anticipate for some of your key IMC partners. And then how comfortable you are, I guess on a broader term over the next couple quarters with U.S. domestic box capacity given that some of your big Western partners are probably going to take longer to recover, there are seeing some sloppy capacity tied up in the West, how quickly does the box capacity need to come online to meet the growth that you anticipate from the highway conversion market?","Don Seale","Well, certainly box capacity will continue to expand this year, not only in our EMP fleet, and our contribution. We are acquiring about 2,000 containers and chasses to support that. Our Western partner and EMP UP is also participating in the expansion of EMP. And I will point out that our Intermodal marketing partners are also expanding their fleets in a fairly significant way. So as we add those additional units and the national network continues to improve in terms of velocity, we think we will have the capacity there for the growth that we had targeted for 2014. And certainly beyond \u201814 we are all modeling what that growth will be and what the capacity enhancements will need to be as well as replacements.","John Mims - FBR Capital Markets","Given that there has been a pretty substantial step-up in 53 foot boxes orders in 2014 versus 2013 have you seen that reflected in the prices that you are paying for the 2,000 EMP boxes?","Don Seale","No, we had our prices committed to. So we are not seeing a price impact.","John Mims - FBR Capital Markets","Great. Okay, thanks so much. I will turn it back over.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman, Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research","Thank you very much. Hi, everyone. Question for Marta and then a follow-up on CapEx, Ken Hoexter earlier asked about the $1.5 billion in cash and you do have $440 million due later this year, following up on your thoughts, it just seems like normally you guys hold closer to $500 million in cash and is your thought maybe to pay off the $440 million later this year in cash and bring cost of debt down that way or your share repurchase seems a little lower than I would have thought it would have been with that kind of cash balance, can you just give us a little bit more detail into your thoughts on making the balance sheet better and why you should have $1 billion more cash than normal?","Marta Stewart","Yes, Jeff. Well, you are right that we have, I believe in September we have a debt payoff this year. And so we are going to wait until closer to that time period to decide whether we are going to use cash on the balance sheet or refinance that. As I have said, we are a little bit high now, because we had the two debt issuances last year in order to try to get that long-term interest rate down for the future. If we have known that interest rates were going to stay low into this spring, we would have issued that $400 million. We would have issued one of them this year. That having been said, we always look to the capital first and Mark spoke it\u2019s not terribly significant, but Mark spoke did pull off a little bit on the capital work in the first quarter as they shifted resources to deal with the weather. And so we will still expect to have the $2.2 billion capital plan for the entire year, but it will be \u2013 some of it will be shifted later, so some of the money will be absorbed that way.","And we announced our regular quarterly dividend yesterday, so we will keep looking that was our run rate same as the first quarter, but we will keep looking at the dividends and we have a history of steadily increasing those. So, we will look at the dividend \u2013 and the share repurchases really are going to be based on what the market is doing and the alternative uses of our cash. So truly, even though the balance is higher we have not changed our priority order and we will just have to see in September what we do with that debt.","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research","Okay. Just we already had you pegged for the $2.2 billion in CapEx and we have got you now projected closer to $2 billion in cash at year end, and I guess we will see the answer. Going to CapEx then and use of cash, you got the Tier 4 locomotive standards that start at the end of this year. Can you give us an idea of what your thoughts are around locomotive CapEx? And any thoughts you have on continuing down a Tier 4 locomotive path with the current diesel versus some of the natural gas technologies that are out there that are being tested?","Wick Moorman","Well, it\u2019s a good question. As Mark told you, we are picking up 75 new locomotives this year. We will look later in the year obviously, but it\u2019s unclear to us that we are going to move into Tier 4 in 2014. It\u2019s a new technology. We are certainly going to want to see it prove out. We are going to look at the pricing of those locomotives. And we are going to continue to look as all of the carriers are at the development work that\u2019s being done in LNG. I think that\u2019s a very interesting and promising technology. It\u2019s probably a year or two out from being proven. There are still regulatory issues as you know, but I think we want to keep some powder dry in terms of that technology.","Remember at the same time that we do have a very active locomotive, road locomotive rebuild program at our shops in Juniata. So, we are this year and this will continue for a number of years, continuing to take some of our older road locomotives and essentially rebuilding them in kind and producing what we feel to be pretty close to a like-new product. So that keeps our locomotive fleet rejuvenated as well. So, we think we have a good thoughtful program. Clearly, we want to do two things. One is ensure that we have the locomotive resources to move the businesses effectively but also to manage our capital as prudently as we can.","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Vernon of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein","Alright, thanks you for taking the question. Don just a question for you on Intermodal rates, how closely should we expect Norfolk\u2019s portion of that rate to track with truck ate inflation. I am trying to think if that should be one-for-one or if you would expect some leakage to pay for the yard to door truck rate inflation that would also presumably be going up?","Don Seale","Well, certainly rail pricing over time we will track truckload pricing, that\u2019s the lead indicator. Of course rail-to-rail competition is present as well. But I think we certainly are optimistic that we are seeing a truckload market that's beginning to inflect with higher capacity and the need to improve pricing, which certainly will support further improvement in Intermodal pricing.","David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein","Is it going to be a little bit less than the one-for-one that you would see in truck rate inflation?","Don Seale","I think it will be a little bit less than the one-for-one.","David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, great. And then, Marta, maybe just as a quick follow-up, the $160 million kind of year-over-year reduction in pension and post-retirement benefits, what\u2019s the baseline for that. I am looking at $177 million was your cost last year, is that full number just coming down the $17 million for your average benefit costs this year?","Marta Stewart","That\u2019s correct, David. The $177 million is in our footnote and that\u2019s the total of pension and post-retirement medical. And so the $32 million in the first quarter plus $40 million each of the next quarters would be what you would expect that to in total to come down.","David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein","So if we saw rates go up again in next year, is there a chance that you can start to see a net periodic benefit in your labor line?","Marta Stewart","Well, it all depends, as you know the components of the pension depends on the discount rate and also what our assets do. And so the amortization for years past 2015 will depend on what happens with interest rates and with our pension plan assets, which so far this year as you would expect are doing very well.","David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein","Excellent. Thanks very much for the clarification.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","Thanks. Quick question on coal, you mentioned the last call volume was PRB, what was the quarter\u2019s utility coal mix by source basin and would you share your expectations for this over the next couple years please?","Don Seale","Yes, in terms of our mix of coal sourcing, Illinois Basin was about 18%, PRB was about 16%, Central App was a little over 40% and Northern App made up the balance.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","And could you add a little color on how this shift towards more the Western Basin is affecting your length of haul expectations too?","Don Seale","Well, the Illinois Basin affords us with opportunities to \u2013 for extended haul, so length of haul that\u2019s helping. Also Northern App coal that is beginning to flow materially into the South, that\u2019s helping as well. The PRB coal really doesn't change our length of haul because it\u2019s a fairly stable pattern with the Memphis Gateway, that\u2019s gateway receive traffic. And we don\u2019t see a lot of change in that ahead, so stable length of haul there extended length of haul on Northern App to the South as that develops and extended hauls from Illinois Basin to the South as it develops.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie Group. Please proceed with your question.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Group","Thank you. I am following up right on Keith\u2019s question with another take of the basin mix. After the congestion issues that are still lingering through this year, how do you see your mix changing, maybe more PRB suffer, do you see more of the Appalachian coal come into the mix and what should that mean for the profitability of your coal franchise this year? Thank you.","Don Seale","We believe that as utilities restock their stockpiles, which are down materially coming off the winter, we believe that we will see more Illinois Basin coal going to the South. We will see more Northern App coal flowing into the South, into North Carolina in particular. PRB coal will expand on the margin to replenish stockpiles, primarily in the Southeast for us. And as far as the margins go, the overall mix should be favorable in utility on that incremental business as it moves longer haul from the Illinois Basin as well as Northern App. Central App utility business still higher cost, but we do expect some volume increases out of Central App. We believe that increase will be less than from Northern App and from Illinois Basin.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Group","Thank you. And as a follow-up also on the margin issue, could you please remind us of the big picture on margins on the operating ratio as you see the business mix evolves and adding your productivity initiatives? I mean, we are trying to see sort of the noise at the level of the unit price through incremental margins and several other colleagues have attempted this question, but if you could set us straight again on how we should think of margins a few years out? Thank you.","Mark Manion","We have a goal obviously of continuing to push the operating ratio down and our margins up. We don\u2019t forecast what that will be, but I think that we do have opportunity for some more improvements on that and I would hope that a few years out we will have driven the operating ratio maybe down a few points, but that\u2019s going to depend a lot on market conditions and on a lot of other factors that are out there. But the best answer I can give you is that we are focused on trying to continue to drive the operating ratio down.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Group","Can you highlight any one movement in business mix or one productivity initiative that should be a main driver in improvement?","Mark Manion","No, I think that when you look at our business mix, it\u2019s obviously volatile in terms of coal. We have solid growth prospects in the others, but the volatility in coal will have an impact on our overall margins. And in terms of productivity, I think that we have a lot of initiatives underway. None of them in and of themselves are a particularly defining moment, from a productivity standpoint, but when you look at them all together they are going to do a lot for our bottom line.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Group","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Tyler Brown - Raymond James","Hey, good morning. Mark, just quickly, can you give us an update on where you are on the movement plan to rollout, maybe when all the 11 divisions will be fully implemented? And then in the divisions where you did see it implemented this year, did your network respond better given the weather?","Mark Manion","We will complete that project by the end of this year or just barely into next year. So we are getting close. And we have done a good bit of analysis looking at movement planner to determine what kind of improvement we get in velocity. And it is still looking like we are in that 2 to 4 mile an hour or 10% to 20% range, it\u2019s early. So, those are approximate figures, but we think that just like it\u2019s helpful during the good weather, it\u2019s helpful during the bad weather. So, we think it\u2019s very promising.","Tyler Brown - Raymond James","Okay, good. And then Don just within the domestic intermodal games, was there kind of anything unusual there, I know you guys don\u2019t break it out anymore, but did the premium traffic perform better than usual? I just noted that your TOFC volumes are pretty good?","Don Seale","Yes, we had a significant increase in our premium in LTL traffic in the first quarter. This ranges from UPS to FedEx to the various western frontload carriers.","Tyler Brown - Raymond James","And just real quickly do you expect that to continue and how does that impact yield?","Don Seale","We expect further growth in our business for parcel activity and LTL.","Tyler Brown - Raymond James","Perfect, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We have come to the end of our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the floor back over to Mr. Moorman for closing comments.","Wick Moorman","Thanks everyone for the questions this morning.

It is my pleasure to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With me today are several members of our senior team, including our President, Jim Squires; our Chief Marketing Officer, Don Seale; our Chief Operating Officer, Mark Manion; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart.","As all of you know by now after 39 years of exemplary service Don has decided to retire effective March 01st. Therefore this will be his last earnings call, and I know all of you join me in wishing him a long and happy retirement. ","Turning now to our financial results, I am pleased to report that Norfolk Southern achieved another solid quarter, which completed an outstanding 2014 financial performance with record annual results across the board including all-time highs for revenues, income from operations, operating ratio, net income, and earnings per share. ","Looking at our top line, revenues for the fourth quarter were $2.9 billion, flat compared to our record 2013 fourth-quarter revenue, despite a 15% decrease in coal revenue and lower fuel surcharge revenue. Overall volumes increased 4% as growth in intermodal and merchandise more than offset a 6% decline in coal volumes. For the full year, revenues were $11.6 billion, up 3%, notwithstanding a 6% decline in coal revenue. Don will provide you with all of the revenue details in a few minutes.","Our fourth-quarter operating expenses were down 1%, resulting in a fourth-quarter record $891 million of income from railway operations and a 69.0% operating ratio, which is a 40 basis point improvement compared to 2013. This enabled us to end the full year with an operating ratio of 69.2, the company's first ever sub-70% operating ratio and a 180 basis point improvement over 2013. ","As all of you know, we were able to achieve these results in the face of service challenges and the fourth quarter was no exception. However, as you also know, we have worked diligently to improve our velocity and operating metrics, and we saw definite improvement after the Thanksgiving holidays. Mark will go over our service metrics and provide you with the latest update on our initiatives for improvement. ","Fourth-quarter net income of $511 million and earnings per share of $1.64 were comparable to 2013's record results. For the full year, record level net income and earnings per share increased 8% and 9%, respectively, excluding the large land sale that benefited 2013. Marta will cover this as well as the rest of the financials with you in more detail. ","We are excited about delivering another year of record results and even more excited that our service product has turned the corner after a few difficult months. We remain optimistic about our prospects going forward, and on that note I will turn the program over to Don, Mark, and Marta. I will then return with some closing comments and we will take your questions. Don? ","Don Seale","Thank you, Wick, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth-quarter revenue was $2.9 billion, as Wick indicated, roughly even with a very strong fourth quarter of 2013, with gains in merchandise and intermodal offset by a decline in coal. Merchandise revenue increased $56 million, or 3%, while intermodal revenue increased 31 million, or 5%, compared to last year. Coal revenue declined 98 million, or 15%, with weaker shipments in utility and export markets. ","Volume increases in intermodal and merchandise generated 103 million of positive revenue variance in the fourth quarter. Despite volume increases, fuel surcharge revenues declined 45 million compared to 2013 as a result of as a result of a 13% decline in West Texas intermediate oil prices compared to 2013. ","Additionally, revenues were impacted by the negative mix effects associated with higher intermodal volumes and lower coal volumes. The combined impacts of reduced fuel surcharge revenue and negative mix resulted in an overall ARPU decline of 4%. ","Total volume for the quarter was up 4%, or roughly 66,000 units due to a 6% gain in intermodal shipments and a 5% gain in merchandise shipments, which offset a 6% decline in coal. Our merchandise business benefited from very strong chemicals and metals and construction volumes, which were offset by declines in agriculture and paper and forest products.","Fourth-quarter intermodal volumes were up over 57,000 units or 6%, compared to fourth quarter 2013 with particular strength in international volumes. And our coal volumes declined by 6% due to weak shipments in both export and utility markets. ","Now breaking out the market segments on the next slide starting with coal as shown on Slide 4, coal revenue was down $98 million or 15%, compared to fourth quarter last year with volume down 6%. Coal ARPU declined 10% in the quarter as a result of reduced fuel surcharge revenue as well as the negative mix impact of reduced export volume. ","Overall utility coal volume declined by 6% in the quarter, driven by lower coal burn and lower natural gas prices. ","Shipments to northern utilities were down 9%, due primarily to a previously announced market share loss, a negative comparison which we cleared on January 1st of this year. Finally, utility coal volumes were suppressed by weakened service levels, which we estimate to be about 1 million tons in the quarter. We expect to make up most of those deferred tons not handled in the fourth quarter.","The export coal market continues to be impacted by strong global competition and a weak demand environment. Weak market fundamentals and the falling Australian dollar drove a 25% decline in export shipments for the quarter. Volumes within our domestic metallurgical markets were up 13% with customer-specific gains in coke shipments driving growth. ","Intermodal revenue in the fourth quarter increased by $31 million or 5% to 649 million, due to 6% volume growth. Revenue per unit was down 1% for the quarter as positive pricing activity was offset by lower fuel surcharge revenues and the negative mix impact of higher volumes of lower ARPU international freight.","Domestic intermodal volumes were up 4% for the quarter with gains due to highway conversions and growth with key accounts. Growth in this segment was slowed in the quarter as a result of lower network velocity. ","On the international side, strong growth of 10% was driven by new contract business, the introduction of new service lanes, and West Coast labor disruption. The five carload business groups shown on the next slide within our merchandise market had mixed results in the fourth quarter, with strong gains in metals and construction and chemicals offset by weaker volumes of agriculture, paper and forest product commodities.","Total merchandise revenue of 1.7 billion was up 3% or $56 million versus 2013, with ARPU down $31 or 1% for the quarter as a result of lower fuel surcharge revenues. Metals and construction volumes were up 12% for the quarter, with increased volumes of slabs, coil steel, frac sand and aggregates. Chemicals volumes were up 14% for the quarter, driven by continued gains of crude by rail and natural gas liquid shipments.","Following a strong quarter, our automotive volumes were flat in the fourth quarter compared to 2013. These volumes were impacted by both plant downtime and model changeovers at key Norfolk Southern served plants. ","Volumes within our agricultural markets were negatively impacted by network velocity as soybean shipments declined versus last year due to longer cycle times, which limited railcar availability. This decline was partially offset by increased corn volumes to ethanol producers and feed markets in the Southeast.","Finally, paper and forest products volumes declined 2% in the quarter, with increased volumes of lumber and wood products offset by declining shipments of graphic paper and municipal solid waste. ","Now before I conclude with our outlook, I will make a couple of comments about our fuel surcharge programs. The WTI oil curve shown here in this graph on the slide will negatively impact our surcharge programs at current projected oil prices. Over 85% of our revenue base is covered by negotiated fuel surcharges that totaled $1.3 billion in 2014. These surcharges were almost evenly split between WTI and on-highway diesel-based programs.","More than two-thirds of the WTI-based surcharge revenue programs contained trigger prices above the current WTI price per barrel. At these expected prices these contracts will yield zero fuel surcharges in 2015. The remaining WTI-based contracts as well as the on-highway diesel-based contracts are expected to generate fuel surcharge revenue, but at a substantially lower rate than in 2014.","Now concluding with our outlook, we anticipate continued opportunities for volume and revenue growth across most of our business units in 2015 despite headwinds with fuel surcharge revenue. The exception again will be the coal markets, both domestically and in the export sector. We expect utility coal volumes will be impacted by lower natural gas prices. Within the export sector, global oversupply, low commodity pricing, and a weaker Australian dollar will leave US producers at a disadvantage in the world marketplace. Turning to intermodal, highway conversions will continue to generate growth with key domestic customers across our strategic intermodal corridors. And on the international side, we expect additional volumes due to new customers and service offerings. ","Our outlook for our merchandise book of business continues to be positive. We project continued growth in crude oil shipments to East Coast refiners, but possibly at a lower rate of growth in view of current WTI and Brent spreads. And we expect continued gains in natural gas liquids and drilling materials, such as frac sand and pipe, due to strong activity within the Marcellus and Utica shale regions. We anticipate higher steel volumes to support the commercial construction and automotive sectors and increased road construction activity will boost volumes of aggregates and asphalts, while growth in housing starts will generate higher volumes of lumber and construction materials. Automotive volumes are expected to increase with vehicle production at several key NS-served plants, well above the industry average increase of 1% in production for 2015. ","And within agriculture we expect increased soybean volumes and higher ethanol and feed shipments ahead. So in total we expect broad-based growth in 2015, but the headwinds will be coal and top-line revenue associated with the fuel surcharge forward curve. ","In summary, moving forward in 2015 as we manage the components of the top line, we remain committed to making the necessary improvements to provide the level of service our customers expect with growth across our intermodal and merchandise business segments. We will also continue to employ market-based pricing, which, due to tight transportation capacity across all modes, will trend higher in 2015. ","Thanks for your attention and Mark will now go over our operations report. ","Mark Manion","Thank you, Don. It's good to see the continued traffic growth in the fourth quarter. While network velocity for the full fourth quarter declined, our velocity and overall operation improved in December. Remember that last quarter I said customers should start to notice improvements in service and service consistency during the fourth quarter, and that has indeed been the case as December numbers showed a decided uptick in our performance levels. As we continue to apply resources where needed and focus on improving the operation, we expect that improvement to continue. ","Turning to Slide 2, our 2014 reportable injury ratio is 1.20 for 200,000 employee hours worked. That is a slight uptick from 2013, which was driven by a difficult first quarter in 2014. ","The primary objective of our safety process is for all employees to get home safely to their families after each workday. We are working hard in 2015 to build on the benefits of behavior-based safety and working collaboratively with our employees to prevent injuries. We are very pleased to report that there were no employee work fatalities in 2014. That\u2019s an important safety accomplishment, but it goes without saying that we are continuing to work to significantly reduce all injuries. Train accidents for 2014 were up slightly from 2013 at 2.4 per 1 million train miles, but the NS accident ratio remains better than the industry average. ","Grade crossing accidents have increased to 3.9 per 1 million train miles for 2014 compared to 3.6 for 2013. As you can see, they have improved in the fourth quarter. NS remains at an active leadership role with the national Operation Lifesaver driver and trespasser safety education program as well as company campaigns. ","I am also pleased to let you know that we recently accepted -- were accepted as a member to the Campbell Institute, the research arm for the National Safety Council. Membership is reserved for companies that demonstrate world-class environmental and safety leadership. Achieving membership reflects our continued commitment to environmental health and safety leadership and improvement. ","Moving to Slide 3, our composite service metric dropped to 62.8 in the fourth quarter, but you can see there was some nice recovery in December. As I said last quarter, positioning T&E forces was our immediate focus and I outlined several steps we've taken to bring T&E forces in line with current and expected volume. I also outlined several infrastructure projects across the Chicago\/New Jersey corridor that were nearing completion. In addition, I detailed the timeline for the acquisition of additional locomotives in the fourth quarter. ","The first of the larger conductor trainee classes completed training and were placed in qualified status beginning in November. In November and December we qualified and placed into service 397 new conductors. The Englewood fly-over at Chicago was completed in October separating NS and Metra operations for improved fluidity.","In November, we completed the expansion of our classification yard at Bellevue, adding capacity and additional flexibility to operations across the northern region. Also in December, we put six new staging tracks for unit trains at our Conway terminal near Pittsburgh. ","In regard to locomotives, we took delivery of the 50 new EMD locomotives in December and 34 of the 100 SD90MACs that were purchased. With these efforts, service began to improve in December and will further improve into 2015, as we bring on additional T&E forces to meet growing demand.","Additionally by the end of the first quarter, weather permitting, we will complete projects such as a new connection track at our 51st Street yard at Chicago and a new connection linking our terminal at Elkhart, Indiana to our line going south through Marion, Indiana. This will enable more fluid operations around one of our largest terminals, and the growing volume quarter between Chicago and Atlanta.","On Slide 4, train speed data reflects the same trends of improving performance and network fluidity toward the end of the quarter. For the full fourth quarter, train speed averaged 19.7 miles per hour, with an increase in December. ","On the next slide, terminal dwell averaged 29.7 hours for the full quarter. We did see improvement in December, even though average dwell is somewhat skewed due to the Christmas holiday shutdown. In the post-holiday period, we\u2019ve seen average terminal dwell continue to fall and expect that trend to continue as train operations become more consistent across the network. ","A summary of key operating metrics shown on Slide 6. With a volume increase of 4% in the fourth quarter, our crew starts remain flat, the same pattern we've seen for the full year. The availability of crews created more opportunities to combine and annul trains. ","The impact of crew shortages and a slower velocity, particularly during the first two months of the quarter resulted in increased overtime in the fourth quarter. But as I noted earlier, we\u2019re adding nearly 400 new conductors in November and December and will be increasing the number of qualified crews over the next few months. Additionally, as our train speed continues to improve as we saw in December, we will see a decline in overtime. ","Carloads per locomotive also declined due largely to an increase in light locomotive moves as we directed more power to our terminals across the northern region and increased the number of premium intermodal trains to protect service levels over the seasonal peak going into Christmas and the holidays. For the full year, carloads per locomotive was flat. In the fourth quarter, gross ton miles per gallon continued to show the improving trend we've seen through the year, down 3% over the same period last year.","Improvements toward the end of the fourth quarter reflect our efforts of the last several months to increase crews, increase locomotives and implement infrastructure improvements. As you can see, these additional resources are coming on board and will continue through the first half of the year. Our customers have seen improvement in service, which will continue as operating performance improves. ","Thank you. And now Marta, I will turn it over to you.","Marta Stewart","Thank you Mark and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll now discuss our fourth quarter financial results, which concludes another year of record performance. I will finish with an overview of the full year financials and speak to our capital spending plan for 2015. ","Slide 2 summarizes our quarterly operating results. Railway revenues as Don discussed, were about even for the quarter, while railway expenses decreased by $21 million or 1%. This resulted in record fourth quarter income from railway operations of 891 million up 1%. The operating ratio improved 40 basis points to 69.0. ","The next slide shows the major components of the $21 million net decrease in expenses. Lower fuel costs as well as lower compensation and benefits were somewhat offset by increases in purchased services and rents, materials and other and depreciation. Now let's take a closer look at each of these expense categories. ","As shown on Slide 4, fuel expense decreased by $56 million or 14%. For the quarter, our average price per gallon was $2.52, a 17% decline.","On the consumption side, gallons used rose just 3% on the 4% growth in fourth quarter volume. As Don just showed you, the WTI forward curve is projecting further declines and we are currently paying about $1.70 a gallon. If this continues, we will see meaningful savings in the coming year, as we use about 125 million gallons of diesel fuel each quarter. ","Turning next to compensation and benefits, these cost declined by a net of $47 million or 6%. Continued favorability and post-retirement medical and pension accruals, coupled with slightly lower health and welfare costs, resulted in a $47 million reduction in expense. Additionally, incentive compensation showed a relative decline of 32 million, largely due to the higher accrual level in the fourth quarter of 2013. Partly offsetting these declines were increased pay rates of $15 million, higher overtime of $11 million, and 5 million related to the temporary transfer program Mark discussed with you on last quarter\u2019s call and which was in place to increase crew availability primarily in the northern region. ","For 2015, we will have a higher quarterly increase related to pay rates because our labor agreements call for a wage rate increase effective January 01st instead of July 01st, as we have in the previous five years. Therefore, while each quarter of 2014 reflected about $15 million for this item, or a total of 60 million, for 2015 it will total approximately $85 million and will be weighted about two-thirds in the first half of the year. ","Slide 6 depicts purchased services and rent, which were up $46 million, or 11%, largely due to higher volume-related activities, particularly in the areas of intermodal operations, equipment rents, and joint facilities. The slower network velocity Mark described also contributed to the increase. The materials and other category rose by $29 million, or 15%. About 16 million of this was due to higher casualties and other claims as the prior year, the fourth quarter of 2013, have a large favorable personal injury adjustment. In addition, $6 million of the increase is related to higher material usage. And, lastly, 2 million was due to higher T&E travel and temporary housing costs associated with the transfer program. ","Turning to Slide 8, depreciation expense rose by $7 million, or 3%, which is consistent with the trend in the third quarter and is reflective of our larger capital base. That brings us to our income tax accruals and effective rate, which are shown on Slide 9. Total taxes were 279 million for an effective rate of 35.3% compared to 34.5% last year. The effective rate was somewhat lower than previous quarters of 2014, primarily due to $9 million related to tax credits in the extenders legislation which passed in December. Since the legislation was only for 2014, those credits will not benefit our 2015 tax accruals and, therefore, the effective rate in 2015 is likely to be closer to the combined federal and state statutory rate of 37.5%. ","Wrapping up our quarterly overview, net income and EPS comparisons are displayed on Slide 10. Net income was 511 million, a decrease of $2 million. Diluted earnings per share were $1.64, even with the prior year and matching our all-time fourth quarter record. ","Focusing next on the full-year operating results; revenues were up 3% while expenses only rose by 1%. This resulted in record operating results up 10% and an all-time best operating ratio of the 69.2. As you might expect, the record operating results also provided for record bottom-line results, as shown on the next slide. Net income for the year, depicted on the left side, was $2 billion. Excluding the large land sale that benefited 2013, net income increased 8%, which translated into a 9% increase in earnings per share to $6.39. ","Moving on to cash flows, our cash from operations covered capital spending and produced 734 million in free cash flow. While the year-end tax legislation I just mentioned also extended bonus depreciation for 2014, it did so after we had made our fourth-quarter estimated tax payment. Therefore, the cash flow benefit of 2014 bonus depreciation, which amounted to approximately $250 million, will not be reflected until 2015 when we can reduce our April estimated tax payments. ","Turning to shareholder returns, we distributed $687 million in dividends, reflective of the two dividend increases made in 2014. As Wick mentioned, our Board has approved another $0.02 per share dividend increase effective with our first-quarter 2015 dividend payment. In addition to the dividend, we also repurchased $318 million of stock. In 2015 we anticipate a higher level of share repurchases more in line with our average of the past five years. Our operating expectations will be supported by a robust capital program in 2015. Slide 14 shows four years of historical capital spending as well as the projection for 2015. The $2.4 billion budget is 13% higher than 2014. ","Slide 15 splits our planned capital spending between core, growth, and PTC. Similar to prior years, core spending comprises about two-thirds of the total and reinvests in our track, our freight cars and our locomotives. Growth and productivity-related capital make up about a quarter of the budget, as we invest for additional volume, add locomotives, and increase track capacity. ","Slide 16 provides you the detailed amounts by type of expenditure. Most are generally in line with recent years proportional spending. ","In addition to the $2.4 billion capital budget, the acquisition of the DNA South assets from Canadian Pacific of approximately 215 million will also be reflected in property additions on our cash flow statement in the quarter in which that transaction closes. We believe this capital program positions us well to efficiently grow in 2015. ","And with that, I thank you for your attention and I will turn the program back to Wick. ","Wick Moorman","Thanks, Marta. Well as you have heard, we had a good fourth quarter which capped off a very good year in spite of some of our and the industry's operating challenges. The good news for all of us is from that standpoint is that we and the other carriers seem to have turned the corner from a network velocity standpoint. And while we obviously still have a few months of winter to go, we at Norfolk Southern are confident that our metrics will continue to recover and reach their 2012-2013 levels by the second half of 2015.","From a business standpoint, our outlook is positive but there are clearly some question marks out there. As you\u2019ve heard from Don, coal remains something of a wild card for us with continued weakness in the international markets and natural gas currently in the $3 range. ","It\u2019s also unclear how the effects of lower oil prices will play out. Obviously the reductions in lower fuel -- will result in lower fuel expenses for us and should provide an additional boost to segments of the economy that can generate more traffic for NS. However, our revenues from fuel surcharges will also be considerably lower, and it may well result in slower growth in the energy-related segments of our traffic base, including frac sand and crude oil. ","Quite frankly, neither we nor anyone else we know of understand exactly how this will all play out, but we are obviously watching it closely and are ready to respond to whatever happens to the best of our ability. The end of day, our strategy remains the same, do our very best to operate an efficient, high-velocity railroad, which enables us to offer the best possible customer service and retain and grow business at rates that provide a superior return for our owners. ","That's easy to say, but as 2014 proved not always easy to do. But Norfolk Southern has the best team in the business and I am very confident in our ability to reach that level again quickly and stay there. ","Thanks and I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Bill Greene","Wick and Mark I wanted to ask you about costs, because in the past we have seen Norfolk tend to want to keep some of the resources in place a bit longer to maintain the service when volumes start to grow. Obviously we\u2019ve been in a period of strong volumes and the service hasn't quite been there, so if volumes this year turn out to be less than expected, how much of the cost structure is kind of fixed? How much could you go back and touch? Or are we kind of in a world where, no, given the service challenges, we're going to hold this regardless kind of what volume does?","Wick Moorman","Well Bill one thing we can react to pretty quickly is we can dial back on our crews. As far as locomotives we've kind of got what we've got, but I think it was very beneficial that we got these 100 SD90MACs, so that was not as expensive a play as far as the locomotive to go. And then as far as cost go, so much of this has to do with what's baked into our operation from a productivity standpoint and these big projects we\u2019ve had that you are familiar with over the last particularly two or three years, where our leader continues to rollout, movement planner continues to rollout, we will complete our last division in February, all the benefits we're getting from our productivity projects in our terminals with engaged, similar type projects with insight in our locomotive shops, all those things continue to actually lower our cost structure. So we will keep a really close eye on it. And we think we can dial things back if things are not as robust going forward.","Bill Greene","Don or even Wick if you have a view on this too, obviously the fuel surcharges have been a focus. Given the way you've sort of constructed yours and a number of contracts being WTI-based, is there an opportunity here or even a desire to shift that more toward the on-highway diesel to better match revenue and costs, so that we don't have mismatches of this of this magnitude? ","Don Seale","Good morning, Bill. As you mentioned in your question, most of these fuel surcharge components are embedded in contracts so it would take us some time to convert overtime. We continue to look at the various formulas that we apply in the marketplace. We have done that over time. We will continue to do that, but there are no plans in the immediate sense to convert from WTI to on-highway diesel. We continue to look at it and, as contracts expire, we will continue to look at that and assess it. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Allison Landry ","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask a question about the decline in coal yields and if you could maybe give us a breakdown of how much was mix versus lower fuel surcharges versus price. And if that included any rate cuts on the export side? ","Don Seale","Good morning, Allison. This is Don. I can assure you there has been no price adjustment on the export; the mix and the fuel are the two highlights of the decline. Let me address mix. As I pointed out in my comments, export shipments were down 25% in the quarter. Those are our longest-haul, highest RPU coal shipments, but we also had negative mix within export as our Lambert\u2019s Point pier, which is the longest of the long-haul, was down about 32% in volume while our shorter-haul export traffic at the port of Baltimore was up 5%. So we had negative mix within the export segment. ","And then within utility we had some partial offset. Our northern utility tonnage was off a little bit more than our south. We were down 9% in the North and 1% in the South, and then fuel was the remaining component of the offset. ","Allison Landry ","Okay. That's very helpful, thanks. And I just wanted to ask, you did mention expectations for solid growth as it relates to NGLs and frac sand in the Marcellus and Utica. Are you -- I guess are you getting a little bit more cautious just given where gas prices are and the rig counts that are falling? I know that right now it seems like the Marcellus and Utica are more insulated than some of the oil plays, but how are you thinking about that for 2015? ","Don Seale","Allison, that\u2019s a good question and gas continues to be disconnected from oil in terms of the marketplace. Low gas prices, as we pointed out, puts pressure on our utility coal market, but we expect the Marcellus\/Utica region for frac sand, pipe inputs, as well as natural gas liquid outputs, to continue to be rather strong this year. The outlook on oil is a little more problematic as the spreads have collapsed and in January we\u2019ve seen Brent actually for a day or two move below the WTI levels. So as long as we see oil in that below $50 range, and spreads that are very close or nonexistent, crude by rail from the West will be more problematic than it was 60 days or 90 days ago. ","Operator","Next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Wadewitz ","Good morning. And Don, I just wanted to say it\u2019s been a pleasure working with you over the years and wish you the best in retirement. ","Don Seale","Thank you, Tom. ","Tom Wadewitz ","On the surcharge topic, is there a framework you can give us to think about this? Because I think the sense is that you are probably a bit over covered, maybe partly due to WTI, maybe due to just the way some of the contracts work, and there is somewhat of an operating income headwind as well as lower revenue. Is there any way you can frame that? Should we look back maybe to 2009 and use that framework for maybe the change in revenue versus change in expense? Or how would you want us to think about how large that headwind is from the operating income headwind from lower surcharge in 2015? ","Don Seale","Tom, looking at 2015 specifically, as I mentioned, our fuel surcharge revenue generated in 2014 was $1.3 billion. If you look at the formulas we have, about half are WTI based and about half are on-highway diesel. And about two-thirds, as I mentioned, of the WTI based are out of the money right now with oil below $50. The other third will continue to generate fuel surcharge revenue this year, as will the on-highway diesel fuel surcharge revenues. So if you put all that together, I would tell you that we expect fuel surcharge revenue slightly below 50% of what we collected last year. ","Tom Wadewitz ","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. How do you think about the -- second question, how do you think about the utility coal sensitivity to gas price? I am wondering what percent of your coal consumption would be in the PJM region or I don\u2019t know if you would call that Mid-Atlantic. But what percent of your coal consumption is there and how much risk do you think there might be at current gas prices of switching really taking your -- taking coal tons away from you? ","Don Seale","Let me frame your question Tom which should be helpful to you and others on the call. Our utility coal business was down about 3.5 million tons for the entire year for 2014. And that was after a market share shift in the North that we talked about, which is about 5.5 million tons of loss for 2014, so we actually had on the margin a small improvement in overall utility tonnage, but I will tell you natural gas prices that are now 285 per million BTU in that range puts a lot of stress on our coal utility plants in the North in close proximity to the Marcellus and Utica gas production fields, where gas is trading well below the 285. ","In the Southeast, the southern portion of our utility fleet, we also see fairly significant pressures on our utility coal burn as a result of gas being that low. So the North is more pressured with respect to proximity and lower spot gas prices, but the South has competitive pressure as well when gas is below $3. ","Tom Wadewitz","Can you give a rough sense of the mix between what's North and what's South?","Don Seale","In the year, we were slightly over 50% in the North on tonnage, like 52-48.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Barnes with RBC. Please proceed with your question.","John Barnes","In looking at your CapEx outlook for 2015, you highlight the rebuild program and the used locomotive program. Just curious with EMD out of the market, how long are those programs, the rebuild and the used program, a sufficient band-aid to cover your locomotive needs? And especially if you get any material volume growth again this year, I know coal is weak, but in the other commodities, how long can that serve as a band-aid until EMD is back in the market?","Mark Manion ","I really don\u2019t -- this is Mark, I don't think about it as a band-aid and keeping in mind that at this point, we are figuring on a steady state of at least 50 locomotives a year and after a couple of years we\u2019ll even increase beyond that, so that is very helpful to us. And then we just got 50 new locomotives in the last year and like I said the 100 SD90MACs coming up, that's going to cover us very nicely for 2015. And then we've got space reserved for purchases in the two years beyond that, so we are in good shape for locomotives.","John Barnes","And then turning on the pricing side for intermodal, truckload rates should move higher. Even though they are experiencing a decline in fuel surcharge, there's some talk about capturing some of that in coal rates. Do you think the outlook for intermodal pricing is similar, that you ought to be able to replace some of the lost fuel surcharge with an increase in base rates? And is this a year where maybe there is the potential to close the gap between truckload and intermodal pricing?","Don Seale","John this is Don. The first part of your question absolutely, we see an opportunity based on tight transportation capacity in the truckload market and across other modes of transportation that sets up a good, solid opportunity for improved pricing across our intermodal book. You will see the results of that in our ARPU as we go through the year, but that will be offset somewhat by lower fuel surcharges, we may not be able to capture all of the delta in the base rate, but we will make a more substantial headway this year in improving base rates in intermodal.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Wetherbee","Mark just wanted to touch back onto the service side. Just kind of get a rough sense of maybe what type of cost was allocated maybe to service issues in the fourth quarter, if you could highlight that? And then as we think about 2015, assuming nothing major from a weather event and obviously there might be some issues in the East Coast in the next couple of days, but as you think about the outlook for 2015, how should that recovery progress as you get these crews back online? When do you think you kind of have service back towards levels that we saw maybe a year or two ago?","Mark Manion","Yes Chris let me take that question and then I'm going to turn it over to Marta to put some more numbers on that, but as we go forward, the way I\u2019m thinking about it is, we have managed to hang onto the recovery that we started with back at the end of the fourth quarter, that's been good. Hopefully we can continue to do that, so the way second quarter shapes up we\u2019ll depend on how the rest of the winter goes, but I\u2019m thinking of the second quarter in terms of improvement over where we are right now. And very much as we go into the second half, I\u2019m thinking of us being back to our old selves in terms of higher velocity, which is certainly going to help cost fallout. So as I think about 2015, I think we\u2019ll not see extraordinary just due to the fact that we are ramping up. ","Marta, can you put some numbers on that? ","Marta Stewart","Yes, I can. In the fourth quarter, Chris, there was a number of pieces I mentioned. If you put them all together, the service cost comes to about $35 million. I mentioned the $11 million in overtime, the $5 million of temporary transfers that we had that was in comp and benefits, and then in materials I mentioned $6 million of increased materials usage. And the final piece is in purchased services and rents. That was up due to volume, but there was a service component to it of about $12 million. The last piece I mentioned was in the other category, the travel for the temporary transfers. So if you put all that together it's about $35 million of additional costs in the fourth quarter. ","Chris Wetherbee","Okay, that\u2019s great. That\u2019s really helpful. And then just circling back to the fuel surcharge component, I guess I am just trying to understand sort of maybe why there isn\u2019t more of a push to move towards the diesel-based or on-highway diesel-based fuel surcharge programs. It would seem like that would be maybe a better match to the input cost. I guess I am just kind of curious why that wouldn\u2019t be something that you would be thinking about doing over the course of the next couple of years as these contracts come up for renewal. ","Don Seale ","First and foremost, as I mentioned earlier, it\u2019s the fact that we have to cycle through contracts to be able to make those changes. We are -- we will continue to assess whether or not we want to make those changes when we negotiate with our customers, but first and foremost it\u2019s a timing issue. ","Chris Wetherbee","Okay, but it is something that you would consider I guess going down the road here? ","Don Seale ","Well, the fact that we are at 50% of our surcharges are on-highway diesel shows you that -- demonstrates that we have been moving in that direction. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Kim, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Thomas Kim","Good morning. Thanks for your time. I just wanted to ask on the export side for coal, I presume the 3 million in coal royalties is primarily related to that. And I guess should -- and please correct me if I am wrong there. And I am wondering is that rate in the fourth quarter something that we should be sort of looking forward to as sort of the run rate for \u201915, bearing in mind that it does seem like the run rate in the fourth quarter was slower than what we have seen in the first nine months of \u201914. Thanks. ","Don Seale ","Good morning. Of course the export coal does not have a royalty revenue associated with it. This would be Pocahontas Land, which is our energy subsidiary in West Virginia that has coal leases to coal operators. And that would continue to -- that is recurring income based on coal production and coal volumes. ","Thomas Kim","Great, thanks for the clarification there. And then just with regard to the overall export volumes in coal, the fourth quarter did show some further deterioration in the absolute tonnage. If we were to annualize that for 2015, we would be looking at sort of a similar decline for the year, call it about 18% or so. Do you think that is a fair assumption or could you give us some color as to what sort of export coal tonnage we should be anticipating for the year? ","Don Seale ","Let me frame your question just looking back. We saw our export volume in \u201914 fall from 28 million to 23 million tons. In that marketplace in \u201914, we saw the thermal market to Northern Europe declined from the mid-70s all the way down to under 60 now on the API2, $60 a ton. That is well below the cost of production for most or all of Central App producers, so our producers that have historically moved thermal coal to Northern Europe are out of the money with respect to production cost. ","And also on met coal we saw continued softness in the world settlement price, below $120 per ton, and we saw Australia continuing to increase production as well as watching their currency weaken against the dollar, which gives them a further cost advantage. So 2015 is shaping up to be a very challenging year for export coal. I won't go out on a limb and tell you how much we actually expect, but we don\u2019t expect it to be strong.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Brandon Oglenski","Good morning, everyone. Wick, it seems like we come back to this question quite a bit, but for investors this is all a relative game, right? So I think when we were at your analyst meeting last year you talked about how Norfolk has targets to really improve profitability right along with the rest of the industry, but obviously you guys don\u2019t provide any specific forward guidance. But today it seems like the call has been focused on a lot of negatives here. You still have lingering service challenges this year. You have higher capital spending, increased coal headwinds. You have the whole issue with the surcharge mismatch right now. ","So, what\u2019s the risk here that 2015 really shows a slowing in the margin improvement? Is this an event here where we see very robust volume demand across the industry, and yet, because of the specific issues at Norfolk, we can\u2019t get a lot of earnings expansion or keep up on a relative basis? Or am I thinking about this too negatively? ","Wick Moorman","Well, I think that you are a little negative on that, Brandon. I think that if you kind of look at the positives, the first is we are clearly in an economy that continues to expand. And the negatives that can go along with the decrease in crude oil prices and fuel surcharge decreases are countered by the fact that I think we\u2019re going to see strong economic growth. And that\u2019s going to drive some segments of our business that are very profitable for us and where we can continue to make volume and margin headway. ","The second thing I think that\u2019s important is that, we and a lot of the rest of the industry in 2014 really did labor under operating challenges. We feel as Mark has told you, a lot better about where we are operationally. We have more to do, more resources that are coming on, but resources that aren't going to add a lot to our overall cost structure. And as you look back at 2014 and you look at not only the expenses that we incurred but, quite frankly there are some places where we could have handled more volume had the network operated a higher velocity. I think we have a lot of positives in that regard as well.","Mark mentioned that we\u2019re optimistic that we are going to be back, certainly by the second half in terms of the operation of railroad and we're going to improve throughout the first half. So I think that -- I think there are a lot of positives that we\u2019re looking at in 2015. Clearly there are headwinds and we want to be upfront about those headwinds, but as I said at the beginning I am optimistic that we are going to have a good year in 2015.","Don Seale ","Brandon this is Don. I would just add to that too that, if you look at the latest quarter, it\u2019s instructional with respect to the pending improvement in our network performance. If you break down our fourth quarter and we don't normally do this by month, but I will do this here. If you look at our volume increases in October, we increased volume by 2% year-over-year, albeit against a strong comp from last year. November, at the bottom of our overall service performance metrics, our volume was flat. And then in December coming off the network reset after the Thanksgiving holiday and with the improved operation after that reset through December, our volumes were up 9%. Our December was much stronger with respect to volume and revenue than the prior two months.","And the only reason I'm going through that data is just to point you toward the strength in our network with respect to overall demand for merchandise and intermodal and coal that was deferred, when we generate better cycle times and improve velocity in this network, which we saw in December.","Brandon Oglenski","Well I don't want to put words in your all's mouth here, but does it sound like that the positives offset the headwinds and that we\u2019re focused on this morning, on channel?","Wick Moorman","Well Brandon I would certainly say on balance that, we think so. We certainly hope so. 2015 has got a long way to go and we\u2019re not sure what\u2019s going to happen in a lot of sectors, but right now as I said, we remain optimistic. We do have some headwinds but we have got a lot of positives in front of us as well.","Brandon Oglenski","And just one more Don by the way congrats on retirement here, I'm sure you'll be happy not to take any more coal questions going forward. Well if I can just get one last one in then, we've talked a lot about it here, but what is the actual outlook for utility and export coal in 2015? Should we be expecting -- I think in the past you\u2019re talking about 1% to 2% decline from MATS, but has that outlook deteriorated just with where natural gas prices are in the discussion we\u2019ve already had?","Don Seale ","Brandon the outlook on utility coal with respect to MATS is the same as what we talked about last fall at our Investor Day Conference. Nothing has changed there. Natural gas prices have trended lower. The forward curve is lower. That will put as we have already said additional pressure on our utility coal burn at our utilities. The question Mark is whether or not gas will stay low all year, and we just have to wait and see that.","With respect to export, the metrics for export thermal as well as metallurgical coal are not good. And we\u2019ll have to see if those change, but we don't see any drivers in the world market that would change that at this point.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.","Bascome Majors","Don since you like coal questions so much, I've got another one for you here. At a really high level, I know we've talked about it lot, but there's a lot of concern out there from investors that that 2015 in coal could be a repeat of 2012 and that's understandable given the weather, natural gas prices and the export headwinds that you've talked about at length already today. But the supply side today is also a little bit different there. Can you talk a little bit -- do you think you and your coal customers are better equipped today versus coal headwinds than 2012? And maybe why or why not?","Don Seale ","I think we\u2019re equipped with respect to handling the demand and also the cyclical nature of demand in 2015. Should we see the rest of the winter extremely cold, we are having a storm in the Northeast as we speak that\u2019s bringing something called winter weather, cold and snow, to that area and that will increase electricity demand. Demand in electricity in our service territory for all of 2014 fell by 1%, even with the polar vortex in the first quarter. So we don\u2019t know how cold the rest of the winter is going to be or how hot the summer is going to be, and I will tell you those two unknowns are a big component of what utility will actually do for 2015.","I think we are better positioned to handle spikes in demand than we were last year. Our crew base is stronger. Our locomotive fleet is stronger. Our network is more resilient. So I am optimistic that if we see opportunities ahead that are driven by those short-term spikes or changes, we will be able to take advantage of it. ","Bascome Majors","And can you give us the latest sense of stockpiles from your customers in each region? What are you hearing today? ","Don Seale","We were down about 18% going into the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter, including December, was relatively mild and even with some of the deferred tons that we didn\u2019t deliver, our stockpiles now are close to normal in the North and close to normal in the South. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Justin Long, of Stephens. Please proceed with your question. ","Justin Long","Thanks and good morning. You gave some helpful color on fuel surcharge and the potential revenue headwind this year, but just to be clear on the potential earnings impact, if WTI and fuel prices continue to trend in line I guess with the forward curve, what\u2019s the operating income headwind you expect in 2015, all else being equal? ","Marta Stewart ","I think, as Don said, and the amount that he said where it could be half of what it was last year is based on the prices that we are seeing now, the current prices. So if you take that same viewpoint of current prices in our fuel expense, you can see the gallons that we burn on average per quarter. And to get a point estimate you would take the current price, and as I said we are paying $1.70 a gallon, so I think you could model it out. ","If it changes, I think we would like to give it in those kinds of pieces because Don has given you what would happen if prices stay where they are now and I have given you what the pieces would be if prices stay now. So that way if the amounts -- if either of those change, you can forecast the two pieces separately. ","Justin Long","Okay, fair enough. And second question on service. As we think about the potential for a gradual service recovery that could occur over the course of the year, is there any way to frame up how significant a one mile per hour improvement in velocity on the network could be for the business, whether it\u2019s the additional capacity it creates for volumes, the cost savings, or some other way to think about the financial impact? ","Mark Manion","This is Mark. One thing that comes into play is that it affects our locomotive fleet. And our analysis on that reveals that for every mile an hour you get about a 70 locomotive, 75 locomotive benefit from that. And then, from the standpoint of just pure improvement that we get from velocity, of course some of our costs drop off. We see the number of re-crews go down, so we don\u2019t have that expense. We see reduction in our overtime. And beyond that it just frees up the network to where we just run so much more fluidly and that\u2019s just got various benefit to it. ","So, barring an unusual winter, I would think we could get an additional mile per hour. We are bumping around 21 miles an hour right now, and I am hopeful that we could get another mile per hour out of that in the second quarter. And then, like I said, return to more historical good times in the second half. ","Operator","Our next question is from the lien of Matt Troy, Nomura. Please proceed with your question. ","Matt Troy ","Great, thank you. Just a question on service. You covered it, I think, from the cost side, but if we wanted to be a little bit more conservative in our outlook, maybe in light of the current storm heading into the Northeast. Could you just talk about what areas of the network are a little bit more sensitive or where you might be a little bit more focused and vulnerable through the balance of winter? ","Don Seale","Well, our line between Chicago and New Jersey, of course is our heaviest mainline, and we can have over a 100 trains a day running over portions of that area. And so, particularly in the face of storms that\u2019s where we can see challenges, that's where we definitely saw challenges in the third quarter, particularly in that Chicago to Cleveland area. So in light of that, what we are actually -- what we have actually done is we\u2019ve shifted some of our volume onto other lanes. And we are helping ourselves in that regard. And so, even in-spite of the fact that additional resources applied to that area, the fact that we have unloaded a little bit of that tonnage, we think will be helpful as well and you put all that together and we\u2019re optimistic going forward. ","Wick Moorman","Let me add to that though from a macro standpoint, clearly the area that it's not just Norfolk Southern that we\u2019re almost vulnerable to is disruption in Chicago. It\u2019s -- we interchange so much traffic there, as do all of the carriers that prolonged bad weather in that part of the railroad as Mark says is problematic. We\u2019ve done a lot to try to mitigate the potential downsides of that. The other carriers have as well, but that\u2019s the place where the industry is still clearly most vulnerable. As I say not from a single bad storm, we've seen some bad weather already in the first couple of weeks of the year up in that part of the world and it didn't help, but it hasn't had a whole lot of lingering bad effect. But if we saw something like we saw last year in terms of just a ongoing series of storms, that\u2019s when I think we would all really have to scramble.","Matt Troy","I guess my second question would be for Don and Don again congratulations echoing the earlier comments. Just one last one on coal, I'd like to take the question from a different way. If I look at an export market that was 23 million tons and is a run-rate that's maybe 20% off that based on more recent volumes. I guess if you look at all the pricing metrics and the competitive factors, why did any of that coal need to move? I mean how much of it is under contract? But if I did look at the outline, why should we think of any of it needing to move at such structurally depressed prices where U.S. coal is not relevant in global markets?","Don Seale","Well part of that is that we do have some contracted coal and our suppliers have that contracted coal. The other is that our suppliers are running mines with an intent to keep those mines in production to bridge to a point in the marketplace, which now looks like it could be 2016 at the earliest, before that market starts to turn and pricing starts to move up in the world markets. So part of it is suppliers with contracts.","The other part, a larger part are suppliers that are staying in those markets to have a place at the table and to keep their employees at work and keep production going until they can get better prices.","Matt Troy","I guess I was just trying to ask a long way of how much do you have under contract and visibility in 2015 on a percentage base? Is that something you could dimensionalize?","Don Seale","Our metallurgical coal in the fourth quarter and I will give you this as an example with 80% of our export, we only had 20% of our volume that was thermal. And the contracts that we have are in the thermal side and not a significant portion of the thermal.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please ask your questions.","Scott Group","I\u2019ll try and ask two quick ones. Don when you add up all the moving parts the fuel, the volume, growth, pricing getting better, do you think you\u2019ll see revenue growth this year?","Don Seale","We do. That\u2019s the short answer.","Scott Group","Is there a longer answer? Or --","Don Seale","No, no I think your question is a good one. We expect revenue growth in 2015. We expect as we indicated in the remarks, our merchandise business is continues to be strong and I\u2019d just remind everybody how strong that merchandise segment was in the fourth quarter of \u201813. I would look at the comps and look at the growth on top of those strong comps in the fourth quarter. So we expect that to continue. It may be mitigated somewhat with energy-related commodities that are a little bit weaker, but we\u2019ve fundamentally strong merchandise franchise. ","And then I look at this maybe a little biased, but we have the best intermodal network in the East. And we\u2019ve invested in that intermodal network. And the time for growth is now and the time for margin expansion is now.","Scott Group","It sounds like between volume and then maybe price offsetting mix is enough to get you to positive revenue?","Don Seale","We\u2019re confident that that will be the case.","Scott Group","And then just one for Marta. I know you talked about ramping up the buyback this year back to historical levels, can you give us a little color on what you mean by that? We've got a couple years of $2 billion of buyback, some years $1.3 billion, 2013 with $600 million, so what kind of range were you thinking with that comment?","Marta Stewart","Right, if you look over our last five years, the average -- you're right it has gone a bit up and down, but over the last five years it averages a little over $1 billion.","Scott Group","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","John Larkin","Good morning, everybody, and thanks for taking my question. Maybe this is for Wick. Given that Don has been such a consummate professional for so many years could you maybe share with us the thought process of replacing him? I assume the replacement will come from an internal person, but perhaps you could illuminate us a little bit in that area?","Wick Moorman","Well, I think all I can really say is that we are obviously looking our hand over and we are talking with our Board, which ultimately makes or helps us make decisions like this. We look forward to coming up with a replacement candidate in the fairly near future. I will say that, in some ways, Don is irreplaceable, particularly his patience in answering questions about coal. But, no, we are on track to name a new Chief Marketing Officer in the fairly near future.","John Larkin","Thanks for that. Then maybe just a question on the capital program that Marta reviewed earlier. I was a little surprised to see a large freight car program of -- I think it's 404 million. Usually over the years I think the freight car percentage of the total has been a little lower than that. Can you give us some color on where that money is going to be spent, given that so many of the cars that are employed in the new energy business are typically leased cars or shipper-owned cars?","Marta Stewart","John, you're absolutely right that that is a little bit of a higher percentage than we have had in the recent years. One of the reasons why is exactly what John just talked about; is expected growth in our intermodal market. So we've got some containers and chassis that we will be purchasing.","In addition, he talked about the automotive sector and how strong we think that's going to be for us, so we've got bi-levels and tri-levels in there and we've also got coil cars. So it is to replace -- those are the growth that I mentioned and it's also to replace other units that are either coming due for their normal capital replacement or that we are going to capital instead of leasing. So we've got growth and replacement in there.","Wick Moorman","I think that -- to add a little bit to what Marta said, which is exactly right, when we look at our freight car fleet -- and we have some components of it in addition to our coal hopper fleet that are aging -- and we look at our business prospects, we really fundamentally believe that when we see the need for car types where we know we are going to be in that business for a long time. It's good business for us and business that doesn't fluctuate wildly over a cycle.","It makes more economic sense for us, if we have capability to do so, to buy rather than lease. We are constantly doing those types of economic analyses. And in these cases we feel that it is better business and offers ultimately a higher return for us to buy the cars rather than leasing, as we might have in the past. But that is not, we feel, the best thing.","John Larkin","Thanks for the color.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead with your question.","Jason Seidl","Thank you. I guess I will first start off by saying, Don, you will definitely be missed and best of luck in retirement. I guess I will switch it up a little bit since it's late in the call. You guys mentioned that there was some shutdowns and some retooling in some of your auto plants and that you are expecting a pretty strong 2015. Based on the fact that some of the shutdowns and retooling were in the fourth quarter, should we expect some of the strength to be front-end-loaded in the year?","Don Seale","Jason, this is Don. We will see ramp up volumes of the F-150 for Ford, for example, out of Kansas City. That was one of the plants. The new Transit at Kansas City, which is a van, also ramping up and then, of course, General Motors at Wentzville, Missouri, also ramping up. So we will see some front-end loaded growth and growth throughout the year though from those plants that I'm mentioning.","Jason Seidl","Okay. And I will switch my second question here to intermodal. Obviously this issue that has been going on with the West Coast ports pretty much since July, is there any way to quantify a benefit that Norfolk might've seen from that, if any?","Don Seale","It's not very easy to quantify the exact benefit. We have seen more all-water service coming to the East Coast ports, but, frankly, we had seen that pattern develop over the last five, six years. So our East Coast ports are busy. They probably are on the margin busier than they would have been had the ILWU negotiations not impacted West Coast port operations. But what we are seeing in our international growth more fundamentally than that, is new accounts and new services, one of which I will mention is the South Carolina Inland Port at Greer, South Carolina. That\u2019s ramped up and continues to grow. And our Heartland Corridor and terminal projects associated with the other corridors have helped us continue to grow our business with new accounts in the international space. ","Jason Seidl","So, Don do you think, given all the issues the West Coast port has had now and then even a couple years back and the projections for ramping up a lot of East Coast ports to handle larger ships, do you think some of these wins can be sticky for the East Coast? ","Don Seale","I think the larger ships that are continuing to come online that are coming to the East Coast ports already through the Suez Canal, that\u2019s something that\u2019s notable and certainly sticky. That will continue. The Panama Canal has been delayed, as we know, into \u201816. But the Suez Canal, as we have said all along, because of the shifting nature of international freight origins in Asia from China back toward Vietnam and Malaysia et cetera, we are already seeing those large ships come to the East Coast ports. And we expect that to continue. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman, Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Kauffman","Thank you very much. Thank you for taking my question. Congratulations, Don, and best of luck. ","Don Seale","Thank you Jeff. ","Jeff Kauffman","Let me also ask you a question on your way out. If you had to guess how much business the railroad did not do because of service congestion, service issues, and I'm thinking more specifically intermodal, but I will leave it open -- how much business do you think the company could do next year if service levels normalize and you get some of that business back? ","Don Seale","We certainly will do more business because our fleets, our equipment fleets have better capacity when we turn them at a faster pace. Certainly we believe we could have handled more volume in 2014, and the numbers that I walk through earlier in the call just in the fourth quarter demonstrates that with 9% growth in December alone in terms of overall volume versus pretty much flat volume growth in October\/November. So we will see more business because demand is strong and we expect that demand to continue to be strong. Wick mentioned the consumer market benefiting from lower gasoline prices. We think that will certainly have an impact on overall demand in intermodal. ","And also the strong dollar, while it is a headwind for exports, it will definitely be a tailwind for imports, and again, our international business will benefit from that. And turning the equipment faster gives us more capacity, generates better customer satisfaction, and also supports our pricing negotiations. ","Jeff Kauffman","Should I think of the D&H acquisition as more of a revenue opportunity or an optimization opportunity? ","Wick Moorman","I think you would think of it as both. We have been a substantial user of the D&H for some time now as one of our major routes to access New England, along with the Pan Am Southern. We do believe that we will be able to some extent to streamline and improve our operations as a result of this. But we also have done a careful analysis of the market and do see increased revenue opportunities, so we think that from both standpoints it\u2019s a good deal for us. ","Jeff Kauffman","Okay, and last follow-up with Marta. Marta along the lines of the question I asked Don, you outlined about $35 million of congestion related costs that you believe occurred in the fourth quarter. As the service levels do normalize and the miles per hour go up and some of the older locomotives can be put down, overtime is not being paid, what do you think congestion costs you all-in in 2014? ","Marta Stewart","Well, that\u2019s a good question. In 2014 and we talked about some of the pieces on each of the calls. In the first quarter we had a weather related impact that we talked about, first quarter 2014, that was 45 million. And then in the second and third quarter we talked about service impacts that were about 25 million a quarter and then this one, as I said, is about 35 million. ","So we had weather first and then we had some degree of service related, most of it is related to velocity, as you would expect additional costs. So going into 2015, as Mark said, we are hopeful that we are going to gradually improve through the first two quarters. So we will still see some of that, some of those costs in the first couple of quarters we think. And we will also have, as he mentioned, the fact that we have additional employees that we got in the fourth quarter, those will carry forward and we are continuing to add employees in 2015. So you are going to see the costs that are related to service I would say front-end loaded in 2015 and then gradually the overtime, the extra materials, the extra purchased services due to velocity work themselves off in the latter half of the year. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Investment Research. Please go ahead with your question.","David Vernon","Maybe Don or Mark a question for you on capacity within the intermodal network. Are you guys sort of thinking about -- could you talk a little bit about how you guys are thinking about the growth opportunity on the domestic highway conversion and whether you will be adding any new train starts or new services within the intermodal network this year? And what kind of room you have to actually take new volume growth?","Don Seale","This is Don. In terms of our network capacity for domestic intermodal and also international, we\u2019ve invested in the terminals and the corridors to the extent that we have capacity in the network to grow in a significant way. Certainly the train service plan is set for 2015. And if we see that demand changing or enhancing or growing beyond that, we may look at new trains, but at this point we don't see a need for significant new train service in the network. We will continue with our densification program and stacking programs to generate more boxes per train to the point that they reach a length of train that we decide to add a section to it, but all of that said, we have capacity in the network without adding anything right now.","David Vernon","Maybe and then just as a quick follow-up Marta, question for you on some of the non-operating stuff. We had about $150 million a $0.30 tailwind from the pension and post-retirement stuff this year. Is there anything else like that that we should be aware of from a modeling perspective for 2015? Is there any sort of large one-time non-operating items that we should be putting into our estimates?","Marta Stewart","No in that area pension and post-retirement, you're right, we had that big decline 2014 over \u201813. But the accruals for pension and post-retirement, which are in compensation and benefits, those are expected to be flat in 2015 versus 2014.","David Vernon","And there's no other sort of non-operating stuff that we should be -- that we should have on our radar? ","Marta Stewart","No. As you know, our non-operating items include the coal royalties that Don mentioned earlier and also include real-estate sales and those if you look historically, those are lumpy, but right now we don't have anything that we\u2019re anticipating that\u2019s going to make that significantly different from 2014.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.","Ken Hoexter","If I can just kind of follow-up maybe on the fuel surcharge programs, I just want to understand, maybe clarify some comments earlier to build the start of the call, you mentioned no plans to convert from WTI to on-highway and then to Chris later on you noted it\u2019s a timing issue and you will consider it. Can you just state, why wouldn't you clearly state that every contract going forward at least would be discussed or converted from WTI onto on-highway diesel in the contract?","Wick Moorman","Ken we plan to make the best business decision with those negotiations for each contract, so we wouldn't want to say one way or the other, but we\u2019re certainly open to it and it will be part of our negotiations and we\u2019ll make the best business decision for us going forward.","Ken Hoexter","And then on the CapEx, question for Mark. Just with service rebounding, as you accelerate CapEx 15%, could that impact your service improvements at all? Does it accelerate it? Does it slow it down in instances where you need to make capacity investments? And then thoughts on the D&H, does that fit in there at all as well in terms of accelerating any of the service rebounds?","Mark Manion","Well in terms of -- I presume you're talking about infrastructure improvement, is that right Ken?","Ken Hoexter","Yes.","Mark Manion","Yes. And I've talked about that on these calls before how very beneficial that is and we have been spending for going back probably 10 years, more than 10 years now, it's that approximately $50 million a year. And like I\u2019ve said in a very surgical way where we've got the tools these days to look out to see where the capacity needs are. And we've got a bundle of infrastructure improvement projects that are teed up right now. They are always rolling out of the pipeline and they continue to be very beneficial to the overall operation, so that is part of what will get us improved velocity as we go forward this year and after that.","Ken Hoexter","So as the investments come on, you don't see it impacting your slow, steady improvement comment earlier?","Mark Manion","I do see it positively impacting us Ken. For example, and the Bellevue project is well outside of what I was talking about with the surgical projects that I referred to, but Bellevue for example, as beneficial as that was and when we turned that on in the second half, we saw big improvements to that, but the reality is we have only implemented half of the operating changes related to Bellevue. So more to come and in fact we will implement the rest of that around the end of this first quarter. So improvements from that, improvements from a variety of other projects that -- not necessarily real big, but the key cumulative effect is very positive.","Ken Hoexter","Appreciate the insight. I could just wrap up, my favorite Don statement years ago was we were in a hot hotel room conference room at the end and he said, just helping coal out, leave your air conditioning on when you leave the hotel rooms to help burn more coal. So, Don, appreciate the thoughts over the years.","Don Seale","Ken, it works good with heat as well. Leave your windows open. Thanks, Ken.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Don Broughton with Avondale. Please go ahead with your question.","Don Broughton","Most of my questions have been answered. I had one little housekeeping thing. Marta, you said that because of the timing of the renewal of bonus depreciation you were going to recognize a catch-up in Q1 for 2014. In order to properly model, what is the nominal amount of that catch-up?","Marta Stewart","And that is a cash one. I don't know if I was completely clear on that. That is a cash effect so we already recorded the deferred tax proportion related to that in the fourth quarter, but we made our estimated surplus paying your taxes ahead of time. So cash effect.","Don Broughton","Perfect, that's perfect sense. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Thanks very much and good morning. I wonder if you could, as your peers have done, give us a sense of your total exposure to crude by rail, frac sand, and pipe, either as a percentage of total revenue or a percentage of total volume.","Don Seale","Yes, good morning, this is Don. Our crude oil based on the actual loads handled in 2014 was a little less than 1.5% of our volume for the year. If we factor in the natural gas liquids and Marcellus, Utica inputs and outputs, including natural gas liquids, and put it with crude, it is a total of 3%.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Okay, that's very helpful. Then just in terms of network performance; clearly that was a challenge all year, but particularly in November and December it looked like those were very challenging months, then followed by some good improvement in December. Can you just talk a little bit about what made October and November so challenging and then the reset that you did post-Thanksgiving?","Don Seale","Sure, I'd be glad to. As we got into the third quarter that was the point of the year in 2014 where we had the lowest crew base, keeping in mind that as we finished the tough first quarter of 2014 and velocity was not good due to all those weather challenges, we did get a surge in volume. And the surge in volume was -- it was in some specific areas, mostly in our northern region, and as we got those volumes and were pretty well keeping up with them through the summer, but as we got deeper into the third quarter those volumes were still up there and that is when we hit the trough as far as the lowest point of our crude base.","You may recall that we had a temporary transfer program where we sent about 120 conductors up into that northern region. It was extremely helpful, but again, we had to paddle hard in order to keep up with it, so that's why we were up against some pretty difficult situations and got into some congestion in that October\/November range. But then, as we have been saying, the resources, particularly the crews, those people that we hired right after the end of the bad winter, they became -- they started becoming available in bigger numbers in November and that is when we saw our improvement.","And Don referred to the reset. It's nothing magical, but simply put, with the advantage of those resources, the additional conductors in November with the advantage of some additional locomotive power we had we took advantage of lower volumes that come on each year that we experience each year around the Thanksgiving holiday. Customers aren't loading as much freight, so we took advantage of those lower volumes and those increased resources to what we call reset the network. And at a point in time at all of our terminals, we come out of the gate with an on-time railroad and we were able to sustain that, so it has been very helpful.","Cherilyn Radbourne","That's perfect. That's all from me, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie. Please go proceed with your question.","Cleo Zagrean","Good morning and thank you. With regards to pricing, ex-fuel, could you please comment on the outlook for core trends for coal and the rest of the business excluding coal, and how you expect mix to impact the operating ratio in 2015 versus 2014? Thank you.","Don Seale","This is Don. Good morning. I will address the first part of the question first with respect to the pricing outlook, we expect it to be stronger based on transportation demand capacity issues in the marketplace. Truckload capacity is constrained as well as other modes, as we indicated earlier. So we expect the pricing outcome to be stronger in 2015 than we have seen in the past couple of years for sure. Can\u2019t get into the actual components of it, but we do not expect to see price increases in export coal. We will maintain our current pricing. As we have indicated in past quarters, we don\u2019t believe that we can move that market now with changes in our price. So, therefore, we will maintain our quarterly pricing we have in place. ","With respect to our utility coal contracts, we have escalators that are in those contracts that will escalate. I will tell you that the all-inclusive less fuel index this year is projected to be up around 2% and then up 3% in 2016, which is a better outcome than we saw in \u201914. ","Cleo Zagrean","Would you say that transportation at the margin may help the competitiveness equation for domestic coal, and there may be some thinking or trade off that you would consider there to help volumes? ","Don Seale","I think if we see the economy continue to expand, which we believe it will with low energy prices, higher consumption based on savings to the consumer from those energy prices, that we will see increased activity in the economy both on the industrial sector, the manufacturing sector, as well as the consumer economy. So that should lead to improving electricity consumption and production and that certainly -- those two things certainly would help the utility franchise through the year. ","Cleo Zagrean","Thank you. And then the mix impact on operating income? ","Don Seale","Well, the mix impact, we will see more intermodal versus coal shipments. Our intermodal is growing the fastest of our entire network. Our merchandise is second and then coal, of course, has been contracting up to this point. All of that business is positive with respect to operating margin and operating income. I will tell you that intermodal puts a little bit more pressure on the operating ratio than, say, coal growth or strong merchandise growth. ","Cleo Zagrean","Thank you very much, and my follow-up relates to the operating ratio outlook. Can you help us understand your expectations for improvement this year for the main drivers, maybe price volume and productivity, and with any detail you would like to offer about operational initiatives that you are looking forward to this year, Bellevue and any others that you would like us to be aware of? Thank you. ","Wick Moorman","Well, I will take a stab at that. We clearly have a goal every year to continue to lower our operating ratio. We were successful at that, as you know, for 2014 and I guess that all I can say about various initiatives is that the operating ratio is -- has a numerator and a denominator and we have a lot of initiatives underway in both. We think that improving velocity will have very positive impacts on our cost structure. And as you heard Don say, we think this is a good pricing environment, and we think that the general strength of the economy gives us very good prospects for growth in a lot of the key elements of our business. So using both of those elements, it\u2019s our goal and intention to continue to lower the operating ratio in 2015 and in the future as well. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Rob Salmon, Deutsche Bank. Please go with your question.","Rob Salmon","Thanks, Don. As you had answered one of Scott\u2019s questions earlier about kind of the intermodal side of the business, you had highlighted the fact that the time for intermodal margin expansion is now. And clearly there is a train length extension component of that, but if I switch over to the pricing side, could you give us a sense of how much of your domestic intermodal business is up for repricing in 2015 and whether that is a front-end loaded or a back-half loaded thing? ","Don Seale","Good morning. This is Don. I will tell you that on our domestic intermodal book about 60% of the business is being reprised in 2015. The largest tranche of that will be effective February 15. We have previously and that\u2019s a contract and I won\u2019t get into the increased level. I have previously indicated what our plans were for our public prices for EMP boxes, our domestic boxes, and that is running in the range of 5%. ","Rob Salmon","Thanks, Don. Then just a quick follow-up with regard to the cycle turns in intermodal. Can you give us a sense of how much the box turns have declined in 2014, whether you can speak to kind of where they are on the E&P or on the triple crown on a per month basis, or just overall percentage changes and how we should be thinking about that improving as velocity comes back? ","Don Seale","I don't have the percentage that I can give you offhand, but we will tell you that our -- as our train speeds declined in \u201914 our cycle times declined with that. We were running somewhere in the range of 27 miles per hour to 28 miles per hour in our intermodal network only, not our total network, but our intermodal network. And that declined in the range of 22 miles per hour to 23 miles per hour, beginning to come back up. So you can take that delta and certainly get to your answer with respect to cycle times.","Operator","Thank you. There are no additional questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back to management for closing comments.","Wick Moorman","Thanks very much for your patience. Thanks for all your questions again, all of our thanks to Don for his great service to our company. And we look forward to speaking with you all again at the end of the first quarter. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation."]}}
