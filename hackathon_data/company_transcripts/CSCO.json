At the request of Cisco Systems, today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect.","Now I would like to introduce Melissa Selcher, Vice President of Corporate Communication and Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Thanks, Kim. Welcome, everyone, Cisco's fourth quarterly FY 2015 quarterly conference call. This is Melissa Selcher, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO, and Kelly Kramer, our CFO.","By now you should have seen our earnings release with expanded financial information. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found on the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website.","Throughout this conference call we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. And we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue, and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise.","The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we'll be providing for the first quarter. They're subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and any applicable amendments which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details.","As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during this quarter unless it's done through a specific public disclosure.","I'll now turn the call over to Chuck.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Mel. It's an honor today to lead this call as the CEO of Cisco. While this is only my third week officially in the CEO role, we've really hit the ground running since my appointment was announced on May 4. I believe that I'm stepping into this role at an incredible time for the company. John's vision and leadership have set Cisco up for the future that I believe will be even better than our past. John is an industry icon, a global community leader, a friend. And as Executive Chairman, I'm excited that our customers, partners, employees, and shareholders will continue to benefit from his contribution to key priority areas, and I look forward to his partnership going forward.","Over the last 90 days, we've seen an infectious energy emerge at Cisco, and we've made strong moves around the four focus areas that I laid out: accelerating what's working and changing what's not; simplifying our business; driving operational rigor; and investing in our talent and our culture. We will continue to move quickly. And going forward it is my intention to be transparent on what we were doing, what we are doing, and more importantly, why we are doing it.","As we closed our fiscal year, we delivered record revenues and record non-GAAP EPS for both Q4 and fiscal year 2015. We're growing our business and earnings while driving the evolution of our portfolio and how we bring increasing value to our customers. We demonstrated our continued commitment to driving shareholder value, and in FY 2015 returned $8.3 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, which represented 73% of our free cash flow.","Cisco is in a very strong position. Our results reflect the work we've done over the last several years transforming Cisco in today's rapidly changing market.","When I think about our strategy, I look at the huge market opportunity that exists as businesses and governments use technology to drive their growth and operational efficiency. This is why our customers are moving to digital, and it is their number one priority. In the digital world, data is the most strategic asset, and is increasingly distributed across every organization and ecosystem, on premise, at the edge, and in the cloud.","The network plays an increasingly important role enabling our customers to aggregate, automate, and draw insights from this highly distributed data with security and speed. This is driving them to adopt entirely new IT architectures and organizational structures. We understand how technology can deliver the outcomes our customers want to achieve, and it is how we will continue to drive our differentiated strategy and prioritization in our business. This is something our customers and our partners appreciate. And starting today and over the coming months, it is my goal to simplify and bridge for you how Cisco's unique position in this significant market translates into growth and profits for our shareholders, both today and over the long term.","With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Kelly to run through our execution on our financial strategy.","Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Chuck.","I am pleased with our execution on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments, and delivering shareholder value.","Starting with profitable growth, we saw good top line growth in Q4 with a record $12.8 billion in revenue, up 4%, bringing our full-year fiscal year 2015 revenue to $49.2 billion, also growing 4%. Successful portfolio refreshes across almost every product area and effective resource reallocations to growth areas fueled revenue growth in Q4 in every product area except for SP [Service Provider] video. Specifically in Q4, the continued traction of the new core platforms in high-end routing drove routing revenue growth of 3%.","Switching grew 2%, with very strong 200%-plus growth of ACI, both the Nexus 9000 and ASIC, and strong performance in the Catalyst business. And a refresh of the entire collaboration product line accelerated our collaboration growth to 14%. Data center grew 14%, with continued market leadership of UCS. Wireless grew 7%, driven by continued Meraki momentum, and security grew 4%.","In security this quarter, we saw the acceleration in the shift from hardware to software. Our customers are rapidly adopting our subscription-based and software offerings, which is helping us build a greater mix of recurring revenue. This transition is accelerating and will remain a focus for us going forward.","Security and collaboration both had deferred revenue growth of over 20% at the end of the quarter, and we saw total deferred product revenue grow double digit again this quarter, up 21%. Product orders in Q4 grew 4% year over year, with a book-to-bill comfortably above one.","Looking at the geographies, which is the primary way we run our business, the Americas grew 7%, EMEA declined 1%, and APJC declined by 1%. Total emerging markets declined 2%, with the BRICs plus Mexico down 7%.","Looking at customer segments, we were pleased to see a return to positive growth of 2% in service provider. Commercial grew 11%. Enterprise globally declined 1%, and public sector grew 4%.","From a profitability perspective, in Q4 we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.59, up 7%. GAAP EPS was $0.45. For the full year, we grew non-GAAP EPS 7% to $2.21, with GAAP EPS of $1.75. Q4 non-GAAP net income was a record $3 billion, up 6%. GAAP net income was $2.3 billion.","The focus the teams have placed on gross margin stability through technology innovation, sustainable differentiation, and cost savings continues to pay off in Q4, resulting in a non-GAAP gross margin of 62.1%, with non-GAAP product gross margin of 61.0% and non-GAAP service gross margin of 65.9%.","Strong operational rigor resulted in non-GAAP operating expenses in Q4 at 32.8% of revenue and a non-GAAP operating margin that expanded to 29.3%. As I stated at Cisco Live, we are making the right bets and driving discipline in where we invest, helping to ensure we get the best return on our investments. We believe continued operational discipline combined with portfolio optimization can drive our operating margins even higher from where we are now over the long term.","Moving on to the second pillar of our financial strategy, which is the way \u2013 the work we are doing to manage our portfolio and strategic investments to fuel our key long-term growth in areas such as cloud, data center, software, and security. In Q4, we announced an agreement to sell the Client Premises Equipment portion of our SP Video Connected Devices unit to French-based Technicolor for approximately $600 million in cash and stock, subject to certain adjustments. We will continue to refocus our investments in service provider video towards cloud and software-based services. We expect the transaction to close at the end of Q2 of fiscal year 2016, and expect to see an approximate one point benefit to our non-GAAP gross margin rate and negligible net income impact after close.","We also announced our intent to acquire the cloud-based security company OpenDNS. The OpenDNS acquisition aligns with our strategy to deliver more cloud-based subscription services and drive the value of analytics and our security offerings. In Q4 we also closed two acquisitions to further complement our software, collaboration, and cloud offerings. These moves are consistent with our strategy of increasing the allocation of our innovation and R&D efforts to our growth areas.","Services revenues grew 4% in Q4. Double-digit growth in our advanced services portfolio of cloud, security, consulting, and analytics reflects our strategy of selling customer outcomes. Further extending our renewal capabilities, which is highly profitable for us, last week we completed the acquisition of MaintenanceNet, a cloud-based software platform that uses data analytics and automation to manage renewals of recurring customer contracts.","Moving on to our third pillar, delivering shareholder value, in Q4 we increased operating cash flow 15% to a record $4.1 billion. Total cash, cash equivalents, and investments at the end of Q4 were $60.4 billion, with $7 billion available in the U.S. And in Q4 we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders, including $1 billion through share repurchases and $1.1 billion through our quarterly dividend.","For the full year, we generated strong operating cash flows of $12.6 billion and free cash flow of $11.3 billion. We returned $8.3 billion to our shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, which represented 73% of our free cash flow. We are firmly committed to continuing our capital allocation strategy of returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders annually. We are also committed to looking at the right acquisitions at the right price to drive our growth strategy.","To summarize, in Q4 and for the full year 2015, we executed well against our business and financial strategy and saw that execution reflected in our profitable growth, cash generation, and operating leverage. We have also demonstrated our firm commitment to delivering shareholder value.","Let me now go through the guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, which includes the type of forward-looking information that Mel referred to earlier. In terms of total revenue, we expect it to be in the range of 2% to 4% growth year over year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in a range of 61% to 62%, and the non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 28% to 29%.","And the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 23%, up 1% from the prior fiscal year. This represents approximately $0.01 of impact to EPS. If the U.S. R&D tax credit is reinstated, we would reflect that benefit in our effective tax rate.","Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in to range of $0.55 to $0.57. We anticipate our GAAP EPS to be lower than the non-GAAP EPS by $0.11 to $0.15. Further details related to this range are included in the slides and press release that accompany this call.","I'll now turn it back to Chuck to summarize the call.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Kelly.","So let me quickly summarize. I believe our strategy and execution have enabled our performance to be quite differentiated from our peers. We delivered record revenue and non-GAAP EPS and drove positive growth in new orders while increasing our deferred revenue on the product side by 21%. We are delivering these strong results all as we transition our business. Let me give you some clear examples.","First, as we look at our collaboration business, two years ago we said we would overhaul our portfolio and shift it towards more recurring revenue. We delivered revenue growth of 14% and saw deferred revenue growth over 20% on the strength of our subscription and SaaS businesses.","As we look at security, in a highly distributed digital world, security is the top concern for our customers. We are pushing threat-centric security everywhere across the extended network, driving our FirePOWER security services across hundreds of thousands of ASA firewall platforms and ISR routers. In Q4 we added customers more than 15 times faster than Sourcefire at the time of the acquisition.","We're quickly building a substantial software subscription business in our security portfolio, and you see that in the 26% growth of deferred revenue in Q4 for security. Assuming we continue to execute, I'm confident we'll see high double-digit growth in the back half of this year.","In switching, we are driving the transition to the Nexus 3000, Nexus 9000, and ACI, and in the quarter we grew revenue across those product families to $438 million, growing more than 100% year over year and more than 50% sequentially. We added 1,400 new Nexus 9000 customers, bringing us to over 4,100 total. And 26 of our 28 largest enterprise customers are now Nexus 9000 customers, with 30% of them new in Q4.","In high-end routing, we continued to drive the transition in the core and saw both of our new platforms grow in triple digits. We've solidified our lead in this market.","And with Meraki, customers are rapidly adopting this new cloud-based consumption model. Three years ago we bought Meraki for $1.2 billion, with $100 million of annual orders. We closed this year with almost a $1 billion order run rate, scaling the business through our global commercial channels. These are just a few examples of what we are capable of when we focus, and this is what I intend to accelerate.","We've only begun to scratch the surface on how we can take advantage of our scale and relevance in this digital transition and how we deliver our technology to our customers. The strategic role Cisco is playing is at the center of the digital transition today and in the future, and it's why I strongly believe Cisco's best years are ahead of us.","Mel, let's open it up for questions.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Thanks. Kim, let's open for questions. I'd like to remind analysts to please ask just one question. Thanks, Kim.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot. I just wanted to ask a question related to security. That was an area in an otherwise strong quarter that was a little bit below at least where we had modeled. I'm just wondering if you can give a little view on maybe what transpired and how you think about security and what needs to happen there to drive that growth. And I guess as part of that, are you comfortable with your current portfolio in security, or should we expect you to look to make additions there to make it \u2013 increase even further the competitiveness? Thank you.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, James. Thanks for the question. Number one, I am very bullish about where we are with our security portfolio. I think the team has done a tremendous job. They've actually driven the transition that we have begun from hardware to software and subscription business. As we stated, the deferred revenue was up over 20%, I think 26% in the quarter. Software is now 47% of our security portfolio.","On the FirePOWER services, which is where we have our malware capabilities, we added almost 3,000 new customers, which before the quarter I think we had 3,000 customers, so we doubled the number during the quarter. And what we plan to do now is take that across all of our 275,000 ASA firewall customers. And I do feel comfortable that in the next couple quarters we'll get the revenue back in the high double digits. So I think it's a transition that we're pushing. I think the team is doing a great job of accelerating that transition. I think it will be good for us in the long run.","As it relates to our portfolio, when we think about this, we clearly are going to have to continue to expand our offerings for the customers. And we'll do that through a combination of internal R&D, acquisitions where needed, partnerships where they make sense, co-innovation where it makes sense, so we'll be looking at all alternatives.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Great, thanks, James. Operator, next question?","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, thanks very much. I just wanted to ask a question on the backlog. It was down year over year even though book-to-bill was strong, as was deferred. I'm just curious if you can help us reconcile that. And just related to that, enterprise I think you said was down 1% year over year, even though you had very strong bookings there last quarter. So I just wanted to understand the dynamics there as well.","Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Simona. I'll take the backlog one here. So looking at our backlog, it was down marginally from a year ago. And as you know, that's just a point in time. I think the big difference when you compare that to the great strength you're seeing in our product deferred revenue being up is as soon as we invoice it out of our \u2013 invoice whatever it is, the hardware or the software, we remove it from backlog. And then obviously, then as we get our cash for our things or we defer it for a deal, it goes into deferred. So there's a bit of a disconnect between the two of when it's actually invoiced out. But from a backlog weeks, it's right in the same line as what we'd expect at the end of the year.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Simona, on the enterprise portion of the question, so the number that we put out there was a bookings number, order number, new orders. And candidly, I'm not concerned. We see the enterprise business, because of the finite number of customers that exist in that segment, we see those varying quarter by quarter. The commercial and public sector, we sell the same solutions. And I think that if you look at the performance there, we're very optimistic. So I'm not concerned at all about the enterprise business.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Thanks, Simona. Operator, next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, Chuck. Welcome on your first call. I wanted to piggyback on the last question. I had a similar question on switching. Last quarter, I think there was some concern about switching sales having peaked two quarters ago. I think you saw a sequential uptick in switching. How should we be thinking about the cadence in your overall switching business? Is this a business that you feel comfortable growing kind of this 1%, 2%, 3%, low single-digit percent range?","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Amitabh, thanks for the question. I'm pleased with where we are. If you look at our performance in the campus and in the access piece of our business, we had solid performance. We continue see strength based on, frankly, customers connecting everything, IoE, collaboration. As we continue to drive our collaboration portfolio, all of those video end units require switching ports. Security is driving an element of that, as is the transition we see in wireless.","In the data center, we're continuing to work through the transition that we have talked about. I think that you can tell from the numbers that we put up on the Nexus 3000\/Nexus 9000 revenue at $438 million, up 53% sequentially, we feel really good about where we are. We're accelerating there, and I think that we are very optimistic and pleased with where we are in our switching business.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Great, thanks, Amitabh. Operator, next question?","Operator","And our next question comes from Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank. Brian, your line is open. You may want to check the mute feature on your phone.","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, good idea. Hi, guys. If you could add up your services revenue including Meraki, including some of the enterprise area (20:09) products, what's the revenue based on that? What's the overall growth rate and trend in that business? Thanks.","Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Just to make sure, Brian, what pieces are you trying to quantify in there?","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Meraki, your recurring revenue streams, your services plus your recurring revenue streams.","Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I see.","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","What do you have in revenue and what's the growth rate and what's the trend in that? Thanks.","Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Okay, great question. So if I start with \u2013 let's see here, let me just get to that data. I'd say if I go to the actual balance, if I start with the deferred balance and then I'll get to the actual revenue piece of that, like I've talked about before, on the product side, we've been increasing the amount of our deferred revenue that is recurring. So that amount year over year of my total product deferred revenue is now over 46%, up from 40% a year ago, so we continue to increase that. Obviously, there are different ranges of the term on that. But on average for product, it's slightly north of $500 million-plus quarter on quarter that we're weighting down, amortizing every quarter on the product side.","On the services side, it is obviously a much more accurate run rate. I'll pull it up here as we go through. Just give me a couple seconds here and let me pull it up for you. Or actually, let me follow up with you on the call back because I have to dig it up a little bit. Okay, Brian?","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Brian.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Great, thanks, Brian. Operator, next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America Securities Merrill Lynch.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Tal, you may be muted as well.","Operator","Please check the mute feature of your phone. Tal, your line is open.","Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, sorry, now you can hear me. Thanks very much for taking my call. I want to go back to the question on switching because I'm trying to understand. This is a major upgrade, and still we don't see the numbers picking up materially. The sequential growth we're seeing is below what we've seen the last two years, and I'm wondering. Can you go over what's offsetting the growth in Nexus 3000 and Nexus 9000? Why are the numbers not showing much greater increase given the magnitude of the cycle? Thanks.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Tal, this is Chuck. It's a great question. So as we look at our data center switching, again, we are very pleased with the campus and the access switching. We've got a refresh that's being driven there, and that's moving along well. We're very happy with the transition going on in the data center switching space. As we look at customers that are migrating to 10-gig, 40-gig, 100 gig, which is really represented by the data that I gave you earlier, and it's just being offset by the transition from the Nexus 7000 to these new platforms. And we think in the next few quarters we'll see that inflection point.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Great, thanks, Tal. Operator, next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with Bernstein.","Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, thank you for taking my questions. On the service provider side, so you are now getting back to some good revenue momentum. I was wondering. How much of that comes from a change in the landscape in how operators are looking at spending and how much is much more related to your own dynamics and your own product cycle?","And then when we look at the second half of the year, of the calendar year, could you give us a sense of how you see the market evolving, especially your largest clients in the U.S.? Thank you.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Pierre. So on the service provider business, clearly we're pleased that we got back to growth this quarter. Our teams have done a great job. We're proud of what they've done. We made some changes over the last 18 months internally in engineering and services and in sales to better position us, and I think that had a lot to do with it.","I also think that we have really gotten to a point of what I'd say architectural vision alignment with most of our customers. We saw balance throughout the quarter in SP. We saw good performance from data center, collaboration, high-end routing, even SP mobility. And so while we're pleased with the 2%, we're still cautiously optimistic about where we go. I think that in the second half of the year right now, relative to when you think about SP CapEx, there's a lot of movement right now around the expectations for that in the second half. And candidly, we have not modeled any significant increase in the second half of CapEx spend from SP. And if it does occur, then we'll certainly benefit from that. So again, we're cautiously optimistic in this space.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Great, thanks, Pierre. Operator, next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you, maybe a question on how we should think about Cisco's long-term growth on an adjusted basis, considering Cisco has and will continue to make acquisitions, and increasingly you're taking a fresh look at divesting businesses. So can we return to your 3% to 6% long-term growth rate post the SFA divestiture? And concurrently, how should we start modeling the revenue impact as we transition to subscription and as Cisco moves faster to software?","Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Mark. So obviously, when I did Cisco Live, we had assumed the SP video set-top business was still in our portfolio. I think, though, to offset that, as you know, we're very acquisitive, and we will continue to be very acquisitive going forward as we continue to build out our portfolio, especially in areas like software and security.","So in terms of your second part of your question, we will clearly break out to you \u2013 we expect to close the deal officially in the December \u2013 January timeframe. And when we give guidance for Q3, we'll make sure it's very transparent so you can adjust your models for what is coming out based on what we were modeling before.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Great, thanks, Mark. Operator, next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great, thank you very much for taking my question. I wanted to come back to the routing segment. The results this quarter certainly were a bit better than what we were modeling. But when we compare your results to some of your closest competitors, it does appear that at least in their June-ending quarters, they grew a bit faster. So maybe you could help us understand what might be going on in the routing market overall as well as your competitive position and market share. Thank you.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Simon, thanks for the question. So as we think about the SPs right now, I mentioned earlier that we had great success in our high-end platforms that we talked about last year as we began the transition, both of them growing over 100%. As we look at the marketplace today, we did really well in the core. We need to probably improve our performance in our edge routing platforms as we look ahead. But I do think that as we look at where the service providers are going, what they want to do with virtual managed services, how we're aligned now around the deployment of NFV and how we move forward with that, we think that we're well positioned with routing as we look ahead.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Great, thanks, Simon. Operator, next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo.","Jess I. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, guys. I was hoping you could share with us how much of your business is now coming from the Web 2.0 vertical, the trends you're seeing there, how material the opportunity with these customers may be for your prospects in fiscal 2016. And then the service business saw a nice improvement, so any insight as to what drove the improvement there and if there's any reason to believe service growth could accelerate as customers move forward with more complex network architectures. Thanks.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Jess, thanks. So on the MSDC and web players, what I will tell you is that we've spent a great deal of time over the last couple years really understanding what the requirements are, where they're headed, and how we can provide the technology that they need. And I'll tell you, this quarter the top 10 web-scale players, our order growth exceeded 20%, so we're very pleased with where we're going. We actually embarked on some co-development with one of the cloud titans in the last 12 months, and we delivered last quarter a new high-end platform to them as a result of that co-development. So we're pleased with our progress there. We continue to work with them around their unique needs, and we think with our ability to build out scalable solutions with consideration to their unique needs, I think that we're reasonably well positioned.","On the services side, we had good performance this quarter at 4%. I think as we look at our customers and they continue to move to the Internet of Everything and connecting devices, they're going to continue to need more and more services. So we're pleased with where we are, and we feel good about our position in the services business going forward.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Great. Operator, next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from George Notter with Jefferies.","George Charles Notter - Jefferies LLC","Hi, thanks very much, guys. I'm somewhat impressed with the growth rates you guys are putting up in the commercial segment, I guess, on year-on-year product orders. You've had a string of fairly attractive year-on-year growth rates. But can you talk about what's going on there? Obviously, Meraki is a part of the story. I know you guys are trying to push that cloud management system onto other products in the portfolio. Can you just talk generally about the initiatives you have going on in commercial and how you keep driving that growth going forward? Thanks.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, George. We always appreciate that question. This is why when we look at our enterprise segment this quarter, it doesn't concern me. When you look at our commercial business, our selling motions, our solutions and everything we do are the same. There's just a much broader base of customers to balance it across. So we grew the global business in commercial 11%. Just a couple other data points for you, our U.S. commercial business this past quarter grew 19%. That's 23 consecutive quarters of positive growth, and 16 of those have been double digits, so we've had very consistent performance.","I think the key is that we have really shifted both our solutions and our technology as well as our selling motion and our services capability to be much more tightly aligned with how the technology aligns to our customers' business issues. And I think we're doing that very well in the enterprise, and I think the teams have done a really good job of that in commercial. And those commercial customers, those midrange customers, we see it time and time again. They tend to be the early adopters of our new technology because they view it as a way to accelerate their business, to drive their competitiveness, and they just always seem to adopt early.","Meraki has clearly been a big success for us, as I said earlier, relative to exiting Q4 almost on a $1 billion run rate from an order perspective. And we continue to see it being a very relevant portion of particularly the lower end of our commercial market, our K-through-12 market in not only wireless, but also we're seeing an expansion into managed cloud switching as well as security. So we're very pleased with where that is going, and we would expect to continue to add more and more functionality to that platform.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Great. Thanks, George. Operator, next question?","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen.","Paul J. Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks. I appreciate you taking the question. Just very straightforward, if you could, talk about pricing across regions and in general. And, Kelly, can you remind us what cloud times (32:09) are as a percentage of revenue?","Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","The cloud, we don't actually share that with you. But if I get back to your pricing question, I'd say what you're going to see this quarter is very similar to what you've seen all year. Our pricing has remained very \u2013 in a tight range. You're going see that our impact on year-over-year points is basically the same as where it was last quarter, so we're not seeing any incremental discounting going on. And again, that's looking across the board. I think our teams have been executing very, very well, especially outside the U.S. where they're facing the FX headwinds, where they're being very disciplined and managing through the currency effect.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Great. Operator, next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets.","Tim Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. I just wanted to talk a little bit about the emerging markets. It sounds like the U.S. performance has been outstanding, just some of the countries were highlighted as a problem. Could you give us just a little view on how long do you think before we can start to see a more broad-based recovery in the emerging markets, and what pieces of your business do you think are most likely to drive that? Thank you.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Tim, good to hear from you. Thanks for the question. So if you look at the emerging markets, I would tell you that story in Q4 was quite similar to the story in Q3. If we go through the five BRICM countries, Brazil actually was negative 45%. Russia was negative 38%. China was negative 3%, which actually was the best performance we've had in eight quarters. And we had some bright spots. India was plus 5%. Mexico was plus 26%, and Mexico had just a tremendous year in general. And all the emerging countries outside of those five actually grew 3%. So overall it was negative 2%, as we stated. So it's very much the same as it was last quarter.","I think that largely they're largely macro and geopolitical issues. We have adjusted our cost structure where needed and we've invested in areas where we've seen growth, as you would expect. And we believe that as the macro and the geopolitical issues resolve themselves, we think we'll be a big beneficiary of that.","The other comment I'll just make on emerging is if you just look at the EMEA numbers and you remove Russia, EMEA was actually positive. So it was up plus 1% without Russia. So overall, the emerging continued to be a little bit of a strain.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Great, thanks, Tim. Operator, next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jayson Noland with Robert W. Baird & Company.","Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yes, thank you, and I guess a follow-up to Europe. How much of that is macro and how much of that is U.S. dollar strength? And then, Chuck, if you can, comment on any head count reductions to start the fiscal year. Cisco has made some cuts the last couple years.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So as we look at Europe, I think that again, there's an emerging markets element associated with it the way we measure EMEA. And also, I think we stated on the last call that we believe that the currency issue may have as much as one to three points, even though we sell primarily in U.S. dollars in most countries. So I will say that I believe our teams have proven over the last several quarters in Europe that they out-execute our peers and our competitors, and that they \u2013 I think if there are macro issues, we'll deal with them. But based on the things that we can control, I think our teams are doing a very good job.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'd like to thank everybody for joining the call today. I want to just quickly summarize. I do believe that we are in a very strong position. I think that was reflected in our results. I think they were differentiated from what you've seen from many of our peers. Again, record revenue and record earnings per share as well as the 21% growth in deferred product revenue as we continue to transition our business to a more predictable while growing revenue and earnings at the same time. I really believe that the transition that our customers are going through in the move to digital and the Internet of Everything will only be successful with the network at the center of that transition, and I really do believe that the best years for Cisco are ahead.","So thank you very much for joining the call. Mel?","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Thanks, Chuck. Cisco's next quarterly call, which will reflect our FY 2016 first quarter results, will be on Thursday, November 12, 2015, a day later than normal because of Veterans Day, at 1:30 Pacific Time, 4:30 Eastern Time. Again, I'd like to remind you that in light of Regulation SP, Cisco's policy is to not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it's been through an explicit public disclosure. Thank you for joining our call.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's conference call. If you like to listen to the call in its entirety, you may call 1-866-465-1308.

At the request of Cisco Systems, today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect.","Now, I would like to introduce Melissa Selcher, Vice President of Global Corporate Communication. Ma'am, you may begin.","Melissa Selcher","Thank you Kim. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our 97th quarterly conference call. This is Melissa Selcher, and I\u2019m joined by John Chambers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Frank Calderoni, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Rob Lloyd, President of Development and Sales and Gary Moore, President and Chief Operating Officer.","I would like to remind you that we have a corresponding webcast with slides including supplemental information that will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, and cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the Investor Relations website. Click on the Financial Reporting section of the website to access these documents.","Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both, GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements and as such are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-on-year basis unless stated otherwise. As we have in the past we will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer segment result in terms of product orders unless specifically stated otherwise.","I will now turn it over to John for his commentary on the quarter.","John Chambers ","Mel, Thank you very much. I am pleased with our solid performance in Q3 with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.51 and revenues of $11.5 billion. We saw strength in our non-GAAP gross margins of 62.7% and non-GAAP product gross margins of 61.4%. We also continued our disciplined management of the business with total non-GAAP OpEx down 6% year-over-year. We generated 3.2 billion in operating cash flow and returned approximately 3 billion to our shareholders through the dividend and share buyback. We are very focused on creating value for our shareholders, employees, customers and partners.","Our conviction around how we\u2019re evolving Cisco is strong and resolute. You\u2019ve seen is deliver incredible innovation, make bold moves in the market to capture future opportunities and disrupt our competitors and ourselves when necessary. We remain committed to do the right thing to increase our long-term strategic value to our customers and advanced Cisco toward our goal of becoming the number one IT Company.","In Q3, revenue, earnings per share and gross margins exceeded our guidance. Or product orders improved to be relatively flat your-over-year. Our book-to-bill was comfortably above one. I am pleased with the progress to return to growth and I\u2019d like to give you an update on Q4 revenue guidance which will allow you to frame our remarks on the business momentum. For Q4 we expect revenue to decline in the range of minus 3 to minus 1, which would represent quarter-over-quarter growth of 4% to 6% that is Q3 to Q4.","We saw strength across a number of areas of our business end as we looked across the world. From a geographic perspective total U.S. product orders grew 7% with U.S. commercial and U.S. enterprise both up over 10%. The momentum in U.S. enterprise and commercial remains very strong. As an example, in the U.S. enterprise, total deals over $1 million were up over 25% from Q3 start to Q4 start; and deals over $5 million are up more than 50%. As we continue to move to solutions, our Enterprise customers are making more and bigger investments as they partner with us. We see continued stabilization across Europe with order strength in the UK up 7%, Germany up 5%, and northern Europe as a whole up 4%.","From a product perspective, our new service provider platforms are showing good momentum. As we shared with you in prior calls, it takes time when you introduce disruptive high-end products before the growth returns. This quarter we saw high end router order growth reversing a three quarter negative trend. While we are pleased with these results, these numbers will continue to be lumpy. The Nexus 9000 and our application-centric infrastructure, while still early, is gaining significant market traction.","In just our second quarter shipping new application centric infrastructure i.e. ACI enabled platforms, specifically the Nexus 9000, we grew from 20 plus customers last quarter to 175 customers this quarter with a pipeline approaching 1,000 customers. We saw major wins including competitive wins and displacements at large financial institutions, large cloud providers, software-as-a-service and major service providers.","Data Center revenue grew 29%. UCS continues to cement its place as a leading platform for hybrid cloud environments, big data, and virtual desktop services gaining market share for the 17th consecutive quarter since it was introduced. Security revenue increased 10% and orders increased 20%, as a source for our integration continued to fuel growth and opportunities with customers. There are several businesses that are starting to show improving trends.","Collaboration is the first. While collaboration revenues decreased 12% in the quarter, collaboration orders increased 4%, reversing a multi-quarter negative trend. Positive revenue growth of software-as-a-service WebEx business was balanced by declines in Unified Communications and TelePresence. In this quarter, we began unveiling our next-generation of collaboration solutions, specifically a new range of innovation cloud connected TelePresence products at very competitive price points.","Wireless, revenues grew 3% with orders up 12%. We did see some weakness in the service provider customer segment and at the low end of the market, but we saw good strength in 802.11ac ramp, with the AP 3700 now the fastest ramping access point in our history.","There are three areas of our business which we have discussed for the last several quarters where we are managing through challenges, both macro and Cisco-specific. First, emerging markets; from a macroeconomic perspective, continue to be challenging. Orders in our emerging markets declined 7% with the BRICs plus Mexico down 13%.","As we said for several quarters, we expect these challenges to continue. The challenges we saw in Brazil down 27% and Russia down 28% are consistent with those we are hearing and seeing from our peers and customers, while China declined 8%, Mexico declined 3% and India declined 1%.","Our strategy with emerging markets has not changed. Our relationship begins with the engagement with the leadership of the countries on key priorities for the country and technology development initiatives and drives all the way to local municipalities, their service providers and private businesses.","Second, service provider; service provider orders were down 5%, showing improvements from the minus 12% decline in Q2 and 13% decline in Q1. The weakness in emerging markets also negatively impacts the service provider customer segment. SP Video revenue declined 26%, which had a negative impact on our SP segment numbers as we continue to manage through the transition of that business. SP Video orders declined 11%. We are seeing some signs of stabilization in the SP business but believe it will take multiple quarters to return to growth. We will continue to make changes we need to, to lead in the service provider market.","And third, new product transitions in high-end routing and high-end switching. While we saw momentum, actually good momentum in high-end routing orders, as I mentioned earlier, it is still early in the transition, as revenue lags orders by a quarter or so. We did not see the benefit on this revenue in this quarter. This lag, combined with the challenges on access layer and the mobility business, led to a decrease in next generation network routing revenue of 10%.","On the positive side, the strength of the ASR 9000 continues with revenue growth of 59% and it is Cisco's fastest growing and most successful high-end router since the 7500 introduced over a decade ago. We did see next generation routing orders relatively flat and saw orders of the NCS 6000 and the CRS-X grow above our expectations though again it is still early in the ramp and off relatively small numbers.","Overall switching revenue declined by 6%. We continue to manage through declines in our campus switching portfolio, specifically at the high end with the exception of the Catalyst 3850 which is going very well. We are pleased with our momentum in data center switching but it's still early in the high end switching transition. As a result of these transitions, it will be several more quarters before we see growth in overall switching. Switching gross margins remain strong.","Stepping back, I am pleased with the momentum we are continuing to drive across our business despite these challenges. We will continue to take it one quarter at a time as you would expect. While competitors at times may gain share on us in a given quarter or two, we believe that our strategy of driving architectures to deliver business value will win in the long-term. I've met with over 100 CIOs in the last month, and they understand where we're going, our strategy and our differentiation, and are asking us to partner even more closely with them on their business outcomes.","Looking forward, we are driving the innovation and making bold moves to lead the major market transitions our customers are facing today. Two transitions that I would like to highlight this quarter are cloud and the Internet of Everything. On cloud, in this quarter, we announced our InterCloud strategy, leveraging our application-centric infrastructure together with our partners to deliver the first global open network of clouds. Customers, providers and channel partners are turning to Cisco to create an open and highly secure hybrid cloud environment.","Cisco is unique in our ability to enable a seamless world of many clouds in which our customers have the choice to enable the right and highly secure cloud for the right workload. We have already announced major global InterCloud partners such as Telstra and with more to come at Cisco labs next week. Rob, I think you'll be announcing them that time and it's getting pretty exciting.","As you would expect, we have added some of the best and brightest cloud talent to our team. We are also seeing our partnerships in delivering converged infrastructure such as VCE and FlexPod, leveraging application-centric infrastructure and the InterCloud fabric to provide on-ramps to the InterCloud. As part of our InterCloud strategy, we will deliver a portfolio of Cisco cloud applications and services. The Cisco cloud applications which are already in market, mainly WebEx and Meraki, continue to perform very well. WebEx revenue grew 7% with annual recurring revenues up 12%. The total number of billable users was up over 26%. Meraki, our cloud networking business grew over 150%, with the customer count growing approximately 30% sequentially.","We also continue to cement our position as the number one cloud infrastructure and the number one cloud provider according to Synergy. Delivering the innovation and platforms to fuel the world's largest cloud, that was again the number one cloud infrastructure and the number one hybrid cloud provider.","On the Internet of Everything, last quarter, I discussed the momentum we are seeing with our customers to translate the Internet of Everything opportunity to actual business requirements. We are making measurable progress connecting the 19 trillion value, we've identified in the Internet of Everything to specific business opportunities and pipelines.","Again, at Cisco Live next week, our user conference, probably 20,000 people in person and we hope 200,000 plus virtually, customers like Royal Dutch Shell and The Weather Channel would join us on stage to share how they are partnering with Cisco to leverage the Internet of Everything to drive innovation and business results in their own organization. Our close engagement with our customers to capitalize on the major market transitions like cloud and Internet of Everything will be a future driver of our services growth. Service revenues grew 3% this quarter with continued strong margins, Gary, nice job by you in exerting the team.","We continue to be optimistic about the future opportunity as our customers embrace cloud, mobility, social, analytics and the Internet of Everything, they are seeing Cisco as uniquely positioned to help them build and run the highly securable environments they require. We are helping them design secure and optimized cloud solutions, enabling industry-leading security for their mobile workforce and access data from anywhere to speed decision-making among other solutions.","During the past quarter, we announced our new Managed Threat Defense Service to help customers detect and prevent attacks across their extended networks, fueling our security services business opportunities. We will continue to differentiate our approach to services leveraging both technology and people to deliver business value. We continue to drive our evolution to software and services, and this quarter, we closed a first of its kind, multiyear deal to license Cisco's software portfolio to General Motors. This innovating licensing agreement involving our software and hardware where needed will give GM greater speed and flexibility to drive business value. So for example, when GM needs to increase their collaboration solutions across the company, they have access to our full suite of products to do that.","Going forward, Cisco and GM will continue to partner to deliver GM's business goals up to and including the Internet of Everything. We are evolving very quickly as a Company to meet the changing requirements of our customers globally, and I am extremely pleased with the level of innovation and the value we are driving across the Company in both technology and business models. We are leaning forward and will continue to make the moves in investments we need to ensure our leadership for the next decade.","I'd now like to turn the call over to you, Frank, and to go into a little bit more details on the financials for the quarter and expand on our guidance.","Frank Calderoni ","Thank you, John. In Q3 FY '14, we executed well as we managed through the transitions in our business and markets, resulting in our financial performance above our expectations. From a top and bottom line perspective, total revenue was $11.5 billion, down 5%; non-GAAP net income was $2.6 billion and non-GAAP EPS was $0.51. Our GAAP net income was $2.2 billion and GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis were $0.42. Product revenue declined 8% and services revenue increased 3% with product book-to-bill comfortably above 1. Overall, non-GAAP operating margin was 28.1%.","In Q3, our total non-GAAP gross margin was 62.7%. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 61.4% and product gross margin benefited from improved productivity as we had greater leverage with our cost structure, partly driven by higher revenue volume. These benefits were offset by pricing.","Non-GAAP service gross margin was 66.8%, consistent with historical levels. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $4 billion or 34.6% as a percentage of revenue, compared to 34.8% in Q3 of FY '13. Operating expenses were higher quarter-over-quarter, driven by investments in cloud and acquisitions, as well as higher variable compensation.","Given the expected decline in our full fiscal year revenue, we do expect our variable compensation expense and thus total non-GAAP operating expense to be lower than originally forecasted. Our headcount decreased by approximately 230 from last quarter to 73,834.","In Q3, other income and expense was $100 million, reflecting realized gains on sales of publicly traded equity and fixed income securities. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments were $50.5 billion, including $4.6 billion available in the United States at the end of the quarter.","We generated operating cash flows of $3.2 billion during the quarter. During the quarter we issued $8 billion of debt for general corporate purposes, including repayment of debt and a return capital to our shareholders through our share repurchase as well as our dividends.","The debt repayment portion covered $3.3 billion of previously outstanding notes. As you recall, our capital allocation strategy is to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually through dividends and share repurchases. So far in fiscal year '14, we have returned approximately 140% of free cash flow to our shareholders, comprised of $8 billion of share repurchases and $2.8 billion of dividends.","In Q3, we returned $3 billion to shareholders that included $2 billion to share repurchases and approximately $974 million through our quarterly dividend. Our diluted share count, decreased by approximately 150 million shares, driven by this repurchasing. We remain committed to this strategy. Our balance sheet continued to be an area of strength in Q3 with DSO at 35 days, non-GAAP inventory turns of 11.2 and total deferred revenue growth of 4%.","Let me now provide a few comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter. Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements and that actual results could be above or below our guidance. The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with a reconciliation to GAAP.","As John mentioned, we expect total revenue to decline in the range of minus 3% to minus 1% on a year-over-year basis. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP gross margins to be in the range of 61% to 62%. As we have said in the past, forecasting non-GAAP gross margin has always been challenging due to various factors such as the volume, product mix, cost savings as well as pricing. So as a result, non-GAAP margins may vary quarter-to-quarter by a point in either direction of our guidance range. Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 is expected to be in the range of 27.5% to 28.5% and our GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be approximately 21% in the fourth quarter.","Our Q4 FY '14 non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to range from $0.51 to $0.53. With our Q3 performance and our current guidance for Q4, our non-GAAP EPS would be at the higher end of the full year FY '14 guidance of $1.95 to $2.05 that we provided earlier this year.","We anticipate our GAAP earnings to be lower than our non-GAAP EPS by about $0.11 to $0.14 per share in Q4 FY '14 and $0.56 to $0.59 for the full year. This range includes pre-tax impact of approximately $60 million in Q4 FY '14 and up to $500 million for the full year as a result of our anticipated restructuring charges related to our workforce reduction plan that we announced in the second quarter.","Substantially, all of these charges are expected to be recognized during fiscal 2014. During Q3, we recognized pre-tax charges to our GAAP financial statements of $26 million related to that announcement and $336 million through Q3. Please see the slides that accompany this webcast for further details.","Other than those quantified items noted previously, there are no other significant differences between our GAAP and our non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructuring and tax or other events which may or may not be significant. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.","I'll now hand it back to John for his summary comments. John?","John Chambers ","Frank, thank you very much and well done. Reflecting on the quarter the dynamics in our business and market continued to play out as we said they would and we did what we said we would do. Our management team is executing well and driving innovation, transformation and discipline across the entire Company. We're delivering solutions, not just technology in a way we haven\u2019t in the past and are transforming our business models toward more recurring product, software and cloud revenues.","As we continue to drive the business, we remain focused on shareholder value creation, by maintaining the flexibility to make the right long-term strategic decisions for the business, driving efficiencies in our cost structure and returning capital through dividends and share repurchase to our shareholders.","In addition to the solid financial results, there are four key takeaways for how we are driving Cisco forward that were evident in this quarter. First, we made good progress on our plans to return to growth, despite some macro and industry-specific challenges. At the same time, we are innovating and investing while becoming more efficient and taking costs out. As a result, we're delivering and often over delivering on your expectations by transforming our business. I'm proud of what we've done and excited about what's to come.","Second, we are delivering more innovation at a faster pace than any time in our history. I look at the new high-end switching and routing platforms, the recently announced InterCloud strategy, new collaboration portfolio, new pervasive security offerings, new data analytics, self-learning networks, services in all delivery capabilities, IoE and much more.","And we're not just innovating in technology. The changes we are making and how we deliver value to our customers leveraging integrated architecture software and services to deliver their business outcomes are driving larger opportunities and deal sizes as well as more recurring revenue.","Third, we are disrupting the competition, and when necessary disrupting ourselves, to drive our leadership position. For example, we began work on application-centric infrastructure over three years ago. When we launched into the market in November, we laid out a roadmap for our customers on how we could deliver on the benefits and promises of SDM. The traction we are seeing with our application-centric solutions gives me great confidence that we are leading the transition to SDM. We have similar disruption examples today in high-end routing, collaboration, our overall go-to-market and organization structures.","Finally, I believe we are positioned extremely well on the major market transitions. When I look at our leadership in the Internet of Everything, our differentiated hybrid cloud strategy, InterCloud, our ability to command SP and enterprise mobile solutions like no one else can. Cisco\u2019s unique insight into the network traffic to provide security and analytic solutions is second to none and our ability to converge the network, compute and storage from the cloud to the data center to the wide area network all the way to the edge, the network is clearly at the center of each of these transitions. We are creating tremendous value for our customers when we connect the unconnected and opportunities are clearly exciting.","Now, Mel, let's move to the next fun part, which is Q&A.","Melissa Selcher","Thanks John. We'll now open the floor to Q&A. We still request that sell-side analysts please ask only one question. Operator, please open the floor to questions.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs","So, this is one question with perhaps a couple of sub-parts. But I just wanted to understand John your guidance a little bit. So you are guiding for better than normal seasonality in the July quarter and that's despite the continued weakness both in emerging markets and in service providers. So, can you just expand on what is driving that and to the extent that some of that is driven by the Nexus 9000 ramp, where you highlighted 175 customers? Can you just dig into a little bit on how many of them are also licensing ACI, and also does that include any of the top 10 cloud providers?","John Chambers","Got you, a few questions Simona but you\u2019ve been very patient with us over the years. So we\u2019ll do that. In the future roll the questions for everybody to one. In terms of seasonality, you're right. The guidance seasonality wise for Q3 to Q4 is 4% to 6% growth. If you look at it, Frank, if I know these numbers right, over the last three years, it was about 1.9% or 2%. Over the last five years it\u2019s averaged just 3.2%. So it is above that. We're going in with stronger backlog and by definition we had a very good third month of the quarter.","In terms of the weakness in emerging-market and service provider, you're correct in that we anticipate those continuing for several more quarters and that's going to be heavy lifting as we work our way out. But let me leave no doubts in anyone's mind. We are committed to emerging-markets, we're going to position ourselves as we've done before, when countries are seeing economic downturns and positions for the future. In regards to service provider, we're going to do whatever it takes to get back on top there and get that to return to regular growth.","In terms of the areas that are growing well, you saw it in almost every product category, and while the revenue numbers by definition, when product revenues were down 8%, if I remember Mel, right and product orders were relatively flat, which means plus or minus 1%, it means in almost every product category bookings grew faster or orders grew faster than the revenues and we showed that. And so you see areas like collaboration, which we've been in getting into a little bit longer in terms of our products before we introduce new products and Rowan has done an amazing job there. They turned from what's been a three or four quarter -- three quarter I think it is negative quarter-over-quarter to a 4% growth. And Rowan, I'm betting on you big time to get that growth up to at least high single-digits by the end of this next fiscal year.","You'll see new product announcements throughout this year in the collaboration area making it easier to use and product announcement given at Cisco Live next week where you almost want to think about it like a iMac combination with TelePresence on ease-to-use and tremendous price performance. So you can bring this to the desktop and it can be literally a phone replacement that also has a capability of a touchscreen to bring it alive.","Now where you're leading me on other products such as the high-end switching, the Nexus 9000, I have not missed on a customer call, and I've probably called, like I said, a 100 CIOs in the last quarter on the 9000 and application-centric infrastructure behind it. And I'm not that good a salesperson, Rob, and I'm sorry. What it means is the product is really, really solid. And so you're seeing us take leadership across the Enterprise accounts. When you think about it going from 20 plus customers to 175, going to 1,000 people in the pipeline and you see us with the application-centric infrastructure with a simulation going on. Rob, if I remember that number right, I think it's over 50 customers who are doing that.","Robert Lloyd","Correct, that\u2019s correct.","John Chambers ","And again the receptivity has been extremely strong. Many of you come from financial institutions. So you might have seen some small startup and VMware combined because they have been out there for five plus years. We\u2019re taking almost all of those back. The momentum feels very, very good on it and I think you'll just see us knock them off one after the other. In the commercial marketplace, (indiscernible) recently would say the 9000 is on fire. But to your indirect part of your question, Simona, it will take another at least one and probably two quarters before you get high-end switching going well. They put a 9000 in, you do the ACI modeling, et cetera. So it's going to take us few quarters to extend it out. But your overall premise is right. We present our architecture strategy and our vision, the CIOs get it, they buy into it and we're in extremely good shape in Enterprise as you would guess from the 6% growth that we showed this quarter and improving.","Melissa Selcher","Great. Thanks Simona. Next question. ","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer","Thanks and congrats again on great execution. I'll also take a stab at a two-part question. First of all, I was referring to the last page of your press release.","John Chambers ","I am happy that you give us the compliment. Two questions, but you got to keep it to one.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Company","I will give you another one, if I can get three questions. But speaking on deferred revenue, Frank, looking at the breakdown of your deferred revenue, you have a very nice increase on a year-over-year basis on the product side. But when we look at the split of that between current and noncurrent, it seems like most of it is concentrated in the noncurrent area. So, can you talk about how the change in deferred revenue relates to the change in your business model as far as moving more into cloud, more into as a service type of consumption models for your customers?","And then for you John, on the competitive front, from a high level standpoint, some of the switching vendors have talked about going aggressively after your Cat 65 install base which is quite substantial still out there. How do you feel about your ability to defend that, and also with the -- some of the clearly good progress you\u2019ve been making on UCS, how do you feel against IBM and HP these days as far as going after the server footprint, both the standalone and on a converged basis as well.","John Chambers ","Got you. Okay, Frank, you get the easy part, deferred revenue and what's occurring there and I'll probably explain on that and lead into the other questions.","Frank Calderoni ","As you know, so if you look at the overall deferred revenue close to $12.7 billion in the quarter, up 4%, the key driver of the growth was the product side, close to $4 billion up 11%. And within that on the question that you mentioned, the driver has been growth that we see in our subscription type business and that was up within that segment about 36%. And within that segment its WebEx, its security, its Meraki and it's our collaboration, our enterprise license agreement. So those are the areas that when we talked about even back in December -- at the Financial Analyst Conference, we\u2019re talking about some of the cloud offerings, subscription offerings -- that's the piece that's showing growth and that's clearly what's driving the improvement in the deferred revenue on the product side. Good performance there. Just also put in perspective as far as the contributions, still small contribution, but we do expect that to continue as we see the investments over the next several quarters in this space.","Robert Lloyd ","Yeah, what's interesting is, Ittai you nailed it. We are seeing a number of our customers of all types begin to look at not just recurred revenue, but kind of a pay-as-you-go or pay-as-you-drink type of approach. We've closed a number of key deals and these are $100 million type of deal this quarter alone that we'll see the results on over the next three to five years, but it shows very little impact in terms of this quarter and next quarter and that's something we just have to manage through. And we'll try to keep you in tune, what that means. It obviously means as you understood from the deferred revenue product growth that it\u2019s 1% of our growth now goes into this category faster than before per quarter. And it would not surprise me to see if this was 2% to 3% by the end of next year and our key is to do that, keep our balance on profits and revenue growth and earnings per share.","At the same time, we build something that will introduce more continuity in our revenue streams, which I think all of you want to see. So it's a little bit of a balancing act. It's one that we're up to, but kind of fun for Chuck Robbins, our Head of Sales as he does this. And in terms of the switching, I think your comments are right. The campus switching is where we're seeing some good competition, but our real issue is we have products like the Cat 6000 that are still going great guns and very competitive. But they are decreasing as you expect year-over-year by a fair amount. The 3850 in that category is very price competitive, but we are competing with much lower cost products. So we're trying to get the total number up when the price performance might be 2 or 3 or 4 to 1. It\u2019s a little bit of a challenge there.","To answer the question about that Simona hit on the 9000, our win rate on the data center switching is really, really good. Our share there is probably close to 70%. We clearly built backlog this last quarter because a lot of the orders came in late in this category area. And I feel very, very comfortable with our ability to win not with a 9000 alone, but how we\u2019re going to not only embrace SDN and benefit from it, but we're going to lead in SDN, and Rob, maybe it depends on if we get some questions later, I'll give you the ball on that. But we\u2019re going to embrace it very tightly and bring the benefits of a virtual and physical architecture into one and then take the application-centric infrastructure straight down from the cloud data center all the way to the WAN to the Edge. So, it's a great story to tell.","In terms of UCS, candidly, our competition, IBM and HP and Dell, I feel very comfortable with us continuing to beat them pretty well. Our growth of 29%, I think the three of them added together might've been negative growth in terms of Blade servers. Our real competition here is white label. We saw this coming three to four years ago. We're going to sell architectures in the white label approach as opposed to standalone products. I personally believe standalone products from any Company, whether its standalone switch or a standalone server will get squeezed pretty hard. And so our competition there is architecture and how you bring compute and network and storage together, how you bring that together with application-centric infrastructure and bring it down the environment. That should get premium floor and we know how to sell it pretty well.","And then when I talk with our customers, they -- most of them will say that we're the only Company that's really differentiating our server architecture in a way that we\u2019ll pay a premium for. Most of the others, they view it more as a commodity in a bid type of approach. Frank, you had something to say?","Frank Calderoni","Yeah, I just want to go back to -- just to clarify, Ittai, your first part of the question on deferred revenues. I gave the balances for Q3 '13 that were growing at 11%. Just to clarify, last year, we had close to $4 billion Q3 '13 going to $4.4 billion in product deferred revenue. That's up 11% and the overall total last year of $12.7 billion going to $13.2 billion, up 4% in total. I just wanted to clarify that.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with Bernstein.","Pierre Ferragu - Bernstein","Can you give us some color on how your gross margin evolved sequentially? So you've had a very good improvement in gross margin. I was wondering how much behind that was just operating leverage having better volumes and if there was anything that is at all between this quarter and last in terms of product mix and of course pricing as well. And lastly, if you had some specific, like cost actions over the last three months that helped gross margins improve. And then maybe I have just one very -- last question to ask around the switching weakness. I was just wondering if you could give us some color geographically, is there a big overlap between your weakness in emerging markets and switching or is switching a market that is seeing like a weakness, much more broad based across the globe?","John Chambers","So, first on the gross margin question, Frank, keep me kind of balanced on this. If I look at gross margins, this quarter, we moved a fair amount of the products, Pierre, that the team, and engineering -- John Kern has been working on in gross margin improvements, but last quarter we didn't have as many of those products that worked to our benefit on. Also, the mix was to our benefit. You saw set-top boxes continue to decline, even though orders slowed, declined a lot less than we've seen in prior quarters on it. And the UCS was good at 29%, but it was at 29%. So we had a very good mix advantage for us on that.","You're seeing pricing issues, but contrary to what people worried about, I'm not seeing these pricing issues because of SDN. We actually -- our win rate there is really good and our story Rob and really bring it at the home application wise and protection wise is very, very good and you see that in the data center. We are seeing some pressure on the campus switching area, where there are different price points as you move into the market. A little bit of it is due to volume, but I think also what you saw on this time is almost 1% above our 61% to 62% guidance.","You're going to see the swings a point above, a point below that guidance periodically, and I'd urge you not to overreact or underreact to either one of them. We clearly aren't -- did not give you guidance of 62.7% for this next quarter, nor is it likely it will be 61% to 62%. And there will be quarters when it goes below that 61%. If we see a trend coming, we would tell you. Right now, we're comfortable in that 61% to 62% gross margins. Actually, what I worry about most is the mix and a little bit aggressive pricing out of emerging countries in the ugly market, where if you've got to win some strategic deals, you're going to discount pretty aggressively. That's not a function of architecture SDN; it's purely a tough market in a UCS-type environment or a campus switching type environment. Frank, how close was that or what you would say?","Frank Calderoni","Very close. So, the 61.3% from last quarter, it's\u2026","John Chambers","It's actually a good answer.","Frank Calderoni","I just want to answer that one point though. Just recap, the mix was pretty much, as you said, was to a slight benefit quarter-on-quarter. So that helped. Pricing was fairly consistent. We haven't seen really much change from a pricing standpoint. We did get a benefit in the volume because last quarter we did talk about the drop in the volume that we had from Q1 to Q2. So volume improved. So we got that and as a result of that, we were able to get a substantial amount of the cost benefit, some of which came from last quarter that was delayed and others that we kind of worked on this quarter. So, cost was a big plus for us in the quarter, which enabled us to get to the 62.7%.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Kvaal with Northland.","Jeff Kvaal - Northland ","I would like to follow up on the gross margin question if I could and that is to say, you have a couple new products that theoretically should be very accretive to the gross margin structure that are in the pipeline, i.e., the new high-end switches and routers. Why wouldn't we see the gross margins be stable, if not even a little bit above where we are today as those products blend into the overall mix? What are some of the offsetting forces there?","John Chambers","So, in regards to the new platforms, let's go first to switching. The new products we're introducing is very much in line with our high-end switching margins. They're very good. We're able to protect it very well. We win in terms of the architectures, comfortable with it. They just don't have the major volume yet. And while 175 customers is exciting enough from 20 plus, it isn't the 1,000 and we need to move to those bigger numbers; then to have the big volume roll out as ACI simulation moves to ACI implementation, not just across our Nexus 9000, but down to our other catalysts products as well in terms of direction.","The routing products, again, were designed from the beginning with good gross margins as opposed to, if I had to do over something, we've done throughout our history for almost 20 years, we developed the products and brought them in at 50% gross margins and over a period of two to three years, brought them up to their normal margins of 70% or whatever you aim for. We won't make that mistake again. We're beginning at high gross margins. But again the volume isn't as much to that. Rob, if you have anything to that?","Robert Lloyd ","No, John, I think you've covered it.","John Chambers ","Okay.","Robert Lloyd ","Well, I would say our gross margins have been consistent. I mean, last quarter given the volume which we talked about, historically, we've done everything we said we were going to do around gross margins, 61% and 62% plus or minus one or two every quarter.","John Chambers ","Yes, we don't want to give anybody the impression we are not all over this. We clearly are and we want to give everybody the impression that we know a mix issue could put pressure on us here. So we're working on it hard, and that's one of the things we've got to execute on and continue to execute well on.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank,","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank","A question around the AC or the Wi-Fi base. Wireless was I think up 3% year-on-year, orders up 12% if my memory is correct. Can you talk a little bit what we see coming in the next quarter? You see this -- really AC transition that you've kind of gone through for the last couple of quarters and you expect to come out of that and when do you see Wave 2 AC impacting the upgrade cycle in your Campus switching business, 3850 specifically? And then if I can do a follow-on, I'd appreciate that.","John Chambers","It seems I lost control earlier. Mel, we'll get it back to one next time. Brian, in terms of the wireless, and I'm including all wireless on it. We lost a little bit of momentum due to a combination of factors. I think you've seen us pick that back up. It's very low-end that we've exposed then for a while. Now, with the new products coming out from outside the various group, I think we're much more competitive there. You're right that we are going to combine the fixed and the wireless products together on it. I'm not sure -- I would have been sure -- the exact turn up on that, because they often take longer than we think and when they occur, grow faster especially at the low end on it. And your second question?","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank","The second question is really on your license agreement with your software portfolio for GM, wanted to try to understand that a little bit more, what do you - and that's in collaboration, what are you specifically licensing? How is this going to crack? Just a little more color around what the agreement is and what products it might involve. And how could you see expanding this your product line becomes more software versus hardware over time?","John Chambers","So, let me talk about the concept of GM and just put that to the side, because that's specific to a customer and the first one. Think about what we are really beginning to share with our customers is an architecture in each product category we're in that combines the infrastructure with the platform, with the application, with services. And you grow across all of these architectures from the Internet of Everything to cloud to data center to collaboration to security to mobility, and when you combine those together, and we bring a Cisco -- largely Cisco powered environment to this, your operating cost drop dramatically because the customer doesn't have to do systems integration, and you get outcomes quicker.","Now what's exiting about this deal, this is all about software. And you license that software all the way across everything from our IOS to the collaboration to the security and as you therefore begin to compete against products like white label, you are able to say, all right, you've already got a license on software, you can be very competitive on the architecture. This is something that clearly, Rob and I and then Chuck Robbins, who heads up sales want to drive through our whole Company, and this is what we'd like to see many other customers do. If we this well, that really gets exciting and this is a huge move on the transition to software being more and more part of our portfolio. And tying our software pieces together just like we\u2019re beginning to tie our hardware and ASICs. Gary, you're very familiar with the GM deal. I know we have to respect their rights on this one, but any other thoughts to add to this?","Gary Moore","Just a couple quickly. One it is, everything that you've said and I do believe we've already seen high interest from our other large enterprise customers, the CIOs you met with et cetera. But the opportunity here is to put in their catalog all of the software that Cisco has. We've added switching - we\u2019ve added everything we do to this. So now they have a software catalog that they prepaid. And now all they have to do is make minor decisions relative to what products and our products give them that end-to-end architecture. Example would be, moving stuff that might be individual products in a dealership that would be controlled with a floppy disk [indiscernible]. And so that\u2019s now, a very easy and for them cost-effective solution to IP enable it and control that from a single spot and download it to any dealer they have, as an example. Same thing we do with stadium division and some of our other solutions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America.","Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I have a question on two things. Number one is service revenues are down. If you sum up the last four quarters, service revenue growth is down to 2.5%, down from 7% the same four quarters a year ago. So similar period, down from 10%, 11% before. I understand that there is a link between product growth and service growth, but on the other hand, you do offer and you mention it, you do offer more service based solutions. And with other companies we have seen longer lag between the decline in products or the decline in services. So is there any fundamental change in services, is there any discount on services side or difficulties to charge for services? Can you tell us anything about it beyond just the product growth?","John Chambers","I'll take a crack or Gary you want to go first, I'll go second.","Gary Moore","Okay. So Tal, I think, first off, your numbers are correct as it compares to last year, if you look at where we've been each of the quarter this year, pretty consistent as we look across that. I think the core product bookings over the last eight quarters have driven us down. What we've done though is start and we've started this some time ago to build these other services that have a slower contribution in '14, will have a bigger one in '15 and a bigger one in '16. And so we're building those out and those are services that we are selling today in large part, whether it's could enablement and adoption services as we look at InterCloud and helping customers build their hybrid clouds, the service catalog development and how these customers are managing that services catalog, helping them move their workloads to the cloud and from one cloud to another as well as the security managed threat detections that we announced last quarter.","So those are all things that have a revenue ramp that are adding to the services revenue that aren\u2019t -- that won't be as dependent on core product bookings. That said, the ability for us to continue to manage 3% growth in the quarter relative to the margins that we continue to drive look anywhere else, I think you'll see that is they very well run services organization that contributes greatly to our customers and that they value.","John Chambers","So, I completely agree with what Gary said, Tal, especially on the profitability in that the customer set it bring to us. I think the technical services, what Joe Pinto has done there has been amazing. We split technical from advanced services out, okay. So, it grew well and its profitability is very good. And I think, given the product run rates that we're on, I'd give us an A in that. I think the point you're raising Tal is how quickly do we move in advanced services, from not just bringing our products together to be able to work well or network audits or things like that to outcome based.","And the outcomes that Gary walked through, we're going to move through over this next year very aggressively and only about 20% of our advanced services, if I remember right, Gary are outcome based today, and they're at more midlevel outcome based as opposed to the transformation that we talked about at the GM or transformation. Hopefully if we do our job right, in a number of companies and countries. So, that's where the growth has to return from assuming the product numbers do not pick up at a much more healthy rate.","And I think what you're seeing is kind of -- I hate to always call a leveling out, but I think you'll see us level out about this level, maybe one more quarter at this and then slowly start coming back up. But Tal, your constructive feedback and criticism is fair. We like where we are. We love the profits. We love the customer satisfaction, but we've got to make the transition here to services delivery and on those architectures and business outcomes, before you're going to see the number grow well that you alluded to.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS.","Amitabh Passi - UBS","John, I only have one question for you. I wanted to maybe understand your sort of strategic rationale in some of the alternative areas where you're making investments. If I look at the radio access market, you made an investment in a Company, I think, called Altiostar. Your broadband access investments with the ME 4600, you're going after the converged packet optical market with the NCS 4000. When I look at each of these markets, they are large markets but they have very well established incumbents, all of them with relatively lower gross margin. So, I guess just given all the focus on gross margin, just wanted to understand how you're thinking about attacking these markets, how do you continue to sort of extract a premium just given the fact that they're highly competitive with relatively low gross margin?","John Chambers","Okay. So, the reason we're not in radios is because the margins are terrible, and actually almost non-existent unless you bundled in total solution. We make investments in new companies and new architectures and we make investments to see if their strategy plays out and plays out well. And if it doesn't, it's a good investment and hopefully you get a reasonably return on it. If it does, then we partner very tightly or acquire off of that. So we've got $2 billion under investment directly and probably a fair amount more indirectly through a number of our joint funds we invest in the technology.","Let's use Altiostar as an example. A real good team at the top. Ashraf Dahod, he is world-class, he did the Starent job as you all know, serial entrepreneur and he usually does extremely well. And we told him if he ever wanted to come back to Cisco and work and do something exciting together, we're very interested and he did come back to us and said, all right, Pankaj and John, I would like to do this, would you want to invest and would you like to be a part of it? When we looked at his new architecture and his price points he's designing to, they got really exciting.","Now, we have to see if it's going to work, but I like the team that's in place and that's what you look at when you invest. I like the fact he's got a marketing transition, not building an old world radio architecture of the past, but one for the future, probably starting in emerging markets then coming into developed. And we'll see if it works out. If it does, we'll play victory and we would you we are very smart. And if it doesn't, you might not hear us talk about it again on that. But if I were going to bet on a start-up team, we've got a couple of them inside of Cisco we do well with, but Asia has been extremely good. And so that's a classic way to invest rather than take a big risk and an unreasonable amount of upfront capital to see if you run the whole thing and then see if works, you do investments, keep the Amazon entrepreneurship and running fast, you open doors, form an account, and go for it. Does that make sense? Make sense to you Amitabh on what we're doing?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes from Barclays.","Ben Reitzes - Barclays","John, I wanted to ask about the pick-up you saw in the U.S. and Europe. Is this it? Are things turning? And in particular how sustainable would it be?","John Chambers","I think the U.S. is sustainable, especially in commercial and enterprise with all the appropriate caveats. My few years at law school taught me on that. But I watch the pipeline, I watch the approach. Our U.S. Enterprise and Commercial are usually a very good indicator of GDP slowly increasing or GDP decreasing, and we saw a turn up in U.S. in Enterprise and Commercial back in summer of 2012, and if you bought [indiscernible], Ben, I think we all understand what would have happened. So, that feels good and you combine that with the CEOs I talked to, most of us feel 2.5%, 3% for the next nine months is very doable number. Not many things to do backflips on, but reasonable progress.","Europe is still a little bit fragile, but we did see stability across the north with some growth rates for a change and Europe in total was finally positive, not counting the emerging markets for us, and even stability in the South, looks like its occurring. Now I know they've still got structural issues there, and I know some of the countries are in transformation, have some tough decisions to make. But I think they are out of this downturn, slowly improving. And when I talked with our customers and the top financial people in New York which I did just a week ago, almost everybody else is beginning to see very similar trends. In fact, it almost was scary because when you describe the world just like I did earlier, including emerging markets and the challenges in Russia and Brazil, we could finish each other's sentences regardless of industry.","So I think Europe is coming back. Again, it's going to be slow and heavy lifting there, but they haven't addressed some of those structural issues, but more consistency; and even the South is starting to show stability on it in terms of direction. So, good about the U.S., good about Europe, don't feel very good about emerging markets. They are still very challenged, especially the BRICs.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets","John, the business is stabilizing and looking into your bookings linearity, more predictable, it feels like in a couple of quarters, the revenues may actually start declining and actually turn positive. Does it feel that you can hold this $46 billion to $48 billion annual revenue base because it's more predictable? Also, how should we think about the annual OpEx? Is $15 billion to $16 billion the right number or should we expect some cost cutting? Then just on cash, eBay repatriated some cash. Recognizing your views on taxes, what else can Cisco do since half the market cap of Cisco is in?","John Chambers","Okay. So, our clear goal was to return to growth. It won't be straight up into the right, and it may be a little bit bumpy because we're still way dependent -- too dependent on our orders coming in and shipping in the next quarter and during the quarter on it. But you are right, looking out over several quarters, we would expect. How long it will take us to turn back up to mid-single digit growth, if that's where we're going. It probably won't be immediate, once you get a slight growth quarter and then the next quarter is there. But I think you will see us do that over gradual time. We are going to continue to chopping expenses -- Gary is our champion here along with Frank tightly, but we have to put money into InterCloud and we have to put money into sales rep coverages as we make these changes, and as we get really good on security and collaboration, they require specialists for a period of time to run with. So, we are going to put investments into the area there as we go forward a little bit into next year.","But I think your premise on slowly up into the right is right. It will probably be a little bit bumpy. It won't be just one quarter. You finally turn the corner and then the next quarter you are there, but we're going to take it a quarter at a time in terms of our guidance. So, we want you all not to get ahead of us on this. We are very pleased with this quarter. Next quarter's set up pretty well, but we got some real heavy lifting to do and I'm sure a couple of bumps along the way especially in emerging markets and service provider are on the listing. Frank, talk a little bit about that, where we are on the cash and how we've chosen different path than some of our counterparts did and why we chose the path we did.","Frank Calderoni ","So we can't comment specifically with regard to what eBay did, but I think Mark, the key thing for us is -- this goes to the outreach we've had with all investors over the last couple of years is to build the capital allocation strategy that our investors are looking forward to the combination of investing both in the buyback as well as in the dividend which we've done in the last couple of years, and our strategy to a minimum have 50% of our free cash flow to be used for that purposes.","As I have mentioned earlier, this year, we've been fairly aggressive with 140% of that free cash flow through the dividend and buyback. We expect to continue that strategy going forward. We feel that based on the amount of cash that we have in the U.S., the amount of cash that we generate in the United States on an ongoing basis, as well as our ability as we did this past quarter to leverage the debt markets that we have the ability to fund both near term and long-term, the continued support of being aggressive on that capital allocation strategy.","Gary Moore","We're pleased I think, Frank, what we've done here and I think we've pushed it to a pretty good extent without endangering our rating et cetera on it. So we just chose a different path. I actually am very comfortable with the path we chose.","Operator","And your next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James & Associates.","Simon Leopold - Raymond James & Associates","Quick one, I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit more about the Ethernet switch business and the transitions. You alluded to the idea that the transitions do take a long time. What I wanted to see if you could talk about is any kind of compare and contrast this transition to the 9000 family versus the prior transition you experienced when you moved to the Nexus family. We could understand a little better about how this situation is either similar or different from the past that might help us? Thank you.","John Chambers ","Sure. And then I'm going to put on the back-end of that, Simon and I'm going to ask Rob to kind of tie through where this fits on InterCloud and ACI throughout our whole family of Nexus products. So to answer the question very directly, when we moved to the - we remember the 9000 is a Nexus line and we are going to take many of the capabilities on the 9000 including ACI and move it down to our other Nexus products. The 7000 was a slow startup and it took us a long period of time and we had tough gross margins on it, when we designed it, et cetera and it took us a while to add the features that we needed. Now, I like very much where the 7000 is. You're going to see it have very continuous, very good growth opportunities with the 9000 and the 7000 together and then I'll kind of judge the total growth there at the high-end switching on in terms of the capability.","I think, the 9000 will probably ramp quicker once you get a number of Lighthouse accounts and they get their two and three and four systems working well on it. Remember, this is the engineering team that did the UCS where people said this is going to have a very slow ramp and it will take time to achieve that goal and while it took us a little while to get the attention of the market on UCS, the numbers went up very quickly and I was talking with Alison Gleeson who heads up our Commercial group, and what she and Soni are doing focused on the market and they're actually on pace for the number of customers in the pipeline that they had for UCS, which is amazing in the commercial market where Clearly, some of the commercial accounts won't be reaching to the 9000.","So, I think the ramp, once it goes will probably be quicker but it will be the 7000 and the 9000 together and Rob, bring us together and maybe a quick snapshot of this next week with where we are in InterCloud and how this really ties to where we're going with our switching architectures.","Robert Lloyd ","Sure, John, and I think just to continue on the comment you made is the 9000, is a continuation of the Nexus family, running in standalone mode, using the same operating processes our companies rely -- our customers rely on as well as an APIC mode where we begin to deploy the controller, that is the fundamental building block of our ACI architecture. When you think of the differences across not only our catalyst switch and our routers and access technology, the vision of ACI is to use the construct of a unique application policy which no one else is talking about in SCN and move that policy not only across both physical and virtual networks in the data center but as well to the wide area into the access.","So, when we now begin shipping that technology in the next few months, the trials turn to production, you will start to see the idea of an end-to-end application policy evolve and the really neat thing here is that same policy could run in my private cloud on UCS or even now on a Vblock or a FlexPod, but as well in a public could instance. And we'll be showing examples of how that policy can flow between private, managed and public clouds at Cisco Live next week. So there's a lot of difference. We really do both physical, virtual, end-to-end across the network in terms of moving policies. We are starting to see that at scale. Earlier, we were asked about public clouds deploying. We'll be announcing two partners that are deploying ACI in their public cloud environment. One of them is in the Gartner top quadrant, one of them is mid-size. So, I think it's really catching on and it is really different in terms of deploying the model our customers are embracing today, which is hybrid cloud and I think we've really hit the nail on the head with ACI.","Operator","And your next question comes from Inder Singh with SunTrust.","Inder Singh - SunTrust","So, good quarter, and you sound excitedly upbeat, especially after the past couple of quarters. It sounds like the demand side has picked up for you, but also the product upgrades are starting to kick in and I think you've spent quite a time on the switching side of it. I wanted to ask you about routing as well. Clearly, the Company made a big bet with the CRS-X and I think you alluded that you're seeing above expectations in terms of the demand for that, but can you provide some more color on that? And then, just the other part of the question around the security business, same thing, we've seen all these networks come under threat. Clearly perimeter security hasn't been working on networks. What are you doing differently here, where the security business is starting to show growth for you now?","John Chambers","So, on the sequence, I'm usually pretty realistic where our competitors are, even though we know how we're going to beat them. At the high end routing, we're by ourselves, and some people might have a product that might compete with an ASR 9000, say that's a high end router product, it's really not. So on the CRS-X and NCS, they're both world class by themselves type capability. The ramp was actually good, but these tend to - they tend to buy [ph] 10 by 10 and so you will see those numbers bounce a little bit in terms of quarter-to-quarter based on one big deal or two and no one allows me to use the word lumpy now in terms of direction. In terms - so I really like these products and candidly I have not had a customer concern on the ones we put in, in so far, which is unusual with the new products.","In terms of security, you're right, the marketing security, you tend to have a hot product company, one or two product areas and as long as that product is hot, i.e., Malware or Firewall, or whatever they're doing, intrusion protection, prevention, it tends to be a very good growth. The bad guys, as you alluded to just go right around that and found weaknesses. And so where we're going to play in terms of security? You will see security go across the whole architecture from our literally capability with InterCloud down through individual private cloud, down to the data centers, down to the WAN, down to the access point.","And this is where we're going to use both our merchant, but also our custom ASICs. You will see us play security at each node throughout that environment in a way that nobody else can and you will see us evolve to something we'll talk about next week on self-learning networks to where it's very good for load balancing or the Internet of Everything and you have to have that given how unpredictable the Internet of Everything, 50 billion devices are going to be on loads and prioritization of applications. But its ability to handle, distribute now a service tax and other things becomes very exciting.","It was a glimmer in our eye 15 months ago. We put the team on. It now looks like this is really going to hunt and I want to see a couple of big lighthouses move them from beta to growth. But that begins to change the competitive environment. And I think that's what you're going to see us do in security. You'll see us move on multiple front on security, bringing those products together on architecture and then providing what Gary alluded to and what Bryan Palma is leading for us in terms of a consultancy group that really helps you before, during, and after, and does this virtually and physically together.","So we're betting on this big time. I think the markets already figured it out. It's got to be an architectural player that wins here, and if you don't have the ability to see what's going on in the network, you're playing with one arm behind your back, no matter how good your products are in terms of direction.","Now, this is heavy lifting and it takes multiple steps to do it, and you get up one step and then you plateau out, and you get up the next step. So I'm counting on Chris Young executing well here. And I think that's a good question Mel to end on. That key takeaway is what you'll ask us here at the end, is this innovation engine has never been better and think about it, we talk probably about 10 major product innovation areas today from InterCloud to what we're doing in high-end routing and switching to self-learning networks, the collaboration portfolio with a refresh on it, how we're moving to software architectures on it, where we're going with security and it's moving very well.","The one area that we didn't spend as much time on was collaboration and each of our enterprise customers would tell you what the CEO wants is first operating cost reductions, and second revenue growth. And that has changed over the last six months. The collaboration has been good from us and maybe one other peer, but it doesn't get the productivity at 5%, 7%, Gary that we need inside Cisco and others. Watch what Rowan and team brings out this next year, on products, ease of use, capability, creativity, and just to level set, when Rowan came here and we finally brought our three product areas together with WebEx, which have been separate too long and with TelePresence and with Jabber, and they took a small team to move very rapidly. It took him six months to develop his plans, 12 months to implement it. He hit every milestone along the way.","Now you're finally starting to see, products start to come out, which are really world-class, and something called Red Dots, which might not mean much to people in this audience but Red Dot is like the Oscars in this industry. We've won six in our history as a company. We won six this last year, all in this collaboration product groups, on product design and direction. So we're getting back to ease-of-use. Think of it like an Apple and TelePresence combined and ease-of-use and implementation and I encourage you to look at it -- at Cisco Live this next week.","So innovation is going well. We've got a lot of challenges in front of us. We're not underestimating those, but I think this is a very good step, Mel, back to not only growth but innovation and disrupting our sales which I know is painful at times for our shareholders.","Melissa Selcher ","Great.

At the request of Cisco Systems, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect.","Now, I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks, Michelle. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2019 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I\u2019m joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO.","By now, you should have seen our earnings press release, a corresponding webcast with slides including supplemental information will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the financial information section of our Investor Relations website.","As is customary in Q1 we have made certain reclassifications to our prior period amounts to conform to the current period's presentation. The reclassified amounts have been posted on our website. Click on the Financial Reporting section of the website to access these documents.","Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic, and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise.","The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements including the guidance we will be providing for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K which identifies important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.

As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn it over to Chuck.","Chuck Robbins","Thank you, Marilyn, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered another great quarter. It is absolutely clear that the strategy in transformation that we laid out three years ago is working. We accelerated revenue growth, expanded margins and generated strong operating cash flow and double-digit earnings per share growth.","We saw broad-based growth across all of our geographies, product categories, and customer segments. This was driven by strong execution, differentiated innovation and our transition to more software and subscription offerings. We are well positioned to capture significant growth opportunities while creating long-term value for our shareholders.","In today's environment there's an ever increasing number of connected devices with users expecting an always on experience with access to any application. The enterprise has expanded to now include multiple clouds and applications are evolving at an unprecedented rate. Customers facing a new level of complexity are increasingly seeing the value of our integrated platforms over standalone products.","We are fundamentally changing the network and security industry. We're building an architecture that is designed to securely connect any user on any device on any network to any application running anywhere. This creates an enormous opportunity for us as we deliver a multi-domain intent-based networking architecture that drives automation, simplicity, and agility for our customers.","Now let's take a more detailed look at our results as we continue to deliver new innovation across our entire portfolio. Starting with infrastructure platforms, over a year ago we set out on a strategy that would disrupt how growing data from a proliferation of new connected devices and complex traffic flows would be managed and secured from the private enterprise into multiple cloud environments.","We brought to market and intent-based architecture capable of capturing business intent and applying it across wired, wireless, and enterprise routing, including SD-WAN. This allows our customers to automate their operations, applications, and security policies for efficiency and business agility. This value proposition resonates strongly with our customers and is driving continued strong customer ramp of our Catalyst 9000 family of switches.","Yesterday, at our Partner Summit we announced several exciting new additions to this architecture. We launched the next additions to the Cat9K family, the 9200 and the 9800. The Catalyst 9200 series of switches extend intent-based networking to simple branch deployments and midmarket customers. The Catalyst 9800 is our newest wireless controller. We continue to help our customers run consistent security, automation and analytics services across wireless and wired environments. The 9800 gives our customers ultimate flexibility, running anywhere from on-premise and any cloud or embedded virtually on Catalyst 9000 switches.","We also announced a major new architectural change for the modern branch network. Cisco is unifying our security in SD-WAN technologies to help organizations embrace the cloud faster with choice and confidence. We provide the simplest way to integrate SD-WAN with our cloud security. This is a great example of how the expansion into the cloud is driving our entire portfolio.","In the data center as more customers move to multi-cloud environments, the need for secure virtualized infrastructure grows. Our strategy is to enable our customers to address increasing connectivity and data growth while securely enabling workloads across any combination of private, public, or multi-cloud environments. We continue to invest in innovation to help our customers transform their data centers for improved efficiency, scale and resiliency. This has resulted in tremendous traction with our Nexus 9K, ACI, and UCS solutions as we architect security from the application to the network and support cloud workloads wherever they may reside.","Building on the success of our industry-leading Nexus switch portfolio we recently unveiled new Nexus 400G switches. We are committed to leading the market transition from 100G to 400G providing customers with increased bandwidth and scale in their data center environments powering any workload in the cloud.","The addition of 400G to our Nexus portfolio extends the power of ACI providing intent-based networking to Enterprises, web scale, and service providers, to enable them to build compact, fully automated, high-bandwidth fabrics. Cisco is the only company to not only deliver the best of breed 400G portfolio, but also brings customers the architectural solutions for today's multi-cloud world.","Last week we expanded our hybrid cloud portfolio by introducing the industry's first hybrid solution for Kubernetes on Amazon Web Services. We are delivering a hybrid cloud solution that is designed to enable our customers to easily connect, secure, and monitor Kubernetes based applications across on-premise and the AWS cloud.","Turning to our security business we again delivered another robust performance with double-digit growth. Our goal is to be our customers' number one security partner. We are building a comprehensive and integrated security portfolio focused on effectively detecting, rapidly containing, and quickly responding to threats, spanning from the Edge to the data center into the cloud, our customers, users, devices, applications and data are protected wherever they are.","We continue to add more SaaS based offerings to our broad security portfolio. A great example of this is our recent acquisition of Duo Security which provides cloud-based identity solutions for unified access security and multifactor authentication. Duo solutions play an important role on extending our intent-based architecture in a multi-cloud environment simplifying policy for cloud security and expanding endpoint visibility coverage. The integration of Cisco's network, device, and cloud security platforms with Duo's zero-trust authentication and access products is designed to allow us to easily and securely connect users to any application on any network device.","Moving to applications, data intelligence continues to be critical for organizations to improve business outcomes and agility. Our AppDynamics solution uniquely addresses this need resulting in another quarter of strong double-digit growth. Our innovative capabilities and application monitoring and analytics provides unparalleled real-time business insights to our growing customer base making us the clear market leader.","We achieved a solid quarter in our collaboration business and continue to set the standard for how people connect, collaborate, and create every single day. We are defining the future of productivity and collaboration by providing customers of all sizes with a comprehensive portfolio to help them share data through any device anywhere. Customers recognize the value we bring with more than 95% of the Fortune 500 using our collaboration solutions.","We're delivering unique capabilities, enabling rich collaborative experiences, increased productivity, and helping our customers transform their workspaces. This is accomplished through our new modern WebEx experience, AI enabled devices, and enhanced interoperability across our on-premise and cloud solutions.","Yesterday, we expanded our collaboration offerings with a full suite of cloud calling and team collaboration tools to extend our customers' on-premise investments with new hybrid solutions from the cloud to the end-user. These innovations include the availability of broad soft cloud calling with WebEx teams through service providers, 85-inch WebEx board and our new portfolio of total room solutions with Room Kit mini and WebEx Share.","In summary, we had a great quarter and our opportunity has never been greater. Our growth continued to accelerate as we executed well against our strategy, continued to drive innovation across our portfolio, and delivered more software and cloud-based offerings. It is clear our customers are looking to Cisco as a trusted partner to help them operate in a multi-cloud world and to transform their businesses.","We are well positioned with our growing portfolio across multiple domains as we continue to innovate to bring our customers a more secure, automated, and simple IT infrastructure. We believe the strength and differentiation of our portfolio, combined with the power of our business model provides us with a strong foundation for fiscal year 2019 to create long-term growth and shareholder value.","Kelly, I'll now turn it over to you.","Kelly Kramer","All right, thanks Chuck, I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter followed by the guidance for Q2. We executed well across the business with strong orders, revenue growth, margin, EPS, and operating cash flow. We had continued momentum in product orders which grew 8%. Total revenue was $13.1 billion up 8%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 31.9%, non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion up 14% and non-GAAP EPS was $.75 up 23%.","Let me provide some more detail on our Q1 revenue. Total product revenue was up 9% to $9.9 billion. Infrastructure platforms grew 9% with strong growth across all businesses. Switching had another great quarter with growth in Campus driven by the continued ramp of the Cat9K and growth in data center driven by the Nexus 9K. Routing returned to growth driven by Service Provider. Wireless had double-digit growth with strength in our Wave 2 offerings and Meraki.","We also saw good growth in data center driven by servers and Hyperflex. Applications was up 18% with growth across all the businesses. We saw good growth in Unified Communications, TelePresence and AppDynamics. Security was up 11% with strong performance in Identity & Access, Advanced Threat and Unified Threat. Service revenue was up 3% driven by software and solutions support.","We continue to transform our business delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software after subscriptions were 57% of total software revenue, up 5 points year-over-year. To remind you, we adopted ASC 606 in Q1. There have been no changes to our offerings to customers or our cash conversion cycles. This is purely an accounting change.","It does not impact the metrics, I'm sorry, it does impact the metrics that show our continued business transformation. We think the most meaningful metric going forward is software subscriptions as a percentage of total software revenue. When we look at the impact of acquisitions and our Q1 results year-over-year there was an 80 basis point positive impact on revenue.","We saw strong momentum in Q1 with total product orders growing 8%. Looking at our geographies, Americas grew 8%, EMEA was up 6%, and APJC was up 12%. Total emerging markets was up 16% with the BRICS plus Mexico up 19%. In our customer segments Enterprise was up 15%, Commercial grew 8%, Public Sector was up 8%, and Service Provider grew 2%.","From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q1 gross margin was 63.8% up 0.1 point. Product gross margin was 63.2% up 0.2 points and service gross margin was 65.7% up 0.1 points. Our operating margin was 31.9% up 1.5 points. In terms of bottom line from a GAAP perspective Q1 net income was $3.5 billion and EPS was $0.77.","We ended Q1 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $42.6 billion. Q1 operating cash flow was $3.8 billion up 22% with free cash flow of $3.6 billion also up 22%. Normalized for the $400 million legal settlement we received from Arista operating cash flow was up 9%. From a capital allocation perspective we returned $6.5 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $5 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend.","From an M&A perspective, we closed two acquisitions in Q1 with Duo Security and July systems. These moves are consistent with our strategy of increasing investment in innovation and R&D for our growth areas. To summarize, we had a great Q1, we executed well with strong topline growth and profitability, we're seeing the returns on the investments we're making in innovation and driving the shift to more software and subscriptions, delivering long-term growth in shareholder value.","Let me reiterate our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. Note that we have normalized our second quarter guidance to exclude the SPVSS business for Q2 fiscal year 2018 which we divested on October 28, 2018. We have provided historical financial information for the SPVSS business in the slides that accompany this call.","We expect revenue growth in the range of 5% to 7% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in a range of 30.5% to 31.5% in the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be at 19%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.71 to $0.73.","I will now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks Kelly. Michelle, let's go ahead and open the lines for questions and as a reminder, I ask that all of you limit yourselves to one question only. I'll now turn it over to you Michelle.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. James Faucette from Morgan Stanley Investment Research, you may go ahead.","James Faucette","Thank you very much. I guess maybe I'll this to Chuck and Kelly you guys answer what you think is appropriate, but one of the key questions we've been getting from investors is, if you're seeing any change in customer behavior either because of pending tariff implementations or macro conditions around the world you've seen, in this past quarter you've seen a lot of volatility on exchange rates as well as the pending implementation of these tariffs. So I am wondering if you are seeing any change whether customer is pulling forward deals or reducing deal size, et cetera? Thank you very much.","Chuck Robbins","So let me, thanks James, let me give you some comments first of all and then I'll pass it over to Kelly. First of all, we \u2013 the tariffs were immaterial to us in Q1, the 10% I think we implemented them with a month to go, so we did not see any impact. But I can tell you that from a demand perspective when we implemented the pricing changes which we told you we would on the last call, we saw absolutely no demand change from the week before and the week after we did that.","We have talked to all of the sales leaders around the world and I could tell you there are probably only a handful of customers that have made any indication to us right now that they are doing any pull forwards. Now that doesn\u2019t mean that there is stuff outside that we don\u2019t see, but in general we do not view this as a broad-based issue and our momentum from the first week of the quarter to the last week of the quarter was incredibly consistent. So, Kelly any comments?","Kelly Kramer","Yes, I mean I'll say just to add some \u2013 add to that, if I look at the linearity by month through the quarter of Q1, it was the exact same as it was in Q1 2018. So we didn't see for the 10% churns [ph] we didn\u2019t see any pull ins. Just to kind of remind everybody, we are actively working with our supply chain to mitigate as much of this as possible and we've made progress, for that that we couldn\u2019t mitigate we passed on and we passed on the price impact just for the products impacted versus broad-based.","We were very specific and surgical where we applied it, but overall we were very specific. Going into Q2, like Chuck said, it's pretty straightforward, but I would hope that it is the potential that drives some demand but the underlying the underlying strength of the IT environment is still there.","Chuck Robbins","Yes, two other quick comments, I can just tell you personally I haven\u2019t had one conversation with any customer around the tariffs at this point. Secondly, I think that the once we got past the midterms we've begun to hear some positive at least headlines relative to the discussions and I remain fairly optimistic that this has become a top priority for the administration and we're hopeful that they will come to some agreement before we move to anything more significant.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks for the question James. We'll go ahead and take the next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank, you may go ahead.","Vijay Bhagavath","Yes, thanks Marilyn. Yes good afternoon, Chuck, Kelly.","Kelly Kramer","Hey Vijay.","Chuck Robbins","Hey Vijay.","Vijay Bhagavath","Yes, hi. I have a bigger picture question for both of you if I may, which is the subscriptions model the promise was to get a higher share of the purchasing dollars, the customers budgets, is that starting to happen, are you starting to see it in your sales figures, and if you could give us any data anecdote saying, yes now that we have kind of expanded and extended software subscriptions across the portfolio we are seeing x percentage more of the customers share of IT spending purchasing dollars would be very helpful? Thanks.","Chuck Robbins","Yes, thanks Vijay. Let me comment, because this was at the heart of our presentation this week at the Partner Summit and there's a significant recognition that I think is occurring in the marketplace right now. If you look at what our customers are dealing with, they are dealing with a world that truly does involve consuming services from multiple cloud providers, most of our customers have well over 100 and beyond SaaS applications that they're dealing with. They still have increased investments in the data center.","They are beginning to see IOT explosions at the Edge, data the Edge, mobile workers everywhere, interconnectivity with suppliers and customers. And what that has done is it's completely made obsolete the original assumptions on which they did define their IT infrastructure. And so the IT infrastructure was built by assumption of traffic flows that just fundamentally don\u2019t exist anymore.","And so what we're seeing is that they now need to drive security, and policy, and automation from the campus to the data center to the branch into the cloud and they are looking more and more at the simplicity of having a single architecture to provide that capability. So one of the big things that we talked about this week was the need to drive multi-domain architectures for our customers which actually give them the ability and you're seeing us extend and connect like policy in the Campus with policy in the data centers, you are seeing ACI being connected into DNA in our software defined access technology in the Campus so that we can extend policy.","You saw it this week with the branch where we integrated our SD-WAN with our cloud security portfolio. So and I think we're seeing that come through in more and more of these broad-based software licenses that we continue to see our customers adopting. So I think that we are that play out exactly as we thought Vijay. Kelly any\u2026?","Kelly Kramer","No it's fine.","Vijay Bhagavath","Thanks.","Marilyn Mora","All right, thank you. Michelle, go ahead and take the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs, you may go ahead.","Rod Hall","Yes, hi guys, thank you for the question. I guess I wanted to focus in on product revenue growth. It was really strong for the quarter of 9%, I know that's SPVSS which if anything dragged that down. And then, I mean it feels like you've been pretty conservative in the guidance and I know you'll probably say, no we aren\u2019t. But I'm just curious what could go better in this guidance? What are you contemplating in terms of elements of conservatism? Can you give us any ideas how you are thinking about that forward quarter right now and how things might go better if let's say we do get a trade deal, et cetera?","Chuck Robbins","Hey Rod, thanks for the question. Let me just give you some, a little color and then Kelly can answer some specifics on the math. I would say the last two quarters were probably the most consistent strong quarters that we've seen in years honestly and I think it's a combination as we've talked about of the macro environment, but also frankly the innovation. If you look at the portfolio that we have put out there and you look at the number of announcements in the technology and the innovation that we delivered this week, I think you're going to continue to see strong execution.","We're really proud of what our teams have done. So and I think that the recognition by the customers of this architectural shift that I was talking about earlier is really beginning to play out. So we feel really good about how we're performing. I'll let Kelly comment on both the product revenue growth and the outlook.","Kelly Kramer","Yes, I'd say actually. I think Rod, I feel like this is a pretty good guidance and actually better theoretically than maybe you guys were expecting. But don't forget that 6% growth in the midpoint of the guide gave you again excluding SPVSS out of both periods obviously is really solid because we have much tougher comparison a year ago. I mean we see the strength and I'm just trying to balance it with there is a lot of unknown depending on what tariffs do, but underlying strength in the macro gives us good confidence. So I feel actually very good about the call.","Rod Hall","Hey Kelly, just one comment on that. What I would say I didn't mean that it was disappointing from a guidance point of view. I just meant that you were so strong on growth in the reported quarter. Why not be more I guess aggressive with the guidance that was really what I was asking.","Kelly Kramer","Yes, I got it, then there is one - there is - you bring up a good point which I do want to get out there. Our growth was very, very strong in Q3 and again back to ASC 606, under new accounting rules, as you know we have a very strong presence in the Enterprise. Our Enterprise business is going very, very well. Whenever we sign these big multi-year Enterprise agreements under the new accounting rule that will accelerate revenue. So in this current Q1 software came in very, very strong because we happen to have two very large multi-year Enterprise agreements with some large enterprises where in any one quarter I might have one, but this was a big one. So that's one additional piece to it, but overall I'd say all of the underlying fundamentals are very, very positive.","Chuck Robbins","I think these enterprise agreements are actually reflective of what the question Vijay asked?","Kelly Kramer","That's a good point.","Rod Hall","Great. Thank you.","Marilyn Mora","Alright, thanks Rod. Next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Paul Silverstein from Cowen and company. You may go ahead.","Paul Silverstein","Kelly, just two quick questions on pricing and the drag from the shifts are occurring or just 606 address that? And the bigger question for you and Chuck, and Chuck if you can't answer this I'm hoping you will answer a different question, but I hear you keep citing the strength of the macro environment. And the thought arises that it is far from even throughout the world. U.S. has been strong, but there are plenty of other places far less so. In fact, I don't think the word strong would apply and yet your revenue on a very broad base, across geographies is very strong and far outstripping what we see from the macro perspective.","If you can't answer for the disconnect, my question to you would be, how \u2013 would you think is the time period? I know it\u2019s still early the Catalyst Switch architectural upgrade cycle, how far do you think that has to go? Where do you think you are in that process, how much strength is still to come? Thank you.","Chuck Robbins","Okay. Thanks Paul. Thanks for the four questions. Just kidding. So Kelly, you'll talk about pricing and other things. Let me give you the broader answer Paul. I think you're right and I mean when you look at our results on an orders perspective and you see emerging countries up 16% in the face of a rising dollar that's different than what we've seen historically when we were very, what I would say is we were directly connected to the global GDP and we moved with it.","I think it - maybe this was the beginning of us answering the question that I've been asked for the last two calls which is how much of this is macro and how much of it is your own execution. When we began to perform differently than what's perceived to be in the macro, I think that will give us insight into how much of it is our execution, our innovation.","The other thing I'd point out is that - and by the way in the emerging countries, just to be clear, it was very consistent across the board. So we had incredible strength in, we did have incredible strength in India. It was our second quarter of 50% plus growth in India. So we have really done a great job there and it's not just the large service providers. We had a large public sector deal this quarter, so we're - you know that is a key market for us that we intend to win in and the teams are doing a good job there.","But I think the other thing to consider is that when you look at our customers even in a tough economic environment, what is one of the things that you want to do when you're in a tough economic environment is you want to continue to drive cost and productivity in your business. And at the heart of the automation strategy and at the heart of some of the SD-WAN stuff and at the heart of re architecting the infrastructure, the ending result is to drive cost out and drive productivity up. So it's unclear to me at this point, what a - any sort of significant macro shift is going to do to the spending in this environment because it is connected to what you're trying to achieve when you do have a tough macro environment.","So we're going to have to see how it goes, but - so that's that question. On the Cat9K, look we're still incredibly early. I mean it is incredibly early. We just launched another product that addresses a market size similar to what we launched a year and a half ago. And so, we're just on the front end of it and as customers adopt that architecture then you're seeing, we announced the wireless portfolio that's going to fit within that. In the spring you'll see SD-WAN get integrated into the overall architecture in addition to the innovation we announce this week. So we feel good about where we are and we'll see how the macro plays out.","Kelly Kramer","And Paul, on that price, we saw from a rate impact on project about 1.9 points down, so slightly up from what it has in the last couple quarters but still better than it was say in Q1 of 2018, but a slight tick up, 1.9 points.","Paul Silverstein","Thank you.","Marilyn Mora","All right. Thank you. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Samik Chatterjee, you may go ahead, from JPMC.","Samik Chatterjee","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I kind of had another macro question which is just to focus on your EMEA business. You had a strong quarter there, which are the countries kind of driving that strength? And as you kind of get to this point where we have some more clarity building around Brexit, how do you \u2013 are you seeing any kind of enterprise customers starting to sort of come off the offensive and start to invest a bit more, given that there's no more kind of clarity building around what the eventual deals will look like?","Chuck Robbins","Again, I'll make some color commentary and I'll let Kelly give you some details there on the numbers. But I think that Europe, for us Europe is held up in a time where there's been ongoing uncertainty and I think this shows a resilience that we've seen around the world in the face of a lot of uncertainty. You have Brexit, you've got Italy, you've had elections, you've got Merkel's announcement and yet we still see continued strength and it's been pretty consistent for the last what, Kelly four to six quarters I'd say it's been fairly consistent growth. So our teams are doing a good job there. I think that we'll continue to execute and I think that any clarity on any of these issues like Brexit can do nothing but help in my opinion. So Kelly?","Kelly Kramer","I'd just say it is very broad based. I'd say enterprise is exceptionally strong. So it's there's no - and the UK specifically has been pretty good for us as I said the last four quarter, so I think it does just go back to it is a resilient IT environment.","Samik Chatterjee","Okay, thank you.","Marilyn Mora","Alright, thank you. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. James Suva from Citigroup Global Markets. You may go ahead.","James Suva","Hi, Chuck and Kelly, it\u2019s Jim Suva. I just have one question. I just have one question and that is on memory pricing. Can you just remind us of when memory pricing was going up, say the past 12 or 24 months, what sort of actions the company did and more importantly, what is the strategy going forward as memory prices appear to have softened, how should we think about that in your strategy or pricing or impact to your company?. Thank you so much.","Kelly Kramer","Yes, so the historical what we did with memories around DRAM specifically, it was a combination of just prices going up and consistently for all of 2017 and 2018 and it was a very tight supply. So our strategy was securing supply. We bought inventory ahead. We did everything we could to try to minimize the impact. We had big purchase commitments and we are still seeing year-over-year price increases in this quarter. We still are seeing the prices being higher than they were a year ago.","The good news is though when we look forward and like I alluded to in the last call, we should see it go from a headwind to a tailwind starting in the second half of our fiscal quarter. So Q3 and Q4 we fully expect that DRAM to be a tailwind for us, which will be good and this quarter the impact will be lesser then impact next quarter and then we get to goodness. And we did, much like we're doing with tariffs, we did pass-through a lot of the memory costs through price increases over that time as well.","James Suva","Thanks very much for the details.","Kelly Kramer","Yep.","Marilyn Mora","Next please?","Operator","Thank you. Tejas Venkatesh from UBS. You may go ahead sir.","Tejas Venkatesh","Thank you. I'm on for John Roy [ph]. I wanted to focus on the enterprise orders which were up 15%, I think the best since 2011. Where is that strength coming from and are there businesses that are accelerating versus the reported quarter? And maybe secondly, somewhat related, you called out strength in Service Provider, routing but enterprise routing is a significant portion of your routing business. And it was down a lot last year after the Viptela acquisition. Now that that's partly integrated how is it going?","Chuck Robbins","So I would say if you look at our enterprise business it was incredibly consistent globally. It was incredibly consistent across the breadth of our portfolio. I think every product category we had grew in the in the enterprise space. And it's largely driven by the strategy and you know in the automation side that we brought forward with that's represented in sort of proxy by the Cat9K from a revenue perspective.","We've also - our team and we talked about this before, back in Q4 of 2018. If you go back to the Q3 call, we said that we felt confident that the SD-WAN Solutions would begin to be rolled out in Q4. We saw that and so we've seen continued adoption of that and I think with the announcements we made this week with a native integration into our cloud security portfolio that you'll even see that continue.","So, I think the - our teams are doing a good job of helping our customers understand the cost and the operational simplicity that they can gain from some of the architectures that we're bringing forward and I think that's what's driving it. Kelly, any comments on that?","Kelly Kramer","Yes, I mean it was across all basically across when I look across our business basically just about everywhere. So it was again broad based.","Marilyn Mora","All right. Thanks for the question. Next question please, Michelle?","Operator","Thank you. Sami Badri. You may go ahead from Credit Suisse.","Sami Badri","Thank you. My main question has to do with Service Provider growth in the quarter and you made a comment earlier about India being up 50%. If you were to exclude the India growth in the quarter would Service Provider be flat to down maybe give some perspective on that?","And then the second part is, I do think about the Service Provider segment or the customer vertical in the next year or two, are you seeing some customer spend being held back with the onset of 5G spending and deployments coming into the picture? And if we were to see a 5G revenue type of spending deployment or acceleration where in the next four quarters do you think that would start to be very noticeable?","Chuck Robbins","Go ahead, Kelly.","Kelly Kramer","Yes, I'll take the first one on the Service Provider excluding India. I will just say, this our Service Provider segment was up in the Americas and EMEA as well. So again, it was a not driven by India though India had a very strong Service Provider as well, but it was up everywhere. Yep.","Chuck Robbins","I would say just a quick characterization on this market and we've talked about this before, different customers, different markets or different phases of their architectural transitions and we're seeing in Asia we had a couple of big wins obviously where we're helping them re-architect their networks, try to simplify their architectures and a lot of that is in some ways to prepare for 5G. So we're executing better and but I think, I'll still say what we've been saying is that we've been doing planning with many of the customers on 5G. I had a call with one CEO today talking about their rollout plans. So we're actively in the discussions and our teams are working on architectural designs to accommodate.","You're going to see them go into trials. In fact you've all heard some of the U.S. providers are going into trials in the first quarter of next calendar year. I still believe it'll be calendar 2020 before we see anything if we're looking for some broad based movement. But we'll see how it goes if they move faster, then obviously we could be a beneficiary of that, but we're staying close to it right now. ","Sami Badri","Got it. Thank you.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks Chuck, next please?","Operator","Thank you. Jeff Kvaal from Nomura Instinet. You may go ahead.","Jeff Kvaal","Thank you. Yes I have a question and a clarification. The question is on the 400 gig side, I think some of your peers in the space are hoping that this will be an opportunity for them to make insertions into the Web-Scale market. It seems Chuck from your language that you're focused primarily on the enterprise market, though I guess and I'm wondering if not now for Web-Scale when if I have that right?","And then Kelly maybe on a clarification side, could you help us understand if you've baked anything into the January outlook or pass through of memory prices or increases in tariffs or what have you? Thank you.","Chuck Robbins","Yes, so Jeff my apologies if I misrepresented our 400 gig strategy. I think I said in the script that we were in the opening comments that we were we were absolutely focused on Web-Scale. And I think this does represent an architectural transition that gives non-incumbents the opportunity to insert, so we will look for those opportunities as well.","I think when you look at the 400 gig advantages we have we're bringing forward much like we do with the Nexus, we're going to have a merchant version and then we have an ASIC based version we'll be delivering. We have telemetry. We've got optics, security automation, backward and forward compatibility that are going to provide differentiators for us.","We're co-chairing some standard boards. We can extend ACI from the private cloud into the public cloud across these. So we think we have a lot of advantages. The teams - we have the ability to analyze data flows with security ACI automation policy. So the whole intent based portfolio that our teams in the data center actually introduced years ago, we think will be a big differentiator as well as the breadth of the options that we'll have in the 400 gig space. But we absolutely do see the Web-Scale as an opportunity that we're going to go after here.","Kelly Kramer","And on the clarification, so yes, in the January outlook, like I said when I was talking about component costs and memory costs, I still will have some bit of, will have still headwind in Q2 from memory as well as some costs around the MLCC and I have an assumption baked in and certainly the tariff costs if they go up to 25% as well as an assumption on what we can offset with prices pushing through, so that's all incorporated in the guide I gave you on the gross margins.","Jeff Kvaal","Yes. I'm sorry Kelly, I meant on the revenue side there was a pass through on tariffs or memory how much is that going to be.","Kelly Kramer","Yes, it\u2019s the same. I'll tell you from an overall perspective. Let's assume they do cut in, in January because we will honor quotes if they have quotes in the system the data that we haven\u2019t taken a order yet, it will take a while before both the price increase cuts through as well as even when the tariffs do cut down on the cost side will lead through the inventory that has been brought in at the at the lower cost. So the real full big impact, we'll see, feel when the tariffs go to 25%. If they go to 25% we'll be in the third quarter. But I have baked in some incremental on both the revenue and the margin side and from January.","Jeff Kvaal","Okay, thank you both very much.","Kelly Kramer","Yep.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks Jeff. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Srini Pajjuri from Macquarie Capital. You may go ahead.","Srini Pajjuri","Thank you for taking my question. Kelly, one clarification and a question, first on ASC 606, is it just a one quarter benefit to revenue or do you expect any more in Q2 or going forward? And then the question is, you talked a little bit about some of the metrics that you used to give us on the recurring front not being as relevant going forward. Could you give us some more color on that and what sort of metrics that we should focus on? And then if you have any targets for those new metrics going forward? Thank you.","Kelly Kramer","So, on the first question on ASC 606, so we will benefit from that going forward. The point I was making earlier was, this was a little abnormal this quarter because we had two very large enterprise multi-year deals that were very heavy software content, that we recognized now in the new accounting rules, you recognize upfront. You recognize up front, so just to remind everybody of where we are impacted on mostly from ASC 606, when we have enterprise agreements, whether these are term based or not we will be recognizing them upfront if basically the functionality of the software goes to the customer.","So a lot of the enterprise agreements we have will all be recognized upfront. Cisco One for example a lot of that's going to be recognized upfront and even a portion of our enterprise networking like the Cat9K subscription a portion of that now will be upfront even though some are still deferred. So it's accelerating basically big enterprise license agreement. So this quarter we had two very large ones, but we will be benefiting going forward. And again it's incorporated in the guide and overall long term it will be in that 1% and 1.5% kind of range.","Chuck Robbins","Yes, I just want to make a comment. When we set out to move to more of a software and subscription model, the real benefit for us is, it gives us the opportunity to go in and monetize those licenses again in three years, that has not changed. And that was the big benefit because if you looked at the way we saw the switch previously as an example, we would sell a switch with integrated software one time and perhaps five to seven years later we would go in and try to sell another one.","In this model, the underlying ability for us to go in at either the three-year or the five year point whenever that subscription is up and renew it that still exists. This is just an accounting change. So the underlying value to our business is still valid. So we're going to continue to move very hard in this direction.","Kelly Kramer","And so, on the metrics then to your . Second question there. So that's why to that point we think the right metric is looking of our software, what percentage is subscriptions right. And that continues to just increase and I'll use the Cat9K as an example. We've talked in the past where we used to sell the previous which they sold for 100 and we recognize $100 out front. We're selling the count we used before ASC 606 we sold that Cat9K for 100, about 25% of it was deferred and we recognized that 25% over say a three-year term. And then they would renew it for another three-year term. With ASC 606 that 25% that was deferred about 12% is now deferred. Now other eleven is recognized up front, but that full 25% is what we renew.","And so that's why when you look at the software that's still subscription software, that's why we think that's a relative metric. We don't think the - like looking our deferred revenue. We look at that in the past. I mean that was a proxy but as you saw from our disclosures we wrote off $1.3 billion of that balance with the adoption of the new standard for those enterprise agreements and for Cisco One. So looking at that isn't as meaningful.","And even with the recurring like using that Cat9K example it's not as meaningful. That's kind of why we think using subscriptions it shows we're still making the transformation. It shows that we're making progress and have that again nothing's changed with the customer. We still have that stickiness of having that subscription and the ability to continue to build out our offers with them.","Srini Pajjuri","Great, thank you.","Kelly Kramer","Yep.","Marilyn Mora","Alright, thank you. Next please?","Operator","Thank you. James Fish from Piper Jaffray, you may go ahead.","Q - James Fish","Hi guys, thanks for the question and congrats on a great quarter. Just quick one from me, the Edge is a topic popping up more and more. I guess, what are your thoughts around move towards a distributed environment, how that will impact Cisco and One bassinets are being made to win there? And just secondly, there's been a lot of larger M&A over the last few months. How is Cisco viewing the M&A pipeline today? And if a large enough deal were to come along would this impact that share buyback plan? Thanks.","Chuck Robbins","Let me talk a little bit about the Edge and I'm going to pile on with a little bit of a cloud, a little bit of discussion around just what we see happening with applications into the cloud and some of our announcements, and then we'll talk about the M&A question. So first off the Edge is incredibly important and I think that's what's leading us in many cases to some of these strategic partnerships that you hear us building with the Web-Scale Provider.","Some of those are multifaceted where there's an Edge component involved because, you know for us to be able to aggregate the data and give the application developers the ability to run micro services at the Edge, that's why we put X86 into our Access products so that you can actually run services from within applications out at the Edge and process data as you need to. We've also built some data fabric technologies like Kinetic that are being used by our customers today very early days.","So we think that, we think that what this Edge dynamic does is, it gives us the ability to re-architect the Edge like what you're seeing with SD-WAN, but frankly it makes the network more relevant in the world that we live in today because the traffic flows and where the data is where the applications are, where your users are, it's all just fundamentally dynamic. And so you have to architect an environment that accommodates for anything anywhere. And so, we think that this is actually good for us over time and we'll continue to build technology that enables our customers to deal with it.","The other thing I want to just talk about relative to this, because part of the reason that these Web-Scale partnerships are so important is that we are enabling these developers with things like the Kubernetes solution that we have to actually build applications once and then move them seamlessly between private cloud and public cloud. And we did that with our Google announcement. We've done it with our Amazon announcement.","So what I think is going to happen is instead of creating this complex software architecture at the core that is necessary to map applications back and forth, for future apps they're going to be built on Kubernetes and we're going to give the customers if they want to start in the public cloud they can seamlessly move them into the private cloud or if they build them in the private cloud they can move them into public cloud.","And with our ACI being extended into the cloud now customers can actually seamlessly take their policy in an ACI architecture and extend it into any cloud that they like. So we're trying to make that simple and we think the combination of that and the Edge actually brings the network much more value in the future. There was a question?","Marilyn Mora","Yes, about M&A pipeline.","Chuck Robbins","Oh M&A, sorry Jim. We've always said we will look at any opportunity that arises if it strategically aligns and it's good for us fiscally. And I would say that the deals that you've seen done over the last few months have zero bearing on how we think about it. We continue to look at the opportunities that make sense for us and are part of our financial plan and makes sense for us from that perspective and that's how we'll continue to look at it.","James Fish","Thanks.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks, Jim. Next question please?","Operator","Thank you. We have time for one more question and that comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James.","Simon Leopold","Great. Thanks for squeezing me in here at the end. I just wanted to ask one quick one and one thematic. On the quick one there were some press reports about layoffs and I know Cisco regularly does some pruning, if you could address that? And thematically I'd like to get an understanding of how you think about the SD-WAN products. You've been in this marketplace for a while now and it looks like it's getting traction, but my thought is this is a headwind for your router business but a tailwind for the SD-WAN platforms, how do you see this playing out over let's say the next several quarters? Thank you.","Chuck Robbins","Okay, so let me address both. The first is that the restructuring that's going on right now is first of all it's not an OpEx reduction and we've \u2013 I've actually taken this issue and talked head on with our employees about what's going on right now very directly. And majority of this is part of the customer experience transition. If you look at what we've done relative to the software portfolio and how we're building out these offers for our customers any great software company has a very successful customer experience organization.","And if you'll recall we brought in Maria Martinez from sales force back in May of this year and she has been putting together a strategy for how we need to be structured for the future, and this is actually just, it's an unfortunate step that we needed to take in order to expeditiously get to where we need to be relative to dealing with the renewals and the lifecycle that our customers are going to want us to drive with them in this new portfolio. So that's really the predominant driver for what's going on right now. And again I've been very clear with our employees, we've been very open and transparent with them about what's going on.","On the SD-WAN side, I think you're \u2013 it's probably generally accurate what you described. However, I think that there's been such a stall in the enterprise routing business for the last couple of years waiting for this to take off that I would view it as a net positive now because we have movement. And you got to remember many branches are going to - they're going to leverage SD-WAN technology on top of one of our ISRs anyway.","So you're going to see various flavors at the Edge. You're going to see some software only on X86 type platforms all the way up to software running on high end ISRs because you still need a high performance branch, but you want the flexibility in how you dynamically route your traffic out of that branch. So I view it as a positive and frankly I think when you see the enterprise business, the consistency we've seen over the last few quarters I think SD-WAN is a big part of that.","Simon Leopold","Great, thank you.","Marilyn Mora","Thank you.","Chuck Robbins","Thank you. I have just a couple of comments. I think I'll just leave you with, I think that you know our teams are executing incredibly well. There's clearly some uncertainty out there, but I think the macro economy has shown a level of resilience that not many people expected. I think that what we're beginning to see and what is coming through here is that while the cloud four or five years ago was viewed as an existential threat to our business I fundamentally believe that the cloud and the transition to the cloud that our customers are undergoing is actually driving our growth now. So we feel good about where we are. We feel good about the innovation and we feel good about our team's execution. Thank you guys for joining us and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.","Marilyn Mora","Thank you, Chuck.

This is Melissa Selcher, Senior Director of Analyst and Investor Relations, and I'm joined by John Chambers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Frank Calderoni, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Rob Lloyd, Executive Vice President of Worldwide Operations; and Gary Moore, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.","The Q3 fiscal year 2012 press release is on the U.S. high tech Marketwire and on the Cisco website at http:\/\/newsroom.cisco.com. I would like to remind you that we have corresponding webcast with slides. Additionally, downloadable Q3 financial statements will be available following the call in the Investor Relations section of our website, including revenue and gross margin by geographic segments, as well as revenue by product categories. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets and cash flow statements can also be found on our website in the Investor Relations section. Click on the Financial Reporting section of the website to access the webcast slides and these documents.","An audio replay of this call will be available from May 9 through May 16 at (866) 493-8039 or (203) 369-1749 for international callers. A webcast replay is available from May 9 through July 20 on Cisco's Investor Relations website at investor.cisco.com.","Throughout this conference call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. The financial results in the press release are unaudited. The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, and as such, are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Form 10-Q and 10-K and any applicable amendments which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted.","I'll now turn it over to John for his commentary on the quarter.","John T. Chambers","Thank you, Mel. I am pleased to share another quarter of solid execution on our 3-year plan of continued profitable growth. For the second quarter in a row, we delivered record revenues, record non-GAAP earnings per share and record non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP net income. We believe our vision and strategy are working. Our value proposition and mind share with our customers are very strong. One example would be our traction and relative performance with our service provider customers, which represents about 1\/3 of our total business and where we believe we have taken wallet share almost across-the-board.","We remain #1 or #2 in almost every product market where we play. At the same time, we have maintained or gained share year-over-year in the majority of product categories across service provider, commercial and enterprise in the most recent quarter for which the market share data is available. Additionally, we are often named the top IP vendor by our very important channel partners.","We remain focused on our 5 foundational priorities and the role of intelligent networks in driving our customer's business. In a world of cloud, video and mobile device proliferation, the role of the network and specifically, the intelligent network, has never been greater. In all aspects of IT, we clearly are becoming more mobile, more social, virtual and visual.","As we have done for the past 20 years, we have again demonstrated our ability to capture the market transitions that matter most to our customers and have delivered the innovation and the market-leading products to enable our customer's success. The acceleration of the data center and specifically the UCS business years ahead of our competition is just one example where we grew Q3 revenue over 50% -- 57% year-over-year for the UCS business, while each of our top 2 data center competitors had flat or negative growth in their service business in the most recent quarter.","Our results from the data center over the last year are an example of our history of seeing market trends early and having the ability to react quickly, both technologically as well as operationally. We have done what we said we would do and position the company for long-term growth and shareholder value, and we continue to do the work internally to position the company going forward.","With the help of the whole company, we have put the processes, accountability and structures in place to enable Cisco's future growth and position us to remain the agile and industry-leading company our customers, partners, employees and very importantly, our shareholders, expect. We have a solid game plan, and in our view, are successfully executing against the plan even in the face of ongoing economic challenges and cautious IT spending especially in the enterprise accounts.","We believe we can continue to create value for our shareholders by balancing top line growth and the current environment with a disciplined focus on operational execution and efficiency. We remain committed to our long-term financial model as outlined to you previously.","With this call, I'll first turn it over to Frank for a discussion of the Q3 financial results. Then I'll walk through what we're seeing and where we're focused going forward. Frank will then detail our guidance, and then I'll wrap it up heading up to Q&A with Mel.","Frank, let me now turn it over to you.","Frank A. Calderoni","Thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a solid third quarter with total revenue of $11.6 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Total product revenue was $9.1 billion, up approximately 5% year-over-year. We saw single-digit revenue growth in our overall core product businesses and double-digit growth in a number of other areas of our portfolio. John's going to cover this in more detail later in the call.","Services revenue was $2.5 billion, an increase of approximately 13% year-over-year. Total product book-to-bill for Q3 was approximately 1. Q3 FY '12 total non-GAAP gross margin was 63.1%. That was up 0.7% quarter-over-quarter and down 0.8% year-over-year. For product-only, non-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter was 62.0%, an increase of 1.1% quarter-over-quarter. The increase was primarily driven by favorable mix and cost savings, partially offset by pricing, discounts and rebates.","On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP product gross margin decreased 1.1%. We were pleased to see the solid gross margin performance especially in our core product areas of switching and NGN routing, which on a combined basis, reflected quarter-over-quarter improvements as well as continued gross margin stability. Our non-GAAP services margin for the third quarter was 67.1%, down 0.9% quarter-over-quarter and up 0.1% year-over-year.","Turning to our geographic performance. Our year-over-year total revenue grew across all geographic regions, with increases of 3% for the Americas, 5% for EMEA and 24% for APJC. The growth in the APJC region was driven by strength in both product and service revenues across most of our customer segments led by service provider, which benefited from the completion of several large multiyear projects in the region.","Total non-GAAP gross margin by geographic region was 62.7% for the Americas, 63.9% for EMEA and 63.3% for APJC. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, Americas was flat, while EMEA decreased 0.6 points and APJC increased 5.8 points. Regarding the increase in APJC, we saw benefits from low discounts, product mix, cost savings and volume, including the multiyear projects I referred to previously.","Non-GAAP operating expenses were 34.5% of revenue or approximately $4 billion in Q3 FY '12. That was up approximately $80 million as compared to the previous quarter. Our increased G&A expenses in Q3 reflected investments in our operational infrastructure, including real estate, IT project implementations and investments related to operational and financial systems.","We are pleased to see continued stability in our non-GAAP gross margin as well as strength in our overall non-GAAP operating income, which grew 12% year-over-year and was 28.6% of revenue in Q3. We grew profits faster than revenue consistent with our overall strategic financial goals. We will continue to target non-GAAP operating margin consistent with our 3-year model, balancing investments between gross margin and operating expense.","Our Q3 FY '12 non-GAAP tax provision rate was 22%. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $2.6 billion, representing an increase of 11% year-over-year. As a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP net income was 22.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for the third quarter was $0.48 versus $0.42 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, a 14% increase year-over-year.","GAAP net income for the third quarter was $2.2 billion as compared to $1.8 billion in the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, an increase of 20% year-over-year. Earnings -- GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for the third quarter were $0.40 versus $0.33 in the same quarter of fiscal year 2011, an increase of 21% year-over-year.","Now moving on to the balance sheet. The total of cash, cash equivalents and investments at quarter end was $48.4 billion, up approximately $1.7 billion from last quarter. Of this total balance, approximately $6.1 billion was available in the U.S. at the end of the quarter.","Our cash flow from operations in the third quarter was approximately $3 billion. Our accounts receivable balance was $4 billion at the end of Q3 FY '12. Also at the end of Q3, days sales outstanding, or DSO, was 31 days, consistent with last quarter and down from 37 days at the end of Q3 FY '11. On a year-over-year basis, the decrease in DSO was driven by continued shipment linearity, and going forward, we do expect DSO to be in the range of 30 to 40 days given the business mix, the linearity and as well as the growth of our services business.","Total inventory at the end of third quarter was $1.5 billion that was down $1.6 billion -- from $1.6 billion in Q2 FY '12. Non-GAAP inventory turns were 11.1 this quarter. That's up 3\/10 compared to last quarter and up to 8\/10 from Q3 fiscal 2011.","Inventory purchase commitments at the end of Q3 were $4.4 billion. That's up approximately $180 million quarter-over-quarter. Total deferred revenue was $12.6 billion at the end of Q3, an increase of approximately 8% compared with Q3 FY '11. Deferred product revenue grew $3.9 billion -- to $3.9 billion or roughly 5% year-over-year, and deferred services revenue was approximately $8.8 billion, an increase of about 10% year-over-year.","Our headcount at the end of Q3 totaled 65,223, up 1,353 quarter-over-quarter. This was driven primarily by hires in support of revenue growth opportunities in services as well as strategic engineering hiring.","In the third quarter, we returned approximately $1 billion in cash to our shareholders through our stock repurchases and dividend payments. During Q3, we repurchased $550 million of common stock under the stock repurchase program or 27 million shares at an average price of $20.28 per share. A dividend payment of $432 million, representing $0.08 per share, was also declared and paid during the quarter.","As we have stated previously, our capital allocation strategy remains committed to returning cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and our share repurchase program. Over the long term, we intend to continue to strongly support the dividend while assessing opportunities to increase it over time. Our flexibility is limited based on our U.S. cash position unless we see reform in U.S. corporate income tax policies.","Now let me turn it over to John for additional color on the quarter. John?","John T. Chambers","Thank you, Frank. Now for a more detailed discussion on geographic and specific product results. After the intensive work we undertook last year, the parts of our business that we can control are largely healthy. We are squarely focused on the areas of highest opportunity and growth and are executing well. However, we are still in an uncertain environment economically and in global perspective.","We continue to see the impact of the areas of concern we have discussed for the last few quarters. Those were, just to repeat them: Europe and the global economy, public sector, India and conservative IT spend as reflected in the commentary of our peers. Each of these areas has proven to be as challenging as we anticipated, and several, Europe and customer conservatism, have gotten worse.","The following geographic and customer segment growth rates are in terms of year-over-year product orders unless specifically stated otherwise. In Q3, Cisco's total product orders grew approximately 4% year-over-year.","Looking at the numbers from a geographic perspective, specifically the Americas grew product orders by 5% year-over-year. EMEA grew product orders -- I'm sorry, was flat year-over-year. We have seen the issues of Southern Europe expand. Central and Northern Europe have their own set of challenges. On the positive side, our emerging markets in EMEA grew 12% year-over-year, and Russia, as part of that emerging market group, was up 22% year-over-year.","Asia-Pacific, Japan and China grew by 7% year-over-year. As expected, we continued to see weakness in India. On the positive side, Japan continues to perform extremely well for us, with orders growing 39% year-over-year. China declined by 8% due primarily to the timing of several large deals. I do believe we can continue to drive even greater performance in the emerging markets because we have the teams focused on our programs, portfolio and sales and partner coverage in those regions.","Moving on to a customer market view. Specifically, service providers grew 5%, enterprise was down 1%, commercial grew 8%, public sector was up 3% year-over-year. While service provider CapEx budgets were very tight in the quarter, our service provider segment continued to perform well. In Q3, SP orders grew 5%, with the Americas growing 5% and within the Americas, the U.S. service provider group growing at 9%. While in Asia-Pacific, Japan and China, SP grew by 8%; and in EMEA, grew by 1%.","Cisco's architectural approach has differentiated us within the service providers and allowed us to take wallet share on a global basis, especially when you consider some of our peers like Juniper where their revenues declined in the most recent reported quarter by 6% and over -- a decline of over 20% in routing in that quarter. Huawei's SP business, as reported in their most recent documentation, was up almost 3% year-over-year even though they are in emerging markets and part of what should be the fastest-growing. And Alcatel's revenue was down 12% year-over-year.","As we discussed, our foundational priorities align almost one-to-one with our service providers\u2019 customers' top priorities. Around the world, we are partnering closely with the aim of driving new monetization opportunities for them, and in so doing, even greater opportunity for Cisco.","As you have seen in our enterprise order growth and the trends over time, we are seeing hesitant spending environment. At this time, we are not seeing a significant downturn in the environment nor are we seeing new challenges in our own business. We are seeing larger -- longer sales cycles, more sign-off and smaller deal size. Again, what is all focused in terms of a more cautious environment and uncertainty from a CEO perspective.","Our competitive position continues to be very strong in our enterprise and commercial accounts, where a year ago, the fear was competitors gaining share. One year later, that has not happened and in many of them, we are actually getting dramatic market share versus those competitors that some people were concerned about before.","Over the past year, we've made significant changes to our company that enable us to respond and adjust to a cautious environment, and we will continue to be laser-focused on profitable execution. The following discussion on products will be in terms of revenues year-over-year unless otherwise stated.","Looking at our performance across our portfolio, we continue to see solid performance across most of our priority areas, with a few areas where we need to be improving. Product revenue grew a total of 5%, with switching up 5% year-over-year to $3.6 billion; next-generation networks, or NGN routing flat at $2.1 billion; and with services up, Gary, congratulations, 13% year-over-year.","Data center revenue continued to grow very rapidly at 67%, while collaboration revenue was flat. We did see double-digit growth in wireless at approximately 20% in terms of revenue. Service provider video grew at 12%, security was up 9%. I will quickly walk through the highlights from our 5 foundational priority areas. All these numbers, again, are in terms of revenue year-over-year growth unless otherwise stated.","First, with the core. Our customers are confident that Cisco will lead in the current and future evolutions of networking. Specifically, I am pleased with the continued performance of our switching portfolio. We saw relative strength this quarter with the modular portfolio and continued to see the ramp of the Nexus line with the Nexus 2000 and Nexus 5000 combined, growing approximately 75% year-over-year.","Our switching margins continue to be stable and at the levels of several years ago. Of specific interest, is that our Nexus 7000 is now within 6 gross margin points of the Catalyst 6500, and as you may remember 1.5 years ago, that delta was 17 points.","The transition from 1-gig to 10-gig is enabling applications in video to work across the network in ways that enable today's business demands. For Cisco, we are seeing strong transition to 10-gig E drivers driving higher ASPs and more server business, with Nexus 10-gig orders growing approximately 10% quarter-to-quarter and 40% year-over-year and Nexus ports growing at 90% year-over-year.","NGN routing revenues were flat this quarter, with high-end routing up significantly and optical down. While our revenues at the edge of the network where our ASR 9000 were up over 80%, an area that a year ago some people considered a concern for Cisco.","We also continued to see strong performance in the core, where our flagship CRS-3 has achieved $1 billion in total orders in just 1.5 years. Key takeaway here is so in both of these key places in the network, we believe our legacy platforms are well on their way to transitioning to the new products.","In another area in Q3, we continued to bring out strong new products in security and wireless. An example of that would be the AP 3600. This flagship wireless product was launched last quarter and is off to a very good start. In the data center, our value proposition around Cisco's unified fabric combining storage, networking and processors in an architectural approach continues to resonate strongly with our customers.","There are a few additional points in the data center I would like to call out for you. We had another very strong quarter in UCS servers, with year-over-year growth of approximately 57%. This was especially pleasing given that our 2 largest data center competitors appeared to be flat or a negative growth in this area. However, as our data center business grows, and increases in penetration, we should start to more closely track regular server seasonality more than we have in our hyper growth start-up phase.","In our view, the investments we made in the unification of server, storage and computing is working as we see ongoing traction to the enterprise and private cloud with strong, integrated, win-leveraging solutions such as Vblock and FlexPod. Our strategic partnership with EMC and VMware is going extremely well. This quarter, all geographies saw strong cloud architecture growth, with the emerging countries leading the way.","And in service providers, we are now the $1 billion order run rate in terms of their cloud implementations. The key takeaway is not only that our data center business is going strong, but our industry leadership in the cloud is becoming broadly accepted across leading customers around the world.","Moving on to collaboration and video. Our Q3 performance in collaboration being flat is not where we expect it to be. And as you would expect, we are putting an aggressive action plan in place with specific focus on our sales execution. Part of this challenge is market-driven and part of it is our need to execute more effectively.","More specifically on collaboration. Increased sales of IP phones within our Unified Communication products were offset by sales decline in other products in the portfolio. Our TelePresence business, for example, has historically had tremendous success in the public sector and enterprise markets. As we saw continuous pressure in public sector and enterprise spending, we also saw the impact on our TelePresence results.","On video, pervasive video is front and center in almost every customer's mind, from the individual tablets all the way through to the fully-enabled TelePresence conference rooms. Open standards and interoperability are a must in our opinion in this video architecture.","We continue to look forward to the close of our NDS acquisition announced in March. This transaction, which remains subject to regulatory review, was significantly increased the speed with which we can help our service providers and, in broader set of media players, deploy and monetize the next-generation video experiences. Both our service provider customers and the key industry analysts understood the value of this deal immediately when it was announced. I had personally talked to over 20 of these customers about this acquisition and our video strategy of evolving in the cloud with Videoscape. Every one of them understands the importance of this move and the benefits it gives to them.","Cisco's competitive differentiation and collaboration lies with our open approach to voice, video and mobile clients. With the new collaboration offers including Jabber, which is our new software application bringing instant messaging, conferencing, voice and TelePresence video to multiple devices, the customer can deploy across any operating system, including Windows, Mac, iOS, Android and BlackBerry. This open approach addresses a market that demands interoperability, people-centric experiences, and it is our job to capitalize on this opportunity.","On architectures, many recent third-party surveys have seen and suggest strongly that we continue to gain relevance in the eyes of our customers as a partner to address their greatest technology, business challenges and opportunities. One highlight this in past quarters is our advanced services business, which has seen strong strength in both growth and margins as our customers tackle their toughest and most important technologies and business opportunities.","For example, in cloud and BYOD, we've seen strong demand for advanced service offerings. We strongly believe these professional service, whether delivered from Cisco or together with our partners, accelerate the success and time-to-market of the technology solutions and architectures driving their business and parities.","Finally, one of the biggest market transitions going on in the industry is the explosion of mobility and device proliferation. Mobility covers elements in each of our top 5 foundational priorities. The following are some interesting combining data points on Q3 order results in terms of mobility. Wireless orders grew 19% year-over-year, and again, this is from an order perspective. SP Wi-Fi is off to a strong start and achieving some early franchise wins, with orders growing 127% year-over-year. And the ASR 5000, which is our mobile packet core, grew orders well over 100% year-over-year.","As I reflect on these results, my conversations with our customers and partners and the results of our peers, I am more confident than ever in our value proposition in the market. With the work we have done over the last year, we are better able to plan for, adjust and execute in any market environment we encounter. Given that state of our markets that we've covered in this conference call, as you would expect, we are going to remain conservative with our business models and conservative with our guidance.","With that, I'll turn it over to Frank to walk us through our Q4 FY '12 guidance. Frank?","Frank A. Calderoni","Thank you, John. I would like to remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements, and you should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. This guidance is based on current pipeline and our view of the business trends based upon the information we have available today and actual results could be above or below our guidance.","The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with reconciliations to GAAP. Taking into account the business climate that John already mentioned for Q4 FY '12, we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 2% to 5% on a year-over-year basis. This revenue guidance is aligned with the product order growth trends we saw in Q3, and the feedback from our customers on conservative IT spend, as well as the macroeconomic climate especially in Europe.","As we have said in the past, forecasting gross margin has always been challenging due to various factors such as volume, product mix, cost savings and competitive pricing pressures. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 62%.","Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 is expected to be in the range of 26.5% to 27.5%, up approximately 1 to 2 points over Q4 FY '11, continuing our delivery of profitable growth. Our non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be approximately 22% in the fourth quarter.","Our Q4 FY '12 non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.44 to $0.46 per share, up approximately 10% to 15% year-over-year, our guidance model\u2019s profits growing faster than revenue consistent with our 3-year financial model.","We anticipate our GAAP earnings in Q4 will be $0.07 to $0.11 per share lower than non-GAAP EPS. This range includes our typical differences, as well as an impact of up to $0.02 as a result of our anticipated restructuring charges.","Other than those quantified items noted above, there are no other significant differences between GAAP and our non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructurings and tax or other events which may or may not be significant. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.","Related to our July 2011 announcements on restructuring, we have incurred total pretax charges of approximately $945 million to our GAAP financial results to date. We expect the total restructuring charges to be approximately $1 billion, with the remaining charges to be incurred in the fourth quarter of FY '12.","Throughout the fiscal year, we have demonstrated our commitments to our long-term financial model of growing profits faster than revenue through areas such as selective changes to our portfolio and a strong focus on operational execution and efficiency. We believe our disciplined business management will enable us to navigate the near-term environment, provide operating leverage and continue to deliver value to our investors.","John, back to you.","John T. Chambers","Thank you very much, Frank. In summary, our results and guidance reflect the strength of our business in a cautious environment. We continue to see market trends early, and we believe we have the ability to lead quickly, both technologically as well as operationally.","The portfolio we have in place today is the strongest across-the-board that we have had in our history, and our innovation engine is executing well. We are attracting top talent across many key areas of our business and are poised to drive the transitions ahead.","When I think about the many near-term drivers of opportunity, both from a growth and a profitability perspective, I wanted to highlight one and that is cloud. I am extremely pleased with the traction we have made in cloud. Cisco's CloudVerse framework integrates a unified data center with a cloud intelligent network to enable cloud services and applications for our enterprise and service provider customers.","Today, over 70% of the leading cloud providers are using Cisco's CloudVerse on their journey to the cloud, and our traction with our massively scalable data centers and Web 2.0 customers continue to be very strong. In the U.S., there are approximately 10 key MSDCs and Web 2.0 customers, and 9 of the 10 have invested in our Nexus platform to run their applications and services. When I think about the long-term emerging opportunities around the program mobility and flexibility of the network, including OpenFlow, SDN and a much broader set of related opportunities, I am very excited and confident Cisco will lead the next generation of networking.","While the impact of these trends will most likely be many years out, we have already positioned Cisco well for this evolution. As an example, from a programmability perspective, we already have approximately 5,000 customers on the Nexus 1000V. Combined with our stated commitment to drive software revenue models, we have unmatched expertise in the evolution of the network, and we plan to continue to invest in the internal innovation, partnerships and acquisitions that we believe will drive our networking leadership for generations to come.","Through every market transition, Cisco has emerged stronger and with more market share. A year ago, many of you had concerns about our competitive position, our gross margins and the state of our portfolio. A year later, our product portfolio has never been stronger, we refreshed our entire switching portfolio while increasing our profitability and pulled ahead of our competitors. These results speak for themselves, and our team should be proud of these accomplishments.","There are areas in the macroeconomic environment that we cannot control, and they may impact Cisco's near-term business. We believe our vision, strategy and associated investments continue to be focused on the right market transitions and resulting business opportunities. I want to thank our shareholders, employees, customers and partners for their ongoing commitment. We remain extremely excited about the opportunities for Cisco and for the network at the heart of every major market transition and evolution. In the near and long term, we will continue to manage the company well, delivering the value you expect from Cisco.","Now Mel, let's open it up for questions.","Melissa Selcher","Thank you, John. We'll now open the floor to Q&A. We still request that sell-side analysts please ask only one question. Operator, please open the floor to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America.","Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My question is about the environment. If I do the math right, you're guiding for product revenues to be down 3%, 4% sequentially, making some assumptions on services. What's the risk that the environment is just trending down given that the portfolio is in such a good shape right now? What's the risk that we're just going to have another downturn like we had 2 to 3 years ago?","John T. Chambers","Tal, it's a very fair question, obviously one that we've looked at very, very much over the last several months. When I talk to our customers, they do not see that occurring in their environment, and they traditionally, even the areas that have been going slow like service providers and also the financial services industry group, have said their plans are to spend more in the second half of the year. However, Tal, in the very next sentence they said, we are waiting to see what happens in Europe and what happens with government policy. So there's nothing that we see in this environment that indicates either on our behalf. Our product portfolio, as you said, is the most competitive ever. And we think as the new market share numbers come out, we will gain share in the majority of the market areas when they reported is in very good shape. The service providers, I think, we're in the strongest position, and I think you'll see us maintain that. And almost across every product area, we are continuing to gain share of mind and usually market share. In the commercial marketplace, if their business is good, they spend. So again, when we look at it, Rob, we saw good spending in the commercial marketplace especially in the beyond the top 2000 Fortune type of accounts. The public sector was a little bit better than we thought, but Tal, in terms of your modeling, we view it as pretty flat as you go forward. There will be segments that will be up and segments that will be down. We'll probably talk about that in Q&As a little bit later. The enterprise is one that had changed in terms of consumer IT confidence, in terms of customer IT confidence on spending versus the last quarter, and that's got a little bit tougher. When I talk to my peers in the industry, and make no mistake, I've been doing that; we can almost finish each other's sentences on what we're seeing around the globe from the enterprise customers. Again, not a view that things are turning down, but just very steady improvement and an uncertain and cautious wait-and-see type of environment from that perspective. So while we will always watch the numbers, Tal, and we do worry when you see a trend occurring that it can be an indication of a bigger issue, I think right now I'd classify it as uncertainty and looking to see more certainty on the global economy and in Europe and secondly, more certainty in terms of government policies that can have major impacts on their business. So it's a nice way of saying that we're not sure. We sure don't like the trend in the enterprise IT spending, although we think in our product areas, we control our own destiny in terms of share of market.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to follow-up on the service provider business where, in particular, you cited the strength in APJC, and I think you also cited, though, several large multiyear projects in that area that are being completed or were completed. Are those being replaced? And if not, should we expect a step down in revenues in that particular area?","John T. Chambers","Well, I think the right way to look at it, Simona, and thank you because we knew there would be questions on revenue growth versus order growth, the right way to think about it is, what is your order growth in terms of the momentum. And if you watch, there will be times when there are large shipments i.e. that occurred this last quarter that bumped Asia-Pacific, Japan and China up 24% that will not occur the next quarter. So I would watch the booking order grade [ph] numbers. Now to your question, in Asia-Pacific, Japan and China, we are doing very well in the service provider market. If you look at key accounts in Japan like NTT, SoftBank et cetera, you are seeing us gain both share of wallet and dramatic share of opportunities to monetize their networks. We talked earlier about the Korean telecom, me and Rob, which the team just did an amazing job, going from the data center all the way up to smart services at the end. I was just in China and India in about, whatever a month ago, and at that time when I talked to the Chinese service providers, including content providers and even the smart grid environments, so the grid network, they understood the value of an architectural play very, very well in China. And then when I went to India, it was a shocker, and Gary, you know which account I'm talking about on this. For the first time, one of the major telcos there who has traditionally had everybody imaginable in their network and viewed their job as being the systems integrator, is now seriously looking at us, for truly an end-to-end type of architecture. So Simona, service provider very strong in Asia-Pacific, Japan and China. We'd anticipate continuing to get our share plus some in that environment. We saw service provided in the U.S. very solid with a 9% increase, and Rob, I think we're doing better in the MSOs as well as in the traditional telco group. Latin America was a little bit weaker than we'd like to see and that has to do with the some of the European service providers business in Latin America on it. Europe, we were good in our what we call our select top 5 or 6 service providers with good -- I think the growth, Rob, was almost 20% year-over-year if I remember right, but we were not near as good in the individual country service providers. They're starting to see the effect of the economic and other challenges. So Simona, it's a nice way of saying trending in terms of what's available looks good, and we believe we will continue to get our share plus some in service providers barring a major surprise.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Modoff with the Deutsche Bank.","Brian T. Modoff - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","John, so kind of looking a little longer term as you kind of look at the network intelligence piece of your business and looking at the wireless as a specific area, you saw Starent -- your Starent acquisition doing well for you. Are there other elements that you see in these evolving networks that you think you need to strengthen in your portfolio to continue to see good growth in the service provider side of the business?","John T. Chambers","Sure. We're working with the service providers on a bunch of fronts, and I think, Brian, you set me up with the comment on the wireless. We commented in this session, I think, that we are at the $1 billion run rate in terms of the key wireless components together in the service provider market, as well as a $1 billion run rate in the cloud. So in terms of the areas, if you look at the key trends going on, cloud is the first one, and we are doing extremely well not just in traditional virtualization environments but we're now, Rob, beginning to get them to run their Oracle environment or their SAP environment, their core systems, on this capability. So after mobility in terms of service providers, I think cloud is going to go very well. What they're after isn't just efficiency in the data center. They see this as ability to deliver intelligent services capabilities they can charge for i.e. entertainment, i.e. small business applications, et cetera, and to move there. They are very interested in programmability and this is where you begin to see us thinking how do you combine not just software but ASICs, OpenFlow, SDN into total architectural play. And when we shared that strategy with our service providers, including the content service providers, their eyes light up as they see that we get it and they're going to, barring a surprise, transition smoothly through that. The last area that I look at in terms of real growth is video. Video, I think, is at the very front end stage, and while I love the CRS-3 numbers that we've shared with you, having reached the $1 billion run rate and they'll be up in the market in 1.5 years, video is a hog on the network. And you need intelligence underneath it, i.e. a medianet capability to make the video really usable. And then as it goes into the cloud, which all of it will, which over time will help our margins as we move out of a set-top box approach with software to a cloud approach and that will take many years to evolve, the Videoscape type of activity has to be there to manage that segment of the video. So those would be the 3 areas that came to mind. And when I talk about service provider wireless, I'm talking about both the wireless edge, SP Wi-Fi and what we're doing in wireless LANs in the service provider environment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes, I wanted to touch on the enterprise competitive environment. It seems as if you've had a lot of success countering HP and Juniper. But it sounds like Huawei is making a push now more towards enterprise, given the slowing growth they're experiencing from service providers. Can you discuss your plans of how you want to defend against that attack?","John T. Chambers","Sure. Let me start with some generalities and then Rob, I'm going to ask you and get prepared for it, what\u2019s your 2-minute elevator pitch, in terms of why Cisco versus a player like Huawei in the enterprise. Let me start with the numbers. Every year that I've been here, there's either been a key large competitor, a Dell, an IBM, a Microsoft, at times even an Intel that was going to come at us and unseat us in an area, and there are always product transitions every year that people get concerned about. And for 20 years, we've come out of it stronger and in every one of those key areas. So that's not a guarantee of how it will turn out in the future, but it does mean we react very, very effectively. In terms of our enterprise customers, there's no one that has higher loyalty to Cisco, and you see in the surveys and the balance. We\u2019ve got to earn that every day, and as we move into an architectural sale that helps them accomplish their business goals, that gets even stronger in terms of the approach. But if I could, Rob, and again I want to point out, watch Huawei's numbers. They were 11% up year-over-year, and they're getting into everything from tablets to servers to data centers to traditional networking, and we'll see if they get themselves spread too thin. But given the area that they're in with a lot of support from their government, i.e. $40 billion in loans, that was not a particularly exciting number at least from my perspective as I drug through the transcripts and had a little bit of trouble understanding their transitions from year to year to get the numbers, but that's a separate topic. Rob, in terms of your view and your 2-minute elevator pitch on how we're going to beat Huawei in the enterprise just as we've beaten other players when they come at us on our traditional business.","Robert W. Lloyd","John, I'd probably bring up 3 points, the first is a lot of customers that have now had a couple of years\u2019 experience with Huawei are discovering that cheap at the beginning isn't so cheap after all. Their program of putting on-site resources for development is leading to lock in, and many customers who are now seeing increases in their pricing are returning to Cisco especially in the SP. One of the things that is at the heart of our customers, is looking at innovation. There's so much happening, and we clearly know that our customers view innovation from Cisco and they don't see the same from Huawei. And we would clearly say that imitation isn't innovation, and I think our customers recognize that. Finally, today's cloud-centric world, integrity is everything. The privacy of information, how data is protected, is forefront in our customers' mind in a cloud-centric world. That's not the forte of Huawei. And as they examine partnerships to enter markets around the world, this integrity gap is clearly recognized by our partners, and I think they're being -- that's being reflected in their lack of success so far in penetrating the value channels that Cisco takes to market.","John T. Chambers","If I were to draw a parallel, Simon, and Mel, you're going to kick me in a minute, I wouldn't draw the parallel to the way that HP came at us primarily on price even in the enterprise where they clearly had a very strong position. It took us, Rob, about -- I think about in 6 to 12 months to really get our act together on how to compete against them and how to say just good enough, 30% off isn't just good enough and you all have seen the win rates that we've had since then where HP switching is back to where it was when they bought 3Com. I mean this is a huge market share protection. So if we execute right, and I expect us to, I think you're going to find we are very tough versus Huawei. Not just in coming into our home turf, but watch how we did in China versus what Huawei did in China. Their growth in China was mid-single digits. Watch where we used to be on the defensive, all the time in terms of price on service provider markets in Africa and Asia and emerging countries. Now you see us going on the offensive. So I think you'll see us very confident in how to compete against them. They'll be a good tough competitor. They\u2019ve got a lot of weakness and we're going to make them very plain to our customers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","John, there's the notion that your business is becoming increasingly correlated to the global macro. So are there things Cisco can do to break free from this gravitational pull of the macro? And along the way, are there tangible proof points which may indicate that the second half of the year might be better than the first half? And I asked since the July quarter, seasonally your strongest quarter, but it's now the weakest in terms of your outlook, which implies that the October quarter, which is your weakest seasonally, might actually be worse.","John T. Chambers","Okay. Let me start with the macro environment. One of the things that -- one of the primary reasons Cisco sees these trends so much earlier than our peers in the market is we're pretty pervasive. We're in every industry, every country, everything except the consumer in large volumes. And so we can see a hiccup in state and local spending in the U.S. perhaps 2 to 4 quarters before other people, our peers, get it on their radar screen. Now on the one hand, that is so good that 80% of your business is new every 120 days. On the other hand, many of our peers, and I have some very good friends in the software industry, would say, \"John, we're a lagging indicator because our businesses is only 10% to 20% really new every quarter. And so by the time we see it, you've experienced and you might be in it for 2 to 4 quarters.\" I would like to be a little bit more that way. And what I'm after and what we're attempting to do, and Gary has helped us lead the charge, is moving more and more to a certain percentage of our business beyond servers, areas like software, WebEx, being chargeable by the month and looking at new business models that will allow us to get a more predictable stream of revenue base underneath of it. So it's not amplified 5 or 8 to 1 versus what our peers see in the market. So that would be question one in terms of macro. Question two in terms of macro, we want to move into areas that are not as subject to the ups and downs in this. Part of it is that business model change that we talked about that would be a gradual change over the next 5 to 6 years. Part of it is moving to areas like entertainment, video, if you will, from the home and capabilities where you actually see that pretty macro-resistant in terms of customer spend and directions on it. And then I think we need to really evaluate how we perhaps, in government or other areas, whether it's through our partners or directly, begin to provide things by the drink on a regular basis. And Gary, we're looking at that beyond just Cisco capital traditional approach. In terms of the second half of the year tangible proof, just being very open, this is really hard to read. Normally as you know, Mark, I have a real strong opinion on issues. It's hard for me to read, and when you talk to people who say, \"We're going to pick up our spending the second half of the year, we feel very good about how we're positioned,\" and they say that, i.e. the retail banking investment group i.e. some of the service providers, et cetera, then in the very next breath they say, \u201cBut it depends on what happens on a global and macro scale.\u201d So the tangible proof is the customer saying it, but you need to know that if the situation in Europe begins to get really hard or the global environment gets softer or some of these governments, whether it's in India or Argentina or the U.S. or in the 5 or 6 major leading countries in Europe, don't resolve some of the issues, then I think people are in this uncertain environment and when they're uncertain, unfortunately, you don't spend. So I don't think that answer surprises you, although I understand why you're asking it. You had a second point and I didn't write very plainly what it was. Was there a second part of the question that I missed?","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Sure, John. I think the notion that if seasonality continues to be magnified, should we think the slowness that we're seeing right now is short-term, or can this actually be prolonged?","John T. Chambers","It's too early to tell. We clearly are positioned to go whichever way it goes. I'm a betting man and if I were betting, I would say you're going to see exactly what our customers said, which is just very slow, painful progress, in which case we'll do very well. If it accelerates, we are positioned well to participate in that, and if it gets tough, we will take market share in that. Our product portfolio is in the best shape. We've got new products across the board which caused us originally margin problems, and when you have 2 to 3x of price performance revenue generation problems, now work to our benefit. And Gary, the work that you and team have done on accelerating Cisco's transformation, we're ready for the next area whichever way it goes. But if I were betting, I would say it's going to be slow and gradual, some bumps along the way and uncertainty along the way. But if we can at least get some of these areas more predictable, then I think you'll see people spend at a different level. It'd be irresponsible for us to say that for this next quarter, but I would not extrapolate out the first quarter next year and second quarter next year. Barring any surprise, we should be very well on our market share numbers. So it's more what these segments grow at and then our ability to get into new areas like cloud, like mobility, like video, that we candidly have not had as big a share in as before. So I hope that begins to get part of the question out, Mark, and I understand exactly why you're asking.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rod Hall with JPMorgan.","Rod B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just wanted to ask, I guess it's a difficult one, but I'll ask about cost. You guys are -- this revenue guidance number for Q4 is obviously pretty weak. I had to roll the model all the way back to I think 2002, 2003 to find flat revenues in Q4. And so I'm just wondering, you guys are still adding employees at a reasonable clip. I wonder if you could talk us through the flexibility you've got. Do you take action now and stop incremental hiring given the weak revenue development? And then at what point -- what kind of revenue level do you feel like you need to reduce cost further? I know you just reduced a lot of cost. So does it have to get -- how much worse does it have to get before you start thinking about that again?","John T. Chambers","Frank, again, we talked about this a fair amount between you, Gary, myself and Rob. Share a little bit of your thoughts on how we ended up there and then, as always, I'll reserve the right to jump in at the end and add a little bit of color.","Frank A. Calderoni","Yes, Rod. I mean clearly, it goes back to what we've talked about throughout the call today and also what we've been talking with the investment community back since September of last year, and that has to do with our long-range financial model. And I look at it from an operating margin perspective. Overall, it's growing profits faster than revenue. So if you look at the last quarter, I mean, we had operating margin of 28.6%, which was slightly improved from where we were in Q2, and our expenses were 34.5% of revenue. And if you look at how we've kind of closed the first 3 quarters of this fiscal year, if you kind of looked at the total Q3 year-to-date, we had revenue growth of about a little over 7%. We had net income growth about 9.5%. We had EPS growth about 14%. And so we've spent the last year really working on, internally, across the company, a continued focus on gross margin, and it's good to see some of the results that we've had the last couple of quarters and focusing on value engineering and focusing on features within our products to help improve the profitability, to look at the ramp for when we introduce new products. On the expense side, we've continued to look at our portfolio, making some tough calls and rebalancing where it was necessary. We've actually had a tremendous amount of attention on efficiency and productivity. That is not something that we are just, even when we had this conversation last quarter about reaching the goal of taking at $1 billion. I mean this is something that we feel is part of what we need to do over a longer period of time. So we're going to continue that. Of course, when you start looking at top line, we need to make certain trade-offs. Of course, we have to look at it from a short-term and a long-term perspective. We have experience this past year to kind of use that experience as the background to continue this effort going forward, and we'll constantly do the right thing that make sure that we're returning the right value to shareholders and balancing that profitability with the revenue growth.","John T. Chambers","Yes, I'd just add a couple of thoughts to it, Rod, and I understand why you're asking, again very fair. You will see us not underreact or overreact to this. I think if you watch us over the years, under times of pressure, we get pretty calm and pretty focused on how to handle it. Secondly, I would absolutely read into those comments that we do not see this being an economic trend is a given at all. We're going to go ahead and move through this, this quarter and watch to see, just like our customers are watching, to see what occurs because we do think we position ourselves very well. And candidly, from a productivity and leverage point, I think we have. The third element, and I forget if it's Simon or Mark asked this question, it kind of ties to this, as we gave our guidance in Q4, we build backlog and for Q1 and we would all be surprised and disappointed if we didn't continue to build a pretty fair backlog going in from Q4 to Q1 and that is built into our numbers in terms of thoughts. Gary, you might want to add something here?","Gary B. Moore","Yes, just -- I mean Frank hit it very, very well. I mean we are really well positioned from a visibility point of view, well positioned from a portfolio point of view. Getting back just to the heads, I mean it wasn't -- I mean you might look at it as a significant number of heads. A large majority of those were split between services, which are revenue-delivering people, remember the growth that we've had in revenue and services for the entire year. And then part of our original plan was to do strategic hiring back into engineering in the core areas where we want to continue to invest. So we intentionally made shifts in the workforce [ph] there in areas that we're going to deemphasize, and where we couldn't redeploy, rehires in those areas. So that's why you're seeing that.","John T. Chambers","And in your modeling, I mean, what Gary and team have done in services, we know no one else has done in terms of both the gross margins and their revenue growth rates. And doing it with a very partner-centric model, Rob, has been world class, and we are clearly modeling services growth, which is about 20% of our business in a low double-digit type of numbers, and we saw that both in our order rates in terms of the one-year contracts, Gary, as well as our revenue rates. So as you think about your models, that should also be built into it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nikos Theodosopoulos with UBS.","Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","John, I didn't hear you talk about linearity during the quarter. Did the caution in the enterprise spending intensify as the quarter progressed, or was it a constant issue throughout the quarter? And I guess as part of that, if enterprise carrier customers are telling you they're going to spend more in the second half but they're waiting for clarity in Europe and U.S. government policy, those don't seem to be likely to be resolved in the next quarter or 2. I mean, those probably don't get resolved till late year, early next year. So having a hard time understanding why they're pointing to those 2 things and suggesting they might not spend strong in the second half when those clearly aren't going to be resolved anytime soon.","John T. Chambers","So series of good questions. Let me start with the latter. Our customers as a whole in the enterprise market are in the best shape I've ever seen them during any type of economic, even hiccup. Their cache is very, very good. Even the financial institutions outside of Europe are really focused on getting the profitability back in line, getting their occasion positioned. So clearly, they're keeping their powder dry as opposed to saying we have a problem with any powder that we can take action on. In terms of the linearity during the quarter, the linearity was unfortunately very much how we gave the guidance. It was pretty similar month 1, month 2, month 3. Whenever you have a world-class sales group, which Rob, I think you've built and done a great job on, they always close the last week hard. So that always will happen, and that would've bothered me a great deal if we hadn't had a very strong last week close. But that's not indicative that things are necessary changing, but it is indicative that it was not worsening at that point in time. In terms of the caution, I'm just saying what the customers say to us, and we kind of fit in that model right now. If I was betting, I'd bet the second half of the year will be better for us and our next quarter that we're signaling. But we're going to wait and see, and we purely are going to spend per, I think it was Rod's question, very carefully as we go into this and to position ourselves to win either way. We have, we think, our competitors, including the Asian competitors, in a very vulnerable spot where we've made the changes now that they've not made and we've moved into the market growth areas that are really instrumental to our customers in terms of their success when our peers have not. Lots of them are still providing individual products and are either not capable or not trusted to be able to provide this at a much larger level. The nice way of saying whatever is there, I think we have a very high probability of doing very well with no one really knows. I do want to reemphasize though. This is an issue when I talk to our customers and our peers, and our peers especially, they can finish my sentences even though they don't have as much, dependent upon the quarter, new businesses, we do. So this is one that I think is an industry phenomena, and you saw that in Gartner dropping their IT expenditure expectation down to, I think it was 2.2%, now, et cetera. Having said that, usually by the time the majority sees it, it might be already heading another way and we'll see if that way is more up, and I'd love to be apologizing after the next quarter that we were a little bit too conservative. But that's our philosophy, and that we think is the right way to run the business.","Melissa Selcher","I think, about 2.5%.","Operator","And your next question comes from Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First of all on gross margin, you've now beaten gross margin guidance several times, several quarters in a row. We see at Asia-Pac, Japan, China gross margins back up again after being hit last quarter of the China deals and that was off of a strong revenue in that area. So I'm guessing China was a not particularly strong for you this quarter. So you're actually getting a lift out of your APJC for gross margin. Your entire gross margin is about 63%. Frank, why do you keep guiding into the 61% to 62%? What is this bear case that you keep kind of I guess in the back of your mind when you guide so that it looks as though gross margin keeps going back down again yet you keep beating each time. I was worried mostly about APJC. Now that's not a worry anymore, I'm just curious as to what you're worried about. And then just clarification, I calculated that UCS was down quarter-over-quarter based on a 57% year-over-year that you gave, want to make sure that's right. And then John, when you said that second half of the year is stronger, October is obviously a fiscal Q1, usually that's weaker. Should we now be looking at something that's not seasonal for you guys as we start modeling?","John T. Chambers","Okay. We'll go in the quarter in the sequence that you raised it. Frank, on the gross margins?","Frank A. Calderoni","Ehud, if you -- Q3 of course, just to kind of go through, 63.1% total margin for the quarter. That was up 7\/10 quarter-on-quarter and specifically on the product side, 62.0%, up 1.1% quarter-on-quarter. As I mentioned earlier, a lot of positive impacts on margin primarily because of the cross-company major initiatives that we've been driving since the beginning of the fiscal year on many things I highlighted in value engineering and so forth. This is an approach that goes not only from a engineering perspective and the business units that support within engineering, but all the way up to sales organization. We even have compensation tied to improvement in margin. So all that is goodness, and I think as a result, we've had some improvement throughout the year especially in switching. John highlighted a couple of key things if you look at the switching margins. They're back to where they were about 2 years ago. The Nexus 7 actually improved 9 points since Q1 '11 when we were having all those discussions around switching margins. Now it's within 6 points of the Cat 6500 that John mentioned, and that's where it was 1.5 years ago, it's up 17 points. So a lot of goodness there. The other thing that I highlighted as far as Q3 performance specifically is we did have a benefit in the quarter from favorable product mix and cost savings, and I emphasize the product mix. And that does change from quarter-to-quarter as we've seen throughout FY '12, if you look at the margins from Q1 to Q2 and then Q2 to Q3. So looking at that mix of product and taking that into consideration with the lower revenue base in Q4 from a growth perspective is why the range is in that 61% to 62%. So we're going to continue to focus on the many things that we have, as I said, before ongoing not only Q4 but as we go into next year. And as we see more opportunity, that helps us offset some of the mix dynamics both geographic as well as from a product standpoint.","John T. Chambers","I'm going to go in reverse order and then, Gary, after I do this, just to give you heads up, I'm going to ask you to talk about some of the things we're doing to continue the focus on gross margin improvements, a little bit deeper than Frank went because you've got us, the whole company, focused on that now in a very effective way. But let me go to the numbers, and I wanted to check before I respond to it, Ehud. The math would be no, from -- no, actually your math is right, looking at Q2 to Q3. And I think that's more a function of several factors. Most important, I think Romley played an issue with us and I think all of our peers saw it. To the indirect part of your question, we would expect, and I'd be very disappointed if UCS sales, Rob, were not up dramatically versus Q3 and Q4. So to your indirect part of your question, we would be shocked and not have Rob apologize, with me close behind him, if we're on Q4 and we aren't looking well above what the Q3 numbers actually were. To the second part of Asia-Pacific, Japan and China, it's good news and a little bit of a challenge. We have to start building products that are designed for those markets at that price point, and you don't have to have all the capabilities. Today, what we do is maybe inhibit the capabilities but still give the basic cost structure in our bids over there and you see that in terms of its impact. So I think you will see periods of time where there will be margin pressure from Asia-Pacific, Japan and China when we get very large router deals in the emerging markets. However, we're starting to do a pretty good job, Gary, in engineering, beginning to develop set-top boxes in Asia to come in at $25 and $47 per set-top box with much better margins that we get today. And candidly, if we execute well, they should result in a lot more revenue for us in countries like India at much better margins as we move forward on it. We also have done a project like Sunbird, which is a real nice controller capability out of China that has the potential to go into a huge number of -- I'm talking hundreds of thousands of opportunities in the education system and then expand beyond. So we're beginning to do a better job of designing in emerging product -- into emerging countries with products that can meet their average cost per box type of approach and without all the capabilities, not dumbing down our current product down. Gary, maybe just a couple of comments in terms of ongoing focus on margins and what you have us all focused on including the sales force.","Gary B. Moore","Yes. Thanks, John. So at the highest level, everyone in the company is focused on value engineering and driving efficiency, efficiency across the entire portfolio. And that means efficiency not just in the product portfolio but across our people, across everything that we're doing to include our real estate, our contingent labor forces and we've done significant things there already to drive value. In addition though to the things that we've talked about before, like value engineering, our supply chain procurement group is absolutely world-class, and they are driving tremendous value. As I look at what occurs from quarter-to-quarter as we look at the pricing there and the value that will bring longer term, it just kind of compounds on itself. So I'm very comfortable that we can continue to watch the top line in a way that we do, manage the bottom line and the gross margins to stay extremely competitive in the market and return to the shareholders the value that they're expecting. So I'm very comfortable with those things, but there's many, many programs across the entire company: real estate, product portfolio, workforce, et cetera that we're driving.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Robison with Wunderlich Securities.","Matthew S. Robison - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Sort of on the same topic, the mix implied and the guidance for margin. Your orders in China were down, but it sounds like the kind of mix you're talking about was, given the products for the right price points, is still the kind of thing that you're -- where you're seeing more strength in that part of the world. And just kind of wondering if maybe are we thinking about that because you still have quite a bit of backlog from past periods that's causing you to have another strong APJ quarter -- APJC quarter, or is there something else that we should be thinking about in the mix?","John T. Chambers","I would think that the guidance we're giving you is what we really believe on that. Mix will always be a huge determining factor. APJC, and the fact if I we're betting on a theater to have the best growth, that's clearly the one where we would be, barring a surprise in China. And the team out there and then it starts executing extremely well in China. Japan is not going to cover off the ball. Going through China just a little bit over a month ago, I did not see warning signals of major issues in the economy, and we did have a couple of large orders roll over. However, you will see when large orders come, pressure on margins with those type of opportunities. The designing with the margins, the right price points have to be from scratch up. You can't take an existing product and hollow it out. And we've tried that, and it just doesn't work. So we will design from the bottom up in terms of made in China, for China and beyond, made in India, for India and beyond, made in Brazil, for Brazil and beyond. But that takes a multiyear effort, and I don't want to mislead anyone. We're just getting started. Early successes have been pretty good, Gary, in what we've done there and, Rob, pretty effective from the sales side. But I would not look for them to help us out in the next 1 to 2 quarters in terms of the direction. So guidance is mainly a mix issue, Frank, is that fair, and a little bit on the geography side of the house.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I wanted to ask about Cisco Capital. We're hearing more about favorable financing terms for customers, and John, you mentioned, \u201cby the drink.\u201d Could you talk about that approach and the impact it may have to the balance sheet?","Melissa Selcher","Thanks, Jason. This is going to be our last question, John.","John T. Chambers","Okay. If this is the last, we might several of us jump in. Gary, why don't you start us off?","Gary B. Moore","Yes, so Cisco Capital, I think, provides a lot of opportunity for us that we didn't leverage as well as we could have before, just to be open about that. It provides not only the innovative solutions to our customers but also to our channel solutions, and it's going to allow Rob and the sales force have a lot more incremental sales based on the way we're going to focus. I think the fostering of those long-term relationships and the installed base also gives us a strong competitive differentiator, and we're really starting to leverage our balance sheet with them. I think we're really pleased with the growth that they've had. Kristine Snow and her team have done just an outstanding job of positioning people in the regions so that we could move quickly on decisions and where we needed to make moves, be there as a partner to the sales force. So you will see us do more there, but on the other hand, we will be making sound economic decisions and risk. So Frank manages the risk here extremely well, but we've given Kris the charter to really step it up, and she's performing extremely well with her team.","Frank A. Calderoni","And Gary, as the volumes have been increasing as we've also been able to bring this out to the marketplace as a more comprehensive offering to our customers, we're also, on your point about the credit quality, we've seen our portfolio improve actually.","John T. Chambers","Yes. It's a really a nice job, Frank, by you and by Kris and team in the field. Rob, a little bit on the value to the field?","Robert W. Lloyd","Well John, we've actually spent some time on this, and we have seen that we've had larger deal sizes. We've had a margin protection, and in many cases margin enhancement and it does give us an ability to leverage our massive install base and actually churn it much more regularly. So we are going to be out there leveraging our assets and Cisco Capital is a big one of them, and I think we're moving forward as one team.","John T. Chambers","I think in many ways, that's a very good question to end on, Jayson. If you think about what we're saying, this is about innovation and we tend to think of innovation as just engineering of products. What we're doing as a company is innovation across-the-board, and that really is what we're talking in reinventing Cisco. We obviously had a very firm base 12 to 18 months ago where we wouldn't have recovered as quickly as we did in terms of market transition, architectural plays. But we got ourselves much more effectively organized for how customers could buy in the future. We've gotten really fast, and Gary, you and I've got another couple of inches to take off. But our weight is getting back down to a much leaner type of basis as we move forward. But it's innovation in everything we do. I like the innovation that you've seen out of service provider, and I like how we've literally tied those together with not only world-class products but world-class products that work together from the data center to anybody's end-user device, fixed or mobile, very effectively. I think we've got to continue to do that across the other segments at Cisco and build on our strengths in the enterprise, et cetera. And I think what you're seeing from Kris Snow is just one example in terms of innovation. We needed to be a more out of box as our emerging markets grew in terms of our credit policy with our partners, and what was is occurring in our channel partners in the field and Rob, we needed to teach the field how to use this type of innovation in a very effective way, tied to finance in terms of a partnership. And so our goal is to be innovative across the board. We've got spots we got to fix, I think we all know that. I wish we could've given you a more direct answer about the second half versus the fourth quarter. We will always try to tell you what we truly see. And good news and bad news just because there's so much volume being new every 120 days, we do tend to see things much before our peers and almost always, unfortunately, fairly accurate in terms of at least the short-term trend. I do want to end on the note, though, everything that we talked about today, almost without exception, is completely under our control, and our momentum feels very good in the areas that we control and influence. Couple areas we need to be better, we're going to be all over those, and we think we're very well positioned whichever the way this goes. But if I listen to my customers, that's usually where I go, I think we will muddle through this with a little bit of bumps along the way and we'll see if the second half develops the way we hope. But our guidance will be conservative in what we see in the short term.","Mel, with that, let me turn it back to you.","Melissa Selcher","Great. Thanks, John.

As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.","With that, I'll now turn it over to Chuck.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thank you, Marilyn, and, good afternoon, everyone. Our results this quarter demonstrate the continued progress we're make on our strategic priorities. In Q1 we delivered a solid quarter with revenue of $12.1 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $0.61. We are seeing great traction with our new intent-based networking solutions, delivering accelerated innovation across our portfolio and offering a broader range of new consumption options to our customers, resulting in strong increases in our software and subscription revenue. The progress we've made resulted in all three of our geographic regions returning to orders growth during Q1.","Cisco has always been about connecting people, information and machines at scale. Today, the network is becoming more pervasive and critical to business success as billions of new connections are added. We expect these new connections will become increasingly automated, intelligent and secure, delivering unprecedented insights and intelligence to our customers.","Cisco's vision is to deliver highly secure intuitive technology across our portfolio that is designed to constantly learn, adapt and protect to drive business outcomes with greater speed and agility. This extends to the network, next generation data center architectures, advanced IoT applications end-to-end analytics and our Collaboration technologies.","Our vision is resonating with customers and partners around the world as we help them build more secure intelligent platforms for their digital businesses. Today, most of our customers are operating in complex, multi-cloud environments and Cisco is well positioned to provide them with networking capabilities, enterprise class security and support together with cloud scale, agility and economics.","Our new partnership with Google is a good example of this. Over the last few months our engineering teams have been working closely together to jointly develop a new hybrid cloud solution that is designed to enable applications and services to be deployed, managed and secured across on-premise environments, as well as Google Cloud Platform, bringing the best of cloud to the enterprise.","This partnership is an example of the work we are doing with all of the large web-scale providers. We're also investing to develop and acquire new technologies to extend our Multicloud Portfolio. This includes ACI anywhere, which we announced this quarter and acquisitions such as CliQr, OpenDNS, Cloudlock, AppDynamics and Viptela.","Now I'd like to cover some key business highlights in our new product reporting categories. First, let's start with Infrastructure Platforms. Our launch of The Network. Intuitive. in June is an example of the investment and innovation we're driving in our core business. These new intent-based networking capabilities are providing customers' unparalleled insights and intelligence, together with highly-differentiated security and programmability. Our new subscription-based Catalyst 9000 switching platform has been adopted by more than 1,100 customers in just over three months. We expect continued momentum throughout fiscal 2018, and we're pleased that the vast majority of Catalyst 9000 customers are buying our most advanced software subscription offer.","Additionally, we saw a good performance in our next-generation data center switching platforms as customers continue to shift to 10 gig, 40 gig and 100 gig architectures and embrace multi-cloud adoption. We continue to advance our intent-based networking for data center and private cloud environments with the latest software release of ACI. Over 4,000 ACI customers are benefiting from increased business agility with network automation, simplified management and improved security. Going forward, we see a tremendous opportunity to benefit from a shift in customer demand from stand-alone products to integrated platforms with our intent-based infrastructure portfolio providing unmatched benefits.","Now turning to applications. Applications are absolutely central to every digital business strategy. To maximize their effectiveness, companies require a highly-secure network that closely monitors applications and workload performance across a complex multi-cloud environment. Our acquisition of AppDynamics is core to our capability of providing end-to-end analytics, from the network to the data center to the application.","Within our Applications business, we are enabling new capabilities based on advanced AI and machine learning across our portfolio. An example of this is our acquisition of Perspica, providing deep machine learning driven analytics to further extend AppDynamics' leading capabilities in application intelligence. Additionally, we announced our latest innovation on the Cisco Spark platform, Spark Assistant, which is the world's first enterprise-ready, AI-powered voice assistant to further enhance our customers' meeting experience.","Our intended acquisition of BroadSoft will enhance our subscription and cloud-based business. BroadSoft has 19 million subscribers in the growing cloud voice and contact center space and will enable Cisco to offer an even broader portfolio of collaboration solutions to our customers, on-premise and in the cloud. We expect this acquisition to accelerate the pace of innovation in our Collaboration business and we see many opportunities to extend the reach of the BroadSoft portfolio.","Moving to Security. With an expanding threat landscape, cybersecurity is the number one priority for businesses worldwide and is at the heart of every company's digital strategy. In a multi-cloud world, as our customers' environments become increasingly distributed, security requirements only increase. At Cisco, security continues to be a strategic imperative and fundamental to everything we do. As customers adopt and advance intent-based networking, our end-to-end security is the foundation to keep our customers protected from advanced threats.","This architecture, combined with the best-of-breed portfolio across the network, endpoint and cloud, enables our customers to reduce the time to detection, as well as complexity and cost. As a result, we believe Cisco is delivering the most effective and comprehensive security solutions in the market. This differentiated strategy drove the 8% revenue growth in our Security portfolio, and we also saw continued momentum in our Security deferred revenue, with 42% growth.","To summarize, we delivered a solid quarter as we continue to execute well against our strategic priorities. I firmly believe that Cisco is well positioned to capture long-term growth opportunities ahead. We remain focused on providing our customers with the most innovative portfolio of offerings in the industry, powered by intent-based capabilities and delivered through a range of consumption models providing more flexibility than ever before.","Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more detail on our financials.","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by the Q2 outlook. Total revenue was $12.1 billion, down 2%. We continue to focus on driving margins and profitability, with non-GAAP operating margin of 30.4%. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.61 and operating cash flow was strong, growing 13% to $3.1 billion. The role of enterprise IT is dramatically changing with the move to an application-centric focus and adoption of hybrid cloud architectures, with customers increasingly seeing the value of integrated platforms over standalone products.","Cisco's intent-driven architecture with a focus on simplicity, automation and security allows enterprises to manage and govern the interactions of users, devices and applications across the environment. Starting in Q1, to better reflect these shifts we've changed our product reporting categories which are now Infrastructure Platforms, Applications, Security, Other Products and Services.","So let me give you a little bit more detail on our Q1 revenue. Total product revenue was down 3%, Infrastructure Platforms declined 4%, with the vast majority of the decline driven by routing products. This was driven by continued weakness in service provider and a slowdown in enterprise routing. Our switching revenue was down modestly but we saw good momentum on orders in campus switching with The Network. Intuitive. launch. Additionally, we did see continued strong wireless revenue performance and solid uptake of our HyperFlex data center offering.","Let's move on to Applications. To remind you, Applications is made up of our Collaboration portfolio of Unified Communications, Conferencing and TelePresence as well as our IoT and application software businesses such as AppDynamics and Jasper. Applications increased 6% in total, with Collaboration up modestly and AppDynamics driving most of the increase. We did see strong growth in deferred revenue of 18%. There was also a strong increase in the unbilled deferred, which is not on the balance sheet, bringing the combined total of deferred revenue plus unbilled deferred up 32%.","Security was up 8% with strong performance in unified threat, advanced threat and web security, and deferred revenue grew 42% as we continued to drive more subscription-based software offers. Service revenue was up 1% driven by growth in software and solutions services. During the quarter, we introduced a new portfolio of subscription offers called Business Critical and High Value Services powered by AI to predict future IT failures before they happen. We drove good growth in deferred revenue, which was up 10% in total, with product up 16% and services up 5%. Deferred product revenue from our recurring software and subscription offers was up 37% to $5.2 billion.","We continue to transform our business delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions and recurring revenues. In Q1, we generated 32% of our total revenue from recurring offers, an increase of over 3 points from a year ago. Revenue from software subscriptions was 52% of our software revenue.","In terms of orders in Q1, total products orders grew 1%. Looking at our geographies, Americas grew 1%, EMEA was up 2% and APJC grew 1%. Total emerging markets declined 6% with the BRICs less Mexico also down 9%. In our customer segment, enterprise declined 5%, commercial grew 12%, public sector was up 3% and service provider declined 6%.","From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q1 gross margin was 63.7%, down 1.5 points. Product gross margin was 63.0%, down 1.8 points and service gross margin was 65.6%, down 0.6 points. We continue to be negatively impacted by higher memory pricing like we've discussed over the past several calls, which we expect to continue in the near term. Our operating margin was 30.4%, down 1.2 points.","When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our results year-over-year, there's been a 60 basis point positive impact on revenue, no impact on gross margin, a 3 point increase on non-GAAP operating expenses, all resulting in a negative 70 basis point impact on our non-GAAP operating margin rate and a negative $0.01 year-over-year impact on our non-GAAP EPS.","In terms of the bottom line, our Q1 non-GAAP EPS was $0.61 while GAAP EPS was $0.48. We ended Q1 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $71.6 billion with $2.5 billion available in the U.S. Q1 operating cash flow had very strong growth of 13% at $3.1 billion and free cash flow was also very strong with growth of 19% to $2.9 billion. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $3.1 billion to shareholders during the quarter that included $1.6 billion of share repurchases and $1.4 billion for our quarterly dividend.","To summarize, in Q1, we continued to make progress on our strategic growth priorities while maintaining rigorous discipline on profitability and cash generation. We continued to prioritize our key investments to drive long-term profitable growth.","Let me reiterate our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier, and also as Chuck mentioned, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire BroadSoft. The acquisition is expected to close after completion of the customary regulatory reviews and therefore it is not included in the guidance.","We expect revenue growth in the range of 1% to 3% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 62.5% to 63.5%. And the non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29.5% to 30.5% and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.58 to $0.60.","I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into Q&A.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Kelly. Mark, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. And of course while Mark is doing that, I'd like to go ahead and remind the audience that we ask you to ask one question so that we have plenty of time for others in the audience to address questions to Chuck and Kelly.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. Your line is open.","Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you for taking my question. Kelly, I can't help asking you an update on gross margin movement. So, can you give us a bit of a sense of how big is memory prices in the 1.5 point gross margin decline that you've seen year on year? And then sequentially, your guide for gross margin for Q2 is slightly below what you've been guiding for Q1. Is there still like incremental headwind coming from component pricing hurting you from the Q1 to Q2? Thank you.","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yes. Thanks, Pierre. Great question. Yes, so the vast majority of the impact on our gross margin is driven by memory. It is basically 1.3 points of my product gross margin decline year over year. Everything else in our gross margin is basically in the normal ranges. So we expect that to continue. When you look at the guidance, we did bring it down 0.5 point to account for that because we are still seeing increases as we look forward \u2013 moving forward, but otherwise we kind of see everything else in the normal range of things.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Pierre. Let's go ahead and take the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with Barclays Capital.","Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. Chuck, you talked about 1,100 customers have already adopted the intuitive network [The Network. Intuitive.]. I just want to get a sense in terms of how does that underpin longer term the steady state growth? You guys guided to about 1% to 3% growth for the current quarter but as more and more of those customers adopt and they move beyond the labs, move beyond the proof of concept, could we actually see your growth tick higher than 1% to 3% on a steady state?","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yes, Mark. Thanks for the question. So clearly, we're pleased with where we're going right now with this product portfolio. We're pleased with the early feedback. I'll tell you that our sales teams, our partners and our customers are very excited about the architecture that we've announced. It's still one quarter. So we have to get a little more time under our belt but what I will tell you is that when we look back at a transition like the 3850 years and years ago, it's very much in line. And I think that as more customers have the opportunity to test the automation and programmability and all of the software features that they're testing right now, we would hope that the platform continues to accelerate. So one quarter down but we feel good about where we are.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Chuck. Let's go ahead and take the next question, Mark.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS Securities.","Steven Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Yes. To continue along those lines, Chuck, you talked a little bit about the software attach rate. Could you elaborate on that? And particularly the Advantage premium, which I think has the encryption capability and so forth, exactly what sort of mix are you seeing? And do you think that customers are going be willing to pay up for the premium?","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Well, thanks, Steve. So what I said in the script is that a vast majority of our customers that are buying these platforms are opting for the advanced and I would say that it's a vast majority. We knew when we introduced a subscription on a switch that we needed to ensure that there was unique innovation that was available to our customers in order for them to see value in that. We couldn't just simply shift the capabilities that they had gotten before in a perpetual model. We needed to drive new innovation.","So the anchors that are in that advanced subscription are the overall automation capability, which really gets at the OpEx of running these networks. And the second part is the encrypted traffic analytics where we can determine when there's malware inside encrypted traffic without decrypting it. And we think that those two are phenomenal incremental capabilities that our customers didn't have before and I think that's why we're seeing such a high attach rate. So we're very pleased with where we are on that as well.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Steve. Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank Securities.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Hey. Good afternoon, Chuck, Kelly.","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Hey, Vijay.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Hey, Vijay.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Hi, Chuck. Yes, my question for you, Chuck, and Kelly please join in is has anything changed in your sales motion in terms of data center switching? And the reason I ask is we are starting to see this positive news flow Alibaba Cloud recently and perhaps you're in Microsoft as well. What has changed in your view, Chuck, in terms of the sales motion? Is it the clouds paying attention to things like software automation, tools, security, anything else? Or is it just a sales focus on cloud? Help us understand. Thanks.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","So, Vijay, thanks for the question. We've been talking about this for several calls now, about how we reengaged with the large web scale providers back right after I became CEO. And these are long processes as they made major architectural decisions and they have franchises that you're trying to reenter. But if you look at \u2013 whether it's the announcements we made with Microsoft a couple of quarters ago, the announcement we made with Google, you alluded to Alibaba, which there's a summary of that win on our website if you want to go see that. It's our first insertion there, and actually it was before the large sales day that they experienced I think last week. And so we continue to make progress and we're continuing to execute on what I told you that we're executing on over the last year and a half, which is trying to go deeper.","I think the other thing that has become eminently clear is that these large web scale providers realize that it is going be a multi-cloud world and they definitely have come to the conclusion that the edge is going be mission critical for our customers going forward. And as they think about that, we are very natural \u2013 we're the very natural partner for them to partner with as the network is the only common denominator across all these cloud environments all the way out to the edge of our enterprise customer's network. So we're just continuing to execute against what we set out two years ago and we hope to continue to see success.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Chuck. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Silverstein with Cowen and Company.","Paul J. Silverstein - Cowen and Company, LLC","Hey, Chuck and Kelly, I recognize you guys are no longer breaking it out but I'm hoping that you'll throw us a bone and put numbers on the data center switching revenue growth given how important it is and how strong a growth market that's been. And as part of that, Chuck, related to the previous question, can you give us any quantification of your progress with the web 2.0 hyperscale customer segment given the importance of that segment?","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yes, so, Paul, yes, I mean, obviously we're trying to go to new groupings. But \u2013 and just to give you some color, I mean, we continue to see the double-digit growth that we've been talking about of our ACI portfolio continue in the strong double digits. And overall data center was certainly up from a revenue perspective.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","And I think, Paul, from a perspective of the web scale, it's really just what I described. We're in discussions with all of them. We have made announcements with several of them. And we continue to execute against our strategy and it's \u2013 \u2013 these are large franchises. There's two facets. And if you remember on a call back two or three calls back, I said that we're now expanding our discussions into 360-degree relationship discussions. The Google announcement was reflective of that comment, because not only are we working on their infrastructure but we're also working significantly on this multi-cloud enablement, hybrid cloud enablement and helping bridge our customers, their premises-based solutions, their edge-based solutions, their cloud applications, their SaaS applications. And so we're continuing to execute on that right now.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Paul, for the question. Next question, Mark?","Operator","Our next question is from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer & Company.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. And hi and congrats on a good quarter and nice to see growth on the guide. I had a couple things, first of all for you Kelly, can you update us on the number of Cisco ONE customers, just as a housekeeping?","And then for you, Chuck, getting a little bit deeper into the Infrastructure part of the business, great color there on the product lines but maybe you can help us fine tune a couple of things. One on the hyperconverged, I think Kelly actually mentioned that you were off to a good start there, but maybe you can help us understand where you stand on that product line, how good you feel about the platform, how stable it is.","And then the weakness in the enterprise routing, I'm just trying to understand how much of it is a secular issue, meaning SD-WAN starting to make an impact there versus an execution or seasonal element. Is this going be another part of your business that's just going to be under pressure for a long time as routing has been?","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Kelly, do you want to...?","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yes, I'll just hit the Cisco ONE. Cisco ONE continues to have great momentum. We're over 22,000 customers at this point with that so still great momentum.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yes, Ittai, so thanks for your comments by the way. On the hyperconverged offer, our HyperFlex offer, I would tell you that it has continued to probably be at the high end of my expectations. I'd say couple of quarters ago it began to exceed what I was expecting so I changed my expectations and it's \u2013 but they're doing a great job. The teams are doing well. I think we know the use cases where it's very competitive and I think that it continues to \u2013 they continue to operate at the high end of what I expected from them. So we're very pleased with that.","On the question relative to SD-WAN, I think you nailed it right. Our customers \u2013 and we've talked about this for a couple of calls \u2013 our customers have been trying to assess what this SD-WAN architectural transition looks like. And I think that after we acquired Viptela, we have now \u2013 at our sales meeting we provided tremendous clarity to our sales organization and our partner community at the Partner Summit about what our strategy is. We've now taken customers through the road maps of what they can expect and how to position the different alternatives that we have and how those portfolios are going to come together over the next 12 to 18 months.","So I think that it is a by-product of the SD-WAN discussion. And I would expect that we'll start to see customers move somewhat this quarter and then in the second half of the year, I think our customers will continue to begin to deploy some of these solutions. So, again, happy with where we are relative to the positioning of the different platforms.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is from George Notter with Jefferies.","George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I guess I was curious about the revenue headwind associated with the move to subscription models including Cisco ONE. Can you remind us what you wound up seeing in terms of a headwind in the October quarter? And then also what are you assuming for January? Thanks a lot.","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yes, hey, George. Thanks for the question. Yes, right now we're still seeing it around that 2% range. We expect the headwind to grow once we continue to grow the intuitive network [The Network. Intuitive.] that has a subscription. As that grows, that'll grow. But right now it's in that 2% range \u2013 1.5% to 2% range, and we expect that to be roughly in that range next quarter as well.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Mark, let's go ahead and tee up the next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Tal Liani with Bank of America Securities Merrill Lynch.","Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. My question is almost a follow up to the previous question. Can you elaborate? I know you started at the beginning of the year to do the subscription on switching. Can you elaborate on, first of all, the experience you've had so far, cases where customers took the subscription versus didn't take, what does it include? Just elaborate on the subscription and kind of the profile of it and also the take rate so far and whether you need to make any changes to it in order to improve take rates, et cetera. I'm just trying to understand the implications for future years. Thanks.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yes. So, Tal, thanks for the question. Let me break it down. So the advanced subscription today is primarily being sold on the new Catalyst 9000, even though it's backwards compatible with a couple of years' worth of our \u2013 I don't know, two, three years' worth of products that we've shipped in wireless and in routing, et cetera. But what the customers are doing right now is they're basically becoming accustomed to the platform. They're testing the platform before they make an investment on any sort of backwards compatibility, is what I would tell you.","I don't think we need to make any changes right now because the attach rate of the most advanced subscription offer is at the very high end of what I would have expected. So I think we're very pleased with where it is right now. And assuming we execute on the value and the innovation that our customers continue to gain from that, then I think that we'll begin to see them then buy the subscriptions on some of their install base as well. That would be our intent.","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","And just to add to that and just to be clear, 100% of the switches we're selling come with a subscription. It's just the difference in what additional features and security are added between the Advantage and the Essentials.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","That's right.","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","So 100% of the new switches are sold with a subscription and that's going well.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","All right. Let's go ahead and tee up the next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.","Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to focus on the Security angle. So despite having pretty difficult comparisons last year, you're still up 8%. So could you maybe provide some color what's going well there? And then secondly, any sort of growth rates or rough numbers for the advanced threat versus the web security growth rates?","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Mitch. So I think that the thing that is resonating with the customer is if you're looking at the environments that they're all beginning to operate in, they're operating in an environment where they have multiple SaaS providers, multiple cloud providers. They've got their private data centers with applications running. They've got their branch networks. They've got now edge connectivity with IoT coming in. And so, the robustness of an architecture that they have to have that protects across the network, across the endpoint, across the cloud is really what I think is differentiating it. And we've also \u2013 we've been on a multiyear journey of selling software and subscriptions against the threat intelligence and the malware intelligence that we have, and I think that's what's continuing to pay off. So I think it's resonating with our customers and it's an architecture that we continue to innovate on, we continue to expand on.","And, Kelly, any comments on the...?","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yes. I mean, I'd just say advanced threat and unified threat, as well as even web security, they're all up big double digits. I mean, just really strong growth.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","All right. Thank you, Mitch. Mark, let's go ahead and take the next question.","Operator","Next question is from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley Investment Research.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. I wanted to ask a question on capital structure. Can you give us an idea of what your preference is and priorities will be in capital structure in terms of buybacks and acquisitions, et cetera, if the proposed new tax changes pass versus if that change in tax law gets derailed? I mean, particularly curious as to how you're thinking about the pacing of acquisitions versus buybacks, et cetera? Thank you.","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yes. I'll take that one. What I'd say is in terms of acquisitions, the tax policy isn't impacting us either way, because we are lucky to have a great cash flow and access to capital. So it hasn't been stopping us from anything from an acquisition perspective. And it won't, so that will continue.","I would say we're definitely encouraged by the progress that's going on on the tax reform. So like we said in the past, when that happens, and if we get a repatriation, which both plans currently have, we're going to continue like we have, growing our dividend with our earnings growth and where we have opportunity is really to get much more aggressive than we have been on the share buyback. And, of course, we want to make sure we continue to have enough fire power to continue to be able to do the right acquisitions to help us position Cisco right for the long term.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James & Associates.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you very much. I wanted to see if you could give us a little bit more insight into what you would attribute the outlook to in terms of this is the first quarter with year-over-year growth we've seen in quite some time. So I'm wondering if we attribute it to an easy comparison or lapping the buildup of deferred revenue, or some specific product cycle. If you could help us assess the key elements bringing you back to year-over-year growth. Thank you.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Kelly, do you want to take...?","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yes. Sure. I mean, I'll give you some color. I'd say it's a combination of things, right? I mean, if I go to the amount of revenue coming off the balance sheet from the progress we've been steadily making on growing our software and subscriptions, it's now up to 12% of our product revenue. It's now coming from recurring offers and off the balance sheet, so that's helping.","I would say also the launch that we had on The Intuitive. Network. and the excitement around the reinvention of the core is having an impact. So we're encouraged and you've heard me mention, we're seeing positive demand momentum in campus switching overall, which is great, and that has a big impact, because it's one of the biggest pieces of our portfolio.","So that, combined with pretty good orders like we had in Q1, gives us a very good backlog position that allows us to have a good view into what the next quarter looks like. So I'd say, overall, the overall strategy, what we've been executing and talking about for the last couple of years here is we've been making progress and all of this is benefiting us in the outlook.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yes. James, just to clarify one point or just add to actually, when Kelly says 12% of our product revenue is coming from recurring offers, just to put that in perspective, when I became CEO it was 6%, so we've effectively doubled that. And I think that's certainly helpful, and just we're seeing positive feedback on the launch. So, I'm sorry that was Simon. I apologize, Simon.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","All right. Thank you, Simon. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeffrey Kvaal with Nomura Securities International.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Jeff?","Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Instinet","Oh. Yes. Sorry. I'm on mute. Pardon me. Yes. I was hoping to ask about competition in the enterprise switching space, and we've seen a little bit more out of Huawei perhaps, not in the U.S. of course but international. I'm wondering if you could put some of that color into context for us, both from them and also from some of your traditional rivals. Thank you.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","In the enterprise switching?","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yes, enterprise.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","So, thanks for the question, Jeff. I think that if you look at some of the performance we saw around the world, to your point, in Europe and Asia we've talked about Huawei's activity over the last couple of quarters, I would say that our teams have been very focused on it. I think that the intuitive network [The Network. Intuitive.] launch that we did in June really changes the discussion. And where we compete with competitors who their value prop is up front cost of the hardware, I think we're changing the discussion, because if you look at the cost of operating this infrastructure over a five-year period, it's probably 10X the cost of the upfront hardware. So going and helping our customers really reduce that is a value proposition that helps us change the discussion relative to the competition. So they continue to be very tough but we think that competing on the price of the box upfront is something that we can shift over the next couple of years.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Chuck. We'll go ahead and take the next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Erik Suppiger with JBM (sic) [JMP] Securities.","Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC","Yes. Thank you. And it was good to see Security picking up. What are your expectations for Security growth? In the past, you've talked about driving double-digit growth on the Security side. Is that still a goal? And where do you think you are in terms of getting there?","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yes, Erik, thanks for that. So at our Financial Analyst Conference this summer, we articulated a long range guide in line with what you just described. We're going to have quarters that are going to vary from that but that's definitely our long-term objective. And I think our teams are focused now on what is it we need to do for the next wave of this architecture? Once we have this architecture built where we can actually defend and apply real-time defense against known threats, we can learn about a threat through malware and e-mail, and we can protect against it in the network, in the cloud, in the devices at the endpoint all at the same time. So the teams are working hard to continue to drive innovation there but also looking at what other elements can we fit into this architecture over time. And I think that's how we think about the long-term guide.","Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC","Thank you.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Next question.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of James Suva with Citigroup Global Markets.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, Chuck and Kelly. It's Jim Suva from Citi. On your guidance of up 1% to 3% as you talked about earlier, it's the first time you guys have seen year-over-year revenue growth for quite a long time. Kelly and Chuck, you mentioned strength in the orders and also the subscription model taking traction. Are we now at a point where shift to subscription is no longer dragging down year-over-year comps? Or is that still a bit of a challenge and the orders that Chuck mentioned are just so much stronger? And Chuck, any end market areas we should think about for that order strength? Thank you so much.","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yes, I'll take the first part. I'd say no. We're still, I'd say, growing the base of the offers faster and putting it on the balance sheet than it's coming off. But, again, both the year-over-year increase of the balance, the $5.2 billion was up 37% and my income statement was up 37% as well. But I'm still putting more and more offers and as we get scale through the core networking, not just on switching but the whole DNA Center, I think that'll continue to add. So it's still going be a headwind. And as I said before, this 1.5 to 2 points will move to more like a 2 to 3 points in the upcoming years as we get more scale there. So more to come but, again, we're again benefiting from \u2013 we're starting to see the benefit of just having more stability and being able to have a better line of sight and less massive fluctuations by having that.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","And, Jim, just the market segment perspective that is probably pretty clear. We saw service provider pretty much the same as it has been for some period of time. Our largest enterprise customers, which the way we define it is really just is an organizational segment that we have. We did see \u2013 we saw negative mid single digits there, which you saw in the slides. In our commercial business, we saw 12% growth on a global basis and it was double digits in every geography, which is always good to see.","Our enterprise customers what I would tell you is that they're some of the biggest customers who take the longest amount of time to evaluate new platforms and new capabilities like The Network. Intuitive. as well as this whole SD-WAN discussion. So we're actively in those discussions with the enterprise customers. And our commercial customers tend to just move more quickly than others.","And then finally, on the public sector side, which we didn't talk about a lot, I think the big call out there I would say is that two quarters ago we talked about the pressure in the federal business. Last quarter we said we saw it improving and what I would tell you is that in this quarter we saw the year-end it seemed fairly normal. While they still have a lot of leadership roles that haven't been filled and we still have the impending December debt ceiling issue overall for this quarter we saw the federal business pretty much back to what we expected as we closed the quarter. So that's probably the commentary I could provide on the market segments.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Okay. I think we are...","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Well, that's it, isn't it?","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yes. We are going to wrap up.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Okay. I'll wrap it. Thanks, everyone again for joining us today. I just want to wrap with a few points. First off, we are committed to executing on this vision to deliver a highly secure intelligent platform for our customers' digital business. And we are laser focused on five key elements of that strategy to enable our customers' success and drive profitable growth for us and shareholder value as well.","First, we are fundamentally reinventing networking with our intent-based networking platform. We intend to further accelerate our leadership here extending intuitive technologies across the broad portfolio that we have while increasing application, visibility and automation. Secondly, security is fundamental to everything we do. You can't build a next generation digital business without a comprehensive security strategy across endpoints, network and the cloud.","Third, it is very clear that it's a multi-cloud world, and Cisco is in a unique position to help our customers navigate this by expanding our multi-cloud portfolio and extending our web scale partnerships with strategic cloud providers. Our Google partnership is an example of the work we are doing with all of the large web scale providers.","Fourth, we're unlocking the power of the data with advanced analytics such as our solutions AppDynamics, encrypted traffic analytics and Talos threat intelligence. We're also embedding AI and machine learning technologies across the breadth of our portfolio. And lastly, we will continue to deliver a more enhanced customer and employee experience through our broad Collaboration portfolio including our intent to acquire BroadSoft.","Marilyn, I'll turn it back over to you.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Chuck.

As we open this call, I want to recognize the devastation in the eastern seaboard of the United States in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. Knowing many on this call consider the impacted area, home, we want to share our sincere condolences for all that has been lost. We remain committed to doing all we can to support and enable our employees, partners and customers, and the local government agencies and support organizations, who will work to rebuild and move forward.","Now, moving on to a discussion of our year-over-year performance in Q1 FY '13. We delivered another strong quarter of record revenue with growth of 6% and record non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.48 with growth of 12% from an earnings per share perspective.","As we continue to manage through a challenging macroeconomic environment, we continue to see the benefits of our focus on operational excellence with only a 1% increase in non-GAAP operating expenses, Gary nice job there; and strong non-GAAP gross margins at 62.7%, Rob, the teams are doing well sales and engineering, yielding 11% increase in net income and record non-GAAP operating income.","In a world of many clouds mobility, bring your own device, and the internet literally connecting everything. The network has never played a more central role, connecting people, the process, data and things, anywhere, anytime, across any device. In this cloud of mobile world, the challenges of scale, agility, security and resilience can only be addressed by an intelligent network, and Cisco is uniquely positioned to help our customers meet business requirements and drive this new growth.","From my perspective, our strong results this quarter are improved that our vision for the evolution of this market and our strategy for Cisco's leadership role is playing out as we expected. My key takeaway for this quarter are the following.","First, revenue growth of 6% in a very challenging market, where many of our peers are reporting declines and bringing down future expectations. Second, profitability growth in double digits, with solid expense management, with gross and operating margins exceeding our guidance. Third, our service business continues to grow double digits as our customers ask Cisco to partner to build their technology and business architectures for the future.","Fourth, $2.5 billion cash from operations generated this quarter with more than a 3% dividend yield took a boot, continuing to drive value for you, our shareholders. And fifth, while we continue to see very challenging order trends in Europe, we are pleased with our order growth in the U.S., where enterprise group 9% year-over-year, U.S. Service Provider grew 13%, and U.S. Commercial which is not included in public sector grew 5%.","We continue to deliver the innovation, quality and leadership, our customer expect, and we are evolving the role we play in our customer accounts moving from the top communications company to our goal of becoming the number one IT company.","To provide additional detail on our Q1 FY '13 results, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank. I will then walk through, after Frank you are through, what we're seeing in the business and where we're focusing going forward. Frank will then come back with a detailed guidance, and then we'll wrap up with Q&A. Frank, over to you.","Frank Calderoni","Thank you, John. In Q1 FY '13, we executed consistent with our operating model of driving profit faster than revenue, contributing to our long-term profitable growth, driving operating leverage and increasing shareholder value. Total revenue for the first quarter was $11.9 billion, an increase of approximately 6%.","From a geographic perspective, total revenue increased 7% for the Americas, 10% for Asia-Pacific, Japan and China, with revenue for EMEA about flat. Total product book-to-bill for Q1 was slightly under 1 similar to most prior Q1. Total product revenue was $9.3 billion, up approximately 4% year-on-year.","We believe our position in the industry after conversions of the major transitions occurring in the market, allows us to continue to drive solid financial performance, despite the challenging macroeconomic environment.","Total service revenue was $2.6 billion, up approximately 12%. We have seen strong growth in our services business with a revenue compound annual growth rate of approximately 12% of the last decade, which has provided consistency to our financial results. Our services business contributes to both long-term revenue growth as well as adding stability to our gross margins.","Our advance services business continues to perform well with growth over 20%. This business is a growing strategic asset, while we are partnering with customers to build the architectures and end-to-end solutions to deliver business outcomes.","Q1 FY '13 total non-GAAP gross margin was 62.7% that was up 0.8 percentage points quarter-over-quarter and also up 0.3 percentage points year-over-year. While we have variations in gross margins from quarter-to-quarter, most often impacted by product mix driven by growth in several product areas, I am pleased with the benefits from the strong focus that the entire company has had on gross margins.","For product only, non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 61.5%, an increase of 1.1 percentage points quarter-over-quarter and also up 0.2 percentage points year-over-year. We saw a strong execution in driving cost savings, lower overall manufacturing cost and improvements in our commodity pricing. We have invested and will continue to invest in value engineering, which has driven more stability of our product gross margins over these last multiple quarters.","Our non-GAAP service margin for the first quarter was 66.9% that was down from 67.1% last quarter and up from 66.8% in Q1 FY '12. Our services gross margins continue to perform very well. We have driven productivity and cost improvements over time, including for example, increased automation in our service delivery and have delivered exceptionally high customer satisfaction results.","Total gross margin by geographic region was 63.6% for the Americas, 63.3% for EMEA and 58.5% for APJC. Non-GAAP operating expenses were approximately $4.1 billion in Q1, up approximately $100 million, when compared to Q4 FY '12. The increase was due primarily to the addition of NDS operating expense in Q1 FY '13.","Non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was 34.8% in the quarter versus 34.4% in Q4. At the end of Q1, our headcount totaled 72,360 and excluding the addition of approximately 5,750 NDS employees, our headcount was slightly down from last quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 27.9%, representing growth of 13%, which grew faster than our revenue.","Our Q1 FY '13 non-GAAP tax provision rate was 22%. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $2.6 billion, representing an increase of 11%, and as a percentage of revenue non-GAAP net income was 21.6%. Non-GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for the first quarter were $0.48 versus $0.43 in the first quarter fiscal year 2012, which is a 12% increase.","GAAP net income for the first quarter was $2.1 billion as compared to $1.8 billion in the first quarter fiscal year 2012. GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for the first quarter were $0.39 versus $0.33 in the same quarter fiscal year 2012.","The total of cash, cash equivalents and investments at quarter end was $45 billion, that's down $3.7 billion from last quarter due to the completion of our acquisition of NDS. Of this total balance, $7.5 billion was available within the U.S. at the end of Q1. The increase of $1.3 billion in our U.S. cash position from last quarter was driven by cash flows from operation as well as a distribution during the quarter of previously taxed earning, offset by cash we returned to shareholders.","Our cash flow from operations was approximately $2.5 billion and we returned approximately $1 billion to our shareholder through the combination of purchase program, as well as the quarterly dividend consistent with our capital allocation strategy that we discussed last quarter. We continue to closely manage our U.S. cash position taking into consideration a number of variables, including the dividend and the stock buyback requirements, our operating cash flow, capital requirements, funding of our financing business and our acquisition strategy.","In terms of our acquisition strategy, we closed several strategic acquisitions this quarter, including NDS, vCider and ThinkSmart, and we expect to be active with acquisitions to drive our growth and value proposition with our customers. As we look forward, we continue to prefer small-to-medium size deals that are a fit from a technology, strategy, culture and an ROIC perspective.","We are pleased with the integration of NDS with the financial performance consistent with our expectations and the guidance that we provided at Q4 FY '12 earnings call. Our results are reflective of the continued focus and execution around operational excellence. We have a number of initiatives that we are driving across the company, including an enterprise-wide shared services organization that is delivering improved, global, scalable capabilities and significant cost efficiency.","Over the last year-and-a-half, we have been driving numerous operational initiatives and our expectations are to continue to deliver on these over the next three to five years. As we build a company that can be both innovative and disciplined, we will remain focus on achieving profitable growth, where our profits can grow faster than revenue over the long term. We believe our strategy and financial model support Cisco and are confident in our ability to execute moving forward.","I'll now turn the call back over to John for more detail on our business momentum and our trends.","John Chambers","Thank you, Frank. I'll now provide a more detail discussion of the market and our five foundational priority areas in terms of year-over-year revenue growth, followed by discussing geographic and customer segments in terms of orders.","First, our core business. Switching revenues decline 2%. We saw a solid growth in the Nexus data center switching with the Nexus 2000, 5000 and 7000 lines all going in the high teens or better. We continue to see specific strength and massively scalable data centers.","Macro challenges in the U.S. public sector and EMEA, that's our Europe, Middle-East and Africa operation, did have a negative impact on switching revenues. I would remind you that Cisco's market share is disproportionably impacted by slowing in public sector and developed countries.","Switching gross margins remain very stable, actually improving in Q1, and once again versus 12 to 18 months ago, back to where we were, Frank, at that time or above, and just very solid progress across the company; Robin, Gary nicely done. Our switching innovation across ASICs hardware and software is very strong and will drive our continued switching leadership.","Second, our NGN routing portfolio remained strong, especially relative to our competitors. Our total revenue for NGN routing declined 2%, driven primarily by weakness in EMEA, especially the service provider sector there and declines in optical networking due to product migration to faster speeds.","We saw double-digit growth in total Edge Routing with especially strong adoption of ASR 9000, up approximately 80% year-over-year. We continue to see strong momentum in SP mobility, where orders were up 86% year-over-year, as SP addresses the capacity requirements associated with incremental global smartphones and tablet demand.","Wireless continues to be one of our fastest growing businesses with revenue growth of 38%, the fourth consecutive quarter of record revenue. We experienced strong growth throughout our portfolio led by the 3600 series, outdoor access points and high-end controllers. We saw exceptional growth in APJC of approximately 45%.","We are very well positioned for the explosion of mobility, BYOD, bring your own device and SP Wi-Fi small sales. And for example SP Wi-Fi grew almost a 100% year-over-year, granted off of a relatively small base at this point in time.","Security grew 6% driven primarily by high-end and mid-range router firewall platforms, growth in web security and strong adoption of our identity services engine. Transitions like to move to cloud based delivery models and BYOD are few in the growth and played our strengths. We will continue to capitalize on the opportunities in the security space.","Moving on to data center. Data center grew 61%, fueled by our industry leadership, where we're delivering a unified data center strategy. Our unique ability to unify the physical and virtual by delivering ongoing innovation around unified fabric, unified compute and unified management has helped solidify our position as a leader in next generation data centers.","For the first time we are starting to see our leadership in IT, especially the UCS pull through our communication products. This is especially important in terms how CIO's are beginning to view Cisco, not just as a leader in communications, but view us as an IT player, who also does communications.","We saw a very good balance in data center globally. Growth was particularly strong in APJC, up by 127% and in service providers, up a 102%. Enterprise grew 54%, fueled by the rapid adoption of Romley based servers.","The innovation we've driven in UCS and the cloud, combined with our ability to drive the transition to a unified data center have enabled us to achieve the number two position in the x86 Blade Servers category in the U.S., and the number three position worldwide. A category we entered only three short years ago. We also are number four in the overall server market, a market few thought we could penetrate. We will drive the same level of innovation in the evolution of the unified data center that we drove in the compute market with the UCS.","Cisco's strategy for enabling program mobility of the network to drive application intelligence, focus on operational simplicity and cost effectiveness, while leveraging the decades of existing network investments is what our customers are looking for. With an integrated software, plus software, plus ASIC and hardware approach, we believe Cisco alone can deliver the scale, resilience, investment protection and features customers demand this evolution.","Moving on to collaboration. Collaboration declined 8%, facing a difficult compared with Q1 FY '12, which is a record quarter for our collaboration products. We continue to drive our software momentum, and this quarter drove deployment of 2.2 million Jabber software clients. We continue to see challenges in our TelePresence business down in the mid teens and the U.S. federal business of more than 30% for TelePresence year-over-year.","You will see us continue to pull together our TelePresence, unified communication and WebEx offerings into an integrated open architecture that enables communication with any device to any other, with consistent experience and unparalleled ease of use. We believe this strategy will position us well to address the evolving requirements in this market. We need to do a better job in collaboration, and will continue to invest in innovation and sales execution to capitalize on this very important marketplace.","Moving onto video, total service provider video revenue was up 30%, of which NDS contributed approximately 20%. As you would expect, NDS had and is expected to continue to have a very positive impact on SP video margins. Video, mobility, cloud, speed of service delivery and monetization of network loads continue to be the top priorities of our service provider customers. Our unique ability to provide an integrated architectural approach is an area of major differentiation strength for Cisco to address in many, if not most all of the service providers around the world.","Finally, our architectural approach, build off of market transition and focused on delivering solutions to our customers top priorities is moving us from an IP communication provider to a strategic business partner with many of our customers worldwide. One of the most strategic differentiation is our services capability of Cisco and our partners. Our ability to integrate services, engineering, sales, provides speed to market and innovation, and is an area of sustainable differentiation for Cisco and equally important for our partners.","A growing number of our opportunities are led by services delivered by both Cisco and our partners. This business has consistently grown in the low-double digits with very strong gross margin, and is a key growth area for Cisco. We anticipate your will see our service businesses continue to grow, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our total business. In summary, we are pleased with the performance across most of our priority areas.","I will now move on to provide some color on our geographic and customer segments. The following geographic and customer segments growth rates are in terms of year-over-year product orders, unless specifically stated otherwise.","In Q1 Cisco's total product orders were flat year-over-year. I would again remind you that we reported 13% growth in product orders in Q1 of last year that is Q1 of fiscal year '12, making for very challenging comparisons.","Looking at the numbers from a geographic perspective, specifically the American region grew 2%, Latin America within America region grew 3%, led by Brazil up 24% and Mexico up 11%. Canada was down approximately 12% with a very tough compare with last year's Q1 FY '12, where growth was 34% at the end of Q1 of last year.","As we discussed past quarter, we believe the U.S. must lead the global economic recovery. Looking at the U.S., we saw continued positive trends with U.S. service providers up 13% year-over-year, U.S. enterprise up 9% and U.S. commercial that is not including public sector, up 5%. The federal government was as top as we expected and was down 15% year-over-year.","The Asia-Pacific, Japan and China region grew 7%, India had a very solid quarter with growth of over 50%, Japan grew in the mid-single digits, and China was flat. China is very important to Cisco and we want Cisco to be very important to China's transformation. We have invested a lot of resources in innovation in China for the last 20 years and our commitment to China has not changed in any way.","Our Europe, Middle East, Africa and Russian region declined by approximately 10% year-over-year. Europe continues to be as challenging as we expected. We have very strong sales team there and will get our fair share of the business, nice way of saying, Rob, I think Chris will get everything that we have to get from our perspective.","Now, moving on to a customer market view, where I will provide some additional details to quantify the impact of Europe, so you will have a better understanding of the details of our global performance. In Europe, we saw enterprise decrease in the mid teens. Service provider declined in the higher teen. Our service provider business grew in low-double digits in both the Americas and Asia-Pacific, Japan and China. However, when you add these three together, service provider orders in total only grew 3%.","Enterprise, excluding Europe, grew in the mid-single digits, led by the U.S. as stated earlier with growth of 9%. Commercial grew 1%, public sector declined 6%, although it grew in Asia-Pacific, Japan and China in that single digits. While we feel very good about our performance and our opportunity, we all understand the uncertainty in the current microeconomic environment. Specifically, we are modeling Europe to get worst before it gets better.","We see signs of improvement in the U.S. in both, the enterprise, service provider and commercial. Unfortunately, it's still too early to call this a trend that we are continuing to see what we like. And we feel good about our momentum in Asia-Pacific, Japan and China, and anticipate this region to continue to be our fastest growing region in the world.","Now, Frank, let me turn it back over to you for your guidance for Q2.","Frank Calderoni","Thanks again, John. Let me now provide a few comments on our outlook, our guidance for the second quarter. First, let me remind you again that comments include forward-looking statements and you should review our recent SEC filings that identify the important risk factors and also understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","The guidance is based on the current pipeline and our view of business trends based upon the information we have available today and actual results could be above or below our guidance. Looking forward we are basing our guidance on neither a significant improvement nor a deterioration in the global macroeconomic conditions in the near future. The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with reconciliation to GAAP.","For Q2 FY '13, we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 3.5% to 5.5% on a year-over-year basis. For the second quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately in the range of 61% to 62%. Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q2 is expected to be in the range of 26.5% to 27.5%, and our non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be approximately 22% in the second quarter.","Our Q2 FY '13 non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range between $0.47 and $0.48 per share, and we anticipate our GAAP earnings in Q2 will be $0.08 to $0.11 per share lower than our non-GAAP EPS. This range includes our typically differences as well as an impact of $0.01 as a result of anticipated restructuring charges.","Other than those quantified items above, there are no other significant differences between our GAAP and our non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructurings and tax or any other events, which may or may not be significant. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through an exclusive public disclosure.","Related to our July 2011 announcements on restructuring, we have incurred a total pre-tax charge of approximately $1.1 billion, which is consistent with our expectations. Any remaining charges that we expect will be incurred during the reminder of FY '13 related to these action are not expected to be significant.","John, back to you.","John Chambers","Thank you, Frank. As I reflect on Q1 FY '13, I am very pleased with our execution as a company. We delivered on our commitment to you, our shareholders, to our partners and to our customers. Each of us as Cisco employees takes pride in our revenue growth of 6%, non-GAAP gross margins of 62.7%, non-GAAP expense growth of only 1%, $2.5 billion in cash from operations and 12% growth in non-GAAP earnings per share.","Our innovation, operational discipline and ongoing evolution is separating Cisco from many of our peers. Never in our past, have we had so many growth opportunities in front of us. While the economy and emerging competitors always present challenges, and new technology transitions will always require Cisco to lead an adjust. We have an unparallel track record of managing and evolving our businesses to emerge stronger.","As I look ahead I see the opportunities in the commercial marketplace, cloud, mobility and video, driving our business today. I also see our plans to aggressively expand our software and services business, our emerging markets opportunity and our security architecture as an additional driver of our business going forward.","Perhaps, driving and contributing to all of these opportunities is the biggest market transition for us yet. The Internet of everything as a platform, bringing together people, process, data and things to connect the 99% of the world that is not connected today.","We have an unprecedented ability to harness and turn the information that will flow across networks and to new capabilities, which are experiences and unprecedented economic opportunities for the businesses, individuals and countries. The opportunity for Cisco and the intelligent network is clearing compelling.","We expect to capitalize on these opportunities the same way have done for almost three decades, bringing innovation to our customers' most important challenges and opportunities, leveraging our scale and reach every market, every segment and capitalizing on our strong balance sheet to make the right moves for our business and for our customers.","In almost every case, the solution that enable customer success will be implemented and build upon architectures that leverage technology to solve business challenges, as IT underlies every business process as well as every business model and every budget becomes an IT budget. We believe Cisco's unique ability to be a business partner to our customers will enable us to become the worlds number IT company.","Mel, let's now open it up for questions.","Melissa Selcher","Thank you, John. We will now open the floor to Q&A. We still request that sell-side analysts please ask only one question. Operator, please open the floor to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs","Just wanted to ask you a question on the environment, it was interesting to hear your commentary, and unless I missed it, without once mentioning any kind of impact from either the fiscal cliff or the financial services vertical, and in fact a comment that the U.S. enterprise is improving. So I would love to get your feedback on that in the context of the fiscal cliff?","And then related to that if you look out into next year, I also didn't hear your comment, much of your thoughts on the carrier CapEx environment in the wake of AT&T's announcement and the SoftBank Sprint announcement? So I would love to get your thoughts into the opportunity for next year as well?","John Chambers","If you look at the trend, we believed for almost a year unfortunately that for the U.S. it has to lead the total globe out of this economic slowdown. It's going to come from Europe, and while we were all hopeful about emerging countries, they're just not going to be strong enough to really drive us out of this slowdown. So we're watching very carefully, the spending in the U.S. enterprise.","Now, these U.S. enterprises has don't include the large global financials, Simona, in those numbers. And the U.S. enterprise has literally if you look over this last year, in terms of the direction, a year ago it was 15% growth, then it was 5%, then 0%, then 5%, and then this quarter 9%. And the number of large deals, the Brian Marlier who runs this operation is seeing are up both in terms of the number and the size of those deals pretty solid.","Service provider growth in the U.S. was another indication and it grew 13% this last quarter. Well, areas such as AT&T have announced some pretty aggressive capital spending year-over-year. I think that was 15% type of numbers and we are obviously a beneficiary of that. And the Sprint SoftBank where we've very good customers with both companies and very strong relationships all the way up to Masa Son, it was on my board many years ago, as well as Dan Hesse who's a good friend as well.","We've done a good job with both those accounts and would expect to get our first share in those areas. The commercial marketplace hasn't turned up quite as much. The pipeline Rob was a little bit better in the commercial marketplace in Allison's territory in the U.S. We'd like to watch that a little bit longer. And we would like to see the trends remain strong for another quarter before we'd say it's given. But we like what we're seeing trend-wise in this category.","Service provider spending, if their revenues are looking up, they're going to spend more. And I think you're going to see a mix spending environment on the global basis. Our service provider spending, year-over-year, in terms of our ability to benefit from it has been in the mid single digits.","So I think, Rob, depending on the geography to low teens consistently taking Europe out of the number. And as that said unfortunately, Europe was down in service provider 19% year-over-year, that clearly has a big huge impact on our revenue for router numbers, as well as our switching numbers when we look into it.","So I think service provider spending is improving. But again the service provider customers are very different than and the different my other enterprise customers. Uncertainty in this market causes them to spin slower. I personally think the fiscal cliff, we're going to work through that probably with little bit of saber-rattling on both sides. We're looking more towards the tax policy and if government able to instill the confidence in business that allows and ready to invest.","If I would look at one model, we have to look at very carefully around the world it's Canada, the easiest place to do business, it doesn't matter which party is in power, even their provinces or either states. When the national government, Prime Minister Harper gets it the leaders in auto will get it, they drive down through and make it very easy do business there. And you're going to see us grow our business there as well as invest overall.","So I think it's one of the businesses confidences. I do think that is the wild card that can make a difference whether we're going to grow GDP at a 2%, give or take a little bit or get a platform where it belongs to 3% plus. The company's do have the cash to spend if they have the confidence to invest.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Kvaal with Barclays.","Jeff Kvaal - Barclays","It seems as though you all have put services in a much more prominent position in your script this time around, can you help us understand what efforts you're undertaking to grow your services business. And just in general, a broader question, where would you like your recurring revenue percentage of sales to get to over a unspecified period of time.","John Chambers","Two questions that I think are very appropriate and you did read it right in terms of the issue on services, Gary and I have believe that we could as the market moves to more of an architectural play and solving business problems and focusing on solutions. Services both from Cisco and from our partners together could have a major up tick for us and differentiation versus our peers.","So when you sit down with the CEO of research provider or an enterprise account or large commercial or government environment. We often sit down with services led sales and implementation and whether you change that, we made Edzard Overbeek in charge of services reporting to Gary was not settled. We took one of our best global sales people who is a great general manager and companion with a world-class services operation to say how does engineering, sales and services work seamlessly together.","So we would anticipate growth in services looking out over the three to five year window to both grow absolutely, but also to grow as a percentage of our total revenues. Stay tuned. More to come in fact, coming out in terms of a financial would comment in fact coming up in terms of a Financial Analyst Conference in December.","In terms of recurring revenue, getting there is a difficult part. You're going to be very easy to take your current revenue and just recurred over the next three years. And the people who replace the four of us would very much appreciate that. But the key is as we move into this you're going to watch us, and it is easy on our shareholders but also easy on our business model to move to more and more recurring revenues.","So as we do implementations in new areas, as we acquire new company such as NDS, we will very much focus both on the recurring revenue stream because they are new to Cisco, and makes it easier to introduce without a dramatic drop in terms of year-over-year revenue and we're also going to focus more and more on the software time tent.","So you are going to see as our focus on all three of those areas. You read it pretty accurate in terms of recurring revenue and also our focus on the roll of services in increasing, both, in normal growth areas, but also in terms of the percentage of our total sales. And obviously, we're pleased with the gross margins in that area as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer","John, clearly there is some part of the business that are struggling right now, like collaboration that you mentioned. Is there a way you can go area by area and tell us the areas where you truly believe that you are gaining share versus areas of challenges, where you still think it's going to take some time before you balance out the business? And one clarification from Frank. Frank, can you give us how much NDS revenue was in the quarter and how you thinking about it next and kind of just trying to understand the service provider business expenses-NDS?","John Chambers","We'll talk about areas are growth for collaboration and areas of challenge. Collaboration was down 8% year-over-year, although the very strong Q1 of last year, not only a record but the gross numbers were under double-digits. In terms of what went well, unified. Communications continues to be our leader there. It is whether use Gartner's four quadrant area. It's the number play in Gartner's quadrant. And what we're doing with Jabber, I think is very, very solid.","Unfortunately, collaboration seems to be one of those areas and several of peers have seen that this well that during tough economic times, the people just take foot off the gas and watch. And so you are seeing some of that. You're also seeing requirement for us to tie together our WebEx portfolio including Jabber, including Unified Communications with TelePresence into a single call manager which clearly we're going to do, and it's got to be easier to use.","I keep using the word CEO idiot proof in terms of the direction. In terms of areas, that also saw the pressure on it, I clearly we were impacted a large percentage of our business, the federal government is just bigger, it's a biggest multiple factors, and the spending was down in federal government pretty dramatically, not just overall spinning down 15%, but obviously this area is getting just really clobbered. And Europe, Middle-East, Africa, but especially Europe and the developing countries was an area that we also got hit in.","I don't want to in anyway, however, say that we don't have to improve here. If you look at our five foundational building blocks overlaid by security, mobility, this is the area that I think you'll going to see us spoke us on the most, Rob, both on the field perspective and Gary from the services perspective and from an engineering with Martin's team and Rowan who is a new addition to the team going forward.","We needed to also get all these underneath a single-engineering leadership and tightly tie to what we're doing in the field. It's a long winded way of saying, we're all over this, but we anticipate at being a tough battle, especially if we don't see economies pick up from present levels.","Frank Calderoni","As far as NDS, so last quarter when we gave guidance from Q1, I said that we had approximately $200 million assumed in that guidance for NDS, and as I said earlier on the call today that we executed according to our expectation. So we not only from a revenue perspective, but we also executed on the margin as well as on the cost side with the inclusion of NDS plus the certain cost that we added for some of the integration which we have already started, so things overall from an NDS perspective after three months ago is quite well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I have a question on gross margin. Gross margin was above expectations, and I am wondering what is the combination of drivers this quarter, is it that existing products improved in their margins or is it just a mix that certain things grew faster than other things? And then you're guiding back to the same 61.5% gross margin for next quarter. So why do you expect things to reverse back to where they were in the next quarter?","John Chambers ","Gary, I'm going to ask you to comment on the second, on our overall focus on gross margins. If you look at it from a company perspective, we have put a lot of time into this last year. And you have seen our dramatic improvement switching as an example. But also, our improvement in areas such as collaboration, where Martin's team has been all over and that was before we added NDS, which obviously helps our gross margin as well.","And you're seeing us focus on seen focus on your programs, and the field structure roll out with encouraging benefits and rewards for lower discounting, in terms for the balance as well. If you watch what the engineering teams have done, they've focused not only on not having redundancies, sharing common ASICs, et cetera, but it's been an ongoing process.","And Gary, let me have you take at the second step in terms of our focus here. Then Frank, I'm going to let you summarize with the answer to these questions, in terms of it being primarily a mix issue?","Gary Moore","The work that we've been doing and I think I said there is a year ago, we're going to double down on the things that will drive margin gross margin across the company and it's not just engineering, it's not just supply chain, and it's not just our selling ability, it's bringing all those things together in a constructive way, so that we're driving component purchases. We're driving value design with shared component, shared ASICs across the broader set of platforms.","And then taking that to market with a sales force and a channel organization that understands the pricing, understands the market much better, has better visibility and to drive our discounting in a way that we're not leaving money on the table. So it's all three of those things. And the whole company continues to be focused on gross margins. And we believe we've done an excellent job. We told you that we've thought we would be able to do this and we've executed to it. And we have not given up, we're actually doubling down again.","Frank Calderoni","On Q2, the major drivers as Gary just mentioned, if you look at it, is the cost improvement. It's been the biggest driver to growth margin improvement quarter-on-quarter, and it's across all the products for the initiative that Gary just talked about with the strong focus on value engineering commodity, elements and things like that.","Second I would say that a pricing of discount was within the typical range of the quarter, so there was no material change from a quarter-on-quarter standpoint. And then the other point is the mix in Q1, were had less of a negative impact than we saw in Q4. And primarily, we had strength from the mix perspective with the NGN routing and then we also had a less of an impact on the data center business within the quarter.","Now, moving forward into Q2 and the guidance that we gave of 61 to 62, the major delta from quarter-on-quarter is really the mix dynamics. And what we're assuming on a couple of the major segments that we'll have, that kind of an impact, the SP video, the data center as well as NGN routing from a mix standpoint.","And then also what I would say is just looking at it from a transaction standpoint, we've actually done a lot of work in the pipeline looking at the transaction. If you look at some of the transactions and taking the mix of those transactions, is also a factor in looking at that range of 61 to 62. And if you go back and look at this past year, FY12, you'll see that the margins do kind of vary a little bit from quarter-to-quarter, primarily because the mix and also because some of the transactions. And so it's not something that's out of the ordinary.","Operator","Your next question comes from the Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley","Frank, you mentioned that some of the U.S. cash balance today is a result of bringing over or distributing some overseas cash that seems to have previously paid taxes on. I wonder how much more you have of that, so that you could bring over that we could be looking at the overseas cash, more kind of without penalty.","Frank Calderoni","From time to time, we do make distributions of our cash to the U.S. from foreign subsidiary. I had previously been tax by the United States, and this quarter we had a higher amount. I mentioned this last quarter as well. We'll continue to have some period-to-period. And that's of the things that we've take into last quarter when we announced the capital allocation strategy going forward.","So we're factoring that in, kind of looking at that as also one of the factors on the U.S. cash and then being able to support the dividend as well as the stock buy back to be able to distribute the cash at least at about 50% as we cash flow on an annual basis.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley","I understand that, I was hoping you could quantify how much more there, but if you don't, that okay?","Frank Calderoni","We can't really quantify, we have some estimates that we look at, but all depends on some of the dynamics that occur within a quarter. And it's not a steady amount from quarter-to-quarter.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley","So on routing, you made some interesting comments. The service provider Edge routing business seemed to be growing double-digit. Most people thinking of routing in general these days as a low single-digit almost, an expenses-growth kind of a business. You didn't mention core routing? And I'm wondering, is what you're seeing in core routing kind offsetting Edge routing, so we really are looking at routing, going forward as kind of a low single-digit overall business?","And service provider Edge routing just sort of riding some sort of share gains, some kinds of cycle that's going on right now? Although it seems to be hurt on the other side out of Europe, but it appears our guest routing is doing weak in Europe as well. So as we look forward, can we be looking forward to routing being kind of a high single-digit, maybe 10%-ish kind of market going forward, or how do we look at the different pieces of routing, is that something that you can speak to?","Gary Moore","We're going to stay away from long term guidance in the conference call. I never mind, Ehud, what you're asking, it's something we're going to focus on the Financial Analyst Conference in December and our growth expectations by product category. But in terms of your specific question, let me answer maybe in terms of the quarter. Our Edge routing tends to be very order centric. And so for example, as I said, in the call the revenue on the 9000 edged fixed router was up 80% year-over-year.","The revenue on the 5000 was actually very low, but the orders were far away the best orders we've seen dramatically how to book to build with 80% growth players. So we didn't get much revenue growth, but got actually slightly down on the 5000 this quarter. You're seeing a huge pipeline going in next quarter. And the 9000 we did get very solid growth both on orders and balance.","Now, my experience has been you tend to grow in the core and then as you get that build out, then you grow in the Edge. Then you build out Edge and as that begin to get loads. Then you go back in the core. They tend to go back and forth on that. And there are a lot of different views on routing growth on it.","We always get too pessimistic on it during the tough time and too optimistic on the good times. We will address that a little bit. But I think it's fair to say, mid single-digits is conceptually where that consensus comes out, and there will be periods where it's low like this quarter and periods where it's high hopefully in the future as well. And we'll try to cover that in more detail in the Financial Conference coming up December.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets","Can we turn to the investor focus that's really related to possible structural changes due to switching and routing markets? John, we understand your view of intelligent networks, yet, what are the customers saying about the future of switching and routing, and just kind of the division of labor between software and hardware.","And also there is a recurring team to improve gross margin, longer term the margins actually move higher, but should we be concerned about revenue growth actually moving lower. Trying to get a sense of how all the dynamic change your financial model over the interim and longer term, or is that rather just operational focus that just drives gross margins higher and higher?","John Chambers","Let me start off with the 30,000 foot view and try to land the plane very quickly. If you watch the growth of the internet, we see it actually at the next stage of growth in an explosion there. The internet, that everything isn't just a nice concept connecting, 99% of the devices aren't connected. It has huge implications for a big data, huge implications of where you put processing and storage throughout the network, huge implications on security, programmer ability, flexibility et cetera.","So you are going to see the growth occur in multiple areas. And we do see a number of both existing growth opportunities going well such as wireless, such as Edge, as you articulated. And growth in the future in terms of the services, the software that we refer to, recurring revenue stream with our acquisitions and acquisitions will continue to add one to two points in terms of our objective of even growth per year, as we move forward.","In terms of the customers, thereafter how do you solve their problems? And those problems very dramatically, if you're an academic location versus massively scaleable datacenter versus somebody who is interested in could versus search data versus enterprise. And we're going to approach as you would expect us to do with the multiple software and hardware level to your indirect Edge. You are going to us do more in software, both in terms of areas. We're going to focus on the solutions, but also our software in the stack, you'll see us do more strategic within this, switching and routing at the core.","And we did not believe that it's just going be a software world anymore, than it's going to be just a hardware world. And we do believe that ASICs, are going to play a much more predominant role than many people anticipating in this. And putting software in ASICs, is we all know, if you really want fast performance, is one of the key ways as you can differentiate yourself when you already have the resiliency.","So I like our cards, I like how we're positioned. We don't miss market transition. You can get give us lot of grief about many things, over the last 20 years. But we will get it right ahead of people, either cloud and where we're today in the data center, or IP telephony or the role that our business models are going change in search matter, where we very quickly adjust within it. And it's one that I know there're a lot of opinions on, you're going to see it's all over this next couple of years. And we think we're positioned very well for the future.","Rob, your thoughts a little bit about where we're going to head in this area.","Robert Lloyd","Well, John, I think our message is getting out there that the whole constructive suffer, separation of the control plane and the data plane. It means different things to different peoples. So you touched on it. Large scale controllers and agents mean something quite different to a large scale cloud provider or a very large enterprise customer. We've had a chance to review our roadmap in this area and our customers love it. They just want us to get there faster, because we have what they're looking for.","On the idea of overlay networks, where we actually going to combine the construct of a virtual overlay with our significant footprint in physical networks, it's very clear that this migration that will go on over a decade in traditional data centers, is going to require both. And I think we will lead in the transition from physical to virtual with what we're doing with our Nexus 1000D. And this family of network virtual services that relating with.","And then finally, the one we haven't talked that much about, but could be the biggest impact for our customers is creating programmability to the operating systems they relied on. XR, IOS XR in service provider, IOS which is predominant across the enterprise. And when we start to touch the applications that our customers run, we start to touch the experience they can deliver to their clients.","So the whole idea of software tied ASICs and our very comprehensive platform is being understood by customers. And I think it's going to open a lot of opportunity for Cisco in the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank","So the question, you talked a lot about the strength in your order book for the UC or the Evolved Packet Core, the 5K product lines, can you talk a little bit about what's driving that? Is that LTE, can you give us a little geographic color? And given your role in the Evolved Packet Core, do you see and it's kind of got role as a central nervous system of an LTE in architecture. Do you see getting into more of the access side of the LTE as a company? And if so, how would you go about doing that, talking base stations?","John Chambers","So let me say that all of those factors, I'll deal with the first two, you've seen a explosion for us in the data center, both taking share and for the first time this is the key point, the CIOs are looking as IT player that is suddenly starting to pull through communication. And while that sounds basic, it is a huge step for us in terms of the direction. There are many things feeding Packet Core LTE and the explosion of that 3G, 4G.","And in terms of base stations traditional, no, but in terms of the future we're going where the market is where can be the margins and architecture plays. And that's around SP Wi-Fi which we grew at about 100% year-over-year and isn't the growth rate, because it's still roughly a small number, approaching a $100 million, it's a number of SP Wi-Fi wins we had.","There are going to move into small sales and then we're going to combine with SP Wi-Fi, with 3G, with 4G with our architectural plays with application and program ability and flexibility, Rob referred to earlier. And then it gets pretty exciting. So in traditional base stations, no. Base stations for the future, small sale in the home, top-of-pole capabilities, and the answer would be yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Credit Suisse.","Paul Silverstein - Credit Suisse","I think gross margin OpEx as it translates into operating margin are key to your ability to maintain grow your healthy $10 billion plus annual cash flow.","I've got two questions, question one, your OpEx was 34.8% of as a percentage of revenue. I think 34.0% was your post bubble best, couple of quarters ago. I know you're running the company more towards the value bias now. Can you improve upon that 34%, in terms of how much room do you have to get OpEx lower as a percentage of revenue?","And related to that your gross margin his now run 62% to 63% in last right quarters, with your product margin running 61% plus and several last three quarters. I know you're not giving long term, but it's been an impressive performance over the last three years, after the big come down from two years ago. How much stability can we expect going forward?","John Chambers","I'm going to take the last question and give the OpEx question which is much harder, Frank, to you. So if you'll take the first part, I'll take the second part.","Frank Calderoni","So just a call to put in perspective on the OpEx standpoint, clearly the work that we've done over the last year and a half, around some of the restructuring that we've done, and also the focus on operational expense is in critical to get to the point where we are right now. ","We do a tremendous amount of work both on the gross margin as well as on the OpEx in focusing on the portfolio.","We've been able over the last two and half year to really drive a whole approach across the business and looking at return and making sure that we used that as the basis for making decisions. And that's allowed us to be much more efficient in where we make our investments and also where we expect to payoff to in the longer term.","That's a factor, that's not only for the current our performance, but also as we get into the long range model that we provided last year. So I would say that the 35% as a percentage revenue is clearly a good number as we've seen in last couple of quarters. We want to make sure as we go into the future, that we through that portfolio approach to making the right investments, to drive innovation, to be able to stay within the range of what we talked about a year ago and driving revenue growth in 5% to 7% over the longer period time, and then continue to support the 7% to 9% of profits. At a range of what we provided last year, and we'll update that as we get continued new information.","John Chambers","So in the second part of the question, if you look versus 18 or 24 months ago when the gross margins deteriorated, we made the mistake of bringing out five new product lines in switching, at dramatically lower gross margins, especially at the high end of the switching product of 7K, all one time. And before we've not been as good on innovation of bringing the matters quick, but we weren't as effective in designing them to be able to improve the gross margins quickly.","So first takeaway, if you want to see us announce powerful new products at the same time, second key takeaway is that you'll see us design for higher gross margins, and think more through the second and third moves within the gross margins as you do continues price performance improvements and design for those.","You will see us also drive through, like Gary said earlier comment ASICs common sharing, we didn't use many platforms. You'll see us do a better job on that. And instead of taking, I don't know how longer the Nexus 7K was announced, but we're just now getting up finally up to normal gross margins.","So in the complement to the 7K team, we didn't design it with proper gross margins in mind, but you all have really done an amazing job of getting the gross margins back up to where we would expect. But to your point, Paul, I do not see something fundamental change. I'm a very much aware the software issues, some of you are looking at another issues.","I don't see a fundamental change on the horizon, but if we execute right, we won't play out where there is gross margins feel pretty good in our core products. But I think is our mix. And our mix issue, when you're growing an area like UCS that is really becoming very material, and we're in UCS not for growth reasons, its control of the data center.","Its ability to be the primary data center provider when you host and interface into all of the hypervisors. When you look at processor power combined with the network, combined with storage, the ability do that with an open architecture, were almost every peer trust this. Even if we might complete, is a unique opportunity for us. So I think it's going to be subject to mix.","And we're clearly matching this, but secondly we are focusing very aggressively, even though it takes a couple of years to do it, much more software, much more recurring revenue in terms of the approach. So I feel good about that. We're much tougher on designing products consistently at a given gross margins, when they come out and you wont see us announce a whole bunch at the same time. But we're not seeing any abnormal pricing pressure. Rob, your thoughts?","Robert Lloyd","John, I don't think there's anything in the short-term that should change that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Simon Leopald, Raymond James.","Simon Leopald - Raymond James","I wanted to see if you could comment on China, both from broad perspective as well as from Huawei perspective, particularly in light of the congressional study that I guess probably bought more attention to the issue in the public domain. And wonder how you think about the potential for either a trade wall with China or competitive threats as Huawei currently stands whether that's changing for you?","John Chambers","So first of all, I think it's very important that the issues involved here are not between countries. We take on a competitor like Huawei very aggressively. And if you were to look back, flash back, to what I think Paul alluded to earlier, in 15 or 18 months ago, a lot of people had concerns about Juniper and HP and while we're eating our lunch and how we were losing share and how they had a better architecture and better products, fast forward 18 months later, we've beaten them all. And that doesn't mean we would do it in the future, but we know how to compete, we know how to compete very toughly.","In terms of the congressional study, it's really important to note contrary to what was said in original post, we did not have anything to do with that nor would we have done that. And that does put pressure on us in China. The nice thing about the Chinese leadership is they are developed very carefully both business and government through a study that makes the GE School at Crotonville look slow in terms of how they develop their leaders. And I think you'll see them do the right thing on a progressive basis both for their country and for the enterprise at the U.S.","The two countries have to work very closely to get other. We're going to compete aggressively where appropriate versus our competitors overall. So I think there will be a little bit give and take, especially in our communications industry. But I think you'll see the two sides work it out, because it's in the best interest of the world to do in both economies. And candidly in the best interest of the U.S. as well on it. So I see the probability for those issues to be in a trade works that were being very low.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rod Hall with JPMC.","Rod Hall - JPMC","I just had a clarification on the impact of China, particularly in the margins, because you guys had guided I guess on the fact last year that margins were going to be impacted negatively. Do you think that if revenues do slow from China, which looks they may, but margins actually, you see a little bit tailwind from that?","And then I guess I'd circle back around, Frank, to your commentary on the margin guidance. It still feels like its awfully weak, which you're guiding considering what you're delivering. It feels like the margin guidance really are to be at least 50 basis points maybe a little bit higher, because even if you ex-out India's impact, we still get just under 62.5% on the gross margin this quarter, which is pretty strong, so if you could just comment on that, it will be great?","John Chambers","A couple of thoughts. First, on China, we are committed to China. We are invested full force. We will partner in China. And we'll work through ups and downs in the China market. We do think with the challenges going on that we will be under pressure in China for the next couple of quarters and we've modeled that into our business analysis.","But as I alluded to you earlier, the Chinese are very effective in government and business. They would do what's right for the long-term and currently we've earned their trust and ability to partner in the country. So I don't model that for a sustained issue. I see a couple of quarter issue in terms of how we move in that marketplace.","In terms of the question on gross margins, the effective emerging markets, we've got to do two things, what Gary and Rob are both focused on, is how do we design products for emerging markets, where the average selling price being something that market going to afford be at the business or the end-use of consumer in terms of buying the services from the business. So you continue to see us focus in those areas.","But I think in terms of mix of emerging countries on large deals, they will continue to be and I hope they are, because that means there are a number of large deals, Frank, that will impact that. And that's incremental profit for us, even though it's at lower margins, but it profit you either get or you don't.","In terms for the guidance, just before I give Frank, the comment on that, Frank, who would have thought 12 months ago we would be descending our guidance being two week at 61% to 62% and increasing, we ought to be more optimistic. So first a compliment to the three of you, and then how do you answer the question.","Frank Calderoni","So, Rod, the comment you mentioned about the China and emerging country transactions, clearly we've had mentioned that a couple of quarters ago, as John just said. We've had kind of some in a particular quarter and another. So that's one of the variability that we look at, when I was referring to earlier about some of the transactions that we have visibility to that we take into consideration and we give guidance.","The key thing for us, as I said before, is to factor in that, plus look at the mix dynamics across the business as the data center growth has an impact in one quarter and the other as well as SP video, which I factored in. Hopefully, we're in the situation where the guidance is conservative and we can do better than that, but we want to make sure that we have a realistic view right now based on the information that we have. And that was taken into consideration, the guidance that we gave of 61% to 62%.","Operator","Your next question comes from Subu Subrahmanyan with The Juda Group.","Subu Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group","My question is on the unified data centre, John, you talked about it a few times. From a partnerships perspective, how do you see that progressing, there seems to be some pressure on your partnership with EMC with VMware's acquisition of Nicira, how do you see your other partnerships playing out with some getting stronger and some getting weaker?","John Chambers","First comment, I commented on EMC in this area with VMwares. I think Joe Tucci said about earlier this week and he basically said in one of their conferences that Cisco is their most strategic partner and will continue to be. But it he was also very candid in this area and did clearly put pressure on us and them in terms of the relationship.","Gary, you and Rob have been heading this for us for three or four years, they're going to continue to be our strongest partner. We're going to be very good there together. So you're going to see us work together on BCE and other focus areas and continue to get very healthy growth there.","In terms of opening up, however, the relationships, you are seeing us move with Citrix, and you saw the first of a series announcement there. You are going to see us get closer to players like NetApp's and Red Hat, probably Microsoft, IBM if they'll have us. And you will see us do much what VMware has done in terms of an open approach to the market, supporting all four hypervisors, multiple players on the stock, et cetera.","And more what we do best, which is we will partner tightly with a few players, but we also are going to be able to empower the major transitions, overall they're going to the market. And after we work through this, actually, we think we're in much stronger position now than we were at the time of their announcement. And I think we're well positioned for the future. Rob, it's something that you've been heavily involved in and your thoughts?","Robert Lloyd","I think, John, if we support any hypervisor, any orchestration and management layer, any storage partnership, and we do so with really tightly integrated solutions, we're solving the problem that customers are challenged with. We're going to combine the N1K, the Nexus 1000D with a series of virtualized services, virtualized WAAS, virtualized routing, virtualized security and not those to the physical networks that our customers have relied on across any hypervisor, that's actually what our customers want us do.","So I think our strategy here is what they're looking for. I think a unified data center is what they're asking for. And then combining the physical with the virtual in a way that only Cisco can, is actually our strategy.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brent Bracelin with Pacific Crest.","Brent Bracelin - Pacific Crest","I wanted to kind of go back to the quarter, and the real surprise here is the stability we're seeing in America's growth rate. I think 7% growth this quarter, 7% growth last quarter, like 7% growth last year, that's quite different than what we heard from some of the enterprise peers that report their results in September. So could you maybe walk us through how much of the stability you're seeing in Americas has driven by Cisco share gains versus the seasonal improvement that perhaps you had an extra month here in October that you benefited from just tied to traditional enterprise yearend spending?","John Chambers","First, just so I get all the numbers right for the people listening. The Americas in totaled grew 2%. We had some areas that did very well, some areas that did not grow as much. Within the U.S. it grew a total of 2% for the quarter in terms of the bookings. It was hit pretty hard by federal, which was down 15% year-over-year. But the enterprise segment of the U.S., and this is even Brian's team, did move from 15% growth in five quarters ago to 5% to zero, to 5% to plus 9%.","And what you're seeing as I alluded to earlier, a consistency of more large deals and more deals in the pipeline. That piece feels good. We are not seeing that growth and what we called our global accounts are top 24. They're largely financials. The financials are still spending very slow. So some of you are getting your indication of growth rates from the financials, you probably were surprised by how we grew this quarter, because that segment of market is continuing to stay a little bit tough.","In terms of, what I'd like to see, I'd like to see the enterprise continue and do it more consistently throughout the quarter. And then I'd like to see the commercial come up three or four points in terms of growth rates. If you see that stability of service provider, then candidly the numbers are almost always indicative of economic growth. You see it first in CapEx then you see it in job hiring.","Now, to your indirect question, we did see both in Q1 a push at the end of the quarter, which you always see with real strong sales force and we did see it again in Q4 of last year. So for the last two quarters, we closed hard. And, Rob, it's a world-class sales organization that really goes for every thing until we start our flow again the next month in the new quarter within that.","So it was a little bit more backend loaded for this quarter and the quarter before, but both of those numbers were good numbers than the last month or a month-and-a-half of the quarter. So I'd like to see it continue, but the balance was there, part of that market share, but the trend is what you got to watch. And we were probably gaining share earlier even when the trend was lower as well.","So we very much appreciate your alls kind words about growing it mid-single digits, when our peers are often shrinking to mid-single digits. But we think part of that share, but I think we're in the right market, the right time, and mainly our customers are changing how they buy. They're buying architectures and they're buying ability to help solve their solutions as opposed to pinpoint products.","If the decisions on architectures and solving solutions, our win rate is extremely high. If it's a pinpoint product and they quote the best price, then our win rate isn't as high. I know that's an indirect question, just answered, and I tried to answer it with an update if it helps you, but I think it's a wait and see one more quarter, before I feel as good as I'd like to on it.","Operator","Your next question comes from George Notter with Jefferies.","George Notter - Jefferies","I'd like to come back to the question on China and just spinning around a little bit. Are you guys seeing any positive impact globally from this renewed focus on security issues around Huawei, ZTE and Chinese suppliers? Obviously, countries like Australia, Canada, certainly the U.S., India have all kind of raised the issue, is there any market share capture you guys can get at the expense of the Chinese vendors and those kinds of places and elsewhere around the world?","John Chambers","We think we're doing very well on a global basis against all of our major competitors, almost without exception in the traditional networking and many of our related areas, and our competition still continues to be different competitors in each category. In terms of our opportunity, I think what you're seeing is with competitors like Huawei, we are getting very good at reminding people what they buy the company price point wise, isn't what they pay a year to two or three years later.","And if you want innovation and an open architecture there are some real challenges to go with that. And ability really to bring the world-class integration and the services and to help our customers achieve their goals, we're beginning to breakaway which is nicely the same, we're competing much more effectively against the company like Huawei than we were 12 to 18 months ago.","ZTE is not a major competitor, in fact I look at them as much as a partner and would be very open to expanding that relationship as appropriate towards. But I think what you're seeing is we're just executing well and more they are looking for a complete architectural play with security that we don't give your code to anybody, not even our own government or anything else, is an advantage for us and is consistency, which I think is very key overall. But I think we're ought to executing Huawei on many fronts at the same time and we are seeing that benefit.","Operator","Michael Genovese with MKM Partners, your line is open.","Michael Genovese - MKM Partners","John, through the fourth quarter in a row were the year-over-year order growth decelerated, but given the guidance, given the stabilization, given easier comps, would you, I don't know if you would care to comment on this, but do you think that we would see some order acceleration in terms of product order acceleration in the current quarter? And then, secondly on deferred revenues, it look historically not unusual to have a drop like this in the fiscal first quarter, but a big $300 million drop in deferred revenues, can you just comment on that please?","Frank Calderoni","You're correct, Michael. I mean it's not unusual to see that in the Q1 timeframe, primarily because of the strength that we on the services side in Q2 and Q4.","John Chambers","So a little bit longer answer to your questioned, Michael, but it is the last question, then there aren't any more in the queue, and we want you all to speed back in terms of did you like this format, in terms of being crisp on overall data and then spending most of our time on Q&As or would you like to see a little bit more data, given on the front end, and a little less time on Q&A. Mel, if you'll give us the feedback overall, I'd appreciate it.","Let me just give you some numbers, because when you get the numbers and you think about them, you'll understand the answer to your question. Bookings over the last five quarters had gone 13% five quarters ago, 7% growth four quarters ago, 4%, 2% and zero. And revenue, which you all have access to five quarters ago was 5% growth, 11%, 7% growth, 4% and 6%.","So clearly we're going to be on tough revenue quarters, the next two quarters in term of the comp. And just using next quarter as an example with 11% growth as your comparison, where you'll only average 6% for the year minus 11% will average 5%, and the growth rate that we're putting up there is clearly at an aggressive growth rate.","What I'll now watch is actual sequential orders. And so we know what our run rate of sequential orders would be at a bookings growth rate of 5%, we know what it would be at 3%, we know what it would be at 7%. And so we're watching quarter-to-quarter booking growth rates. You are seeing its billed backlog wherever possible that candidly is the best way to run it. You ship once you got orders for in terms of the direction.","And so it's a nice way of seeing that if the next quarter plays out, as we think it will, you'll begin to see the sequential growth. And we'll report on it in terms of orders sequentially is that in the range that indicates that we have not only bottomed out, but we are starting back up or not. But it's a sequential number that will give you the better indication of that or adjust your revenue numbers and have a consistency on revenue and look at the year-over-year revenue number or the year-over-year booking number with that sequence.","I think that summarizes pretty well. I just want to walk away with probably we are pleased with the quarter. It was clearly a very challenging market we're in. It was a very solid quarter and we thank you all for your support from the shareholders side. We are focused on giving you the best value for your investments and that should seen in almost everything we do.","We're getting good balance in our product directions. We are very open on the areas we must improve that are under our control. We are also very candid in areas like federal in Europe that are going to get tougher, before they get better. And we'd point out that we probably never had more new growth opportunities to go in and we'll talk about that more in a couple of months than we're seeing now.","You will see us continue to evolve our model, focusing on both gross margins, reoccurring revenue, software, services, et cetera, but that's a gradual process that you'll see going forward. And our major pressure, while it's always possible and by mathematics many people would say more than just possible, but our experience has been that once we really get focused on item, we're able to hold it very well and that's what we see on our gross margin. Our gross margin mix issue is one of mix as opposed to otherwise.","Bottomline, we're starting to become an IT player. It's an important aspirational goal for us to become the number one IT player. Time will tell we can do that or not, but we like what we're seeing in the market overall. Mel, with that let me turn it over to you.","Melissa Selcher","Thanks, John.

You may begin.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks, Shaun. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. ","By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. ","Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website.","Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and we will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise.

As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.","With that, I will now turn it over to Chuck.","Charles Robbins","Thank you, Marilyn and good afternoon, everyone. Our results this quarter demonstrated that we're delivering against our strategic priorities and realizing the benefits of our investments to transform our business and drive long term shareholder value. ","We delivered a solid quarter, with total revenue of $11.9 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.60. We had strong margins yet again and great operating cash flow, up 10%. We're managing the business well through a multiyear transformation of the company while remaining focused on delivering customers unparalleled value through highly secure, software-defined automated and intelligent infrastructure.","We're on a journey which as we consistently stated, will take a number of years, but we're pleased with the progress we're making. As our customers add billions of new connections in the years ahead, the network will become more critical than ever. They will be looking for intelligent networks that deliver automation, security and analytics that help them derive meaningful business value from these connections. These will be delivered through a combination of new platforms as well as software and subscription-based services which we've been focused on accelerating over the last 18 months.","My vision for this company is to be the most relevant and most important partner for our customers as they enable their digital businesses and we will deliver on that vision. I look forward to discussing this in a lot more detail at our Investor Day on June 28. ","We continue to innovate across our networking portfolio with analytics being a key element of this innovation. This quarter, we completed the acquisition of AppDynamics, enabling us to provide customers with unprecedented visibility across networking, data center, security and applications. As I talk to our customers and partners, I'm getting great feedback about the value of the insights AppDynamics provides to help them make informed business decisions. We're in the early stages of scaling out the AppDynamics solutions through the Cisco Salesforce and partner ecosystem and I'm excited about the future of this space. ","We were also pleased to announce our intent to acquire some new additions to our software and analytics portfolio. Software-defined WAN is a critical market transition and addresses the evolving customer demands and branch routing as a foundational block of executing in cloud networking.","Viptela, combined with Cisco's IWAN technology, will provide an industry-leading cloud-first SD WAN platform that addresses the Edge networking needs of our most demanding customers. ","MindMeld provides an AI platform to build intelligent and humanlike conversational interfaces for any application or device and will complement our already strong collaboration portfolio. These acquisitions support our goal of offering customers extraordinary value through a combination of organic and inorganic innovation and they are aligned to our strategy of investing to drive longer term growth and helping us transition to more recurring software and subscription revenue.","We will continue to deploy our capital resources to give us first-mover advantage as we extend our technology portfolio. In addition to our inorganic growth, we're seeing strong organic growth of our next-generation products and solutions in both networking and security. ","Now let me share some business highlights, starting with our security business which has never been more relevant, as we've seen in recent days. Last week's WannaCry ransomware attack was another example of the devastating impact cybercrime can inflict on individuals, companies and countries around the world. Since Friday's attack, our Talos cyber threat intelligence team has been working around-the-clock to dissect the WannaCry ransomware, understand its attack patterns and keep our customers protected. It's important that the tech industry and customers work together to defend against these attacks from cyber criminals. We will continue to do everything we can to help our customers anticipate, prevent and protect themselves from any future attack by harnessing the intelligence of the network and the power of our security portfolio.","Our security business delivered another solid quarter with 9% revenue growth and 39% deferred revenue growth, reflecting our combination of best-of-breed solutions, together with the industry's broadest security portfolio and a highly effective end-to-end security architecture. ","We continue to lead in network security. Our next-generation firewall portfolio grew 49% with 6,000 new customers in the quarter, bringing our total customer base to over 73,000. ","We expanded our portfolio with the announcement of our Firepower 2100 Series which offers both performance and protection for mission-critical applications. ","Our Advanced threat portfolio continues to deliver strong revenue growth of over 30% and we added 6,600 new customers, bringing the total number of AMP customers to over 35,000.","Now let's turn to collaboration. In January, we introduced Cisco's Spark Board, the first all-in-one cloud-based collaboration and meeting room solution. We've seen good early traction with this SaaS-based service, with nearly 700 customers adopting this solution in the quarter. This is a great example of the transition I mentioned earlier focused on moving from standalone systems to best-of-breed products, combined with software subscriptions. ","Our intended acquisition of MindMeld will help us simplify and enhance the collaboration experience even further through the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning. As chat and voice quickly become the interfaces of choice, MindMeld's AI technology will enable Cisco to deliver unique experiences throughout its portfolio. This acquisition will power new conversational interfaces for Cisco's collaboration products, revolutionizing how users will interact with our technology while increasing ease-of-use and enabling new capabilities. For example, users will be able to interact with Cisco Spark via Natural Language Commands, providing an experience that is highly customized to the user and their work. ","In our data center switching business, we now have a combined install base of over 20,000 customers, who are using our portfolio to help them build, run and manage their private and hybrid cloud environments. ","Our ACI portfolio grew 42%, as customers moved to 100-gig and look to automate the network and increase network performance, visibility and security. We added almost 1,200 new Nexus 9K customers in the quarter, bringing the total installed base to 12,000.","Our APIC adoption continues to increase rapidly with over 380 new ACI customers in Q3, bringing our total to nearly 3,500. ","Before I turn it over to Kelly, let me reiterate a few key points. I'm pleased with the progress we're making. As I've consistently stated, this transition will take time, but we're remaking this company to succeed in a dramatically changing marketplace. We're laser-focused on delivering innovation as well as aggressively managing the business to optimize profitability, cash flows and value for our shareholders. Kelly?","Kelly Kramer","Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter followed by the Q4 outlook. Q3 was a solid quarter with financial results consistent with our expectations. We executed well, driving solid profitability, strong cash flow and we continued to deliver on our strategic growth priorities.","Total revenue was $11.9 billion, down 1%. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.60, up 5% and operating cash flow grew 10% to $3.4 billion. We generated 31% of our total revenue from recurring offers, up from 29% a year ago. We continue to be extremely focused on driving margins and profitability, increasing our non-GAAP operating margin to 32.3%, up 2.3 points. ","Before I go through Q3 in more detail, I want to remind you that Q3 last year included an extra week, it resulted in higher revenue in that quarter of $265 million, $200 million of which was in Services and $65 million from our SaaS businesses like WebEx and some from product distributions. We also had higher non-GAAP cost of sales and operating expenses of $150 million. This netted to $115 million of higher non-GAAP operating income last year.","So onto this quarter. Total product revenue was flat year-over-year. I'll walk through each of the product areas. Switching grew 2%, with solid growth in data center switching, driven by ongoing strength in the ACI portfolio which was up 42%. We also saw a slight positive growth in our campus business. ","Routing was down 2%, driven primarily by weakness in mobile packet core. Collaboration was down 4%, but adjusting for the extra week last year, it was down 2%. The drivers are primarily a decline in Unified Communications' endpoints, partially offset by continued growth in WebEx. Deferred revenue grew 10%. Data center declined 5% with the continued market shift from blade to rack. However, we're seeing solid traction with our hyperconverged offering, HyperFlex.","This quarter, we also further extended our innovations in UCS with new converged solutions for IBM versus stack and with our strategic alliance with Docker to deliver containerized applications. Wireless grew 13% with strong Meraki performance as well as the ramp of our 11 AC Wave 2 portfolio. We continue to innovate with the launch in the quarter of new wireless networking solutions, including a new Wave 2 access point and a wireless controller.","Security was up 9% with strong performance in unified threat management, with growth of approximately 50% as well as growth of over 30% in both advanced threat and web security. Deferred revenue grew 39%, demonstrating the value of our solutions and ongoing delivery of innovation.Services was down 2%. Normalized for the extra week, it grew 4%. We're continuing to focus on renewals and attach rates. ","We drove good growth in deferred revenue which was 13% in total, with product up 26% and services up 7%. Deferred products revenue from our recurring software and subscription businesses was up 57% to $4.4 billion which includes the acquisition of AppDynamics during the Quarter. Excluding AppDynamics, the increase was 51%. In terms of orders, total product orders declined 4%. ","Looking at our geographies which is a primary way we run the business, Americas was down 4%, EMEA was down 6% and APJC grew 2%. Total emerging markets declined 12%, with the BRICS plus Mexico down 10%. In our customer segments, Enterprise declined 2%, Commercial grew 1%, Public Sector was down 4% and Service Provider declined 10%. ","From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total gross margin was 64.4%, down by 0.8 points. In Q3 '16, the extra week resulted in a 0.5 point benefit in that quarter. So adjusting for that, total gross margin decreased 0.3 points.In Q3 '17, our Product gross margin was 63.2%, down 1.3 points and Service gross margin was 67.8%, growing 0.7 points. We increased our operating margin by 2.3 points to 32.3% from a year ago. ","In terms of the bottom line, we grew non-GAAP EPS 5% to $0.60, while GAAP EPS was $0.50. We ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $68.0 billion, with $2.9 billion available in the U.S. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned approximately $2 billion to our shareholders during the quarter that included $0.5 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend, reflecting the 12% increase we announced last quarter. To summarize, Q3 was a solid quarter and we executed well. We're focused on driving operational efficiencies and profitability, enabling us to make the strategic investments to drive long term shareholder value. ","Let me reiterate our guidance for the fourth quarter. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We expect revenue in the range of minus 4% to minus 6% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29.5% to 30.5% and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.60 to $0.62. ","I'll now turn it back to Chuck for some closing comments.","Charles Robbins","Thanks, Kelly and thanks again to all of you for joining us today. As I mentioned earlier, we delivered another solid quarter and we're executing well. We're confident in our strategy for long term growth and profitability. We believe that the network will become increasingly important in solving our customers' most complex business problems and helping them get secure and stay secure. ","We also believe that we will continue to see strong momentum in our shift towards more software and subscription revenue. This reflects the success of the investments we're making in this area -- in these areas, together with the flexible consumption and buying models we're offering our customers. ","Marilyn and I'll turn it back to you for questions.","Marilyn Mora","Great. Thanks, Chuck. Shaun, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. [Operator Instructions].","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Q - Mark Moskowitz","I wanted to see if we could understand more of the guidance, Kelly and Chuck. The revenues are little lighter than we had anticipated. Is that a function of macro factors? Or is that a function more of the shift to the subscription model or maybe there's going to be some disturbance here and there. Clearly, the deferred revenue -- product revenue growth is quite nice, but I was just wondering if there's any sort of puts and takes you could walk us through there. I really appreciate it.","A - Charles Robbins","Kelly, why don't you take him through the bridge and then I'll just make some comments?","A - Kelly Kramer","Sure. So Mark, when we look at guidance, it's a combination of many factors, right? It starts with our backlog and then orders on them, the funnel. And then yes, definitely, we take into account our transition to more software and subscriptions and how that's impacting it. So when I look at the guidance we just gave, our orders were a little weaker in Q3 which does mean that I'm starting with the lower backlog than anticipated. And then when I'm assuming, when I look at the order strength, we're assuming what we saw in Q3 continues on in Q4. So just to give some color around that.","Where we had -- we have been facing headwinds all quarter long with SP and emerging. We saw them get worse this quarter that you saw in the numbers there. I'm expecting that to continue. And then we saw some new kind of macro issues in the areas like Public Sector and the U.S. Fed space and things like that. So I'm assuming that orders in line that we saw in Q3 is going to continue on in Q4. And then finally, we're seeing an impact because you're seeing it go to the balance sheet of this transition that we're just accelerating through to the tune of 1.5 to 2 points. So the combination of those 3 things are driving the guidance into that minus-4 to minus-6 range.","A - Charles Robbins","Yes, just -- Mark, a couple of comments on what Kelly just described. I mean, the Public Sector business, particularly in the United States, the federal business is, frankly, it's about 1 point of that guide. It's a pretty significant stall right now with the lack of budget visibility. And when you think about the strategy that we're deploying, the 57% growth in the software and subscription business, if you just go back 8 quarters ago, we had $2 billion on our balance sheet relative to software and subscription. And the first 2 or 3 quarters, we were convincing the teams that, that was the shift we were going to make. And now we have more than doubled that to $4.4 billion and the growth there is accelerating. So we're very pleased with that transition. And at the same time we deal with all of these challenges, we're also, -- we remain very committed to earnings. We remain very committed to our capital return strategy.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer.","Q - Ittai Kidron","Chuck, I'm going to take a U-turn this time, actually not ask you about the data center business but rather focus a little bit more on the gross margins. Some of the commentary in your press release talked about some pricing pressures. If you could give us a little bit more color on the guidance and your gross margin assumption into the guidance, how much of that is mix-related and how much of that is pricing? And if -- any color you could give on the pricing, how much is competitive versus, I don't know, product shifts or something like that, that'll be great.","A - Charles Robbins","Thanks, Ittai. So Kelly, let's have the same strategy. You want to go through the math on this and then...","A - Kelly Kramer","So Ittai, when we look at the drivers of our growth margin, price in Q3 actually has been in the same range that it was pretty much last year as well as last quarter in terms of the price index that we're seeing. So that's in the same range. Again, it's high, but it's in the range. It's not increasing. I would say in terms of the guidance for Q4, we're assuming that. We're also making sure the teams are being very aggressive where they need to be aggressive in areas and then against competitors where we need to be. But overall, the pricing hasn't changed dramatically besides the normal erosion that we see in churned business lines. I'd say, in terms of mix, that hasn't dramatically changed as well, with switching being positive this quarter, that helped a lot.","And again, well, the mix isn't changing. There's mix changes with MBEs in the guidance going forward but it's nothing dramatic. So I'd say we feel good about being able to continue driving the margins that we have. The only other piece I'll comment on, because we mentioned it before, we're still seeing some cost pressure from the increase in DRAM pricing that was got baked in both our Q3 as well as into Q4. But we've been doing a lot of work and our supply chain team has done working with our suppliers to make sure we can secure our forward supply at prices that we can plan on. So I think we've pretty much got that boxed in for the guidance.","Operator","Next question is coming from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley.","Q - James Faucette","Just a couple of quick follow-up questions to some of the comments that have already been made. Can you talk a little bit about the orders and you mentioned that fed was weak. But when you look at the other areas of weakness, can you talk about, like, what's driving those, et cetera? And I guess, more long term, it continues to be a good deferred revenue growth and you mentioned the security. What are the priorities that your customers are showing in the security space generally? And what are you able to address now versus where are the things that they're asking for that you think you need to improve on?","A - Charles Robbins","Great. Thanks, James. And so we have some order color and then securities. So let me take the order stuff and then, Kelly, chime in as you'd like. So if we just go around -- sort of go around the globe, let me just highlight what we saw. And I'm just going to tell you what drove the weakness in these areas so you can assume the other pieces of the business were pretty much as expected. In the Americas, it was primarily the U.S. federal -- I mean, there's so much uncertainty around budgets. The U.S. federal business was a significant driver. Mexico, there has been a lot of uncertainty in Mexico and that was actually down 49% for us year-over-year. So it was -- there's a great deal of uncertainty around the investment landscape there. And then the third element would have been the Service Provider business in the Americas. So those were the things that really drove the orders in the U.S. In Europe, the U.K., the currency issue in the U.K. is real and was very impactful in that business. And then we continue to see pressure in the Middle East relative to oil prices.","We also -- obviously, there's been a lot of uncertainty around the geopolitical dynamics, some of which have been clarified recently, obviously. And we did see some strength in some countries there, but the U.K. is a big country for us. And the Middle East, obviously, with the uncertainty around oil prices, continues to be a little bit of a pressure as well. In APJC, we saw Japan and Australia were reasonable. India was solid again. And China, we had tough comps from the SP Video business from a year ago that we talked about. So that's really what we saw from an orders perspective. I think if you look at customer segments, just to give you some color, Enterprise, the challenge was largely driven by Europe. Commercial, the lightness there was driven by Europe. Public Sector, as I said, was U.S. Federal and SP was fairly consistent. So Kelly, any other comments on that?","A - Kelly Kramer","Yes.","A - Charles Robbins","Just quickly on the securities, since you snuck that one in, too, James. The -- what our customers -- what we see happening in security right now is that as our customers prepare for the next few years and literally adding billions of new connections, we obviously believe that the network is going to become even more relevant than it ever has been. And our customers are going to need -- to deal with that scale, they're going to need significant automation. They're going to need greater insights coming out of their technology infrastructure like the network through analytics. They're going to need security embedded at the network layer because you're going to have to begin to secure the infrastructure the minute these packets hit the wire.","So what they're looking for is -- they are looking for an end-to-end architecture now for dealing with security. They're looking for an open architecture that actually allows them to buy the best-of-breed technology which we have across many elements of what they're trying to do. But they are looking for an architecture and they're looking for -- to leverage as much of that from the cloud and which correspondingly turns into the subscription business, as you pointed out. So that's what we see happening there. There's obviously lots of other areas within that architecture that we don't play today where we could and we continue to assess all of those opportunities.","Operator","The next question is coming from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. The next question on queue, coming from Simon Jankowski of Goldman Sachs.","Q - Simona Jankowski","It's Simona Jankowski. Just a couple of follow-ups. First, if you can clarify in terms of the weakness you saw incrementally in the Service Provider and emerging market theaters. How much of that was related to competition or pricing pressure such as from Huawei versus some of the macro factors you discussed? And then just a quick follow-up on how did your cloud business do this quarter.","A - Charles Robbins","So let me comment on the first one and then, Kelly, maybe you can talk about the cloud business and how we -- I'll talk about both of them but then how we measure that specifically. So the weakness in emerging and SP, I would say, in emerging, I would say it's less. We clearly -- we've been -- we've had competition from several vendors. And clearly, Huawei is a very strong competitor. I don't feel like it has increased significantly in the emerging countries. It's been pretty consistent there and our teams know how to compete and we continue to evolve our strategy and bring different tools to help them compete. So I don't -- I wouldn't say that had much to do with it. I think on our overarching cloud business, Simona, we look at that in many, many different ways. So we look at, obviously, our private cloud business which is made up of the UCS business as well as our data center switching portfolio which we talked about earlier.","Both of those, the UCS business was down 5, as you saw. And then the -- obviously, our next-generation switching portfolio continues to do well, the ACI elements up 42%. And if you're asking about the MSDC guys which are the web scale cloud guys, it's the same as we were last quarter. These -- we have -- we're engaging with them on an individual basis. We look at the big ones as, frankly, markets of one. We have made great progress with a few of them. Others we're in the early stages and we have codevelopment opportunities. But I would tell you, we're in very deep discussions with most all of them and we're looking at very strategic partnerships that scale beyond even just selling infrastructure to them in many cases. So I'm not sure where you're going with cloud. Hopefully one of those answers cover what you're looking for.","Operator","Next question on queue is coming from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo. You may now begin. Your next on queue is coming from Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse Securities. Your line is open, you may now begin.","Q - Kulbinder Garcha","For Chuck maybe. On the revenue side, I take your points on the macro economy and the weakness in emerging markets.","A - Charles Robbins","Kulbinder, could you just speak up just a hair, buddy?","Q - Kulbinder Garcha","My question is on revenue growth, I think the drivers of the weak guidance you're talking about. I guess, the broader question is how important is getting this company back to growth? It looks like last year, you did grow. This year, you're probably not going to grow very much, i.e. especially organically. So is there something more transformative have to happen on the M&A front? Do you think this is temporary in nature? I know you're having this headwind of this business transformation, but just the importance of revenue growth to Cisco as a company, if you could comment on that for the long term.","A - Charles Robbins","Yes, Kulbinder, I think that -- when we look to the future right now and you really think about the number of new connections that are going to be added, that our customers will be adding over the coming years and the need for automation, the need for analytics and security, what we have done and it'll be done -- our solutions that we'll bringing in the space with a combination, to your point, of inorganic capabilities, as we have shown our ability to do, as well as some organic innovation. I've talked to several of you over the last few quarters about the fact that we went in and reallocated a fair amount of our R&D expense last year and over last 18 months. ","And many of those solutions are targeting these next-generation networks that our customers are going to need to build out to support this new infrastructure. And with a high degree of automation across the network, with a high degree of analytics, with distributed compute capabilities for processing the data at the Edge as well as the security piece. So we have future innovation that will come in that space. We'll also use a combination of inorganic options where we need it. And we believe that as we get into the next generation of the networks that the customers need to build out, that we will be very successful with our capabilities.","Operator","The next question is from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo, you may now begin.","Q - Jess Lubert","I was hoping you could provide a little more detail regarding the order weakness you're flagging in the North American service provider vertical. Last quarter, if I remember correctly, you suggested orders there were improving a little bit. So I just want to understand the change. To what degree it's a technology issue versus a macro issue, the duration, you think, that's likely to be weak for and if there's if any areas within the vertical that are better or worse, that would be helpful.","A - Charles Robbins","Let me just give you a couple of comments and then Kelly can give us any specifics. As I said 2 quarters back, I think, when we had the negative 10% growth or 12% or whatever it was, 12%, I think.","A - Kelly Kramer","Yes, [indiscernible].","A - Charles Robbins","This -- Our entire SP business around the world is driven by very large customers. And so when some number of them have an off quarter, it can affect the business. And I think the Americas would be probably an example of that this quarter as well. And the Mexico business that I discussed is heavily influenced by service providers. And so that's a bit of what we've seen. We had some customers in the U.S. that were performed very well this quarter for us and others that did not. Kelly, any comment on the numbers?","A - Kelly Kramer","Yes. No, I'd say, I think you hit on it. I think with the Americas being down so much, it was a combination of Mexico. Again, these are big customers and that was down. Chuck already mentioned Mexico was down 49%. It was a huge chunk of that was in the SP. And then in the U.S., the service providers, that was modestly down, not dramatic at all. Again and that is, again, we had a lot of customers that were up and a lot that were down, so balanced overall.","Operator","The next question is coming from Pierre Ferragu of Sanford C. Bernstein Company.","Q - Pierre Ferragu","I was wondering, Kelly and Chuck, if how much we should read in the weak guide you gave us against at least expectations we had on The Street. Is there a change we should expect in your seasonality pattern as you're going to watch more subscription services like natural, like trends of the first quarter that we've seen in the past? Is that something that we should see or we should expect to see changing over time?","A - Charles Robbins","Yes, I'll make a comment and let Kelly answer the seasonality portion of it. But clearly, the transition to the software and subscription business obviously impacts how to think about guidance going forward. And when you -- when we see particularly large quarters with high growth like we saw this quarter, I think it will have an impact. I'm not sure exactly how we look at what it means seasonally. Kelly?","A - Kelly Kramer","Yes, I mean, I do think that the models that we've looked at, tried and true over the years, where we could look at normal sequential from Q3 and Q4, I think those models are changing because we're accelerating what is -- we're putting more on the balance sheet than what is amortizing off. While we're part of our revenue guide takes into account the growth of what's coming from our recurring offers, we're still adding so much more because we're adding more and more offers every day.","So I do think it is changing a bit. I think we'll talk about this a bit more when we get to our Analyst conference in June as well. But we'll give you clarity of how we can continue to model that. We certainly saw the big chunk of our business that's driven by the core orders in the book and ship, because we still have a lot of our business that we haven't transitioned yet, but as we drive more and more of that, I do think it's going to have to change how we've modeled in the past as an analyst, right? And we'll give you the clarity to help that.","Operator","Next question is coming from the line of Steve Milunovich of UBS Securities.","Q - Steven Milunovich","Kelly, can you give us any guidance by product segment for next quarter? For example, Services, I assume, will be up again. So in terms of kind of the deceleration of the downside, where will we see that? Will Switching likely be down, Routing be down more kind of in terms of things getting a bit worse? Where do you think we'll see that?","A - Kelly Kramer","Yes, I mean, again, Steve, that we -- because so much of our core business is still very much related to the orders that we have yet to book, our backlog accounts were less than 1\/3. And so much of our quarter comes from the order yet to come. We don't give guidance by business unit. But directionally, I think you're thinking about it the right way, right? I mean, I think last quarter, we tried to guide, when we were talking about Routing. We knew we had strong orders a quarter ago in Routing which is why it wasn't as bad as it had been in the quarter before this quarter on revenue. So again, it takes into account all of that. I do think, as you know, our Switching business is very fluid, so I don't think you should assume that, that is going to continue to be -- that goes up and down, so I don't think you should draw a trend having that being positive this quarter. So I think it's very fluid within business units.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Rod Hall of JPMorgan.","Q - Roderick Hall","I just wanted to see if you could comment a little bit on the 31% recurring revenue. Maybe help us understand how much of that is SMARTnet and maintenance-type services and how much is, let's call it, next-gen recurring revenue. And so that -- and I also would like it, if you could comment, I know the carrier situation in the U.S. is pretty weak and we've seen that across other companies as well. But could you comment on specific projects like the Metro Optical buildout? Is that still a bright spot? Do you still see that project moving ahead as expected?","A - Kelly Kramer","Sure. I'll hit the first one. So yes, if I break out the 31%, so the way to think about it, Rod, is basically, 90% of my services revenue is recurring, okay? So of the 31%, 75% of that dollar amount, so the $3.6 billion -- over $3.6 billion, 75% of that comes from the Services business. On the product side, 10% of my product revenue is now coming from recurring, so that's over $900 million. So 25% of that over $3.6 billion. And so again, I think that Services has continued to be in that 90% range. And again, what we're really trying to drive is more and more of those offers on the product side.","A - Charles Robbins","Yes and Rod, this is Chuck. Like 6 quarters ago, the product number, I think, was 6%, so we have made progress and we'll continue to, as we see the amount of business that we're putting on the balance sheet is accelerating. On your second question, we absolutely continue to see the projects like Metro Optical moving forward. We've actually continued to do well in some of the next-generation areas that we're working with many of the U.S. service providers. So we see that going well and we do believe that as they make some of these transitions, we're going to be right in the middle of them with them.","Operator","The next question is coming from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank.","Q - Vijay Bhagavath","I mean, Chuck, I'm just a research analyst. I've noticed you're using AI machine learning quite a bit more recently. So like to get your idea, Chuck and also, Kelly, if you could, in terms of which might be the product areas within Cisco where you're apply AI machine learning to the max initially, where you see kind of low-hanging fruit, immediate kind of business outcomes from AI machine learning. Would it be in which parts of the portfolio?","A - Charles Robbins","Thanks, Vijay. Yes, it's -- your point is actually quite accurate that we look at how we use it -- both of those as tools across our entire portfolio. And I would tell you that there are initiatives underway and there are active solutions already in the marketplace that have elements of that. In our security portfolio, there are absolutely elements of the that, that are in our collaboration portfolio already. We see lots of opportunities when you start talking about automation and analytics and things like network assurance, capabilities or in service provider, self-healing networks. So we see the opportunity across everything we do and we have initiatives both already working with customers as well as a lot of work going on inside the business units to leverage AI machine learning and other technologies going forward.","Operator","The next question is from Paul Silverstein of Cowen and Company.","Q - Paul Silverstein","I'm hoping for a clarification on certain issues. One, going back to the earlier question on pricing. Kelly, did I hear you say that pricing was relatively stable? And can you give us some granularity in terms of what you're seeing in Europe Switching and Routing in terms of pricing? And just very quickly, 2 quarters ago, you quantified the impact of the shift to recurring revenue model. I think you'd cited 100- to 200-plus basis point adverse impact. Can you give us quantification of that impact this quarter?","A - Kelly Kramer","Sure. So on the pricing, yes, just to give you the clarification of the pricing and I'll pull up actually between Europe here, so just give me a second. But so to clarify, so we do have normal price erosion every period for, mostly, in our switching and routing portfolio, those are the ones that are most sensitive to it. It's been in the same consistent percentage in terms of price reduction year-over-year that it has been both last quarter, a year ago and so in the last -- we had one favorable quarter where we had some favorability for some rebates, but overall, it's been in the same range. But it hasn't gotten worse. I'll pull up about -- I'll try to pull up here as I'm answering the second question, any difference between Europe and the Americas. But I think it's fairly consistent across the regions. The second clarification was on -- what was it, Marilyn?","A - Charles Robbins","On the impact of the recurring business.","A - Kelly Kramer","Yes. Yes, so I have been saying it's in the 1 to 2 range. It is definitely pushing closer to the 2% range at this point. I mean, I think, it's clearly driven. We share with you the balance and that's accelerating and I certainly look at the short term portion of that and try to quarterize that together with it. But it's definitely -- it's pointing to the 2% more than the 1%. And Paul, I'll get back to you on that -- if there's any difference between Americas and Europe on that.","Operator","Next question is from Tal Liani of Bank of America.","Q - Tal Liani","If my numbers are correct, your recurring revenues grew 6% year-over-year and it was 14% the previous quarters. And I'm trying to see what could cause reacceleration. The question I have is whether you focus the recurring part mostly on new types of businesses, such as security and others or you can find ways to go back to Switching and Routing and change either pricing scheme or add features or do something such that recurring revenues outside of maintenance, of course, recurring revenues grow and you can add software features on top will do that. The question is whether the customers will accept it or is this is going to be a traditional business model forever?","A - Charles Robbins","Yes, Tal, thanks for the question. So even in our current deferred revenue from Software and Subscription, there are elements of our core portfolio that are included in that $4.4 billion that you saw primarily through our Cisco ONE offerings that we put together. Probably 18 months ago, we started that journey and we got those offers and they began to ramp. But we also are looking -- obviously, security is ramping. Collaboration has been the one probably the longest in this model. But we do believe that across the portfolio, with future offers, we have the opportunity to do that and you'll see that as we deliver on some of the new capabilities. Kelly, any commentary on the...","A - Kelly Kramer","Yes, on the slowdown, so Tal, we're actually not slowing down. The reason it looks like it's slowing down is for the Services piece, we do have the extra week compare. So if you adjust for that, it's up double digits in total. And if I look at just product, the growth of product which I said is over $900 million, that's growing 34% year-over-year and it was 30% last quarter. So that continues to grow faster.","A - Marilyn Mora","I believe that was our last question. Chuck, maybe I'll turn it to you for over for final words.","End of Q&A","Charles Robbins","Yes, so first of all, I want to thank all of you for joining the call today. I wanted to just take a minute and reiterate that I believe that our strategy is working and I'm really -- I'm optimistic about where we're going to go over the next 3 to 5 years. We set out 18 months ago to transition the business to one of more software and subscription. At the time, 8 quarters ago, it was $2 billion on our balance sheet. Today, we've more than doubled that, up 57% this quarter to $4.4 billion and accelerating. So I believe that is working and we'll continue to shift more and more of our offers into that space. We also, obviously, wanted to be very clear about the areas that we needed to invest in and you've seen significant investments in security and collaboration over the years. ","About 15 months ago, we made obvious reallocations of expenses more towards the core and you're going to see future innovation in that space as well. Our customers really are going to be adding billions of connections in the future and they are going to need a next-generation network with security automation and analytics. And so we're transitioning the business model. We're transitioning the network offers that we're going to deliver to our customers as they move into this next generation. And at the same time, we're leveraging our capability to do inorganic as well as organic innovation to make that happen. And in the midst of all this change, we remain very committed to our execution model and ensuring that we're focused on profitability as well as capital returns to our shareholders. So that's a summary of where I think we're right now and I wanted to thank all of you for spending time with us today. Thanks.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks, Chuck and I'll go ahead and close it up here.

At the request of Cisco Systems, today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect.","Now, I will like to introduce Melissa Selcher, Senior Director, Analyst and Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Melissa Selcher","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our 96th quarterly conference call. This is Melissa Selcher, and I am joined by John Chambers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Frank Calderoni, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Rob Lloyd, President of Development and Sales and Gary Moore, President and Chief Operating Officer.","I would like to remind you that we have a corresponding webcast with slides on our website in the Investor Relations section. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, and cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the Investor Relations website. Click on the Financial Reporting section of the website to access these documents.","Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both, GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements and as such are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","Unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-on-year basis unless stated otherwise.","I will now turn it over to John for his commentary on the quarter.","John Chambers","Mel, Thank you very much. In Q2 FY'14, Cisco delivered record non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.47 and revenues of $11.2 billion, down 8% year-over-year. The market and the dynamics in our business played out largely as we described in our last quarterly conference call. We saw the impact for emerging markets, service provider and high-end product transitions in our business as we discussed last quarter. I will provide more detail in the business update.","As we navigate these economic and product cycles, we are managing our business to deliver shareholder value. In this quarter, we returned a record $4.9 billion to shareholders through dividends of approximately $900 million and $4 billion in share buyback.","We managed non-operating expenses, reducing them in the high single digits year-over-year and Gary, Frank, really nice job on that. We built backlog just as we said we would. We believe this strategy that has enabled us to emerge stronger from every previous cycle remained solid.","We capitalize on the major market transitions, we partner with our customers to deliver innovation and solutions that fuel their business. In our view this next wave of the Internet, the Internet of Everything will encompass every technology transition we are seeing in the market today.","With the network squarely at the center, we are building the platform for the Internet of Everything with scale and security to address the unparalleled complex the requirements. We plan to continue to disrupt the market and disrupt ourselves to deliver the value and solutions our customers require.","Last year, we introduced entirely new approaches to networking, designed around future proofing the best customers are making today and enabling them to harness the benefit of Internet of Everything.","As we capitalize on these transitions, I would like to summarize the dynamics of our business in the following five points. First, the Internet of Everything has moved from an interesting concept to a business imperative driving opportunities across every major vertical. It was the central conversations at the Consumer Electronics Show and the World Economic Forum, the last couple months with CEOs, industry and country leaders globally. Anyone walking away from these events should characterize this year as the tipping point.","Second, we continue our strength in U.S. enterprise and U.S. commercial as we said we would at last quarter's conference call, with year-over-year orders up 13% in U.S. enterprise and 10% in U.S. commercial. While we face SDN, white label servers and public cloud solutions to this market we see our ability to deliver architectures and cost portfolio solutions with scale, security and CapEx and OpEx savings as a driver of our success in this market.","Third, we are managing through the economic and product cycles, just as we outlined at the last call. Emerging market orders declined 3% year-over-year as compared to last quarter's down 12% with the BRIC, Mexico down 10% this quarter. SP orders declined 12% and product transitions in core routing and switching contributing to double-digit revenue declines. As we move to reaccelerate growth across the businesses, we remain focused on managing the levers to deliver value to our shareholders, while making the investments to position Cisco for the long-term.","Fourth, we believe our focus on architectures is really paying off. As the pace and complexity of IT increases, Cisco's ability to bring together technologies, servers and solution across silos should continue to drive differentiation, preference and, over time, gross margins. Point players will be faster at times, but I believe you will see our advantage in delivering integrated architectures at scale win in the end.","Fifth, we said last quarter that our goal is to build product backlog and we exited Q2 with book-to-bill greater than one. We are pleased with our progress managing through the cycles in our market and our business and as such wanted to give you an update on our Q3 revenue guidance before Frank details guidance later. That allows you to help frame the rest of the discussion in this call.","For Q3, we expect revenue to decline in the range of down 6% to down 8%. As we execute on our plan to return to growth over the next several quarters, subject to all the appropriate caveats discussed during this call, we also plan to continue to build backlog. There is no question that we have moved from a compute centric to a network-centric model for IT. Cisco is building the simple, smart and highly secure solutions that will enable our customers to capitalize on the cost efficiencies, agility and growth opportunities that lie ahead.","Our approach is unique. It starts with the central role the network, which is the only place to connect everything, people, process, data and things. Our transition is from selling boxes like most of our peers to selling business outcomes. Our delivery is through architectures, partners and services and we will help our customers utilize their 180 billion Cisco install base to capture the most value today and build for tomorrow.","As we move into this next era of the Internet with our customers, our commitment to you is to invest to sustain our industry leadership position while balancing the evolution in our business and a very strong focus on shareholder return.","Frank, at this time, I would like to turn it over to you.","Frank Calderoni","Thank you, John. In Q2 FY '14, our business performed as we expected. We continue to manage through the transitions in our business and challenges we outlined in our last earnings call.","From a top and bottom line perspective, total revenue was $11.2 billion, down 8%, non-GAAP net income was $2.5 billion and non-GAAP EPS was $0.47 per share down 8% year-on-year. Our GAAP net income was $1.4 billion and GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis were $0.27. Product revenue declined 11% and service revenue increased 3% with product book-to-billed greater than one. Overall non-GAAP operating margin was 27.8%.","In Q2 our total non-GAAP gross margin was 61.3% within our expectations of 61% to 62%. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 58.8%. As our overall volume of business was down this quarter, it negatively impacted our non-GAAP product gross margins in several ways.","First, we have less leverage in our cost structure. We did not get the full benefit of cost efficiencies at the lower volumes. Second, as our volumes in higher margin core products were lower, we saw an unfavorable mix impact toward lower margin products such as SP video and servers. Third, while the impact from pricing was consistent with prior quarters, it was at the higher end of the historical range in Q2. As we improve business volume, we expect it will balance the drivers of our product gross margins.","Our non-operating expenses were $3.7 billion or 33.5% as a percentage of revenue that's compared to 34.1% in Q2 of FY'13. Our headcount decreased by approximately 1,000 from the end of the fiscal year to 74,065. Our expenses benefited from reduced variable compensation expense as a result of our lower financial performance and efficiencies associated with our recent workforce rebalancing.","GAAP net income for the second quarter fiscal 2014, included a pretax charge of $655 million related to the expected cost of remediation of issues with memory components in certain products sold in prior fiscal years.","The charges related to the expected remediation cost for certain products containing memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010. These components have been determined to have the potential to sell due to a design or manufacturing defect.","These are widely used across the industry and are included in the number of Cisco's products. Although the majority of these products are beyond Cisco's warranty terms and the failure rates are low, Cisco is proactively working with customers on mitigation. This results in a charge to product cost of sales during the second quarter fiscal 2014. This charge has been excluded from non-GAAP results as Cisco does not believe is a reflective of ongoing business and operating results.","Total cash, cash equivalents and investments were $47.1 billion, including $3.3 billion available in the U.S. at the end of the quarter. We generated operating cash flows of $2.9 billion during the quarter.","We continue to drive our capital allocation strategy. As you recall, in Q4 FY'12, we committed to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually through dividends and share repurchases. In FY'13, we returned over 50% of free cash flow and I am pleased that in the first half of FY'14, we have returned in excess of the 150% of free cash flow to our shareholders comprised of $6 billion of share repurchases and $1.8 billion a dividend.","In Q2, we returned $4.9 billion to shareholders, a quarterly record for Cisco. This included $4 billion to share repurchase and approximately $900 million through our quarterly dividend. Our diluted share count decreased by approximately 100 million shares, driven by these repurchases. We expect the remaining impact of the Q2 share repurchase to further reduce share count next quarter.","In addition, today, our board approved an increase of $0.02 to the quarterly dividend to $0.19 per share an approximate 12% increase, representing a yield of approximately 3.3%. This dividend increase, combined with the anticipated share repurchases in the second half of the fiscal year, would comfortably exceed a return of over 100% for the full fiscal year of our free cash flow.","In Q3, we anticipate incurring additional debt to refinance our maturing bonds and enhance our domestic cash balances to support our ongoing commitment of returning cash to shareholders.","John, I would turn it back over you.","John Chambers","Thank you, Frank. I will now provide some additional detail on our Q2 performance and trends we are seeing in our business and in the market. I will start with an update on the three economic and product cycles we outlined in our last call.","First, we saw emerging orders declined 3% year-over-year compared to the 12% decline in Q1, with the BRICS [plus] Mexico down 10% as I said earlier. What we saw some improvement quarter-to-quarter, emerging markets remain challenged as we discussed in the last conference call. While this economic trend remains out of our control, we have put in place important programs and efforts designed to capture growth and position Cisco to capture share even if these markets remain challenged.","Second, service provider orders declined 12% year-over-year, SP Video orders including the set-top boxes were down 20%. Service provider orders, excluding SP Video, were down 7%. Product transitions and core routing, along with the emerging markets weakness, also negatively impacted service provider results.","Third, product transitions. At the end of last year, we introduced new switching and routing platforms which typically ramp up over four to eight quarters. Our next-generation routing business saw year-over-year revenue decline of 11% with orders down 5%.","As we manage through these transitions, we have announced reference customers for the NCS platform including Telstra, KDDI and BSkyB. We expect both the NCS and CRS-X to ramp through back half of the year. Switching revenue declined 12% year-over-year with orders down 6%, as we saw some deals delayed as customers architect and qualified their new application centric infrastructure systems. We were very pleased with the first shipping quarter of the Nexus 9000 as the booking pipeline from the beginning to end of the quarter nearly tripled. We believe we are firmly taking share in the 10Gig and the 40Gig data center switching markets.","I will now walk through the elements of the product portfolio that I have not yet mentioned in terms of year-over-year revenue growth. Data center revenue grew 10% with order growth rates in the mid-30s. Revenue this quarter in data center had some impact from lower backlog coming into the quarter and the timing of shipments. The pipeline continues to look very strong and UCS continues to take market share.","Wireless declined 4%. Cisco's cloud networking platform, Meraki, continues to perform very well growing over 100% year-over-year and more than doubling customers from 4,300 one quarter ago to 9,600 in this quarter, due largely to the power of the Cisco channel. Approximately one-third of Meraki's business is deferred. We are also seeing the wireless impact to more complex architectural deals in our large enterprises and service providers where wireless is part of a much broader solution which have long sales cycles.","Security revenue grew 17% with particular strength in network security up 21% and content security up 5%. We are seeing orders grow significantly faster than revenue up 30% this quarter as we continue to shift toward more recurring revenue models in this business.","The Sourcefire acquisition continues to perform very well and there is no question that the Sourcefire acquisition has accelerated our position as a leading security company and in our view, the only one capable of delivering an end-to-end architectural approach. We are very pleased with the performance of both Meraki and Sourcefire acquisitions as part of our build, buy and partner innovation strategy.","Now moving on to collaboration. Collaboration revenues decline 7% with a decline of 9% year-over-year in unified communications as we plan for the upcoming product refresh with our customers. The WebEx conferencing business had a very strong quarter up 21%. In WebEx we so many matrix including billable minutes and new customers options grow quite well. This growth came from both very large enterprise deals as well as good traction in the SMB space.","It is worth noting that our goal to move more Cisco's revenue to recurring is taking place today in our collaboration businesses, security businesses and with respect to some of our recent acquisitions like Meraki. This quarter we saw product deferred revenues increase approximately $100 million quarter over quarter. Over time, you will see us introduce new consumption models in other parts of our business that align with how customers want to buy IT today which will also help us drive better visibility going forward.","Services revenue grew 3% with both technical services and advanced services up 3%. As we discussed last quarter, service revenues are currently tied closely to product growth. So the deceleration in product momentum continues to impact service revenues. Continued investment and consulting services, remote monitoring smart services and analytics would drive additional opportunities in the quarters to come. We did begin delivering a new set of security services this quarter continuing to better address our customers' top priority.","Now on to our cloud business. We will not report this as a specific product category but rather reflected across our product categories continues to grow very well. On the cloud infrastructure side, we once again advanced our position as the leading cloud infrastructure provider. In Q2 we saw double-digit booking growth with massively scalable data center customers as they chose and purchase the Cisco UCS and Nexus portfolio. Our cloud services business also continued very strong growth. As mentioned before, we experienced very strong growth in Meraki web ask and security cloud services business.","At Cisco Live in Milan, in January, we announced several important additions to our cloud portfolio, including Cisco InterCloud, the ability to create interoperability and highly secure hybrid cloud environments across multiple public and private clouds.","While our peers' talent workload mobility within their proprietary cloud offerings, only Cisco can enable organizations to combine and move workloads, storage, compute and applications across different clouds and hypervisors, securely, with all the associated network and security policies.","I will now move onto provide background on our geographic and customer segments in terms of Q2 year-over-year product orders unless specifically stated otherwise. In Q2, product orders declined 4% year-over-year. As we said earlier, total product book-to-bill was greater than 1.","To provide a geographic view of orders this quarter, Americas declined 5%. In the U.S. balancing out strong enterprise and commercial momentum, U.S. public sector declined 4%, within U.S. public sector state and local and education grew 7% and U.S. federal declined 16%. U.S. service providers declined 11% as we managed through the SP Video transition and product cycles mentioned earlier.","Now moving on to Asia-Pacific, China and Japan, which as a region declined 5%, China declined 8% as we and our peers continue to work through the economic and political dynamics in that country.","The Europe, Middle East Africa and Russia region declined 2%. Northern Europe and the U.K. are showing good momentum, while Southern Europe continues to be challenging. Signs suggest Europe is stabilizing, they are still fragile especially in the South.","Moving onto a segment view, enterprise declined 2%, commercial grew 1%, public sector grew 1% on a global basis, and as mentioned above, service provider declined 12%.","As we said on last call, managing through product and market cycles is part of being a leader in the technology industry, we feel very confident in our ability to work through these cycles overcoming the coming quarters. We will continue to tell you exactly what we see and manage the business to perform to the expectations we set with you as we did this quarter.","Frank, I am now going to turn it back over to you.","Frank Calderoni","Let me provide a few comments on our outlook for the third quarter. Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in these forward-looking statements and that actual results could be above or below our guidance.","The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with reconciliation to GAAP. As John discussed earlier, we expect total revenue to decline in the range of 6% to 8% on a year-over-year basis. For the third quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 62%.","Given the business volumes assumed in our revenue guidance it is most likely to be at the low end of this range. Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 is expected to be in the range of 26.5% to 27.5% and our non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be approximately 21% in the third quarter.","Our Q3 FY'14 non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.47 $0.49 per share. As we communicated last quarter, we expect FY'14 non-GAAP earnings per share to range from $1.95 to $2.05.","We anticipate our GAAP earnings to be lower than non-GAAP EPS by about $0.10 to $0.13 per share in Q3'14 and $0.56 to $0.62 for the full year. This range includes pre-tax impact of approximately $50 million in Q3 FY'14 and up to $550 million for the full year as a result of our anticipated restructuring charges related to our workforce reduction plan that we announced last quarter.","During Q2 FY'14, we recognized pretax charges to our financial statements of $73 million related to that announcement. Please see the slides that accompany this webcast for more detail. Other than those quantified items noted previously, there are no other significant differences between our GAAP and our non-GAAP guidance. This guide assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructuring and tax or other events which may or may not be significant. And as a reminder Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.","I will now hand the call back over to John for detail on the business momentum and trends. John?","John Chambers","Frank, thank you very much. Managing transitions has been a core foundation of our success for nearly 30 years. The Internet of Everything is the biggest market opportunity ahead encompassing every technology trend in the market today. In recent months the Internet of Everything has become the center of most every conversation with CEOs, industry and country leaders. 2014 will be the inflection point for the Internet of Everything.","The level the excitement we see in the conversations were having today and with customers about the next wave of the Internet, reminds me of the mid-1990s. At that time, we saw the Internet and e-commerce moving from just a tech thing to something that did impact every industry. Like customers did when the Internet and e-commerce were becoming mainstream, customers are turning to Cisco as a trusted partner today to capitalize on the opportunity and minimize the risk in their business as they move into the Internet of Everything.","As we saw in the e-commerce day, there is a light between thought leadership and mainstream adoption and we still are only in the beginning stages. We are seeing tangible early traction, for example, in our top 50 targeted accounts with over $2 billion opportunity for Cisco. We are managing the transitions in our portfolio today and building for the Internet of Everything for tomorrow. This is how I am looking and evaluating our progress.","First, our willingness to change and disrupt. You heard me say for at least two years, the pace of change has become exponential. Multiple transitions are occurring at the same time requiring Cisco to transform on multiple fronts faster than we have done before. Our scale, customer relationships and number one market position in most of our targeted categories gives us a huge advantage as we deliver a new model for IT. The next generation of network will collapse the OSI stack from seven layers to three, bringing applications, networking and security together at scale. This will not only happen in the data center as we are seeing today but across the campus, access and into the cloud.","Second, customer traction. We don't get to decide whether or not we will emerge as the number one IT company. Our customers do. What we do get to decide is how we continue to deliver the value to our customers to retain the market leading position. This will be done by selling business outcomes enabled by architectures. I look closely at how we are engaging with customers and moving from technology provider to a trusted business partner. Whether it is the $3 billion of value creative in the city of Barcelona through connected and intelligent infrastructure or the first digital country Israel or several major retailers basing the networks on Cisco in order to prepare for the Internet of Everything, our customers are coming to us to capitalize on the opportunity.","Third, operational excellence and disciplined cost management. We managed non-GAAP operating expenses very well this quarter, decreasing 9% as we focus on cost management and productivity. This execution shows we are able to focus on cost as we transition the business. We continue to focus on operating as an efficient organization while at the same time making the right investments to drive long-term growth.","Fourth, creating shareholder value. As we execute our strategy to become the number one IT company, we have also committed to returning at least 50% of cash flow annually to our shareholders. As Frank said earlier, we will comfortably exceed the amount for the balance of the fiscal year. When our operating results have been impacted by a challenging macro environment in the emerging markets along with choices we are making to transform the company, we demonstrated that our confidence in the future and our support for shareholders by materially increasing our capital return as we did last quarter. We continue this focus on shareholder value with the $4 billion share repurchase this quarter and the dividend increase we announced today.","Change has always been good for Cisco and our track record for transforming ourselves, both as a company and as leaders, is unparalleled. We are as close to our customers and partners as ever. We understand their challenges and where they need us to be there, and we are using this position to build the products, solutions and platforms to meet the demands of the market. This to me, has always been the key leading indicator of future success and financial results, and gives me confidence that we will emerge as the number one IT company.","Mel, let me turn it over to you.","Melissa Selcher","Thank you, John. We will now open the floor to Q&A. We still request that sell side analysts, please ask only one question. Operator, please open the floor to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities.","Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking question. Question is on the product gross margin, which decline quite a bit sequentially and was at the lowest level we have seen in a while and you went through some of the volume and mix issue some calls, so I was hoping to touch upon the competitive environment from both, traditional and nontraditional vendors to what degree there was any change in pricing. Perhaps beyond Q3, do you think you can get the gross margin back towards the mid to upper end of the 61% to 62% gross margin ranges, volumes improve and new products ramp or should we be thinking about the lower end of this range longer-term?","John Chambers","Okay. Frank, I am going to have you handle the second part. The first part, there was nothing abnormal about this quarter's pricing trends at all. No abnormality in terms of competitors we saw, new or existing models or new startups. The field is going to go after key wins and opportunities to capture major franchises and key strategic beginning of architectural plays. I think it's good as we begin to drive for growth.","In terms of timing what we said traditionally in terms of the growth, you watch our order improvements, you watch our steady progress each quarter, which I think we have done up to this point in time and are going to do it again this next quarter and you will see as we come through these product transitions at the high end routing and switching, and as you see us began to grow our service provider strategy more together, you will see these turns up in Q4 and Q1 and Q2 in terms of momentum from an order perspective.","Frank, I am going to switch it over to you in terms of gross margin comments.","Frank Calderoni","Jess, as I mentioned, we came in at 61.3% within the range of 61% to 62%, and provided the guidance in the range of 61% to 62% for the next quarter and saying it's at the low-end of that range, primarily in Q2 as well as Q3, the issue is volumes, so to answer your question and that's driving both, most of the cost as well as the mix that I talked about, so as volume does improve that gives us the ability to also improve the gross margin.","When I think about it from a long range perspective, we talked about 61% to 62% for some period of time as volume improved and we get into a more growth scenario from a topline perspective that enables us to be at the high end of that range or even above that range.","Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities","Great. Thanks.","John Chambers","When you rethink about it, Jess, we have control over our pricing, our expenses and gross margins and we are managing these as levers. As volumes come back as Frank said, and I believe very firmly they will, you will see the gross margins improve as well, but reminding everybody for the last couple years, I have been saying gross margins will be in the 61% to 62% range and plus or minus 1% or 2%, and I think the last time we said very openly was impact in 2012.","Melissa Selcher","Thanks, Jess. Operator, next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS.","Amitabh Passi - UBS","Hi. Thank you. John, what is the risk that you have yourself to spread across to many areas where you are fighting multiple battles on multiple fronts we have just a massive rate of flux in each of the markets. The reason I asked you as I am little surprised with these service provider segment for you continues to remain relatively weak. NCS has been off for some time, so I am surprised we are not seeing any traction there, so we would love to get your thoughts in terms of the portfolios there, room for further rationalization\u2026","John Chambers","First, the answer is no. If you are a single product company in today's market, you are going to have a real tough time competing against a number of different competitors, and differentiating yourself. We saw these trends coming and we have articulated for four, five years the importance of architectures where you combine products that combine '13 products that are number one in their field, four products that are number two in terms of market share and two product areas that are number three. You combine these into architectures with services and partners that very quickly bring you to solutions and dramatic differentiation and that is what you are seeing them play very strongly in the U.S. commercial and U.S. enterprise as proof points.","The second part of your question in terms of service provider, we basically are again going with an architectural approach. We are literally saying how do you influence the key issues that are most important to the service provider from mobility to video, to cloud, to speed of services delivery, so reducing OpEx and CapEx and say how you approach these with an architectural approach. So I think this will be an industry where architectures will win and I think we are very well positioned versus our key traditional IT players and future challenges.","Melissa Selcher","Great. Thanks, Amitabh. Next question, operator.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Subu Subrahmanyan with The Juda Group.","Subu Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group","Thank you. My question is on the product transitions you are seeing. Is there anyway to quantify the impact of data center transitions and core routing product transition in this quarter? And John, as you look at the recovery in these, is there a timing expectation? Which one will rebound first between these two?","Frank Calderoni","As you look at it, let's go to the data center and let's go to switching. If you watch and you see the Nexus 9000, as an example, our product pipeline is up to 522 customers. That's almost a 2.9% increase quarter-over-quarter. Our win rate is extremely good versus traditional players and new challengers. You will see us over the next four to five quarters go by, some of the early startups in this area and if you look at the transition I think you watch our orders in Q4 and Q1 in this area and we are going to follow a path very similar to what we did in UCS. A similar game plan that this team has done so many times before from a technology perspective. We will put in place our steps in terms of how we identify the top customers, how we get the close rate, how we amp the volume and at the same time tie that to what we do in the Nexus 7000 and below in terms of the data center.","In terms of the routing, the routers are a little bit longer sales cycles. As you know when you put these routers that has such tremendous capability and function where you can really transfer the whole Library of Congress in a second or the Netflix library in a second, you basically are talking about tremendously powerful capabilities with the NCS and the CRS-X. That will take a little bit longer. I would watch our franchise wins in Q3 and then you should begin to see orders pickup in Q4 and Q1 on those. A little bit longer sales cycles in terms of implementation.","Melissa Selcher","Great. Thanks, Subu. Operator, next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank","John, hi. Switching to the Nexus 9000 order ramp. Will you see that this quarter? Our checks continue to get more evaluation phase in the products still. Will we start seeing that ramp this quarter? Will that help get switching back in the positive territory heading into July and into fiscal '15? Can you give us an update on campus switching and how that's doing? Thank you.","John Chambers","Sure. Again, Rob [ph], I am going to give you the campus switching piece. Let me go to the Nexus piece. Literally, I review almost every other week with the team where we are on this, reminding everyone this team has never missed in terms of our telephony approach, our combination of storage with the network with processors that really made us a major player in the data center and now what you watch on this when you are going to see a steady ramp to grow where we would just pick up momentum in key accounts and we are tracking these key accounts. The volumes are small. We won one, for example today.","That is a huge opportunity but it was the first opportunity but it was the first opportunity to get the door in the foot. So we deal with first getting the pilots in and then scale that this is a product that is extremely competitive and every aspect of the commitments they made on the product are on schedule on the quarters that they committed to. So I feel very comfortable with the product ramps on this and as you begin to see the Nexus 7000 and 9000 both available market then you will move through perhaps a little bit of pause where a customer is saying which way I would go and I have a hesitation here. Rob, additional thoughts on campus?","Rob Lloyd","Yes, John. In addition to the data center, I think that the entire two big transitions which are from 1Gig to 10Gig and now from 10Gig to 40Gig are playing to the strongest hand we have had in terms of our portfolio. So we have a product for every part of the market right now and you covered some of the data center technologies. We haven't talked about the new 40Gig uplinks our Nexus 5000, an important part of the product and of course the 10Gig and 10Gig links on the campus switch which is a 68000. So right across the board, great portfolio strength and you mentioned it, but we give the pedal to the metal on the 10Gig to 40Gig transition and I think you are going to see some good market share movement in the quarters ahead.","John Chambers","Yes, I think the market share gains on that are going to be dramatic.","Melissa Selcher","Great. Thanks, Brian. Operator, next question.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer","Thanks, guys. John, I want to focus on two specific segments, the wireless and the data center. Both, for a couple of quarters, have now either completely flattened out or in the wireless case, have declined on a sequential basis. I am trying to understand, I understand I would assume that some exposure there relates to emerging markets and that's probably one of the sources of the weakness, but nevertheless for you those are very hard growth opportunities, especially on the server side and on the wireless. Many of the competitors are still growing at very cliff, so I am trying to understand if there's something going on in those two businesses that's not related to the macro issue you have been discussing.","John Chambers","Okay. First on the data center, the answer would be no. If you watch the rate at which our orders come in. As I said in the script, the order rate was in the mid-30s and this is more of the time and the shipments, book to billed across most of our product lines you can do the math quickly as I can, all of them were in good shape in terms of book-to-bill. We clearly built backlog in many of the categories and I would be very surprised if you don't see the numbers up in the 30% range this next quarter with all the appropriate caveats. That momentum feels good. We are very, very well positioned versus competition.","On the wireless side of the house, there were areas such as Meraki that was just very, very good for you going with solutions and position it. Some of the other wireless decisions on very large service provider decisions are long sales cycle such as the Small Cell SP WiFi etcetera on it and I think you are going to see as we brought out some additional product functionality that just came out with our wireless LAN capability, Rob, you will see the orders in that category that backup as we look out over the next couple quarters.","On the data center, we are going to win that one and I think you see tremendous position of momentum there and we have no fear there. That really feels good. Then in terms of wireless, there are couple of areas that we need to pick momentum back on.","Rob, I think we know what we want to do on that. You talk to that group the other day, I think.","Rob Lloyd","I talked to them the other day and again this morning, so we have got some actions in place.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer","Sounds good.","Melissa Selcher","Thank you, Ittai. Operator, next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen.","Paul Silverstein - Cowen","I am hoping through this is clarification, but let me give it a shot. Going back to gross margin I just wanted to confirm something. With respect to the pricing environment, I think so and if I go back to the previous quarter you were fairly assertive in your commentary about the healthy pricing especially with the new products that they were coming consistent with your current margin structure to returning to this quarter is it essentially volume issue or we when we look at pricing, when we look at the new platforms has there been any change in terms of the margin profile, those new products in particular and more generally all in terms of the overall product portfolio. I heard you response on a call previously, [issue] but I just want to clarify to what extend is this a volume issue or is there something more?","Frank Calderoni","Paul, great question. It allows me to expand a little, bit it's purely a volume issue. If you look at cost, you look at mix, you look at pricing et cetera, those to come together. Volume is what is driving each of the areas. The area that you are being very general with me on as you are saying all right John if you see an unusual things and switching is that going to surprise.","Even within the switching segment our gross margins are remarkably stable even with lower volume, so we are not seeing anything unusual in the switching at all. We are very, very competitive and as we mentioned before, Paul, these new products which were just now begin to get out and enhancing the effects on gross margins are all coming in gross margins that are very typical of our high-end gross margin. That a much better job than ever done when high-end products, where usually you bring them out in the low 50s and over literally almost 2 years bring it back up to more traditional margins, so I feel good with that, so it's volume and volume ties to what the cost, what the mix and what you see overall in terms of pricing in the field. Pricing the field is a little bit up versus what we seen before, but with well within the range of what we see, a point plus or minus or half point.","Melissa Selcher","Thanks, Paul. Operator, next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.","Kulbinder Garcha - Credit Suisse","Thanks. Just a question on the services side, I think Frank mentioned earlier on the call that service should follow a product revenues and I guess what we are seeing product revenues of declining new self-service offset dollars at risk the two quarters out about maybe quite how should we think about the dynamic.","Then just one further clarification on gross margin if can. Are you saying there is no real change to the pricing environment? It's all volume-driven. The reason why I ask is, you guys knew that revenues were going to be weak this quarter and your guiding for low gross margins will weaken in front of this quarter. They are going to be relatively weak next quarter, so why aren't the cost issues is coming through more long. Any point on that would be helpful. Thanks.","John Chambers","Gary, do you want to take the service. I don't know if you could hear it or not.","Gary Moore","I think, I do, John. So, Kulbinder, on the services. The services business is tightly tied to product but we have added a number of services that John mentioned during the call earlier and those are ramping up and the fact that our product decline has been what it's been, those services aren't coming up as fast and offsetting that. But we are very happy with the way we have been able to drive continued growth in the services business as well as continuing to drive the margin that we have had.","Kulbinder Garcha - Credit Suisse","In terms of the gross margin comments?","Frank Calderoni","As far as the gross margin, just to reiterate, so as far as the guidance that we gave last quarter 61% to 62%. That said, we came in at 61.3%. So we did assume the lower volume when we gave guidance and then also assuming the lower volume for Q3 in the guidance that we just gave for the coming quarter. As far as the volume and the cost impact, so when you take your volume down we have a fixed base within a manufacturing organization, things like logistics center, things like the data center that supports WebEx and things like that. When you have lower volumes, you are spreading that fixed base over those lower volumes and therefore you don't get some of the magnitude of cost-benefit that we have seen in prior quarters. So some of initiatives that we are driving like value engineering will continue to drive those. We don't see the full impact when the volumes are down because it's offset by the fixed cost piece of it. So as I said before, if the volume improve back to, let's say, normal levels then you can definitely start to realize those deficiencies from a cost and then also from a mix standpoint as the volumes improve in switching and routing, that was one that basically had the most cell sales on a quarter-on-quarter basis which tend to have higher margin that's going to overall affect the mix in a positive direction. So we are having those impacts in periods when the volumes are lower and as the volumes improve they should be offset.","John Chambers","Very simple, if we were seeing major pricing pressures, we would just tell you. The switching is the prime example where even in the product transition time period, the margins are remarkably stable on that. So we control the pricing, we control the expenses, control the gross margins and we think we are positioned very well versus the changes in competition at this time.","Melissa Selcher","Great. Thanks, Kulbinder. Operator, next question.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you. John, I am sorry for the background noise. (inaudible), so I guess the bigger the better in your (inaudible) architectural approach, yet some of your assets are past their peak cycle and having a negative impact o your financial model. So on the other point that Cisco has to choose between customers and margins and Cisco actually proactively looks at the corporate ecology so that we can actually have margin, customers happy and investors happy as well.","John Chambers","I think I got part of the question. The question is, do we have to choose between customers and margins. I would say the two actually come very tightly together and this is something that I think we need to both articulate and give you a feel for the examples. When you begin to look at an architectural sale and I was just at that World Wide Tech this last week, WWT, technologies and they this last year did about $2.8 billion as a partner reselling for us growing in the high-20s year-over-year. They align completely with our architectures and they align completely with us as we make the transition into the Internet of Everything.","Now bear with me as I walk through this so you understand why I am sharing this with you. They standardized on Cisco and they are rally building their labs, the architectures, instead of interfaces customers with white papers or slides, they basically say here is what you can do to architectures and it is why you have to have all of these 18 different product areas to be able to get the result that you want when you combine it with services to get the outcomes much faster. They already show that in each of their labs with the capability to bring it to life. So you see the growth, you see the realization on it. On the Internet of Everything, they are almost ahead of us there in terms of, they are already talking to areas like in mining where you connect the sensors to all of the equipment in a major mining operation.","They just feed, as you can imagine, probably 10,000 sensors feeds per second. It goes into six or seven different databases applications. As you begin to think about the Internet of Everything and as they show that architecturally, you almost can show by doing this how you can make the decisions with people, process, data and things much quicker, get the right information at the right time to the right person or device or machine to make the right decision.","So this is why you have to be in these various product areas. This is why when you bring those together your gross margins come up, because you are delivering the results. This is why you don't want to be a single product group like a router or a switch or a wireless capabilities et cetera.","You can get caught in a huge squeeze as you move forward and if that combination that provide gross margin capabilities. If you are in service providers and of course we look at the analysis as we go forward. We are very much committed to the video side of market, because video mobile is the number one application area that they really see differentiation and two thirds of the load on mobile devices and just a year will be video, so you have to be in these areas where you can tie up together. Does that make sense?","Melissa Selcher","Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ehud Gelblum with Citigroup.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup","A couple of clarifications and a couple of questions, clarification were that if you can give us, Frank, maybe because you are buying back so much stock, what the ending quarter share count was that would be helpful. Then a comment on linearity if you could.","Clarification on the services business I thought, because at your Analyst in December you took 80% of your services as maintenance. I had thought it was more a function of your installed base that on quarter-by-quarter product revenue, so if you can just clarify that.","Then another question is about service provider. Service Provider Video, obviously continues to fall is there a bottom just a spot the calculate and kind of look it and you touch for ways when that kind of bottoms out and you should be modeling that and then core routers, you have got a cyclical funk that we are in right now in core routing?","John Chambers","You so many questions, I can even write them down quick enough. Let me stop right now quickly and see if we go through it. I am going to take the take the linearity question. The quarter was very linear, no surprise on that at all, and played out much in the range that we do with the first month being a little bit average and 25%, let's say, let's say second a little bit more in third month in the 40% to 45% range depend on which quarter you are in?","This quarter was very, very, much in line with what we traditionally see Q2s, I want to say so that nobody understands this. We exit the quarter with the best booking backlog in terms of weeks that that was in 10 years in Q2, so the number of weeks of backlog we had was very solid coming out of the quarter. Frank, I will give you a minute to look up to share count.","Frank Calderoni","The diluted share count, the average diluted share count at the end of the quarter was about approximately 5,300. As I said, it came down by approximately $100 million quarter-on-quarter related to the buyback that we did $4 billion of the buyback that we did in this past quarter.","I also noted that when you do the buybacks over a period of time, depending on the timing you won't get the full impact of the reduced share count. It takes another quarter, so we will see further reductions this coming quarter and would have other additional buyback and we do in Q3 and Q4 will then reduce it even further.","It also has offset any increase to the share count related to options and RSUs and SPV the normal increased, so we have offset that and then reduced through the buyback and our objective as we said over to the period of time is to manage share count down over the next couple of quarters and over the next several years in order to help improve the return to shareholders.","John Chambers","Yes. Frank and I always provide a good balance. We are going to be aggressive in the market. You are going to see us well above our 50% free cash flow, buyback and we have continued to be opportunistic there as much as we were in the first six months of this year.","Gary, in terms of services, let me break the question in three pieces. First, how much services is actually tied to the product side of the house? Maybe a real quick discussion the technical services versus advanced services and advanced services and that advanced services however going to move more outcome-based. Two minutes.","Frank Calderoni","First part of that is, roughly 80% and that the combination of technical support services as well as advanced subscription services those, contractors are normally one to three years and you book them and then you deal that revenue out over on equal basis over whether it's 12 monthly or 36 months, so as the product revenue and bookings have ramped down over the last several quarters, there is no new attach to that on either TS or AS.","On the business that is not what subscription the advanced services that are more advanced engineering and capabilities around support services that our project oriented when people aren't building out new networks or were not deploying large deployments then that business also comes down and that has come down fairly significantly as well over the last several quarters. We are ramping up in the areas that John mentioned around smart services, the analytics around that, as well as remote managed services, some large wins there. We are really doubling down on our capability there.","And then we have also shifted and brought together, we are building out a very architecturally oriented with technology people as well consulting services and then security and we have already delivered some of that. Those are ramping up and that's why we have this gap here. You will find us being less dependent on product as we go forward and you will see us continue to manage that business extremely well through automation and things that will allow us to drive the margins we do.","John Chambers","So two real quick thoughts, because I think unifying services really make a difference in our future. Gary and I have given us the challenge to move 50% of these event services to outcome-based capabilities. That's only about 20% today. Very important in the transition. If you look at the Internet of Everything, surely the consultancy piece over the next several years is a $1 trillion market that we can address. So you begin to look at us looking at this is a major new revenue scenario most of consultancy services but more important point through our own whole product architectures. Once again going back, there is a reason that so many people fail with Internet of Everything they do in cities. They do it one step at a time. It is complex. It has got to be able to scale. It has got to have the architectures all come in together. It has got to be mobile. It has got to be data center. It has got to be analytics at the edge. It has got to be secure. It has got to be collaborative. And you have to have a game plan to bring these customers together and just using cities or countries as an example when you bring them together with these architectures that's why you win. That's why you see a digital Israel where really our business grows in the high-teens year-after-year because of what we have done together there.","Melissa Selcher","Okay. Thanks, Ehud. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Tal Liani with BoA Merrill Lynch.","Tal Liani - BoA Merrill Lynch","(Inaudible) very much for the questions. I have just one question left which is, I am still trying to understand, in your numbers what related to the loft quarter, what's related to the next quarter? What I mean by that is, the quarter is definitely weak but I don't know if it is incrementally weaker than last quarter and what are the parts that are incrementally better? So maybe you can just go through kind of the major segments, just to tell us where did you see improvement from the previous time that you updated us about three months ago and just overall kind of the delta from the last time? Thanks.","John Chambers","Sure. Just repeating some the same things and expanding on them. The quarter played out on this exactly as we expected in terms of the three areas that were challenged. And in those challenging areas from a revenue perspective using high-end routing switches as an example, they were down in double digits, bookings were down in the -minus 5% and minus 6% respectively. The emerging countries were better this quarter than last quarter but way too early to call a trend and I don't want anyone to take away, we are basing our estimate on this next quarter with no improvement in terms of the current economic scenarios or what we are seeing with inconsistencies in emerging countries in terms of the direction.","The product orders were down 4% in the direction and as we alluded to earlier, there were several areas that we felt very, very good about in terms of security and the data center progress that we made. The reoccurring revenue, that's about 1% delta that we would have had if we had recognized this in traditional ways. It just increased from the last quarter to this quarter. So I feel very good about where we are now. I think the transitions are working. We are playing about. We gave guidance for this next quarter. Last quarter was 8% to 10%. We said this quarter 6% to 8% and you are going to see us just move this market right along through the transitions and returned to positive growth one quarter at a time.","So I feel a lot better where we are now versus where we were a quarter ago. I don't know if you want to add anything to that, Frank.","Melissa Selcher","Thanks, Tal. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian White with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald","Yes. Hi, John.","John Chambers","Hi, Brian.","Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald","I am curious. We look, sales down 8% this quarter, 6% to 8% in the third quarter. To get growth moving again here, do you feel like Cisco needs a new product category? I mean you obviously are a leader in networking. You have done very well in servers in a short period of time. But to get the revenue growth to more reasonable levels, do you think Cisco needs a new product category?","John Chambers","Let me think about that for the second to put my thoughts. Okay. I think, we have got four or five major product categories using your words in play at the present time. We have the explosion and remember, when we entered the data center saying we are going to bring together the network with server technology with storage which has really been a huge part of our growth and positioned us very well in the data center from the CIOs perspective as well and that's playing out extremely well.","We talked about application-centric infrastructure. Remember just for four months ago, when everybody really got what we are doing with this and how you are going to have intelligence throughout your entire network and what we are doing with both, applications and the network in the infrastructure and the ability to do north bound and south bound API. I mean, that is a huge product category for us in terms of direction.","Then as you pull together the Internet of Everything, and we have been on this for six years. Heavy lifting a year ago, if I had to buy somebody a drink for me to talk very long about the topic. Now, they are offering to buy us dinner and they bring the board of directors here. It's that light switch went off in a very, very positive way with the CES the World Economic Forum and when Google bought Maps, it was a light switch that all of a sudden every consumer, player, manufacturer realized.","Now, the size of those markets is $19 trillion. That's a profits potential. That doesn't count all the infrastructure underneath of it $1.5 trillion in retail alone $2.9 trillion in terms of manufacturing, so you could imagine the conversations that we are having with the leaders in that and we don't go in there selling them routers and switches. We sell outcomes and there is probably no better example than outcomes fail than what we did in Israel.","The challenge for the top government leaders in Israel 18 months ago focus on job creation, focus on inclusion of minorities, focused on healthcare, education, innovation, the ability to move some of the cities to their south, security and do this in terms of support with all three major political parties from the top down and we did that together and 18 months and we have won every single major bid in total on that.","You really began to think about the key takeaway here is the network is at the center of every transition you are seeing. Every one of it and it's going to be an intelligent network and we positioned ourselves very well to both, - again the new competitors coming at us piece meal and the old peers to who piece meal. If you are just a piece meal hardware player with a single product, you are going to really have a tough time as you go forward.","I believe architectures win and I think the categories we outlined, if we execute well, we fuel this growth for the next decade. As we think we have plenty in terms of the opportunities in front of us and I want to careful we prioritize in the right way.","Melissa Selcher","That's the last question.","John Chambers","Mel, you are the boss. Go ahead.","Melissa Selcher","All right, so I think that that's going to conclude our call. Cisco's next quarterly call, which will reflect our FY'14 third quarter results, will be on Wednesday, May 14, 2014 at 1:30 PM Pacific, 4:30 PM Eastern.

At the request of Cisco Systems, today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect.","Now I would like to introduce Melissa Selcher, Vice President of Corporate Communication and Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Thanks, Kim. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's first quarter FY 2016 quarterly conference call. This is Melissa Selcher, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO, and Kelly Kramer, our CFO.","By now you should have seen our earnings release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found on the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website.","Throughout this conference call we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. And we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise.","The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance that will be provided for the second quarter. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Form 10-K, which identifies important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details.","As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it's done through an explicit public disclosure.","I'll now turn it over to Chuck.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Mel.","So Q1 was a very strong quarter across the board. We grew our revenue 4% and delivered non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 9%. We delivered very strong non-GAAP gross margins, and our non-GAAP operating margin was best we've seen in over nine years.","I recognize that our Q2 guidance that we just provided is below what the market had expected. In Q1 we saw lower than expected order growth, driven largely by uncertainty from macro and currency impacts, primarily outside the U.S. Despite these headwinds, I believe we are executing incredibly well in a challenging environment. Let me tell you simply how I see it. We had a great quarter, guided to solid growth in Q2, and feel good about our momentum and how we are positioned for the second half of the year.","As I look at the big picture, I'm extremely pleased with the speed with which our teams are executing. We have a clear strategy and are confident that we are making the right transitions in our business, investing where we need to for future growth, profitability, and market leadership.","Specifically, we are accelerating our ability to deliver on the growth opportunities in front of us. We are driving internal innovation at a record pace. So far in FY 2016 we're seeing a 25% increase in major new product introductions. And three of our internal startups brought solutions to market this quarter working with our key customers. These startups are bringing incredible technology from concept to delivery in under 12 months. Stay tuned next week for announcements around an additional project that we co-developed with one of the world's largest web-scale players.","In this quarter alone we closed three acquisitions, recently announced four new acquisitions, and formed three new strategic partnerships. Partners like Apple, Inspur, and Ericsson see Cisco as the market leader they want to work with to move faster and drive greater value to customers and the market. I believe we will see several points of growth from these partnerships over the next few years.","We are also aggressively driving our cloud businesses. We've always had a hybrid cloud strategy, and it is increasingly clear that every one of our customers want both public and private cloud capabilities in a hybrid cloud. On the public cloud side, Cisco is a leading provider of infrastructure to web-scale and SP customers as they build out their public cloud infrastructure. As just one data point, our business with the largest web-scale players grew over 20% again this quarter.","Within the enterprise, we are winning in private cloud and are focused on automating and driving public cloud economics across our customers' entire infrastructure. We saw this opportunity drive 24% growth in UCS. And our next-generation data center switching portfolio, which is our Nexus 3000, Nexus 9000, and ACI, is now at a $2 billion run rate, with over $500 million in revenue this quarter, growing over 140% year over year with sequential growth of 26%. This performance is much stronger than that of our competitors, who claim they are outpacing and outperforming us.","And our own cloud services continue to grow well. WebEx, one of the largest enterprise SaaS applications in the world, grew revenue over 23% this quarter, and we continue to move more of our portfolio to cloud-based delivery models.","As we deliver more of our portfolio in software and cloud models, we are driving consistent double-digit growth in deferred revenue. We saw software and subscription product deferred revenue up 36%. Security deferred revenue grew 31%, as we sell next-generation firewall and threat defense software to our over 200,000 firewall customers. Our collaboration deferred revenue grew 18%. And our Meraki cloud networking business, where we deliver networking-as-a-service, grew revenue over 60%.","While we still have work to do across our portfolio, I'm incredibly pleased with our continued focus and speed of execution. We will continue to make the necessary strategic moves to drive our success. Over the last quarter, I've spent hundreds of hours with our customers and partners around the world, and they have reaffirmed my confidence in our ability to execute against the opportunity in front of us.","While the market continues to move at an accelerated pace, our customers know they must move with speed as they embark on their digital transitions. It's clear to me that they also understand the central and critical role that the network plays in that transition, and they are looking to us be a strategic partner to drive their growth and build their digital organizations, cities, and countries. We are doing the right things to capitalize on this opportunity. And, as I told our teams this past week, I have never been more optimistic.","Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more details on our financials.","Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Chuck. I am pleased with our execution on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments, and delivering shareholder value.","Starting with our first pillar of delivering profitable growth, we saw good top line growth in Q1 with $12.7 billion in total revenue, up 4%. Product revenue grew 4%, with solid growth in switching, data center, wireless, security, and collaboration. More specifically in Q1, switching grew 5%. In addition to the Nexus 3000, Nexus 9000, and ACI momentum of over 140%, we continue to see strength in the Catalyst business. Data center grew 24%, demonstrating our continued market leadership. Wireless grew 7%, driven by the Meraki business. Security was up 7%, with deferred revenue growth of 31%. And collaboration grew 17%, with deferred revenue up 18%.","In total, deferred revenue had solid double-digit growth of 10%, with product deferred revenue up 16% and services up 7%. Product deferred revenue, driven by our subscription and software businesses, grew 36%. We do see the transition to subscription revenue accelerating, as I mentioned in the last earnings call.","We did see routing decline 8%. We do expect routing revenue to return to growth due to timing of large deals we saw in Q1. Services revenue grew 1%, largely driven by weakness in service provider. Product orders grew 3%, with a book-to-bill below one, which is in line with our typical Q1 but slightly lighter than we had expected.","Looking at our geographies, which is the primary way we run our business, Americas grew 1%, EMEA grew 3%, and APJC was up 9%. Total emerging markets grew a very solid 11%, with the BRICs plus Mexico accelerating to 21% growth.","In terms of customer segments, service provider grew 6%. Enterprise declined 3% based on the uncertainty from macro challenges, consistent with what others are seeing. Commercial grew 7%, which signals to us the broad strength of our portfolio. Public sector was flat.","From a profitability perspective, we delivered record non-GAAP EPS of $0.59, up 9%. GAAP EPS was $0.48. Q1 non-GAAP net income was a record $3 billion, up 8%. GAAP net income was $2.4 billion.","We drove the strong profitability with discipline and rigor on gross margins and operating expense. Non-GAAP gross margin was 63.2%, with non-GAAP product gross margin of 62.3% and non-GAAP service gross margin of 66.2%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were well controlled at 32.7% of revenue, and non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 30.5%. We are ensuring we make the right investment and divestment decisions through disciplined portfolio management.","Moving on to the second pillar of our financial strategy, which is the work we are doing to manage our portfolio and strategic investments to fuel our key long-term growth areas such as cloud, data center, software, services, and security, we've been very active from an M&A perspective, aligning our investments to key growth areas. We closed three acquisitions in Q1 with OpenDNS and Pawaa in software and security and MaintenanceNet in services. We also announced the acquisitions of Portcullis and Lancope in security, ParStream in data analytics, and 1 Mainstream in cloud-based video. These moves are consistent with our strategy of increasing the investments of our innovation and R&D efforts to our growth areas.","Moving on to our third pillar, delivering shareholder value, in Q1 we increased operating cash flow 11% to $2.8 billion. Total cash, cash equivalents, and investments at the end of Q1 were $59.1 billion, with $5 billion available in the U.S. And we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders, comprised of $1.2 billion of share repurchases and $1.1 billion of dividends. The total return to shareholders represents a return of 91% of our free cash flow, more than consistent with our commitment to shareholders of returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually.","Overall, Q1 was a strong quarter. As you review the financials, you see good top line growth, record profitability and operating leverage, a very strong balance sheet with growth in deferred revenue, and strong cash generation. We executed well, consistent with our business and financial strategies.","Now let me reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Mel referred to earlier. As a reminder, in Q4 we announced an agreement to sell the Client Premises Equipment portion of our SP Video Connected Devices business to Technicolor. The transaction is currently going through regulatory approval, and we are working to close it during the second quarter. In order to provide a clearer view of our continuing expected financial performance, we have normalized our second quarter guidance to exclude the CPE business for both Q2 fiscal year 2016 and Q2 fiscal year 2015. We have provided historical financial information for the CPE business in the slides that accompany this call.","So now on to our Q2 guidance, we are executing very well in a challenging global environment, but did see the macro challenges driving uncertainty that impacted our Q1 order growth. As a result, the guidance for Q2, excluding the CPE businesses, is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of zero to 2% year over year. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 62% to 63%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 28.5% to 29.5%.","And the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 23%. The tax rate does not include any impact of the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit. If the R&D tax credit is reinstated, we would reflect that benefit in our effective tax rate.","Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.53 to $0.55. We anticipate our GAAP EPS to be lower than non-GAAP EPS by $0.10 to $0.14. Further details related to this range are included in the slides and press that accompany this call.","I'll now turn it back to Chuck to summarize the call.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Kelly.","So, as I look back at the last 90 days and my first quarter, I am more optimistic than ever about Cisco's future. Yes, the guidance we just gave for Q2 is lower than what the market had expected, and I don't take that lightly. But for me, nothing has changed in how I feel about the business. We are moving incredibly fast and doing all the right things to drive our growth and strategic relevance.","We expect the results of these moves will start showing up in the coming quarters. Every one of our customers, established industry leaders, and disruptive challengers is focused on how they manage, automate, and secure the explosion of connections and data across their digital organization. Our portfolio has never been stronger, more relevant, and more strategic, and we're hearing this directly from our customers and our partners. The opportunity is ours to capitalize on.","We have a clear vision and strategy and are executing very well. We are driving internal innovation at a record pace, acquiring strategic assets, co-developing with our customers, and building a new set of strategic partnerships. I believe our speed and execution are truly differentiating us in the market, and we've just begun to scratch the surface of what's possible.","Mel, I'll turn it back to you for questions.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Great, thanks. Kim, let's open the line for questions. I'd like to remind all analysts to please ask one question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank Securities. Your line is open.","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Hi, Chuck. I took over the practice from Brian Modoff. So I'm looking forward to working with you and your team.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Great.","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Can you guys hear me okay? Yes, hi.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, thank you, Vijay. We can hear you.","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Perfect. So, Chuck, my question is around we had done independent checks and had noted near-term weakness in U.S. enterprise. I'd like to get your qualitative color. And I know you work very closely with the sales teams and also with some of your bigger customers.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Vijay, we are having a hard time hearing you. Could you speak a little louder?","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, can you hear me okay?","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Yes.","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, perfect. I think my question was around we did independent checks with the channel, who had noted near-term order weakness, U.S. enterprise in particular. Could you give us qualitative color from your end? Is it just endemic weakness, customers just pushing out because their own near-term fundamentals are weak like the U.S. industrials, or is it relating to any indecision around migration to public clouds? I'd like to get your commentary on the weakness you noted in enterprise. Thanks.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Vijay, and tell Brian hello when you see him. So relative to the enterprise, we actually are very comfortable with the situation in the U.S. We did see weakness particularly outside the United States and particularly in Asia-Pacific. We saw weakness in Canada as well as Latin America. And we didn't see any impact that was different this quarter from public cloud. We think our customers are moving to a hybrid cloud environment, which I think is indicative of the $0.5 billion that we did in our next-generation data center switching portfolio this quarter. And so we're actually very comfortable with our portfolio.","If you think about our U.S. commercial business and then our global commercial business, our U.S. commercial business was up 12%, and it is a good proxy of how our portfolio is playing in that space. And we firmly believe that if there was a significant difference in the transition of workloads to public cloud, we would see it there first. So we're very comfortable with our enterprise strategy right now.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Great. Thanks, Vijay. Operator, next question?","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes, hi. Can you hear me?","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","We can, Simona.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I wanted to ask you a couple questions on margins. So first, they came in pretty strong in the quarter even though routing was weaker, and that tends to be a higher margin product line. So I was just curious what drove that upside.","And a bit of a question related to that, Chuck, is that you've had margins exceeding expectations for a few quarters now, and in the meantime your growth is decelerating quite a bit here. Some of that is driven by FX and international issues. Do you feel like you're dialing that equation sufficiently in the direction of revenue growth versus margin preservation?","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Simona, it's a very good question. Thank you. I'm going to give a couple comments, and then I'm going to ask Kelly to chime in.","First of all, I think that we talked about and I think it's well documented that there are some currency issues around the world, and I think our teams have done an incredible job of managing that. And we did see our gross margins, non-GAAP gross margins very strong this quarter. So we constantly look at the balance of investments in areas, and we're actively investing in those areas that are providing growth for us like security and in certain countries and in our Meraki portfolio. But it's something that we'll continue to look at. Kelly, comments on gross margins?","Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes, I'd say just to add to that, Simona, this is a big focus for us and all of our business units. But if you look at when you'll see in our 10-Q, we have our typical range. Our pricing has been holding in our typical range, which is a good sign. Where we saw the upside from a year-over-year perspective here is we just had really, really strong productivity this quarter in gross margins on the product side. That drove a lot of the benefit. Again, it's what the engineering teams are working on. It's what supply chain is driving. So it's part of what we're driving to offset the competitive pressures that we have naturally in the tech space. So I'd say it's definitely good execution by the team.","The way that we make sure also that we're not doing a tradeoff like you mentioned because we are driving for growth and profits is we look at things like win rates. We look at things like obviously market share. So we're making sure we're making the right tradeoffs to get the wins that we want, and balancing that because it is all about growth as well as profits.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Great. Thanks, Simona. Operator, next question.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Hey, Mark.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Mark.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Looking at it at a high level \u2013 hi. How are you? If I look at it at a high level, the company has gone through many rounds of layoffs and reorgs, and we've seen this impact other tech companies such as IBM and HP. So having said that, do you feel that we should see some accelerated innovation coming out of Cisco over the next \u2013 as we look towards the back half? Product Catalyst, for example, pipeline of innovation, if you could, give us those positive things to look for in the second half. Thank you.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Mark, that's a great question, and I actually thank you very much for asking it. As I said in my opening comments, we have in our engineering organization, we've really focused on smaller agile teams that are moving more quickly. You're going to see some innovation, as I said, that's going to come out next week. You're going to see a nice steady stream of new products in the market. In fact, one of the comments I made was that I feel like we are very well positioned for the second half, and that's one of the key reasons, is that we have a good new product pipeline. So I think you will be very pleased with the innovation that comes out over the next few months.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Thanks, Mark. Kim, next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup Global Markets.","James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you very much and congratulations to you and your team. My question is that I believe, unless my memory is wrong, that you had a long-term organic sales growth rate of about 3% to 6%. I think that might have been the case. And the outlook now is zero to 2%. Can you help us understand or quantify it? Is some of this due to FX, and how much? And it looks like probably service provider is also driving that down. So maybe Ericsson new partnership you have can help out at some point. Just help us bridge the gap of the zero to 2% outlook for the next quarter versus your long-term goal of 3% to 6%. Thank you.","Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So I'll start addressing that question, and I'll hand it over to Chuck on the Ericsson question. So from an FX perspective, us like every other multinational are feeling the impact of the strength of the U.S. dollar. For us it's a little more difficult to quantify because we sell 90% of our products in U.S. dollars. But I can tell you when I look at the countries that we do sell in local currency, which for us is Australia, Canada, and parts of Japan, for those countries alone where I can quantify it, it was almost two points of just pure translation on our top line growth. So for the rest of our business that's sold outside the U.S., there is certainly an impact. It's just hard for us to quantify it directly. So again, we try to see if we're getting less \u2013 if the demand is under pressure by the number of deals that we have in the pipeline or things along those lines, as well as if we see pressure from our sales teams to discount heavily.","So what I'd say is yes, us like every other multinational is feeling the impact of the strength of the U.S. dollar, but I think our sales teams are executing extremely well through that and being able to sell the value of our solutions despite that. So for sure, identified two points on just the few countries that we have, and there's I'm sure more \u2013 three to four points or more even besides that that we can't put our finger on.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Jim, just a couple comments. You mentioned the zero to 2%. That's our guidance for Q2, and I think the 3% to 6% you mentioned is what Kelly presented as a long-term model at the last financial analyst conference.","On the SP side, I'll just make a couple of comments that we're very pleased with our performance there. We've had the second quarter in a row of growth. The teams are executing very well. And you're right, the partnership that we announced with Ericsson really leverages their strength in radio, in OSS, BSS, and network management inside ESP as well as their real scale from a services perspective around the world. And when you combine that with our strength in IP and data center and networking and security, we think that it's a good combination. Our customers believe that they're actually quite pleased with the partnership that we put together.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Great. Kim, next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America Securities.","Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, hi. I have two questions and I'll ask them. Hopefully, you can answer at least a part of the second one. Switching was very weak the past few quarters on a sequential basis. It was sub-seasonal last quarter also, but this quarter was very strong. And I'm wondering if you can give a little bit of color on what's going right and what's going wrong and how sustainable is the strength in switching.","And the second question which is related but not related, your service growth is below your product growth if I sum up the last four quarters. And you mentioned it a little bit at the beginning of your opening comments. So if you can just clarify, why is it happening? Thanks.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, Tal, let me take the first one and then I'll let Kelly go into some of the numbers. The switching, I think the biggest thing that I've talked about over the last few months is that we've been going through this transition in the next-generation data center. If you think about what happens in the data center is you've got the traditional data center switching architecture, and then you've got our compute platforms that we sell, and then we have the next-generation data center switching architecture. And the historical architecture we know has been declining as customers transition. Our UCS business was up 24% this quarter, so we're very pleased with those results. And then if you look at the next-generation data center, that's the business that we said eclipsed $0.5 billion this quarter, growing at 140%.","So what I've said about our switching business is that in the second half of the year, we expect the inflection point between the next-generation volume and the historical generation to hit \u2013 we expect to hit that inflection point. So I think you're seeing that next-generation switching in the data center continued to contribute to some of the improvement that you saw. And frankly, we've also had some reasonable performance in the campus. On the services \u2013 or any other comments on switching and then the services, Kelly?","Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I think you hit it right on, on switching. And on services, yes, it was up 1%, which is obviously on the lower end of what we were looking for. And it's driven by a couple things, and we've talked about this before. It is isolated largely within service revenue, the service provider segment within there. So the service providers have been a headwind for us up until the last quarter or so. So the model typically it takes longer for services to feel the impact when the product side goes down, the same way it takes a little bit longer, a few quarters, before they start to see it when the section, the product side comes up. So we're seeing some of that as well as just the service provider segment in general. They're going through a lot of transition as well. So that's a tough segment for us. But it's largely isolated to that.","The only other piece I'll add to that is we are feeling very good about the outlook in services. If you look at our services deferred revenue, that went up 7% year over year this quarter, which is $600 million-plus, almost $700 million, and that's the strongest growth we've seen on that metric for a while. So we feel good about more multiyear deals coming in and future revenue coming from that. But, clearly, this quarter at 1%, it's on the low end and isolated to the service provider section.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Great. Thanks, Tal. Kim, next question.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Pierre.","Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, Chuck. Thank you for taking my question. I'd like to come back on your gross margin. So you're up more than one point sequentially, one point above what you had guided for. And at the same time, so you have subscription and licensing deferred revenue up very significantly, I think 36%. So my first question would be could you give us a bit of a break-up of what are the important drivers of the positive surprise in gross margin?","And then my second question is, when I look at your guidance for next quarter, so you guide 63%, 62% to 63%. I guess you are going to be exiting the set-top box business. So from like you said, 63% level this quarter, it almost feels like not very challenging guidance. So am I missing maybe some kind of sequential headwinds on that number? Thank you.","Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Right, okay. Thanks, Pierre. That's a great question. So, first, to your last point, we definitely have seasonality in our gross margins, if you look back. Typically, Q2s and Q4s have lower gross margins, driven by our mix. Those are very, very big quarters for us on the UCS side, on our data center business. So that's a big part of what's driving it. And conversely, Q2s and Q4s (sic) [Q1s and Q3s] are typically higher. Now I would say again, we had very, very good execution across the board on gross margins, and again, driven by the performance by the teams on the productivity side. So, again, that will continue to help.","When I go to Q2 guidance, you picked right up on it. Q1 still had the set-top box business in it. In my guidance for Q2, I completely removed the set-top box business, which is why it's up a full point of our typical guidance of 61% to 62%. We're now up to 62% to 63% for that benefit. So just to remind you, when we get rid of that business, which we are working to close this quarter, we'll see a benefit of approximately a point on gross margin, about 0.5 point on operating margin rate, and very negligible at the EPS level of things flowing through. So we're baking that in the guidance since my guidance excludes that altogether. But overall, again I just attribute it to the disciplined work on VCP on the productivity side as well as the sales teams being very disciplined on pricing.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Great. Thanks, Pierre. Kim, next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley Investment Research.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much, just a couple of questions. First, Chuck, I'm just wondering if you can give a little more color on routing. If I'm understanding you correctly, it sounds like there may just be some timing issues that made the first quarter, the October quarter look a little bit weaker, but you expect that to bounce back strongly. And maybe you can give a little color on outlook how we should think about routing developing as we go through calendar 2016.","And then my second question is somewhat related. I'm just trying to get a sense for how we should think about security. I know that's been a sector or segment that's been growing slower than the market. It's clearly a point of emphasis for Cisco. I was just wondering how we should think about that and your efforts there starting to manifest themselves. Thank you.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right, James, thanks. I hope you all noticed that we're actually accepting two questions now. I think that \u2013 so good questions. On the routing side, James, you nailed it. It's a timing issue. We had good order growth. Our new routing platforms, the new platforms that we've introduced were up in triple-digits again from an orders' perspective. So we do expect that that will bounce back. And we also have some \u2013 as I said in the earlier comments, we also have some new introductions that will be coming out in the next week or so, so you'll see that. So we feel pretty reasonably well about our routing performance over the coming quarters.","From a security perspective, I think that the team has done a great job. They've integrated the Sourcefire malware capabilities into it, into our firewalls and into some of our routing platforms. So they've done the hard integration work. Last quarter, we added over 2,000 new AMP customers, which is the advanced malware solution. We now have over 8,000 customers there. The revenue grew 7% but our deferred grew 31% as they continue to transition the business to more of a software and subscription. And the team is pretty confident that in the second half of the year we can be back in the mid to high teens from a revenue growth in security.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Great, thanks. Operator, next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brent Bracelin with Pacific Crest.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Brent.","Brent Bracelin - Pacific Crest","Hey, how are you? I'll squeeze in two and we'll go from there. Chuck, for you real quickly, APAC growth 3%, that's the best growth rate you've seen in two years. So what's driving the reversal on APAC relative to orders this quarter?","And then, Kelly, if you could talk a little bit more about this shift to software subscriptions accelerating. Obviously, what does that mean from a revenue growth standpoint per your guide? And obviously, your op margins at the highest in what, nine years, what does that mean from an op margin perspective?","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","You take it, Kelly, on the numbers, and then I'll give some color around Asia.","Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Absolutely. So, yes, I'll hit the software subscription one. So this is a big focus of us both from the acquisitions that we're doing. As you see, most of those have been SaaS businesses or software businesses, as well as internal development. So we've really been focused on driving our software and enterprise agreements across the board, and I think you're seeing that translate onto our balance sheet that we will benefit from. When I look at the amount of our revenue coming off the balance sheet on the product side, it continues to increase, and that's how we're driving all our business units to continue to find those and build those solutions.","I'd say Meraki is a good example in our Cloud Networking group, where basically a third of their business gets deferred the way they sell their solution. So we're going to see more and more of that as we go forward, and we'll see the benefit of that not only on more predictable revenue but also strong margins.","I'd say on the operating margin, to address that, again we had \u2013 it was a great quarter for operating margin. I would say again where we talked about the benefit we're seeing on gross margins, we are being disciplined to make the right tradeoffs. We're going to fluctuate always between quarters, but we are again driving for that profitable growth. And we are looking relentlessly for efficiencies so we can fund the investment into the internal R&D and go to market.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Brent, you indirectly asked, so I'm going to give a little color on what we see going on in Asia. It's really a mixed story from just a performance perspective. China, we have been working and investing in for years, and we've been very focused there over the last few years. And we actually had a very strong quarter in China from an orders perspective, growing over 40% this quarter. Likewise in India, where we've been focused on a lot of country digitization efforts there with the Prime Minister and many of the ministries, and they really see the value of technology and what it can do for their country, it too was up over 40%.","Then when you look at the rest of Asia, it was a real challenge. I believe it was negative 8% for the rest. And we did see some uncertainty creep in relative to those countries, particularly who had trading relationships with China, and also we saw the ripple-through effect of the China currency devaluation. And predominantly \u2013 or let me say, we saw it in some of the Asia countries in particular because they have such trading relationships.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Great. Thanks, Brent. Kim, next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Kvaal with Nomura Securities International.","Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Yes, thanks very much. I wanted to throw my two in as well. Chuck, maybe this is less of a question than giving you an opportunity to talk about the second half. It sounds like you have a few irons in the fire that you're excited about. I'm cognizant that new product introductions usually take two-plus quarters to get going, so I imagine there's something else up your sleeve there a little bit.","And then Kelly, I was wondering. Could you help us perhaps understand a little bit in more detail the impact of the mix shift to subscription billing, how much that is costing you in terms of revenue growth, and when you think that it may normalize so that the revenue growth matches the deferred revenue growth? Thanks.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Jeff. So on the second half, my position right now is that I feel like we're incredibly well positioned, particularly relative to the things we control in our portfolio. I've stated that I think that that inflection point in our data center switching, which has been a challenge for us for many quarters, we believe that will happen in the second half of the year. We've got new product introductions coming out across security, data center, as well as routing and others, so there's probably more innovation pipeline than we've seen in quite a while. I mentioned earlier that our team is pretty confident that our security business from a revenue perspective will get back into the mid-teens in the second half of the year.","And frankly, we believe that some of the acquisition activity as well as the strategic partnerships could show up and begin to contribute positively perhaps sometime in the second half of the year. So I am cautiously optimistic, and I think I just feel like we're well positioned relative to our portfolio and what we control.","Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And to the second part there on how to think about the subscription and software part of the business, I would say you're going to see it a couple ways. I think the amount that we see translate onto our income statement or amortize off on the product side is just going to continue to accelerate. It's been growing in the 15% to 20% every quarter, and that's just going to continue as we look forward because we are growing our SaaS businesses. We are adding to our SaaS businesses with acquisitions. And I'd say on the other parts of our business that haven't traditionally been monetizing through software or licenses, we're coming up with all kinds of different offers that our customers are interested in.","So I'd say we're going to see both the balance sheet deferred side grow. It will continue to be a larger part of our product revenue, growing double digits, but it's still in the 5% to 6% range as of right now on our product revenue. But that will grow in double digits going forward for many quarters.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Great, thanks. Kim, next question.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James & Associates.","Victor W. Chiu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi, this is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. I'd like to ask about trends in public cloud migrations. Some of the networking names that we follow have recently begun to flag the migration of applications from enterprise data centers to the public cloud as a secular headwind for their core business. So can you speak to the trends that you've observed and how that's impacting Cisco or how you envision that impacts your results going forward?","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Victor. Thank you. That's a great question. So the way we see it is that our customers we believe are really committed to a hybrid cloud model. They see workloads that make tremendous sense to be in the public cloud, and then their mission-critical high-performance applications that they will continue to run in a private cloud. And we believe that we can provide the bridge for those customers. And I think if you look at our UCS growth and you look at our next-gen data center growth, that would suggest that customers are still building out data centers and still building out private cloud to take advantage of the requirements they have in high-performance applications, security, mission-critical nature.","So we think it's going be both, and we have a strategy that not only is focused on providing the best infrastructure that we can to those public and service providers who are providing web and cloud services as well as a private cloud as well as the elements of our portfolio where it makes sense to be delivered as a cloud service, we'll continue to make those moves like we have with Meraki as well as security as well as collaboration.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Great. Thanks, Simon. Kim, next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. Just to head back to switching for a minute, a two-parter. On the campus side, it sounds like that was pretty strong in the quarter as well. What are you seeing? Is it Wi-Fi? What are you seeing drive that, and how sustainable do you think it is?","Then on the data center side, it sounds like regaining some market share there. What do you think is helping with the greater than industry growth rate that you're seeing currently from the likes of the Nexus 3000, the Nexus 9000, and the ACI? Is it platform? Is it performance? What do you think is driving that? Thank you.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Tim. Thanks for the questions. So in the campus environment, we've seen several drivers over the last few quarters. This whole move to the Internet of Things and the connectivity of more and more devices, some of which are connected hard-wired, others which are just increasing the wireless spectrum and the bandwidth required, the transition into wireless access to higher speeds like 802.11ac, as well as the strength we've seen in our video endpoint business also translates through to, in many cases, refreshes of the networking infrastructure. And then finally, I think we see customers who are trying to beef up their security and are looking at some of the features that we can build into our campus platforms to increase their security. So those are some of the drivers that we see there.","Looking at data center, I think frankly, the teams have just built an incredible architecture. And it is built to really lower the operating costs and increase our customers' ability to implement policy in the data center in an automated way. I think they've also built incredible high-performance platforms and have given the customer the choice of both merchant as well as high-performance ASICs, and I think that the customers are seeing it. In the Nexus 9000 we added another 900 customers in the quarter. And we're now over 5,000 customers with our Nexus 9000, and it's the fastest ramping data center product that we've ever had. So I think it's a testament to what the teams have built.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Great. Kim, next question.","Operator","The next question comes from Jayson Noland with Robert W. Baird.","Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. Thank you. Chuck, I wanted to ask you to comment on the storage market given the acquisition of EMC or planned acquisition of EMC. Do you need to own storage IP? Or maybe the better question is does it make sense for Cisco to own some storage IP given the pace of innovation in storage and your success with UCS, or is status quo the best plan forward from here?","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Jayson, thanks for the question. So as we look at the future and we look across our entire portfolio candidly, we are assessing what our customers need from us and what solutions they'd like to see from us. And then we will leverage R&D. We'll leverage M&A. We'll leverage co-development. We'll leverage strategic partnerships, and we'll move on any one of those fronts across any area that we need to fulfill the solutions that our customers are looking for.","Specifically, the area you asked about, to date, a partnering strategy has been sufficient for what we need. But you can assume that we are constantly looking at that and other areas and what we need to add to our portfolio. And then we determine whether we're going to do it via acquisition or partnership. But our partnerships so far with IBM, Hitachi, EMC, NetApp, et cetera, have been very positive for us, as you can see through our UCS ramp over the years.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Great. Thanks, Jayson. Kim, next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen & Company.","Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks. Chuck, you mentioned that your largest web-scale customers were up by over 20% again this quarter. It implies that's been the historical trend, but that's the question. What has been the historical trend? Is that the right number? If you can give us insight on that.","And then I've got a question about OpEx as a percentage of revenue going forward for Kelly. What we should expect? Is there more you could do in terms of further improvement? And finally, just quickly employee turnover, both desirable and not desirable, can you update us on that? Thank you.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right, Paul. Now you're getting carried away. I'm just kidding. So let me take the first one on the web-scale side. I think I've talked about it in various forums that we really in the last 12 to 15 months I think really began to embark on building products and working with the web-scale players in a very unique way to make sure that our products really reflected the things that were important to them.","So we've only talked about our growth there for the last couple of quarters. We haven't really focused on it for a while, but I'll tell you that it's really in last year and a half when we really got I think serious with them about building the solutions that they really are looking for. And I think that the growth that we're seeing right now as well as some of the co-development that you're going to see coming out is reflective of that focus. Kelly, on the OpEx?","Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","On the OpEx, so on the OpEx, Paul, we are obviously driving that hard and managing it well. I will say though and just in full disclosure, as you would expect, much of the FX headwinds we're feeling on the top line, we are benefiting from on the OpEx side as well. So we're balancing both of those things. And for this quarter it was a couple hundred million dollars.","So I'd say that we will make the tradeoff on OpEx to balance what the business is facing on margins and top line and everything else because we are being very focused on where we're putting those investment dollars to make sure we are putting the R&D dollars in where the innovation is. So I think what you can take away is that OpEx as a percentage might change as currency changes, but we will manage within there very tightly and disciplined in terms of balancing it with the rest of the business.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Great, thanks. Kim, next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from George Notter with Jefferies.","George Charles Notter - Jefferies LLC","Hi, thanks very much, guys. Earlier you gave a customer count number on the Nexus 9000. I guess I was just curious about the ACI version of that product. It's a number I think you've given in the past.","And then also, I wanted to dig down into currency a little bit more. Kelly, I think you gave a nice comment on the translation impact on currency, and I think there were some comments about Asia and some of the transactional impacts as well. But I guess just digging into your numbers historically, particularly on the BRIC countries, I get the sense that the BRIC countries, some of them like Brazil, Russia, where you've had a real severe impact, you've seen big down comparisons for a period of time now. I guess I'm wondering. Have you hit a bottom in some of those areas of the world and the foreign exchange currency impacts starts to come off over time. So how big is the impact and when does it come off is the question.","Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So what I was referencing \u2013 again, I think for sure the impact that we can see in the countries where we sell in local currency, which is only a few countries, is about two points. So for all the other countries, including the emerging markets and Europe, it's hard for us because we sell in dollars to really quantify the impact, but there's certainly impact on demand.","You're right about Brazil and Russia. They have been challenged for some time. I think the growth in our emerging being up 11% is largely driven by the strength of India and Mexico, which have been very strong for the last five quarters, and now adding onto that China with having broad-based strength is really driving that back up. If I back out the BRICM countries, the rest of the emerging markets are I would say not really growing. They're flattish to up to 3% when I exclude the BRICM countries because they are feeling that impact I would say of currency. And I think there's still the uncertainty if the U.S. raises interest rates what that will further do to U.S. dollar strength.","So it's tough to have the full-view quantification of it, but we do think if the rates stayed where they are today, it might get a little easier of a headwind as we move forward through the year. And now it's just I think the uncertainty enterprises are feeling as well as interest rate uncertainty going forward.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, George, let me circle back to the first question you asked on the ACI. I think you asked the ACI version of the Nexus 9000. I think where we're focused right now is actually looking at customers who are deploying ACI in general, so let me give you that data point. We added 200 more APIC customers, which are those customers that are deploying the policy engine that takes advantage of ACI, and we're over 1,100 customers now that have the APIC. So that's the number that I think you were looking for.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","All right, Chuck, I think that was our last question. Do you want to close?","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, first of all, I want to thank everyone for spending time with us today. And I would close by highlighting three things. The first, I really believe that we are executing incredibly well in a somewhat challenging market. The second is we had very strong execution in our results in Q1. We have solid growth for Q2, and we feel like we're very well positioned again for the second half of the year. The third is we will continue to move very fast in positioning ourselves for future growth opportunities, and I feel very good about how we're positioned in general.","So thank you for spending time with us today and I look forward to talking to many of you soon.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Great, thanks. Cisco's next quarterly call, which will reflect our FY 2016 second quarter results, will be on Wednesday, February 10, 2016, at 1:30 PM Pacific, 4:30 PM Eastern.","Again, I'd like to remind you that in light of Regulation FD, Cisco's policy is to not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it's done through an explicit public disclosure.

Ma'am you may begin.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks, Michelle. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2019 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I\u2019m joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO.","By now, you should have seen our earnings press release, a corresponding webcast with slides including supplemental information will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found in the financial information section of our Investor Relations website.","Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis.","The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements including the guidance we will be providing for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which indentify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.","In Q2, on October 28, we completed the sale of our SPVSS business and accordingly had no revenue or expense from that business in Q3 fiscal 2019. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP, and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SPVSS business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SPVSS business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help understand these impacts. The guidance we provided during our Q2 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way.","I will now turn it over to Chuck.","Chuck Robbins","Thank you, Marilyn, and good afternoon, everyone. We had another strong quarter of performance across the business, demonstrating our ability to execute despite the ongoing uncertainty in both the macro and geopolitical environments. Technology continues to be at the heart of our customer strategy and now more than ever our market-leading portfolio and differentiated innovation is resonating with them as they transform their IT infrastructure.","In the quarter, we delivered strong revenue, margins, non-GAAP earnings growth, and operating cash flow. As we continue to help our customers achieve their business objectives, I am confident about the future of Cisco and the growth opportunities ahead of us.","New technologies like cloud, AI, IoT, 5G, and WiFi 6 among others are coming together to revolutionize the way we operate our businesses and deliver new experiences for our customers and teams.","We are fundamentally changing the way our customers approach their technology infrastructure to address the rising complexity in their IT environments. We are building the only integrated multi-domain intent-based architecture with security at the foundation. This is designed to allow our customers to securely connect their users and devices over any network to any application, no matter where they are.","We are integrating capabilities like artificial intelligence and machine learning across the entire portfolio, so customers have greater insights resulting in better and faster business outcomes.","Now for some highlights across our business. Starting with Infrastructure Platforms. Over the past several years, we've been working to integrate intent-based networking across our enterprise access portfolio to help our customers manage more users, devices, and things connecting to their networks.","We brought to market tremendous innovation across wired, wireless, and enterprise routing, including SD-WAN resulting in a continued strong traction of our enterprise networking portfolio.","We are moving into an era of truly immersive and pervasive wireless connectivity, which generates demand for high density, low latency performance, for real-time experiences over both wired and wireless networks.","Enterprise networks today must be optimized for agility and security, leveraging cloud and wireless capabilities with the ability to garner insights from the data and security integrated throughout. Cisco is in a unique position to deliver this for our customers.","We recently announced several new platforms expanding our enterprise networking portfolio with the launch of our subscription-based WiFi 6 access points and Catalyst 9600 campus core switches purpose built for cloud scale networking.","By combining our automation and analytics software with our broad portfolio of switches, access points, and controllers, we are creating a seamless end-to-end wireless first architecture for our customers. We also expanded our open roaming partnership ecosystem to now include Apple, Intel, Samsung, and others to make Wi-Fi on-boarding simple.","With our newest Catalyst 9000 family additions, we have completed the most comprehensive enterprise networking portfolio refresh in our history. We have rebuilt our entire access portfolio with intent-based networking across wired and wireless. We also now have one unified operating system and policy management platform to drive simplicity and consistency across our customers' networks all enabled by a software subscription model.","In the data center, our strategy is to deliver multi-cloud architectures that bring policy and operational consistency no matter where applications or data resides by extending ACI and our hyperconverged offering HyperFlex to the cloud.","Our partnerships with Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure are great examples of how we continue to work with web-scale providers to deliver new innovation.","For example, we recently introduced Cisco cloud ACI for AWS, a service that allows customers to manage and secure applications running in a private data center or in Amazon Web Services cloud environments.","We also expanded our partnership with Google. We announced support for their multi-cloud platform Anthos to help customers build secure applications everywhere from private data centers to public clouds with greater ease.","Going forward, we will integrate this platform with our broad data center portfolio, including HyperFlex, ACI, SD-WAN, and Stealthwatch cloud to deliver the best multi-cloud experience for our enterprise customers.","Moving to security. We continue to see strong momentum with another quarter of double-digit growth driven by our world-class security portfolio. Cisco is the world's largest cybersecurity company for enterprises with thousands of cybersecurity experts helping our customers globally.","Our portfolio covers the entire threat continuum of the modern enterprise and integrates security into every networking domain. We are enabling all of our customers to transform and secure their networks for the rapidly evolving multi-cloud world.","We have a platform that continuously detects threats and verifies trust. By combining Duo, Umbrella, Stealthwatch, ISE, and Tetration, we offer an end-to-end zero trust architecture that is strongly resonating with customers.","Now turning to applications. We continue to execute very well on our collaboration business. These platforms are becoming increasingly critical to how enterprises operate and manage their workforce. Customers are always looking to enhance their meeting ","experiences and cognitive collaboration is quickly becoming the de facto standard for delivering more personalized experiences and transforming how we work. At Enterprise Connect, we introduced several new cognitive collaboration capabilities within our WebEx portfolio, integrating AI and ML to bring context and intelligence to meetings.","The new innovations we launched include people insights, facial recognition, and WebEx calling, all which helped to increase our customers' productivity, making work simple and seamless.","Going forward, you'll see this greater level of intelligence integrated into every piece of our collaboration portfolio across calling, messaging, meetings, devices, and contact center. We also had another quarter of strong growth in AppDynamics as thousands of customers rapidly adopt our Application Intelligence platform for smarter and faster decision-making.","The ability to manage end-to-end application performance across all cloud environments is increasingly important. AppDynamics is the market leader in application and infrastructure analytics delivering unparalleled innovation. We offer the most comprehensive end-to-end visibility from connected devices and applications to the underlying network providing better application performance and user experience.","To summarize, I'm very proud of the progress our teams have made against our strategic priorities to drive profitable growth, accelerate differentiated innovation for our customers, and successfully execute on our own transformation to more software and subscriptions.","Enterprise IT architectures must transform to help our customers get the most out of all of their IT investments. More than ever, our customers need a trusted partner with an end-to-end architecture strategy to simplify, transform, and secure their businesses and Cisco is that partner.","Kelly I'll now turn it over to you.","Kelly Kramer","Great. Thanks Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter followed by the guidance for Q4. Q3 was a strong quarter across the business. We executed well with solid orders momentum strong revenue growth margins EPS and operating cash flow.","Product orders grew 4%. Total revenue was $13.0 billion, up 6%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 32.2% up 0.2 points. Non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion up 8%. And non-GAAP EPS was $0.78, up 18%.","Let me provide some more detail on our Q3 revenue. Total product revenue was up 7% to $9.7 billion. Infrastructure platforms grew 5% with solid growth across all businesses. Switching had another good quarter with growth driven by the continued ramp of the Cat 9K and strength in our ACI portfolio.","Routing grew driven by SD-WAN. We saw a solid growth in wireless driven by growth across the entire portfolio. And Data Center was up with growth in both HyperFlex and servers. Applications was up 9% with growth across all the businesses. We saw solid growth in Unified Communications software, TelePresence and AppDynamics.","Security was up 21% with strong performance in identity and access, advanced threat and unified threat. We're very pleased also with integration of Duo into the Security portfolio.","Service revenue was up 3% driven by software and solutions support. We continue to transform our business delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 65% of total software revenue, up 9 points year-over-year.","When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our Q3 results year-over-year, there was a 40 basis point positive impact on revenue. We saw solid momentum in Q3 with total product orders growing 4%.","Looking at our geographies; Americas was flat, EMEA was up 9% and APJC was up 6%. Total emerging markets was up 5% with the BRICS plus Mexico down 2%. In our customer segments; Enterprise was up 9%, Commercial grew 5%, Public Sector was up 10% and Service Provider was down 13%.","From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q3 gross margin was 64.6%. In terms of the bottom line from a GAAP perspective, Q3 net income was $3.0 billion and EPS was $0.69. We ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalent and investments of $34.6 billion.","Q3 operating cash flow was $4.3 billion up 79%. Normalized for the $1.3 billion of foreign taxes related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we paid in Q3 of fiscal 2018 operating cash flow was up 16%.","From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $7.5 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $6 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion of our quarterly dividend.","We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. In terms of M&A, we closed on the Luxtera acquisition. These moves are consistent with our strategy of increasing investment in innovation and R&D for our growth areas.","To summarize we had a strong Q3. We executed well with strong top line growth and profitability. We're seeing the returns on the investments we're making in innovation and driving the shift to more software and subscriptions delivering long-term growth and shareholder value.","Let me reiterate our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. This guidance includes a type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. Note that we have normalized our fourth quarter guidance to exclude the SPVSS business for Q4 of fiscal 2018 which we divested on October 28, 2018. We have provided historical financial information for the SPVSS business in the slides that accompany this call.","We expect revenue growth in the range of 4.5% to 6.5% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64% to 65%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 31% to 32% and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 19%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.80 to $0.82.","I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks Kelly. Michelle, let's go ahead and open the lines for questions and start to begin the queuing process.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.","Rod Hall","Yes guys. Thanks a lot for the question. I guess I'm going to ask an obvious one and then from the order volumes another obvious one. I wonder if you could comment on the trade situation and the 25% rate increase, and just kind of give us some idea for how much is contemplated in guidance of that?","And anything else you can tell us about exposure of the business? I know that you guys had said that you thought, if it went to 25% there would be price elasticity effects, so that's the first question.","The second one is obviously the Service Provider orders down 13%. That is quite a lot worse number than we would have expected. So, I wonder if you could just give us any more color on what's happening there? Thanks.","Chuck Robbins","Sure. Thanks Rod. So on the tariffs, if you remember back many months ago when the 10% tariffs were announced, we said, we had basically three phases to our strategy. The first was we would continue the dialog with the administration to make sure they understand the impact.","The second is, we'll continue to do what we've always done which is optimize our supply chain, which we've been doing for the last 20 years. And then the third is, we will make pricing adjustments where necessary if needed. I'll tell you that the team has been working incredibly hard over the last six months.","And so last week when we saw the indication that the tariffs were going to move to 25% on Friday morning, the teams kicked in and we actually have executed completely on everything that we need to do to deal with the tariffs.","We are -- operationally all that we needed to do is now behind us. And we see very minimal impact at this point based on all the great work the teams have done and it is absolutely baked into our guide going forward. So that's the first question.","The second question on the service provider business, look we've always talked about this business as being highly lumpy and very big customer driven, and we've seen quarters where you see several big customers stall, and this is a result. And most of the impact of what we saw was in the Americas. And if you just look at the CapEx spend year-over-year, I think it's in the U.S., Kelly.","The data that we had was -- the CapEx spend overall was down almost 20%. So, this is something that we have always said from one quarter to the next until we get into a real network build out relative to 5G that we knew these quarters were going to be lumpy. So, it was very isolated to the Americas, and I think that the strength in our public sector and our commercial and enterprise business continues to indicate that the innovation that our teams have brought into the portfolio is still resonating with our customers.","Rod Hall","Great. Appreciate it guys. Nice job on the execution in such a tough environment too.","Chuck Robbins","Thank you.","Marilyn Mora","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. You may go ahead.","Ittai Kidron","Thanks, and again congrats on a great quarter and execution. Chuck, maybe you could talk about applications, a big deceleration from the level we've seen over the last four quarters. Clearly AppDynamics is doing well in there, but they'll zoom out now in the marketplace, making a lot of noise. Help us think about WebEx, how that business is doing, how do you feel competitively positioned in the marketplace and how do you think about addressing potential competitive headwinds over there?","Chuck Robbins","Thanks, Ittai. So, a couple of comments. Number one, the WebEx business continues to grow very solidly. We're very happy with what's been going on. The team has done a phenomenal job of really modernizing that platform over the last year under Amy's leadership.","And the other thing to remember is that this is the first quarter where BroadSoft is normalized in the run rate so we've had the benefit of that. So some of the growth rates that you've seen were, obviously, boosted by that over the last few quarters. So that's on the numbers front.","I\u2019ll tell you what, the cognitive collab stuff that was announced at Enterprise Connect, I think is going to be game changing. What we see with some of our competitors is that they're focused on taking four collaboration endpoints into a customer and showing a great simple experience.","And frankly if we take four endpoints in with WebEx, the new WebEx we can show a great, more rich simple experience as well. So, one of the things that we're focused on right now is transitioning all of our customers to our modern platforms, because we've been in this business for years and so our customers have varying combinations of technologies.","So one of the big things that we need to do is get everybody to the most modern platforms, which we think are very competitive. And when you put the cognitive capabilities on top of it that -- if you haven't seen it, we should get you a demo of it, it's pretty powerful. So we're very confident where we are in this space.","Ittai Kidron","Very good. Good luck.","Chuck Robbins","Thank you.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks, Ittai. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead.","Vijay Bhagavath","Yeah, thanks. Hey, Chuck, Kelly, Marilyn\u2026","Marilyn Mora","Vijay, can you speak up a bit? We're having a heard time hearing you.","Vijay Bhagavath","Yeah. Can you guys hear me?","Chuck Robbins","Yeah. That's better. Thank you.","Vijay Bhagavath","Yeah, yeah. First, I mean honestly, I would like to commend you for your recent social contributions. We do monitor that news flow in addition to what's going on in the business with many programs, mitigation programs. Honestly I'd like to commend you on that.","And then on the earnings call question, your General Manager seemed quite excited on this WiFi 6, the Campus core switch. So my question to you and helpful for all of us is, how impactful is this new Wi-Fi 6 refresh and the new Campus core, the Catalyst 6000 refresh heading into the back half, and is there a pull forward across the portfolio or would this just be kind of a point product swap? Thanks.","Chuck Robbins","Yeah. Thanks for your comments, Vijay. On the \u2013 look, I think we have to step back and look at what the team has accomplished on the enterprise networking portfolio. We launched the first Catalyst 9000 in the summer of 2017. And two weeks ago, we completed the portfolio across -- our enterprise routing platforms are going through a refresh, our -- the Catalyst 9000 switching family as well as all of the access points.","And if you go back two years ago, we didn't have a single networking product with a software subscription on it. And today, every product in the enterprise routing space, enterprise Wi-Fi space, and the enterprise campus switching space is sold with a mandatory subscription.","So, the progress that the teams have made is phenomenal. They've also -- we had multiple operating systems running across those different platforms. We've now consolidated it to a single operating system and it all is running under a single automation platform, so that our customers can deploy policy. So, it's been an incredible amount of work that the teams have done.","Now when I look at -- as we've talked about with the customers we're still very early in the transition. If you look at -- you could assume customers used to keep Campus switching products for, I don't know seven years, five to seven years. And we've been at small portions of this portfolio for the last two years, but just very small portions and so we still believe we're in the very early days of the transition.","And what you see -- Wi-Fi 6 is effectively what used to be called 802.11ax. And what's happening now is when you get these high performance access points into the organizations and you get the low latency immersive experience possibilities then it's also going to drive the need to upgrade the backbones.","Our guys like to say behind every great wireless network is a great wired network and so we think it's the beginning of an overarching refresh for our customers as they modernize their infrastructure based on this cloud transition that they're all going through. So that's how we look at it today.","Vijay Bhagavath","Thank you.","Marilyn Mora","Next question please.","Operator","Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.","Sami Badri","Hi, thank you for the question. I'd like to focus in on security and more specifically in the strength in the quarter that you saw. Is that being mainly driven by the new acquisitions you guys have made? Or is that more from legacy? Given that you are refreshing the campus, are you pulling forward some of the more legacy security offerings that you had? Or is this predominantly just strength in the M&A, all the acquisitions you've made being integrated and finally going to market?","Chuck Robbins","I'll give you some color and then, Kelly, I'll let you comment on the breakdown of the numbers. I think, this is being driven -- if you think about what's happening with our customers today, they build their security architecture based on the underlying assumption that, they had users at the edge of the network and they had applications in the private data center.","And so, the way you architect that was you protected your parameter. And now our customers are operating in an environment where they have mobile users everywhere. They have branches out there. They have this explosion of IoT connectivity that's occurring and they have applications that are running in hundreds of different places, between SaaS applications, their private data center, public clouds. And so the whole notion of a security architecture has changed completely and our teams have been building towards that over the last couple of years.","So what happens is, we have to protect the customers' data and their traffic wherever it is, and that's why we've been investing in all these new capabilities, making these acquisitions. And I think that architecture where you can actually see threats across the continuum and then dynamically defend across that same -- those same threat -- that same threat surface area, is what's really driving the growth here. And it's also a part of our business that is very, very, very software-rich and is highly concentrated in subscriptions. And so, we also have that recurring piece of this business, which is what we're trying to drive in the rest of our portfolio. Kelly?","Kelly Kramer","Yes. I think the only thing I'll add to that is -- I mean, it's the revenue growth -- obviously, the Duo acquisition I talked about in the earlier comments was part of it. But I can tell you, it was very broad-based across the entire Security portfolio, including network security, advanced threat, cloud security is a big drivers, so very broad-based.","And just to add to Chuck's comments, don't forget that, because we are embedding security into this Enterprise Networking portfolio, we also benefit from the great growth that we're seeing in Enterprise portfolio.","Sami Badri","Got it. Thank you. And then just small follow-up after this. It's just, are you disclosing recurring revenue percentage of total revenue this quarter, just because some of the comments around subscription? Just wondering, if you're giving that out.","Kelly Kramer","Yes. No, we haven't really given out the software revenue actual number, but I think the last time we gave it out was at our Financial Analyst Conference. And again, we're growing very quickly the software portfolio in line, if not faster than what we had talked about then.","Sami Badri","All right. Thank you. ","Chuck Robbins","So, well on track or ahead of where we told everyone we would be at the Financial Analyst Conference in 2017.","Sami Badri","Got it. Thank you very much.","Kelly Kramer","Okay.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks, Chuck. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Paul Silverstein with Cowen & Co.","Paul Silverstein","Thanks. Two quick clarifications and a question. Kelly, you announced this shortly, but can you talk about the rate of price erosion and what you're seeing specifically with respect to DRAM? And then, Chuck, on your comment earlier about the 25% tariff, I apologize if I misunderstood, but I just want to make sure. Are you telling us that you shifted all of your supply chain out of China, so there's no exposure going forward? Or is it just a matter that you've incorporated into your guidance?","And then for the question, some of your smaller peers have commented about a pause in wireless LAN and related switching deployments. As customers are waiting for Wi-Fi 6, you've now rolled out your Wi-Fi 6 Access Points, you upgraded the new 9600, et cetera, are you seeing that pent-up demand?","Kelly Kramer","So maybe I'll start with the first few and then Chuck you can hit on the wireless. So, Paul, on price, we continue to be very disciplined on price. And what you'll see in the Q is from a product gross margin rate impact, it was 1.1 points year-over-year. So right in line, if not, slightly better than what has been in the last few quarters.","And to your question on DRAM, yes, as we expected DRAM turned this quarter and became a tailwind for us in Q3. So that is part of why I guided Q3 gross margin where I didn't -- than where we actually ended up on our gross margin at the 64.6%. We're benefiting from that.","And if I'll just comment a little bit on the tariff question, as Chuck said, it is baked in our guidance. And from what we have baked in, there will be -- there we still have some manufacturing happening in China, but we've greatly, greatly reduced our exposure working with our supply chain and our suppliers.","So the impact that we're expecting that -- again, we're trying to mitigate. We have incorporated in the guide that we gave for Q4 and we think we can manage through that. Of course, we'll be watching that as the quarter goes on.","Chuck Robbins","Yes. And, Paul, then on the Wi-Fi, I don't think -- we've not -- I don't think we've seen any substantive change on the Wi-Fi front. I saw some of the same comments earlier in the week, I think. But in general, I think, our customers -- I think that most of our customers are just continuing to build out and I think they'll transition now to the new WiFi 6-enabled ones and keep moving.","Kelly Kramer","We launched in the last week of our quarter, so it was too early for the -- take any -- ","Chuck Robbins","Yes. We wouldn't have any, given when we launched. And the tariffs, I'll tell you, our teams have just done an amazing job. I mean that's the bottom line. And so everybody worked so hard to a point where literally last week the teams executed on everything incremental we needed to do to deal with it. And it's relatively immaterial at this point and it's baked in the guide.","Paul Silverstein","Super. Thank you.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks, Paul. We'll take our next question?","Operator","Thank you. Jim Suva with Citigroup Global Markets. You may go ahead.","Jim Suva","Thank you very much. Some companies have talked about pauses in demand, whether it be digestion of inventory, such as overbilling a uncertainty economic environment. It appears, if I'm reading your outlook and your results pretty correctly, you haven't seen that.","Can you maybe help us bridge the gap of was it -- did you just have a lot better pulse on the inventory in the channel? Or end markets a little different? Because if I remember right, I think, your cloud sales are north of 20%, but maybe below 30% or something, but we've heard a lot about a pause in cloud spending. Thank you.","Chuck Robbins","Yes. I think, the only area where we saw a real shift was in service provider. And across the rest of the business, look, we watch the same TV shows you guys watch. We see the same stress around the world. We see the same risks.","But if you go back and look at our quarter, if you just -- obviously SP was SP. But in general our linearity from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter was pretty much the same as it was in the same quarter a year ago, based on where we ended up. So outside of SP, I don't think we saw any substantive change.","Kelly Kramer","No. It was really SP. And Jim just to clarify because I saw your note that you published when you say cloud \u2013 if you're meeting the subset web scale, I guess that's not the correct number out there what our \u2013 we've never \u2013 we haven't given it out but I just want to make sure that that's not really kind of like what our web-scale exposure is.","Jim Suva","Got you. Okay. Thank you so much for the clarification. Its greatly appreciated. Thank you.","Marilyn Mora","Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.","James Faucette","Great. Thank you very much. I just wanted to ask a couple of questions perhaps maybe for Kelly on a couple of small things. First deferred revenue was down a little bit quarter-over-quarter and I know that there's been some adjustments around 606. So I'm just wondering, if we can get a little reflection kind of what the mix is doing there. And then also I know you addressed gross margins and some benefit and tailwind you got from components there. But at least the numbers were reported it seemed like a lot of that improvement was concentrated in the APAC region. And just wonder, if we're interpreting that correctly. And if so was there anything unique happening there perhaps that we didn't see in the rest of the world?","Kelly Kramer","Yeah. So first the deferred revenue. Yeah \u2013 no it's a great pickup. I will say the only thing that's kind of changed in the deferred revenue is \u2013 and we kind of talk about this maybe a couple of calls ago is really driven by our collab business. They've gone much more to month-to-month billing. So therefore, it doesn't flow through deferred revenue anymore whereas in the past we might \u2013 it might be financed with customers or it would go through \u2013 they'd pay upfront. Now it's really going month-to-month which again is just how it's recognized through the balance sheets. So that's really what's driving it.","If you look at the rest of our businesses like with the ramp of the subscriptions of the Enterprise portfolio as well as Security those are all growing quarter-on-quarter. And as you know, the big tick-down from a year ago is because of the change of the accounting standard down. But from a business operational thing the only change is \u2013 quarter-on-quarter is really just the shift to the collab business going more month-to-month versus paying upfront.","James Faucette","And can I just ask just a quick follow-up there? And so when should we expect that to stop being a drag? And \u2013 or are we going to see that happen across other parts of the business that you could see some volatility there?","Kelly Kramer","No. I think you're going to continue to see \u2013 I mean, again the collab I think is just going through that just how we're changing our offer and what we're offering there. But I think the rest of the business is going to continue to start building up. So, you'll see that get back to I'd say growing here over the next few quarters.","James Faucette","Okay. And then the gross margin is seemingly concentrated in APAC. Any major reason for that?","Kelly Kramer","Yeah. Actually, the gross margin in APAC was literally very focused mostly in Japan and mostly driven by our \u2013 some big deals in Service Provider that had some lower margins and the typical average that we have in Japan. But it's very isolated to that.","James Faucette","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Kelly Kramer","Yep.","Marilyn Mora","Michelle, let's go ahead and take the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. You may go ahead, sir.","Mitch Steves","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I only have two. One in kind of the securities side and secondly maybe some back half update. On the security side, growing with 20% plus. I think that back a couple of years ago people would never believe that and would have viewed Cisco as kind of a shared owner. So I guess what has changed in terms of the products that you guys are selling? And then secondly do you think that's something that's more sustainable or let's call it teens growth instead of the historical 10% growth? And then secondly, I know Cisco used to kind of give kind of IT spend number. Can you maybe provide us any sort of commentary in terms of what you guys think of the back half? I mean is the demand environment you guys view better worse or kind of the same? Because I think it's a little bit difficult to figure out what you guys are going to grow out considering the first half has already been solid. So I just wanted to know if you can give any color there as well.","Chuck Robbins","Yeah, Mitch. So, on the security front I think it's really what I was talking about earlier. The architectures in our \u2013 for our customers have changed. And I know \u2013 I can remember conversations a couple of years ago about things that we're building. And team would tell me, look we're building for where our customers are going to be next year and the year after. And so, because I was debating with them in some cases about where they were investing and they were right. So they've -- we've had some very strategic acquisitions that have contributed to it and continue to grow.","And I do believe that this \u2013 the architecture approach as opposed to historically what we've seen which is when you're defending a perimeter you just \u2013 you can just buy the best-of-breed all around. And just like if I'm defending e-mail, I buy this. If I'm \u2013 I put in a firewall here and it can be \u2013 they don't have to necessarily communicate. And today the architecture really requires a platform where you ingest threat information from lots of different sources and then you dynamically defend across all those same vectors and I think that's what the teams have built. So as far as growth rates we'll have to see. I'm sure they'll move around based on acquisitions and other things that we do. But I think that we're quite happy with where the teams are. I think it's a good solid business for us for a very long time.","As far as the IT spending look I don't have anything to add to what we \u2013 what you've heard. I think that in today's world we've \u2013 I've said repeatedly that I've been pretty amazed at the resiliency of the global economy over the last couple of years. There are certainly \u2013 as I said early in our prepared comments there's a lot of dynamics at play around the world. There is a lot of geopolitical issues. We've heard some macro issues in certain cases. And we're just going to continue to execute on the things that we can do. And \u2013 but what's going to happen six months from now I don't have any greater visibility I don't think than anybody else. So.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks, Mitch.","Mitch Steves","Got it. Thank you so much.","Marilyn Mora","Yep. Apologies for that. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Jeff Kvaal from Nomura Instinet. You may go ahead.","Jeff Kvaal","Yes. Thank you. Just following up on the prior question about web scale. Your progress on web scale has been a little bit TBD for a number of years. I'm wondering, what you can tell us about when you think your efforts in that regard might pay-off, if you think the 400-gig migration is an entry point for you. Or what do we have to look forward to in that particular vertical?","Chuck Robbins","Yeah, it's a very valid question. And we have a lot of things going on with the web-scale providers today. I think 400 gig certainly will represent an opportunity for us to insert. I think that the architectural transition points is really where you have an opportunity. We've known that for decades from working with the telcos and service providers. You typically don't insert into an existing architecture. It really requires a transition.","So, I think thinking about those kinds of things and 400 gig would be representative of that. But to give you any time line I think we're just going to have to wait and keep plugging away. We're still making progress. We've made a ton of progress on the relationship side. We've got a lot of deep technical discussions that are going on. They're spending a lot of time on our Campus with us. So, we continue to make progress but these are big long-term decisions that they're making and we're going to keep plugging away.","Jeff Kvaal","Okay. Well, I'll keep asking then I guess. And then Kelly from your side what can you tell us -- I guess I mean the mix to software does continue to increase. What can you tell us about where you would like the gross margins to be over an intermediate timeframe or whatever timeframe you choose I guess? Fingers crossed.","Kelly Kramer","Yes, I mean again I think if you go back and look over the last couple of years of where -- just when you look at our guide over the last three years we've steadily moved up our gross margins. And I think if you go back three years we were guiding 61% to 62%. We've steadily come up. And when I guided Q3 I moved up another 0.5 point to get to the 63% 64%.","So, again you're seeing that go through our gross margins as we're going up there. I think there's always puts and takes. We have the natural price erosion that we see every quarter but we're driving productivity. DRAM turnaround is helping us a lot and that's going to help us with positivity there. It's going to help us if we do have again incremental costs we can offset whether it's tariffs or anything else.","So, the 64% to 65% here we're guiding now I think is pretty good. And our whole goal and the whole reason we're making the shift to software besides to continue innovation is it's a great way to drive margin accretion. So, you're just going to continue to see us shift our portfolio that way.","Jeff Kvaal","Okay. Thank you.","Kelly Kramer","Yes. All right Michelle, let's tee-up the next question.","Operator","Thank you. Jim Fish with Piper Jaffray, you may go ahead.","Jim Fish","Hey Chuck and Kelly congrats on a fantastic quarter and execution here. Maybe just going back to Rod's initial question specifically around 5G. Maybe what products do you expect to benefit with or are you seeing orders for already? I know its early days.","But then Kelly maybe you could discuss is there going to be any impact related to the shift of VNS on the model? Like should we expect lower revenue contribution in the cycle but higher gross margin kind of going off to what you were just saying before to? Thanks.","Chuck Robbins","Okay. Jim so let me -- on the 5G front I think there's a couple of things I would call out. Number one the CapEx data that we saw last quarter -- and even the forecast don't look incredibly healthy for these guys. But where they are spending money primarily today as it relates to 5G is they're building out the macro radio portion of their networks first and they're leveraging their existing core networks to run the early trials that they have on 5G basically.","And we believe that sometime in the future when they have -- when the number of connections increases and the capacity gets to a point then they're obviously going to begin to build out these new backbones dedicated to the 5G infrastructure which is where we will generally come into play.","We're also obviously selling them packet core technology for the new 5G networks today but the big play for us is when they begin to evolve their networks to accommodate the traffic. And we've always said we felt like that would be sometime in calendar 2020.","We're working with lots of them on architectural designs and where they're going but it's really going to be core routing backbone technology where we're going to see -- we should see the big impact from 5G. And we'll obviously have to wait and see how it plays out.","Kelly Kramer","Yes. And just on the VNS I would just say I don't SP customers are a little different than Enterprise customers right? Everybody's looking for automation and software-defined everything and I think our entire portfolio is moving that direction. And it's just the nature of the beast whether it's SP or enterprise right? Prices for core are getting less and less the more that we're driving just more throughput and everything else. So, it's nothing VNS-specific but it's the entire portfolio. The software value -- the values where the software is in the automation that we're bringing to our customers.","Jim Fish","Great. Thanks. Congrats again.","Kelly Kramer","Thanks. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Steve Milunovich from Wolfe Research, you may go ahead.","Steve Milunovich","Thank you. First Kelly any concern about bridging the 4% order growth to the 4.5% to 6% revenue growth? And maybe while you're talking about that you could net out the year-over-year impact of 606 M&A which I think you gave us and then deferred which I think is still a bit of a drag and maybe how that might look next quarter.","And then Chuck I think you wanted to kind of tweak the culture a bit when you came in. And if you could update us in terms of things like your Net Promoter Score externally your return on employee surveys how you sort of assess the culture and if that's part of the results that we're seeing.","Chuck Robbins","Kelly?","Kelly Kramer","Yes sure. So, I'll take the topline first. So, yes, the 4% orders growth again like Chuck said if you look at the rest of the business they were all up the 9% for enterprise 10% for public sector 5% for commercial. So that's all great strengths. It's service provider where we had the issue.","And as you know when we guide we have what's sitting in backlog. We can -- we have very good visibility into the pipeline and we have -- we work with all our regional sales leaders in terms of what they're seeing. So, we feel very comfortable with the guide that we're giving you based on all of those factors. So, it's basically incorporated for the SP slowdown that we saw in the orders.","In terms of the revenue question so yes we talked about acquisitions. It's really only Duo and a very tiny bit of Luxtera as our inorganic from the acquisition. So, it was only 40 basis points of our growth. And the 606 impact this quarter was only 1.2 points so it was a relatively small number compared to the other quarter. So, it was 1% -- slightly over 1% 1.2 points from that perspective.","And then on the deferred it's -- that's more of a one of the puts and takes on the margin driver because we are like for example on the Enterprise Networking portfolio deferring we're still deferring. Even though we're deferring last, we're still deferring. So that kind of -- as we have these new replacement products that we have the subscription on. That hurts your rate a little bit, but it's nothing material. So from a revenue, the 606 and acquisitions are fairly small.","Chuck Robbins","And Steve, on the culture issue, we've basically I think been amplifying what's always been a core part of Cisco, but really, really prioritizing it and trying to just create an environment in today's world where people want to work because it's an incredibly competitive environment for talent. And I guess, the way that we look in metrics -- we've been focused on communication with our employee\u2019s, clear authentic frequent communication. We've been focused on giving back. And what we've discovered is that we have a lot of employees who care deeply about giving back to their communities and so I've told them that our ability to give back and our ability to do the things that they love to do is highly contingent upon us running a great business. And so the two are very interconnected.","As far as how do we rate it? I mean if you look at every external employer ranking, we've moved up. The one -- I tell you around the world, great places to work. I think we're number one in countries around the world, maybe 15 to 20 countries around the world. And in the U.S. which is one that just came out recently, we -- I think when I became CEO, we're number 87 in the U.S. And two months ago, we were rated number six. And over 70% of the input for that rate -- those rankings come directly from the employees. And we obviously watch Glassdoor where we're above 4.0 and all those kinds of things. So we're working very hard on it. We think it's important because of -- it's important because when your employees are happy, they actually do a much better job and help the overall results. So it's somewhat cyclical.","Steve Milunovich","Thank you.","Marilyn Mora","All right. I believe, we have time for one last question.","Operator","Thank you. Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research, you may go ahead.","Pierre Ferragu","Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Chuck, I heard you talk about how Cisco technology gets small and more integrated with the platform of leading cloud vendor. As you can imagine, I love hearing that having different -- quite a long time that the Enterprise IT will expand into the cloud that this is going to migrate to the cloud. So I was curious to hear from you a bit more on that in terms of how big it is today in your business. I don't know if you have any idea of the take rate of Cisco technology that are moved to -- that are integrated with the cloud vendors. And if so how do you go to market with the technology? Do you go to market in partnership with cloud vendors? Is that something you have directly to your clients? And of course any idea of the business model how big it is in your revenues already today.","Chuck Robbins","Yes. Thanks Pierre. It's really hard to quantify because the technology that we're building that is either integrated in with the cloud providers or offered off the cloud platforms or enabling our customers to transition to the cloud or expand to the cloud as you put which is the same word we like to use. So we appreciate you coming up with that. We still -- it's everything from extending ACI from the private data center into the cloud to offering virtualized routing functions off of AWS and Azure for developers, virtualized security services even to the SD-WAN technology and now integrating it with our cloud security gateways and then the integration of some of these hybrid stacks like Azure Stack or what we talked about from Google that they announced recently integrating that with our technology on-premise the Kubernetes stack that we've done.","So there's an awful lot of areas where we play. We talk about the fact that while customers are moving some applications to the cloud, they didn't move their employees to the cloud. And so there's a big opportunity which is what we've been focused on which is to evolve this access portfolio to really enable this transition to the cloud that our customers have been undertaking.","So it really is touching massive amounts of our portfolio and I think you'll only see us continue to drive more technology that facilitates our customers' move in this area. So appreciate the question.","Chuck Robbins","So I'll wrap up. I want to thank everybody for spending time with us today. Obviously, we're proud of what our teams continue to accomplish. We're operating in an environment that has very complex macro and geopolitical dynamics right now. But we're continuing to execute as well as we can on the things that we control and that's what we plan to do going forward. So thanks for spending time with us today and we look forward to talking to you again next quarter.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks Chuck. This is Marilyn. Just want to close up the call here.

Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.","In Q2, on October 28, we completed the sale of our SPVSS business and accordingly had no revenue or expense from that business in Q4 fiscal 2019. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP, and product orders information we will be discussing today is normalized to exclude the SPVSS business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SPVSS business in the slides that accompany this call and on our Web site to help understand these impacts. The guidance we provided during our Q3 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way.","With that, I will now turn it over to Chuck.","Chuck Robbins","Thank you, Marilyn. Good afternoon everyone.","Our Q4 results marked a strong end to great year. Our teams executed well through a very dynamic environment. We delivered significant innovation across our entire portfolio and we continued our business model transition with software subscriptions now at 70% of total software revenue, up 12 points year-over-year. We delivered strong revenue and double-digit non-GAAP earnings per share growth for the full year and in the fourth quarter. We also continue to generate healthy margins, cash flow, and returns for our shareholders.","Our technology is fundamentally redefining IT architectures to help our customers manage the complexities of a multi-cloud world and transform for the future. Let me cover some recent highlights across our portfolio.","Starting with infrastructure platforms. We continue to see strong performance with broad based growth across the majority of our portfolio led by our next generation enterprise networking solutions. Over the last two years, we have built a foundation for intent-based networking by rearchitecting our entire networking portfolio to deliver new capabilities through our automation platform.","At Cisco Live, we launched several new technology innovations across networking domains to more effectively secure and manage users and applications across the entire enterprise from campus networks and wide area networks, to data centers and the IoT Edge.","We also added several AI and ML software capabilities to improve network management through automation. A great example of this is our new AI network analytics capability which delivers greater visibility and insights across the entire enterprise network.","In data center, we continue to execute well as we help enable our customers to securely access their applications and their data anywhere from private to public cloud environments as well as at the Edge. We are innovating across every facet of our portfolio integrating AI, automation, security, and assurance into our Nexus switching platforms and our 400-gig offerings. This quarter, we delivered data center network insights providing critical analytics and proactive network management capabilities through automation to increase our customers' ability to troubleshoot and remediate their environments.","We also continue to invest in silicon and optics to build the next generation Internet for our customers. The recently announced intent to acquire Acacia is a good example of how we are enhancing our silicon and optics portfolio to enable web scale service provider and data center operator customers to meet today's fast growing consumer demand for data.","Now turning to security, which had an incredible year. Cybersecurity continues to be the top priority for our customers, driving another consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. As the industry leader in networking and cybersecurity, we're investing in and extending our subscription-based security innovations across all networking domains in today's zero trust environment. By extending our ability to detect threats across public clouds and by protecting the campus, branch, WAN, and data center against threats, we are the only company providing an integrated end-to-end security architecture across multi-cloud environments.","Throughout the year, we've expanded our family of cloud security solutions to help secure identity, endpoints, and the network, which has led to accelerating customer adoption as they move or expand to the cloud. We're also extending this protection from the network to branch offices to roaming users with flexible solutions designed to secure our customers\u2019 SD-WAN environments.","During the quarter, we were excited to announce the availability of a full Web proxy capability on our global SaaS platform umbrella to complement our on-premise appliances. Trust plays a critical role as customers access their network and applications, and identity plays a critical role in delivering a secure consistent experience no matter how, when, or where they connect. This market dynamic was central to our Duo Security acquisition, and we continue to see customer momentum -- customer momentum reflecting the power of Duo's differentiated market leading SaaS platform.","Moving to applications. Our collaboration business continues to perform well as we execute against our strategy to accelerate the future of work, communications, and collaboration. Earlier this year, we shared our vision for cognitive collaboration, which we believe is quickly becoming the foundation to deliver massively personalized experiences and transform how we work. We are leading the market in integrating AI. and ML into our enterprise collaboration portfolio bringing intelligence and context to help our customers work smarter and increase productivity.","Through our AI-driven innovations like people insights, facial recognition, and Webex Assistant, we're driving expanded collaboration experiences on any device integrated with our customer's business process workflows. Building on these cognitive innovations, we announced our intent to acquire Voicea, a market-leading provider of voice-based artificial intelligence solutions. With Voicea's technology, we will enhance our entire Webex portfolio with a powerful transcription service combining AI and automated speech recognition to enable more actionable meetings, improve productivity, and enhance experiences.","We also achieved another outstanding quarter of growth with our AppDynamics demonstrating rapid customer adoption of our differentiated end-to-end visibility and analytics platform from the end user to the network to the application.","In summary, we had a great quarter and finish to fiscal year 2019, and I'm proud of what our teams have accomplished. We are executing well in a time of uncertainty, delivering differentiated innovation across our portfolio, and extending our market leadership and enterprise networking applications and security.","Our performance reflects our relevance as well as the ongoing value we're providing our customers as they transform for the future. We are as committed as ever to providing them with the right innovation to drive greater impact and success.","As I look ahead, I could not be more confident about our unique position in the market and the tremendous opportunity in front of us.","Kelly, I'll now turn it over to you.","Kelly Kramer","Thanks Chuck.","I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter. Then cover the full fiscal year followed by the guidance for Q1. Q4 was a great quarter across the business. We executed well with strong revenue growth, margins, net income, and EPS. Total revenue was 13.4 billion, up 6%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 32.6%, up 1.4 points. Non-GAAP net income was 3.6 billion, up 9%, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.83, up 19%.","Let me provide some more detail on our Q4 revenue. Total product revenue was up 7% to 10.1 billion, infrastructure platforms grew 6%, all of the businesses were up with the exception of routing. Switching had a great quarter with double-digit growth, driven by both campus and data center with the continued ramp of the Cat9k and strength of the Nexus9k.","We saw solid growth in wireless across the portfolio. Data center was up with growth in both HyperFlex and Servers. Routing declined due to weakness in service provider. Applications was up 11% with collaboration, AppDynamics, and IoT software all up double digits. Security was up 14% with strong performance in identity and access, advanced threat, unified threat, and Web security.","Service revenue was up 4% driven by software and solution support. We continue to transform our business delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions where 70% of total software revenue up 12 points year-over-year. When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our Q4 results year-over-year, there was a 60 basis point positive impact on revenue.","In terms of orders in Q4, total product orders growth was flat. Looking at our geographies Americas was up 1%, EMEA was up 4% and APJC was down 8%. Total emerging markets was down 8% with the BRICS plus Mexico down 20%. In our customer segments, enterprise was down 2%, commercial grew 7%, public sector was up 13% and service provider was down 21%.","Remaining performance obligations or RPO at the end of Q4 was 25.3 billion. RPO is our deferred revenue plus unbilled deferred and represents total committed non-cancelable future revenue. From a non-gap profitability perspective, total Q4 gross margin was 65.5% up to 2.3 points. Product gross margin was 64.7% up 2.8 points and service gross margin was 67.9% up 0.7 points.","In terms of the bottom-line from a GAAP perspective, Q4 net income was 2.2 billion and EPS was $0.51. The GAAP results include a charge of approximately $900 million, which is a reversal of a tax benefit recorded in Q4 fiscal year '18, which relates to new U.S. Treasury Regulations issued during the quarter related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.","We ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of 33.4 billion, operating cash flow was 3.9 billion down 4%. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned 6 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of 4.5 billion of share repurchases and 1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend.","In our Q2 fiscal '18 earnings call, we said we would return 31 billion through share repurchases over the following 18 to 24 months. As of Q4 fiscal '19, we completed that commitment with share repurchases of 32.6 billion.","Going forward, we will return to our capital allocation strategy of returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders annually through share repurchases and dividends.","We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline, during Q4 we announced our intent to acquire Acacia, an existing supplier that is focused on Optical Interconnect Technologies. This move is consistent with our strategy of increasing investment and innovation and R&D for our growth areas.","I'll now cover the full fiscal year results. We delivered strong revenue growth margins, net income, EPS and operating cash flow. Revenue was 51.7 billion up 7%, total non-GAAP gross margin was 64.6% up 0.3 points and our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 32.3% up 0.7 points.","From a bottom-line perspective, non-GAAP net income was 13.8 billion up 9% and non-GAAP EPS was $3.10 up 20%. GAAP net income was 11.6 billion and GAAP EPS was $2.61.","We delivered operating cash flow of 15.8 billion up 16%, normalized for the tax payments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in each fiscal year and the cash received in Q1 fiscal '19 related to the legal settlement with Arista, operating cash flow was up 8%.","To summarize, we had a strong Q4 and fiscal year. We executed well a strong top-line growth and profitability and we're seeing the returns in the investments we're making in innovation, driving the shift to more software and subscriptions delivering long-term growth in shareholder value.","Let me reiterate our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal '20. This guidance includes a type of forward-looking information that Marilyn refer to earlier. Note that we have normalized our first quarter guidance to exclude the SPVSS business for Q1 fiscal '19, which we divested in October 28, 2018. We have provided historical financial information for the SPVSS business in the slides that accompany this call.","We expect revenue growth in the range of 0% to 2% year over year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64% to 65%. The non-gap operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 32% to 33% and non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 20%. The 1% increase in tax rate over fiscal '19 is primarily due to a forecasted decrease in tax benefit from foreign income. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.80 to $0.82.","I'll turn it back to Marilyn, so we can move into the Q&A.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks Kelly. Michelle let's go ahead and tee up and open the line for questions. And while Michelle is doing that I'd like to remind the audience to limit yourself to one question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.","Rod Hall","Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess I'm going to ask the obvious one and then maybe pepper in a little bit of detailed color if I can get it. The guidance is weaker than, I think we had anticipated, we know it's a tough macro environment. So, just hoping Chuck that you would maybe comment on that? And maybe juxtapose the change in trend in enterprise orders which did weaken quite a bit with commercial which seems to be holding up fine and kind of why that is going on? And then, Kelly, if you could comment on backlog as well, I know you guys usually give it in the K, so it would be great to get that number as well. Thanks.","Chuck Robbins","Hey, Rod. Thanks for the question. So, let me start by saying first of all the strategy and the work that we've done on our portfolio and the engagement with our customers is absolutely going in the right direction and we continue to make progress and the strategy is working. So, we're quite happy with what our teams have accomplished and where we are right now in that space. There's a couple of things that we saw in the quarter and I'll outline these, and then I'll answer Rod to your question about the enterprise.","First is that, we had continued challenges in service provider and I'll double click on that in just a moment. As you saw in the order growth that Kelly talked about. And then, we did see in July some slight early indications of some macro shifts that we didn't see in the prior quarter. So, those are the two things that happened.","Let me double click on service provider just a bit. The Americas was generally the same from an order perspective from the prior quarter, so no real shift positive or negative. Europe was actually positive in the SP space. In Asia, we saw continued weakening in our China service provider business and we had two massive build outs in India a year ago that just didn't replicate this year with the two major players there. That's the net of the service provider situation it's not more complicated than that.","If you look at our overall business, our orders outside of service provider grew mid-single digits. So, we feel good in this environment about the rest of the portfolio and the work that we're doing to those customers. As it relates to commercial enterprise and public sector and I'm going to probably give you a little more granularity than normal just so you understand with what we believe went on.","You can see that the portfolio that is being sold into all three of those segments is obviously being well received. Our public sector business on a global basis was up 13%. So, we continue to see success and as you mentioned Rod, global commercial was up 7. The enterprise business was really, we saw weakness in China, which was contributed to it. We saw some weakness in the U.K. in enterprise, and then candidly in the U.S. as much as I don't want to use compares for an excuse, we had two major software deals a year ago that were tough to compare against. So, that's really it. The rest of the business and everything we see is still very positive, and we feel good about where we are.","Rod Hall","Thanks for that Chuck.","Kelly Kramer","Yes. Right, on your backlog question, since we adopted ASC 606, we've been disclosing our RPO, which is a more meaningful metric of our future revenue because again with the problem with our backlog, it didn't include our subscription businesses, so it didn't include anything on collaboration or security. So, RPO has everything it has, the deferred revenue, the unbilled deferred, and any committed future revenue and like we\u2019ve disclosed in our Qs, we expect -- of that 25.3 billion, we expect about 56% of that to be recognized over the next 12 months.","Rod Hall","Okay. Thanks a lot Kelly.","Kelly Kramer","Yes.","Marilyn Mora","Next question please.","Operator","Paul Silverstein with Cowen. You may go ahead.","Paul Silverstein","I appreciate it. Just a follow-up from Rod's question, Chuck, a clarification. I felt China was not down or had been down for a while. So, well, less than 3% of revenue and I guess that's not zero. So, you still have exposure. But, I'm surprised it impacted you to the extent you suggested.","And then, I want to ask Kelly about the pricing environment, I assume there's been no change in what we should expect for margins throughout the year. I assume they're going up on both the gross and the operating line given DRAM and the ongoing shift in software, along with benign pricing environment, but if you could comment on that.","Chuck Robbins","Yes. Let me just comment on the China situation. I mean you're right, it's down below 3, it's a small part of our business, but obviously when it falls very dramatically, it can still have some impact because it is greater than zero. But, long term, it's not a concern that I worry about much at this point. And so, that's really the extent of what we saw there. I mean the China reduction contributed to a point of the issue in all of enterprise for us. So, it was that significant, and we definitely saw significant impact on our business in China as it relates to what's going on with the trade war right now.","Kelly Kramer","And then, Paul on your margin question. So, yes, pricing, the environment stays good, actually we had a very good quarter on pricing. It was less than a point that you'll see when we give you the Q. So, that's been very good. And again, you can see, we are benefiting in our gross margins and OMs from the tailwind from DRAM as we expected and you're seeing that in not only the results but also as we've been guiding on the margin.","Paul Silverstein","Appreciate it.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks Paul. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Tejas Venkatesh from UBS. You may go ahead.","Tejas Venkatesh","Thank you. You obviously give a year-over-year order growth number every quarter, but I wonder if you could give us a sense of what the sequential looks like versus historical seasonality. If I have my math right sequential order growth looks somewhat in line with seasonality, but your revenue guide is a tad below where you've grown sequentially in recent years. So I just want to confirm that's right.","And then, secondly, you're coming off a strong year of 7% revenue growth. I know you don't guide for the year, but expect -- investor expectations were somewhat high and I wonder if you could comment even qualitatively on how to think about full year revenue growth. Thank you very much.","Kelly Kramer","Hey, Tejas. So, yes, you're right on our sequential down orders. I mean if we've had this phenomena -- it's not a phenomena, but our Q4 always has a double-digit growth in Q4, it's our largest quarter from a dollar perspective on orders growth for us. So, that happen and then I -- again in Q1 it's double-digit down. So, the sequential isn't a change from historical and again the year-over-year takes into account the kind of phenomenon we're seeing now.","In terms of the long-term guide, again, we don't give more than one quarter. I would say to Chuck's earlier point in terms of how we feel about the portfolio and the margins and the update we feel good about that. The macro and the certain segment issues like SP, I think that I don't foresee that. I'm not planning on that changing in the near-term.","Marilyn Mora","Okay. Thanks Kelly. Michelle, next question.","Operator","Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.","Sami Badri","Hi. Thank you. I was hoping you could kind of just give us an update on the campus switching refresh. And then, perhaps maybe your view on where we'll be next year as you see the campus switching cycle playing out and maybe even potentially more consistent data center switching deployments play out especially, since we're going through some transitions in an industry. So, I guess what I really wish we all understand is, where we are in the cycle, where we in like the fifth maybe sixth maybe even first or second ending the way you see it and then maybe the equivalent of where we see that for data center switching for your customers?","Chuck Robbins","Hey, Sami. Thanks. It's a great question. So, in the last 120, 180 days, I mean we completed the full refresh of our portfolio across switching, routing and wireless in the enterprise. And we're now in a position where all of those have mandatory subscriptions. So we've made that transition from a product development perspective and now those are all out in the marketplace with our customers.","On the catalyst 9000, Q4 was the -- we added more customers in Q4 for the catalyst 9000 than in any quarter prior. So, that continues to move forward favorably. In the campus what I would suggest to you is that we're -- I'd say maybe we're in the second inning at this point of this transition that we see from our customers. As you know they're all rearchitecting their entire enterprise infrastructure to accommodate these traffic flows that are presented from the massive number of cloud applications that they're running. And so it requires a completely different architecture which is what this portfolio is built for.","As it relates to data center, I think that next year you'll probably begin to see some upgrades transitions when the pure 400 gig optics are available. And one of the things that we believe is a big differentiator for us is that we're extending this policy management out of the data center into the campus, from the campus into the wide area, from the wide area into the cloud security portfolios. So, we think being able to enable our customers to deliver policy from the data center all the way across the campus to the branch into the cloud is a very unique differentiator for us. And we think, we'll begin to see customers adopting and deploying that sometime in the next year as well. So that's how we see that playing out.","Sami Badri","Got it. Thank you.","Marilyn Mora","Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Tal Liani from Bank of America. You may go ahead.","Tal Liani","Yes. Hi, guys. If you look at the growth this quarter, it's about 1%. And then, a few quarters ago.","Marilyn Mora","Hey, Tal. Can you speak up just a little bit?","Tal Liani","Yes. Can you hear me?","Chuck Robbins","Yes. Better, yes.","Tal Liani","I'll pick it up here you go. Now it's better. This quarter you're guiding for 1% growth, a few quarters ago, you reported 8%, but you had roughly organically growing -- you were growing about 4% to 4.5%. Can you take the 1% did you have now, and then build on top of it all the things that you're seeing today to see what's the growth environment now that is more sustainable going forward.","I'm trying -- I have difficulties to go from 4%, 4.5% to 1% within like three quarters. And if it's not a major deceleration in the growth environment what could it be? So you mentioned China, what are the other things that are happening today that are unique to Q1 that are bringing the growth down so much from the levels we've seen just a few quarters ago.","Kelly Kramer","Hey, Tal. I'll take a crack at it. I mean at the end of the day, when we are guiding it's based on what we're seeing with the orders [around] [ph] and the pipeline and everything else. And the biggest driver of the guide where it is, is the massive decline we've seen in service provider over the last few quarters. So, that is the biggest driver. Again, like Chuck said, we feel good about the risk portfolio from [indiscernible] perspective growing in the -mid single digits. But, China is part of it, but again like we said it's small in comparison, but SP is still a large part of the business and that's driving this outlook that you're seeing.","Tal Liani","So, what's the -- can you quantify this, can you quantify what is the decline in the growth related to service providers and you think you mentioned one point is related to China. Am I correct?","Kelly Kramer","We are talking about for that is, for the orders rate that we just had -- the order rates for enterprise being down 2 points, 1 point of that at the global level was adjusted China alone. China overall was down over 25% this quarter for us.","Tal Liani","Got it. And if I can just have a follow up on China. We always thought that you're not selling much in China. It's hard to compete in China. Where are you --w here did you have position in China. I know you were selling some routers to service providers, but where are you selling in China and what's being impacted in China, what are the types of products that you're selling into the Chinese market.","Chuck Robbins","Let me just give you a little bit of color then Kelly I can give you some numbers. I mean tell the overall Chinese market as I said earlier is certainly not a major play for us, but it has just dropped precipitously in light of the trade discussions. So, it has a short-term impact and if you were -- where we are selling for years we've sold infrastructure to the large carriers in China, which has just -- it's been slowly declining and we saw it even decline more rapidly last quarter.","And then, what we've seen is in the state-owned enterprises anymore, we're just being we're being uninvited to bid. We're not being allowed to even participate anymore. So those are the enterprises that's where the large impact was this past quarter, so it was just a much faster decline of what we candidly expected.","Kelly Kramer","Yes. And I would just add to that. So, again we talk about the big impact that had on enterprise. It was -- the second largest was down in service provider which is part of our overall service provider being down. But, from a product perspective, we sell everything there from switches, routers all the way down through security and Meraki products. So we sell everything including collab in China and everything is being impacted.","Tai Liani","Thank you.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks Tal. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Jim Suva from Citigroup Investment Research. You may go ahead.","Jim Suva","Thank you very much, Chuck and Kelly, you've been very clear about the softness in revenues. When offer the outlook, when you think about the outlook and a lot of it seems to be service provider, softness that has not been a new theme you've talked about it for the past several quarters. So, where we sit today looking out, is there a lot of risk that it could get worse or you kind of looking at this saying, we're kind of near a bottom for service provider trends because it's been chugging along pretty low and they're starting to sweat their assets potentially. Or is there still some risk that you have, they're just kind of thinking about the service provider headwinds. Could it get worse, or is it you looking at it and saying hey we're calling for a bottom.","Chuck Robbins","Look I think that, when you get into this area there, there is certainly pressure in the business models across all different types of service providers. I think that if you look at the early 5G build outs, most of the telco customers, we have particularly in Americas, they're focused on the consumer 5G trials today they're not -- I mean that is the primary focus. And then getting their 5G consumer networks built out. But they also don't -- I would say don't anticipate that being a huge profit driver off of the 5G transition that's going to come when they build more robust broader 5G infrastructure where they'll deliver enterprise services and that's going to come after they do the consumer side.","So, it's a bit unclear when that will take place. I'd say we're not modeling and don't anticipate any significant improvement in this business in the very near term. And we're just going to have to wait and see. It's been a tough business for us for years and it's now -- it obviously represents a much smaller percentage of our business than it did five years ago. But it clearly was a major point of weakness for us in the last quarter.","Jim Suva","Thank you very much.","Chuck Robbins","Do you want to add anything to that Kelly?","Kelly Kramer","I think you got it.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks Chuck. Let's go ahead and take the next question.","Operator","Thank you. James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead sir.","James Faucette","Great. Thanks. I just had a couple of questions, one related to gross margins and one to the deferred revenue. On gross margins, Kelly, it looks like even though the July quarter was very good, is that you're guiding for both the gross margins to be flat to down a little bit and sequentially historically we've seen at least some improvement. So I'm wondering if you can help parse a little bit what may be going on there. And my second question is, deferred revenue actually looks quite good. So, can you give us some insight into how much of that may be ELAs or software or other aspects, so we can get a little bit more color on what's driving the deferred revenue? Thanks.","Kelly Kramer","So, on the margin, yes, I mean I'd say the margins are going great. We feel good about it. I kept the range in that 64% to 65% to take into account the cutting end of list four of the tariffs. Again, we're going to run the same play that we have for all the other tariffs and we'll be -- again we continue to mitigate, we continue to do everything we can do. But, we see that in that range, which I think is pretty good. And as you look as that falls down through them and are actually doing well and I've actually raised a little bit on the OM guide.","So again, I think we're able to offset the headwinds from tariffs was again continued benefit from the software which leads to your point of the deferred revenue. Yes, I mean again we continue to add to deferred revenue, which again is why I think look at that RPO is a key metric which has both the deferred revenue as well as unbilled deferred when you have month-to-month contracts, it shows the progress we've made.","Just to remind you guys, we adopted ASC 606 at the beginning of the fiscal year, we wrote-off 2.8 billion from our deferred revenue balance for the new accounting rule. And again, you're seeing just big sequential increases since then as we just continue to ramp the portfolio with like for example the entire enterprise portfolio that all have subscriptions.","So it's broad based, we continue to have great adoption of the new products, all the subscriptions we have great adoption of the ELAs. We had really strong performance of software and ELAs in Q4. So, it's all going in the right direction which is again that's why we're still despite any macro environment why we're so bullish on the overall strategy of the company what we're doing an a transformation.","Chuck Robbins","Hey, James. If I might add to that, I know like three years ago, I think I made a comment on one of the earnings calls that I felt like we had figured out how we could drive a subscription business on top of networking products. And now here we are and we've got every product in our portfolio in the enterprise networking now that has mandatory subscription. And we really started showing that two years ago, so the first renewal window is really still a year away. So that's -- the team has done a great job that transition has been good. We're on track with what we told everyone in the Financial Analyst Conference where we'd be relative to our software. And I think that's what you're seeing show up in the RPO metrics as well.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks Chuck. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Tim Long from Barclays. You may go ahead.","Tim Long","Thank you. Yes. Just to follow-up and another question if I could. Chuck, you mentioned a little bit of the weakness was also related to some macro shifts in the month of July. Could you talk a little bit about that kind of what we are seeing with deals pushing out, scaling down more competition or anything like that? And then, you also had mentioned the move to 400 gig upgrades next year. Could you talk a little bit about how you think Cisco will fare in these data center deals as we move to 400 gig and this strategy to take in-house and develop more optics internally, do you think that helps as early as that 400 gig transition? Thank you.","Chuck Robbins","Yes. Thanks Tim. So basically we just felt a slight difference in July. I mean relative to close rates and just -- it just wasn't as strong a finish as we would normally expect particularly in Q4 and I think that's what kind of set off the flags for Kelly and I. I've met with 17 customers in the last five, six business days and nothing's changed about how they're thinking about the role of technology and what we do and how we're playing there. So we're monitoring this, we're watching it, we'll see. Obviously, I think what we've seen in the markets in the last few weeks and what we hear from some of the other players would indicate that others have seen similar things some a lot worse.","And I do feel very good about our position and where we are in the level of criticality that we are playing with our customers now versus five, six years ago and I think that. So, I feel good about that piece. But, that's really what we felt and we'll just have to see how it plays out and whether we get any resolution on some of these major geopolitical issues that are sort of lingering out there.","I've said for like 18 months that I've been amazed at the resilience of the economy and hopefully it can bounce back pretty quick if we get to some -- get more clarity on some of these issues which I think people are just -- I think they're just hedging their bets relative to some resolution on some of the stuff.","And then, the second question was around -- oh around the 400 gig and around. Yes, I'll tell you -- we have -- I feel good about it, number one, where we're in the game. We have our technology roadmaps mapped out. Our teams have made these acquisitions, which allows us to have good control of our components that go into these products. We've talked to lots of customers including the Web scale providers who are very supportive of where we're headed what we're doing. They're supportive of the strategy. They like the acquisitions. And so, we feel good that we'll be in a good place in a much better position to compete in this transition than we were last time around. So I feel good about where we are.","Tim Long","Okay. Thank you.","Marilyn Mora","Next question please.","Operator","Simon Leopold from Raymond James. You may go ahead.","Simon Leopold","Thank you for taking the question. I know you don't want to guide beyond the quarter, but maybe if you could help us sort of level set how to think about the year given that I think you're facing a pretty tough comparison in October. And so guiding 0% to 2% seems to set a new level, but if I just apply normal seasonality through the balance of the year, it would look like the year-over-year growth rate should come back somewhat in the January through July quarters. I just want to see how we should think about really the full fiscal year trending.","Kelly Kramer","Yes. Hey, Simon. I think the way you're looking at, I mean, again, we don't guide and again there's a lot of unknown out there. But, I'll say the way you think about kind of the right way. I think the way you're thinking about the second half certainly, you get more normalized compares on that in the second half. But, I think the way you're looking at it is very rational.","Simon Leopold","And just a quick, do you have a metric for percent of revenue that's recurring. I think you've given it in the past and then with the fiscal year over hope you maybe have that number.","Kelly Kramer","Yes. I know, Simon, we started this fiscal year on that, when we adopted 606 because a lot of our recurring subscriptions like for example D&A, with the Cat9K because of the accounting it changes how we have to recognize it. So that's why really the metric that that we talk about now is how much of our software revenue is subscription based, so recurring isn't as meaningful.","Simon Leopold","Okay. Thanks for taking the questions.","Kelly Kramer","Sure.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks Simon. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Jeff Kvaal from Nomura Instinet. You may go ahead.","Jeff Kvaal","Thank you very much. Kelly, you had mentioned a little earlier that you're taking the operating margin up a shade. I wonder if you could comment on how you are making the magic happen there in light of a little bit of a lower revenue trajectory than we all might have hoped for a few months ago. And then, just to clarify your capital return plan sounds like it's going to be mostly about the dividend here rather than buybacks going forward. Well thanks.","Kelly Kramer","Yes, sure. So on, yes, on the profitability on OM, I think it's not magic, right? It is -- we are working the gross margins hard with like we talked earlier. And then, we're also work in the OpEx side hard as always as well our engineering teams do a really good job of rebalancing their portfolios and making sure they're investing in the right stuff and we are constantly driving for efficiency. So, it's good old fashioned running the business and executing well despite the top-line. So, that's how that's happening and on the capital allocation.","Yes. So, if you go back to when we dig a tax reform back in Q2 of '18 and we announced the big buyback, we had a 31 billion authorization then and we said we'd use that 31 billion. We did effectively use that up through -- up till now, the 18 months. And so, now, since we've really gotten our balance sheet where we want it in terms of -- we reduced our debt. We've brought our cash balance from 74 billion back then now to 33 billion. We've reduced our debt from 35 down to 25. We're going to get back to our normal strategy, which is being very opportunistic when our stocks down like on days like today in buying. But, really balancing between both the dividend and the buyback to be at least 50% of our free cash flow.","Jeff Kvaal","Okay. Thank you.","Kelly Kramer","Yes.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks Kelly. Chuck. Our last question.","Chuck Robbins","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. You may go ahead.","Samik Chatterjee","Hi. Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I just wanted to follow up on the guidance you guys mentioned the service provider weakness is kind of what's driving the weakness, and then, although there seems to be a broader concern here from investors relative to a slowdown in enterprise spending. So, I just want to get your thoughts particularly given the change in the business towards kind of higher software subscription mix. How should we think about levers you can pull to drive growth even if enterprise spending does kind of see a slowdown next year?","And just a quick follow up. At Cisco Live, the team had talked about a major refresh of the collaboration portfolio. So just I want to see what the early response to that refresh has been. Thank you.","Chuck Robbins","Yes. I think one thing that is, I think important to look at is, when we talk about enterprise spending and when many companies talk about enterprise spending that would be -- in some cases a combination at a minimum of our enterprise and commercial business and in some cases people would just include public sector in there and that's sort of a view. And that when you put it all together was actually quite healthy, the orders were quite healthy. We just had a little bit in July of a feel that -- we just didn't close as strong as we would like. And so, we felt like there was even more that we could have done. And it just didn't feel like a normal Q4 finish and it felt a little bit like some of the macro issues may be manifesting themselves. So, that's really what we saw there. And then, Kelly, you want to talk about the software and\u2026","Kelly Kramer","Yes. I mean, again, just on the software, I think again because more and more -- again, even despite like I talked about the write-off on deferred revenue -- the adoption of 606 even despite that the amount of revenue -- software revenue coming off the balance sheet continue just to grow as we put more on the balance sheet. So that helps to buffer when you do go through any tough macro issues. So, I think we'll continue to add to that and it'll continue to help soften whenever there is any kind of macro slowdown. But, it's helping maintain kind of the growth that we do see going as well as margins.","Samik Chatterjee","Sorry. Any feedback on the collaboration portfolio?","Chuck Robbins","Oh, sorry. I'm sorry. Yes. I think what Amy and the team have been doing is really -- they've been refreshing new elements of the portfolio with end units, end points they've been, they've consolidated the -- to a single user interface. We've got new refresh versions of Webex out there. They're bringing the cognitive capabilities in, there's a lot of new technology that they've been bringing. So, I think they're in the midst of delivering on that right now and the result in that business would suggest that our customers are viewing it favorably because it continues to perform really well for a decent sized business. Is that all?","Samik Chatterjee","Okay. Thank you. That's it.","Chuck Robbins","Thank you. So, I just want to thank everybody for joining us today. I look -- we're four years in and I'm really proud of what our teams have accomplished. I mean we've come a long way in four years. And I don't actually judge where we are based on this quarter. I think or the quarterly guidance, I think that what we've built in the portfolio and the innovation and the value that we bring to our customers is sustaining and we'll continue to do that with our customers going forward.","We have a strong record of our execution. I have high conviction in the portfolio and I think we're well positioned for long-term growth opportunities. So, thanks all of you for spending time with us today and thanks for the questions.","Marilyn Mora","All right. Thanks Chuck. So, Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call which will reflect our fiscal 2020 first quarter results will be on Wednesday, November 13, 2019, at 130 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. Again, I'd like to remind the audience that in light of regulation FD, Cisco's policy is not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done to an explicit public disclosure.","We now plan to close the call, if you have any further questions feel free to contact the Cisco Investor Relations Group.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect.","Now, I\u2019ll like to introduce Melissa Selcher, Senior Director, Analyst and Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, you may begin.","Melissa Selcher","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our 93rd quarterly conference call. This is Melissa Selcher and I am joined by John Chambers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Frank Calderoni, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Rob Lloyd, President of Development and Sales; and Gary Moore, President and Chief Operating Officer. I would like to remind you that we have a corresponding webcast with slides on our website in the Investor Relations section.","Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the Investor Relations website. Click on the Financial Reporting section of the website to access these documents.","Throughout this call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements and as such are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail on our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Form 10-Q and 10-K and any applicable amendments, which we identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise. I will now turn it over to John for his commentary on the quarter.","John T. Chambers","Mel, thank you, very much. We are pleased to announce another very solid record quarter. We delivered our ninth consecutive quarter of record revenue. We also delivered record non-GAAP operating income and record non-GAAP net income. Our solid results in Q3 are the proof points of the effectiveness of our vision, strategy, differentiated value proposition and continued execution even with a challenging global macro backdrop.","Specifically, in the opening comments, I would like to focus on the following five key takeaways from Q3. First, we are executing very well and continue to consistently deliver to hit or exceed expectations. In addition to driving both top line and bottom line growth, gross margins continue to be stable and operating margins are strong. Bottom line, we again did what we said we would do.","Second, we are well positioned in the major technology global growth markets in the industry. Our cloud data center revenue growth was up 77%, wireless was up 27%, and SP Wi-Fi up well over a 100%, and SP Video was up 30%. We\u2019re continuing to deliver game changing innovations like UCS, Unified Access, Videoscape Unity, the Internet of Everything and Self Optimizing networks to drive the technology transitions and transform markets.","Third, we saw continued improvements from a total geographic perspective with total product year-over-year order growth of 4% following two quarters of flat growth. Also, for the first time in six quarters, we delivered positive growth across all four customer segments; those segments being Enterprise, Commercial, SP and Public Sector.","The most important takeaway, however, for me in the quarter was the performance in the U.S. and emerging countries. In the U.S. our commercial business was up 13%, U.S. enterprise was up 10%, U.S. service provider was up 10% and U.S. public sector up 5% in terms of orders.","Emerging countries also saw a strong double-digit growth of 13% year-over-year. And remember in Q2, the last quarter, we reported the growth in emerging countries, which is 6%. While we like the trend, we are managing the business to account for a continued slow steady recovery on a global basis.","Fourth, we generated $3.1 billion in operating cash flow and returned to our shareholders $1.8 billion in share buyback and dividends. And fifth, we articulated our strategy in value proposition to deliver a new model for IT, where customers are embracing our unique ability to drive an open systems approach to greater networking automation, optimization and programmability. With the role the network plays at the center of every transition, we believe we are uniquely positioned to help our customers manage through and capitalize on the opportunities ahead and in so doing, meet our goal of becoming the number one IT Company.","In every quarter, there are always areas of our business that outperform and some that underperform. We continue to demonstrate again in this quarter the consistent strength of our portfolio approach, our discipline, our innovation and our execution.","To provide some additional details from a financial perspective, Frank if you\u2019ll go next on this, I\u2019ll come back and then talk about what we\u2019re seeing in more detail from a product perspective and geographic and some interesting trends. You\u2019ll come back Frank, if it\u2019s okay and do the guidance. I\u2019ll provide some summary comments and then we\u2019ll do what we enjoy most which is the Q&A.","So Frank, over to you.","Frank Calderoni","Thank you, John. So we had a solid quarter despite difficult macroeconomic environment. Our strategy is working; we are growing profits faster than revenue and increasing shareholder value remains our top priority. We have stronger operational discipline and a more focused portfolio. Our total revenue growth was 5% and non-GAAP EPS was $0.51 per share. We grew profits faster than revenue six straight quarters as measured through earnings per share.","In this quarter, we completed the divestiture of Linksys, continued our NDS integration, announced two more acquisitions in software and cloud, and closed two others in network software and security all in line with delivering top-line growth, profitability and balancing our portfolio. In terms of our business momentum, we saw product revenue growth of 5% with total product book-to-bill of approximately 1%. Our services revenue grew 7% driven by our strategy of solutions led selling. There are a couple of reasons for the slow growth this quarter.","First, Q3 FY12 was a very strong quarter for services with 13% revenue growth including revenue recognition of several large multi-year deals that were in Asia-Pacific. Second, our services revenue growth is lower following slower product order growth over the last few quarters. As we discussed at our Financial Analyst Conference, our model for services revenue growth is 9% to 11% CAGR over the next three years to five years.","As I mentioned, we announced two acquisitions during the quarter including Ubiquisys, a leading provider of intelligent 3G and LTE small-cell technologies and SolveDirect, which provides cloud delivered services, managed integration software and services. Both of these acquisitions as well as our divestiture meet our business objective to increase growth and innovation while positioning us to provide the optimum return for our shareholders.","We continue to make solid progress with our operational excellence initiatives on both growth and operating margins. We saw very good leverage in our profitability model this quarter with strong non-GAAP operating margins of 28.2%, which was at the high end of our long-term financial model.","In Q3, our total non-GAAP gross margin was 63.0% compared to 62.3% last quarter and 63.1% a year ago. Our non-GAAP product gross margin was 62.1% compared to 60.9% last quarter and 62% a year ago. We continue to see consistency and stability in our product gross margin. We also saw good gross margin stability across our individual product areas. Our non-GAAP service gross margin was 66.5% compared to 67.6% last quarter and 61.1% in Q3 FY12.","We continue to manage our overall business as a portfolio, both in terms of top line growth as well as profitability. So an example was, this quarter, we concentrated our set top box sales in the most profitable business opportunities and we chose not to participate in non-strategic and non-profitable deals. We plan to continue this discipline as we move forward. We saw stability and consistency in total gross margins by geography with the Americas at 62.6%; EMEA at 65.3%; and APJC at 61.1% as well as from a product area perspective.","Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.3 billion or 34.8% as a percentage of revenue and that compares to 34.5% in Q3 of FY12. Our head count investments of 675 are specifically related to our acquisitions as well as investments in our engineering as well as our services business. We expect our strategic investments in these areas to drive profitable growth over the long term.","Our non-GAAP tax provision rate was 21% which was consistent with our expectations. And our non-GAAP net income was $2.7 billion representing an increase of 5% year-on-year. As a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP net income was 22.3%. And as I mentioned earlier, our non-GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis was $0.51 and this is versus $0.48 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 which was a 6% increase.","Our GAAP net income was $2.5 billion, representing an increase of 14%, as compared to $2.2 billion in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012. Our GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis was $0.46 versus $0.40 in the same quarter of fiscal year 2012, which represents a 15% year-on-year increase. We are committed to our capital allocation strategy as we demonstrated by the announcement this quarter of a $0.17 per share quarterly dividend and this was an increase of $0.03 per share or 21%.","Our consistent execution and strong financial position enables us to provide a greater dividend yield level to our shareholders. During the quarter, we returned $1.8 billion to our shareholders which included $860 million through our share repurchase as well as $905 million through our quarterly dividends. Our total cash, cash equivalents and the investments were $47.4 billion, that\u2019s including $7.9 billion available in the U.S. at the end of the quarter. And our cash flow from operations, as John mentioned earlier, was $3.1 billion and this was up 4%.","In terms of our key balance sheet metrics, DSO or days sales outstanding was 37 days reflecting a greater proportion of shipments in April than early in the quarter. And we continued strong and consistent collection throughout the quarter. Our non-GAAP inventory turns were a very strong 11.9%. Overall, our long-term financial strategy is performing as expected and we continue to deliver innovative solutions to our customers. We have the right discipline, focus and rigor and we\u2019re going to continue to make strategic investments and emphasize our commitment to shareholder returns.","John, I will turn it back over to you.","John T. Chambers","Thank you very much, Frank, a nice job. I will now provide some additional detail on the performance and trends we are seeing in our business and in the market. I\u2019ll first walk through our product portfolio in terms of year-over-year revenue growth, followed by discussing geographic and customer segments in terms of orders.","First in networking, we continue to drive industry leading innovations across our core switching, routing and wireless businesses. With continued challenges in Europe and global public sector, we did see switching revenues decrease 2% this quarter. But in the data center, we saw continued strength in our Nexus switching product line with double-digit growth of approximately 12% year-over-year. And in the campus, we saw good customer adoption and growth on our fully converged wired and wireless Catalyst 3850 platform.","We see demand for faster speed ports driving switching upgrades, cycles and in Q3 shipped a record number of 10 gig ports growing 35% year-over-year. We do see budget shifting from wireline to wireless benefiting our wireless business, which delivered another strong quarter of record revenue growth, up 27% year-over-year.","While our competitors have stumbled in this market, we experienced strong growth across the board. SP Wi-Fi growth continued to be extremely strong with triple-digit growth and our recently refreshed wireless LAN portfolio grew at 17%. Our Meraki integration continues to go well and we continue to take share in this market.","Our NGN routing strategy remains solid with our architectural approach and strength in mobility providing differentiated long-term value. In this quarter, total revenue for NGN routing was flat year-over-year. Strong momentum in our ASR 5000 family in SP mobility with record revenues up 60% at the edge. And at the edge from a fixed perspective, our ASR 9000 revenues were up over 40% and this was offset by declines in our core CRS platform.","We do see SP CapEx spending continuing to be challenged, but we believe we are gaining more than our fair share with the alignment of our product portfolio, architectural approach and innovation capabilities with the priorities matching our capabilities to the priorities of our customers. During the quarter, we provide additional detail on our strategy to deliver a new model for IT, helping our customers move beyond the hype of software defined networks or SDN to a much more complete solution for networks programmability and orchestration.","We now have over 50 customers in beta with our Cisco ONE API agents and controller and announced our leadership in the open daylight project, a community led, open, industry-supported framework to create a transparent approach to SDN. Customers are telling us that they strongly prefer the breadth and openness of Cisco\u2019s approach and ability to build upon existing network investments and run across hybrid environments as only Cisco can deliver. We feel very confident in our leadership position in this market.","Moving on to data center and the could, our data center traction is truly impressive with growth of 77% and continued market share gains. As we execute on our unified data center strategy, we are seeing our UCS plus Nexus business now on a combined run rate of approximately $5.5 billion annually, growing over 35% year-over-year.","Integrated solutions such as FlexPod with NetApps and Vblock through VCE are driving significant demand for UCS and the UCS is becoming a preferred and strategic platform across all segments and geographies around the world. Our leadership in the data center, wired and wireless networking and our architectural approach is enabling us to be the trusted partner for many customers as they optimize their business for a world of many clouds.","Moving onto video, total SP video grew 30% driven largely by NDS. The NDS integration continues to go well and Videoscape Unity is seeing continued traction. This quarter, we announced two new European service providers for Videoscape and received the Future of Video Award for Innovation.","Moving onto collaboration, we continue to improve on our collaboration execution. While revenue was down 1% when we normalize for underlying server revenue which is now reported in the data center making a more accurate comparison to what we\u2019ve seen in prior years the business was up 2%. Rowan, we like what we\u2019re seeing there and really excited about our plans for the next one year to two years here.","We saw continued strength in conferencing, up 11% due to momentum and enterprise, offset by softness in TelePresence which was down 6%. Collaboration unit announced and delivered tight integration across TelePresence and WebEx further simplifying and aligning its focus of growing a larger mix of software, which is now approximately half of the total business of our collaboration group.","Moving onto security, we saw a decline of 4% with weakness in content security, balanced in part by [relative] stability and network security. The continued shift of security business to term based software licensing does have a short-term impact on year-over-year revenue growth. Order growth for enterprise licensing agreements, identity service engine, and cloud web security continued to outpace overall business.","Finally, our services business continues to be a crucial component of our strategy to become the number one IT Company. Together with our partners, we are winning large multiyear service deals as our customers ask us to partner with them to meet their business goals. We see near-term opportunities that leverage our solid $180 billion customer install base and longer-term opportunities around new consumption models and markets.","In summary, we continue to focus on market transitions and customer priorities to drive our innovation and focus. We see new business and consumption models coming into the market with increased pace. And we are very focused on how we remain cognizant of the risk, capitalize on the opportunities, and adapt a change faster than our peers to support our customers as their business opportunities and requirements also evolve at this pace.","I will now move on to provide some color on our geographic and customer segments. The following geographic and customer segment growth rates are in terms of year-over-year product orders unless specifically stated otherwise. In Q3, Cisco\u2019s total product orders returned to growth up 4% year-over-year.","Looking at the numbers from a geographic perspective, the Americas region grew 7%. As we said earlier, we saw very strong balance across enterprise, commercial, service provider and even public sector. U.S. public sector grew 5% in the quarter with state, local and education growing 13% and U.S. Federal declining 3%. As we have said before, we believe this balanced approach to growth is a positive signal for the U.S. economy going forward.","The Asia-Pacific, Japan and China region grew orders 1%. We have over the last several years seen tremendous growth in Japan. And last year, fiscal year 2012, there was growth year-over-year of 30%. This has created some tough comparisons. We also continue to see challenges in China, largely Cisco specific, relating to the business environment. We do believe we are making progress, although we expect these challenges in China to last for several more quarters.","Our Europe, Middle East, Africa and Russia region continues to show improvement flat in Q3 following a decline of 6% in Q2. We still see pressure in the southern part of Europe with declines in the mid-teens but we did see growth in three of the four other regions. So you\u2019re beginning to see Europe bottom out with the exception of the South, a great job by Chris and team in Europe.","We were especially pleased with the progress we made in Q3 in the emerging countries with growth of 13%. As a reminder, emerging countries grew 6% in Q2. We are also pleased with the balance across emerging countries with India growing 29%, Russia growing 16%, Brazil up 14%, China up 8%, and Mexico up 4%. The remaining emerging market around the world which is approximately 50% of our total business from emerging countries was also very solid with growth of 13% as well.","Now moving on to the customer market view, again from an orders perspective, we saw growth in every segment. Enterprise grew 3%, commercial grew 3% from an orders perspective, our service provider grew 8% and global public sector grew 1%.","Frank, let me now turn it back over to you for guidance.","Frank Calderoni","Thanks, John. Let me now provide a few comments on our outlook or the guidance for the fourth quarter. Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings and identify important risk factors and also understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements and then actual results could be above or below guidance.","The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with reconciliation to GAAP. For Q4 FY13 while we like the trends, we are managing the business to account for a continued slow steady recovery. With that in mind, we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 7% on a year-over-year basis.","This guidance factors in the divestiture of our Linksys product line, which contributed approximately 1% of total revenue in Q4 FY12. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately in the range of 61% to 62%. Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 is expected to be in the range of 27.5% to 28.5%. Our non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be approximately 21% in the fourth quarter.","Our Q4 FY13 non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.50 to $0.52 per share and we anticipate that our GAAP earnings in Q4 will be $0.07 to $0.10 per share lower than our non-GAAP EPS.","Other than those quantified items noted previously, there are no other significant differences between GAAP and our non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructuring and tax or other events which may or may not be significant. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.","Thank you, and John, back to you.","John T. Chambers","","Frank thanks very much. In summary, for nearly 30 years, we\u2019ve focused on moving the world to [IP], first in communications and now in IT. We build a portfolio of assets that deliver value for customers and shareholders with a discipline and financial strength to make long-term bets on innovation.","There is no doubt that the pace of change in our industry is only increasing. Let me be very clear, change has always been good for Cisco. We use these times of change to get closer to our customers, transform our business and drive new opportunities and at the same time break away from our competition.","Many companies are articulating strategies to expand in the networking and reshape this market. Over the last 20 plus years at Cisco, I\u2019ve seen these challenges every few years. For example, I remember back in the 90s when we were a router company. Some believed that the new switching startups would topple our business. However, after the hype settled, it was clear that Cisco was the leader and we did it by listening to our customers and delivering products that help them transform their businesses.","With this strategy, we established our leadership position and increased our relevance to these customers, and we have used this playbook again and again and again throughout our history to become an almost $50 billion company. I\u2019m extremely confident with the hand Cisco has to play and yet we have never taken it for granted.","We take competition seriously and make no mistake about it, we love to compete, it keeps us focused. History is littered with company\u2019s large and small, upstarts and established that bet against Cisco and failed. I have no doubt we can see this again. We have always believed that the Internet will revolutionize the way we work, live, learn and play.","This has never been true than it is today, think about it, with cloud, mobility all coming together to deliver the internet of everything, and unprecedented new ways of opportunities for many players in our industry and our goal is to lead this transition. While we have to earn our leadership position every day, I believe we have the right cards, the right people and if played right, we can emerge as the number one IT Company in the world.","Mel, let\u2019s now open it up for questions.","Melissa Selcher","Thank you, John. We will now open the floor to Q&A. I\u2019m first going to clarify one number during that was mentioned by Frank. Our Q3 FY12 non-GAAP service gross margin was 67.1%, not 61.1%.","A reminder as we go into Q&A, we still request that sell side analysts to please ask only one question. Operator, please open the floor to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Ittai Kidron \u2013 Oppenheimer","","Thank you and congratulations on great numbers and very optimistic guidance. John, as we went through the last three weeks and listened to every one of your competitors, things didn\u2019t seem as rosy as you see them. Now clearly you are taking business away and you\u2019re executing to higher level than others.","But what is it that you\u2019re seeing on the enterprise side in the U.S.? You\u2019ve highlighted that vertical specifically in the past as very critical for the continued recovery process. How are you seeing purchasing decisions being executed over there? Are you seeing some delays and also if you can revisit your perspective on Fed is there a bottom for that pit?","John T. Chambers","So in sequence, first, thank you very much for the compliment on behalf of us all here at Cisco. In terms of what is changing the market, our architectural approach tying together our products to solve our customer\u2019s top proprieties quicker than anyone else is regaining traction. That\u2019s especially true in enterprise where brands, team focuses on selling to the business customer in conjunction with the CIO and meeting the CEO\u2019s top priorities.","In terms of the momentum there, the pipeline looks good. Pipeline actually increased Rob again faster than the actual growth this quarter and is well over $2 billion for Brian\u2019s group alone. The number of large deals, Ittai, are actually increasing. However, you are seeing a little bit slower rate in bringing the deals home, which is a nice way of saying, you got to have more opportunities and it might come in pieces versus before.","In terms of commercial, where you really look at what Alison has done, leading our Group, that\u2019s 13% growth year-over-year, and it\u2019s probably an even more accurate indicator of economic potential in the U.S. looking out a couple of quarters, and we\u2019ve seen this trend interestingly enough, improve steadily in both enterprise and commercial for four quarters in a row. Alison grew at 13%, but again she sells solutions not routers or switches or data center or UCS type solutions.","Service provider was very strong. Michael\u2019s team did very well there, 8% core growth, 2% from NDS, making 10% growth and you\u2019re seeing our relevance to the large players, the AT&T, the Verizons, the Time Warners, the Comcast continue to be very solid and really make a difference.","So, I like the trends in the U.S. The state and local business, as you all know, almost two, two and half years ago was the start of the decline that unfortunately we experienced first and shared with the market and fast forward two years later, you\u2019re starting to see it lead the upturn. The Federal business will be a market share change. It\u2019s who is able to really make a difference to this market, but if you look, we experienced a slowdown a couple of quarters ago in federal and now you\u2019re at a minus 3%, but I think you will see some of the FX make this a difficult growth market.","So, we\u2019re focused on building relationships and maintaining value. So, I guess the key takeaway and Rob, we saw this last night at a dinner with one of the large boards of big global multinational bank and the day before with a global search provider and they bring their whole boards to Cisco now as we focus on business transformation.","Our ability to bring innovation to them. Our ability to take the CEOs top five goals and make a difference in their ability to achieve all the top five goals in ways that others are not, and I think what you\u2019re beginning to see Ittai is a transition for us moving from a communications company selling boxes five or 10 years ago to being a solutions company selling IT to our customers.","So if I were to summarize, I think the U.S. was the example of what we want to do in the future and I think it is also a positive trend and probably what you\u2019re going to see in the second half of the year from economic growth.","","Melissa Selcher","Okay. Thanks, Ittai. Next question operator?","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.","John T. Chambers","Hey, Mark.","Mark Sue \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Hi, John, how are you? If I think about one of the reasons why the multiple in text box and in ComTech in particular why they have been compressing, it\u2019s been the lack of pricing power and the declining gross margins. There were deals in the past, such as China, where you took a margin hit, since they were strategic, now you\u2019re saying \u2013 now you\u2019re doing the opposite which is walking away from set-top deals, which are not, are we now at a point of structural changes for the industry.","You\u2019re going from selling boxes to selling solutions so that rational pricing can prevail and are we now at a point where these things give you confidence that your need on gross margins can actually improve further from here?","John T. Chambers","So in reverse sequence, the gross margins we like the 61%, 62% range and I\u2019d encourage people not to get above that. But we clearly have done there a huge amount of work across the whole Company on focus on gross margins and the direction. If you sell solutions and IT solutions to the CEOs top priorities, you have earned a major premium. If you\u2019re dealing with a standalone switch or a standalone server and competing purely on a reverse option RFP type of response the margins are very low. But I think what it does speak much what you\u2019re alluding to, our ability to maintain and to add value to our customers as it\u2019s on very strong ground even in the data center where most people thought we could \u2018not compete\u2019 and could not get good margins on market share and we were obviously very successful in all three. So, I think it\u2019s a combination; I would not encourage you to move the models around in terms of your gross margins on that.","We\u2019re doing a better job of getting software in, a better job of getting value for our ASICs. Frank, you want to add something else?","Frank Calderoni","Yeah, Mark, as we talked about, I mean the whole thing we look at gross margin and overall profitability as the portfolio play, not only to the current, but also the long period of time, and we want to make sure that we have the flexibility to make trade-offs. So, as we talked about today set-top box is an area, we\u2019re making some trade-offs. There\u2019s other parts of the portfolio we\u2019ll continue to make trade-offs. In the range of gross margin as I talked about back in December, looking at 61 to 62 over the long-term and there could be some things that could factor it in on the positive side, as we continue to kind of look at investments in the software area.","And there\u2019s things that could also kind of be more challenging on the lower side. So, there\u2019s always going to be that balance that we\u2019re going to work to in the portfolio and we want to stay reasonable with that kind of range over that longer period of time, and the overall focus for us is bottom line profitability.","John T. Chambers","Okay. Thank you, Mark.","Frank Calderoni","","Thank you, Mark.","Melissa Selcher","Thanks Mark. Next question please?","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","John T. Chambers","Hello Simona.","Simona Kiritsov Jankowski \u2013 Goldman, Sachs & Co.","Hi, John, thank you so much. I just wanted to ask you specifically on the service provider vertical, which for you was quite strong and this was a quarter, when we saw a lot of misses related to the service provider vertical and also the carrier spending numbers came in a bit lower for the quarter in some of the largest North America carriers. And so, just wanted to get your perspective there, how much of this is specific to Cisco\u2019s execution and share gains or the fact that maybe the linearity in the quarter changed, where it got stronger toward the end, and just if you can paint that picture looking out through the rest of the year as well?","John T. Chambers","Sure. The linearity during the quarter for our orders was pretty typical what we see all Q3s, not even a variation of 1% in the first month versus the second month, versus the third month of our typical performance. I think it does speak to our value to our customers and service providers and I think it does speak to service providers are beginning to bet that they\u2019ve got to have strategic partners long-term, something that others would not say was going to occur five years ago. So, we\u2019re winning the share of wallet spend. The North American spend, especially in the U.S. is probably stronger than you saw in other parts of the world. We saw Europe challenged in terms of service provider spend and then we saw some great numbers from Asia-Pacific in prior years, NTT as an example out of Japan where we maintain our share spend, but just the spending is tighter. It\u2019s a nice way of saying, Simona, I think the carrier spend is low double digits, and there might be some relief in the second half of the year, but we\u2019re focused on value to the customers and share of wallet spend and I think that was the primary reason we were successful.","Melissa Selcher","Great, thanks Simona. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities.","Jess L. Lubert \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Hi, guys and congratulations on a nice quarter in a tough environment. Question is on\u2026","John T. Chambers","Somebody says that\u2019s nice. We\u2019re about to get this. This is tough question.","Jess L. Lubert \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","So the question is on the guidance, it seems like order trends are improving across the board, yet if I do my math correctly, it seems like you\u2019re guiding for just 1% sequential growth during the July quarter, which has historically been a seasonally strong quarter for the Company. So, I\u2019d like to understand some of the key factors that you\u2019re still most concerned about from a vertical or geographic basis and what\u2019s driving you to take what appears to be a fairly conservative approach to your Q4 outlook?","John T. Chambers","Frank, I\u2019ll take part of it and then you kind of backstop me. First is the sequentials on revenue are usually dramatically different than the sequentials on bookings. Bookings Q3 to Q4 is almost always in double-digits, the orders come in late in the quarter. This is the quarter we build backlog and we fully intend to build a very solid backlog going into Q1 and Q2 of next year and that\u2019s how we\u2019ve always run it.","That\u2019s how the sales incentive plans are positioned. In terms of the order rate, if you think about it, we are projecting 4% to 6% just a quarter ago, you take Linksys out which would be down a point and we now have set 4% to 7% that\u2019s equivalent to 5% to 8%, if Linksys were still in the numbers. It\u2019s pretty aggressive numbers in terms of revenue and it does speak to our ability to forecast.","We appear to be gaining share and feel good about the momentum. But the global economy there still challenges, I would like to see more out of Asia. We would like to see a little bit more stability in Southern Europe. We think these are pretty aggressive outline of our goals for this quarter. So again I would not assume that the sequential 1% in revenue is indicative of our growth and clearly when the order growth returned to positive at 4% that was a good start. Frank?","Frank Calderoni","Hey John, I think that kind of covers a good amount. We\u2019ve been \u2013 clearly if you look at the orders for the last couple of quarters it\u2019s been pretty flat, kind of showing some growth this past quarter. So we have been improving the momentum. We are seeing some momentum improve as we captioned into the guidance in Q4. But with the backdrop of the environment and the slow and steady recovery we want to make sure that we continue to kind of see that play out. Hopefully what we are counting on here is to be able as you said to build some backlog, which is important especially at the end of the fiscal year kind of going into the beginning of the next year.","And so we factored all that in and we feel that this is a balanced guidance both top line and bottom line. So as John said, if you look at the top line at 4% to 7% without Linksys is pretty much 5% to 8%. And then if you look at the bottom line, we\u2019re also growing profits at a pretty reasonable rate in the range of about from an EPS perspective of 6% to 10% on the low and the high. So I think that\u2019s a fairly good set of guidance that we are providing for the quarter.","John T. Chambers","Thank you, Jess.","Melissa Selcher","Thanks Jess. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Tal Liani \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks guys.","John T. Chambers","Hi Tal.","Tal Liani \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I\u2019m trying to understand the gross margin. I know we discussed it, but I\u2019m trying to understand the gross margin and kind of put maybe two questions in one. The routing business grew 10% sequentially, if I do the math right. It\u2019s about flat year-over-year. The switching was down both year-over-year and on a sequential basis. The margins, every quarter, you guide below and you beat the margin \u2013 the gross margin number, and the question is when you take a two year view, the last two year view where margins kind of were under pressure you\u2019re back now to margins that \u2013 above what we saw two years ago or one year ago. So, is this the new sustainable margin of 63? What are the puts and takes of \u2013 I know you just said 61 to 62, but what are the puts and takes in the margins that drove it up to 63 in the quarter that your largest and most profitable business is down sequentially and year-over-year?","John T. Chambers","We have, Tal, as we\u2019ve talked about even back in December. We\u2019ve headwinds and tailwinds that we look at against that 61 to 62, if I want to be balanced looking at over long-term. Clearly, this past quarter very pleased with the 62% margin, I think we had many things working in our favor from across the portfolio as I mentioned.","I think this is one of those quarters where and I\u2019ve looked through a lot of the detail, we had great execution across the board, that doesn\u2019t necessarily happen every quarter, and so we\u2019ve got to make sure things come up from time-to-time gets factored and secondly, the other thing from a headwind perspective that we continue to come through from quarter-to-quarter, if you look back over the last several quarters or even the last two years, from a quarterly standpoint, we\u2019ve had some, where it\u2019s been higher, some where it\u2019s been lower, and the variation depends on the mix.","Mix from the standpoint of UCS and how fast that\u2019s growing, and then also from a \u2013 something that\u2019s the video perspective of the two drivers. So mix comes into play from time to time, as well as various other things from an execution standpoint within the portfolio. So looking at that and spending the time that we have across the business and making sure that we balance that, I feel very comfortable that 61 to 62 is a reasonable range with the ability to maybe go a little higher and a little lower depending upon how those things balance out.","Frank Calderoni","Thank you, Tal.","Melissa Selcher","Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Marshall with ISI group.","Brian Marshall \u2013 ISI Group","Thanks guys. All right. Hi John thanks. Quick question on gross margins as well, and I guess, maybe the margin execution in the quarter was pretty phenomenal, but maintaining the 61 to 62 longer term, I guess that would suggest that, there may be some \u2013 little bit of clouds in the horizon. I guess, one of the things that we would be concerned about is potentially Cisco\u2019s ability to capture any margin shifts that may emerge with the transition to SDN, I mean clearly, most software defined networking developments right now are in a proof of concept base, but over the couple of years, that\u2019ll start to reach volume production and so love to hear about your ability to capture margin in that kind of a realm. Thanks.","John T. Chambers","So I\u2019ll talk a little bit about the margin piece, and Rob, I\u2019m going to ask you to comment specifically about SDN, especially in the data center, where clearly we\u2019re doing extremely well on our numbers. The margins, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a software gain. It\u2019s going to be an architectural gain, where software, silicon, ASICs, hardware, a world of all clouds play architecturally together and as we articulate that well to our customers, our customers are getting it and we\u2019re starting to win our big large deals, because we have the best product architectures in routing and switching.","We have the best, using the customers\u2019 words, SDN strategy and it leverages their existing installed base, and what you are seeing is many of our new investments that Frank is investing in very heavily for us have very little revenue effect for the first year. They are largely going to be expenses this next year and those are the recurring revenues in software as well. But if we were facing abnormal pressure from a new competitor that has a dramatically different business model that was being successful you would have seen different numbers in the data center and you would have seen different numbers in terms of our growth versus our peers.","This is what I said earlier. We have a number of challenges coming at us. In the end it will be in our opinion, architectural play, where software play a key component but it will be an architecture where our plays will I think win in the end and we\u2019ve done this \u2013 I don\u2019t know I have lost track now, Rob, how many times. But we are already on to our next challenge beyond SDN without taking it for granted. Your thoughts Rob a little about the data center.","Robert W. Lloyd","Yes. John, I think you already pointed out that in the data center switching area we actually grew 12%, a very big portfolio and we\u2019ve got some market leadership there. It\u2019s important to note that we just introduced the Nexus $6,000 which is based on Cisco\u2019s ASICs and silicon. And I think the real answer to the question that was just asked is we continue to see absolute evidence in the marketplace that as eventually controllers and agents and overlays evolve, it\u2019s great hardware, it\u2019s Cisco silicon and ASICs that are going to drive the scale that underlies the promise of SDN and Cisco\u2019s software with Cisco ASICs and silicon is really the formula. So we see that alive and well right now, which is why we\u2019re doing so well and I feel very comfortable of the future that formula will continue to scale.","Brian Marshall \u2013 ISI Group","How do you do?","Melissa Selcher","","Thanks, Brian.","John T. Chambers","Thanks Brian.","Melissa Selcher","Next question please.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays. Your line is open.","Ben Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital","Hey thanks a lot. John and Frank how are you doing? I wanted to ask about cash and yield. The night before Good Friday, you snuck in a 21% dividend increase on us. I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little more about your long-term plans for dividend growth and how you balance that with buybacks, it looks like you have still a lot of balance sheet optimization potentially ahead of you and you could get even more aggressive, if you elected do so. So, just how you are thinking about that after this performance and what you just delivered?","John T. Chambers","So, I\u2019ll take the easy part of it and just thank you all for the feedback. We listen pretty carefully to our large shareholders and the buy and sell-side analysts on what you want us to do those with dividend and buyback. In this quarter, it was well ahead of our 50% free cash flow that we committed to and don\u2019t think we won\u2019t listen to you in the future. We absolutely will very much in line with how we accomplish our goals together. That\u2019s the easy part of it. Frank, let me give it you and put the meet behind it.","Frank Calderoni","So Ben, nothing really changes with the capital allocation strategy that we laid out back in the summer of last year. I think what we\u2019ve been able to do since then is really continue to execute against that and that is to say that on an annual basis that we will return a minimum of 50% of free cash flow through the dividend and the buyback.","Clearly, what we\u2019ve done in the last year, it clearly is empathizing much more heavily towards the dividend with the increase that you just referred to. I think that\u2019s an indication of where we are probably going to go. I mean we\u2019re going to continue to look at both as ways of contributing cash, with I think listening to many of the shareholders or more of the shareholders emphasizing the dividend and also conversations with our Board that\u2019s clearly where we have put more of the focus and we will probably in the future.","But balancing that a minimum of 50% on an annual basis, and we\u2019re actually as you can also see, I think we\u2019re doing a fairly decent job of managing the U.S. cash with that as a backdrop to give us that flexibility with the numbers right now close to $8 billion is the highest it\u2019s been in a long time from U.S. cash position. And that\u2019s primarily to be able to have that flexibility to be able to continue down this path of this capital allocation strategy.","Melissa Selcher","Thanks Ben. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Brent Bracelin with Pacific Crest.","John T. Chambers","","Hi, Brent.","Brent Bracelin \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.","Hey how are you. Thank you for taking my questions here. I wanted to go back to the concept of what\u2019s changed in the environment over the last three months. I clearly appreciate your focus on the solutions cell, three consecutive quarters of 5% growth now, but your book-to-bill that was below 1, the last two quarters is now approximately 1, you\u2019re clearly seeing a recovery in U.S. order trends across all major segments, so I guess my question here is, how much of an improvement do you see across overall industry versus how much of the momentum that Cisco is generating here is driven by share gains and the hand that you have specifically?","John T. Chambers","","I think our movement from being a communications company and networking company to an IT company has a huge impact on this. The communications companies candidly have had a pretty tough run this fiscal year, and if you watch what we\u2019ve done and we aren\u2019t completely there and probably never will be, but our ability to be viewed as more as an IT partner to our customers has changed dramatically.","We watch the numbers in the U.S. enterprise and it\u2019s been a very remarkable balance from 15%, all the way down to 0%, then 5%, then 9%, then 10% and Alison\u2019s numbers from 22% down to 4% or 5% base and then to 9% last quarter and up to 13% this quarter, that is solution selling and that is share gains in large part, in moving more to what we want to do, and combining services Gary, into the overall approach.","The emerging markets, there\u2019s been a major push in the last four months about just understanding the key government leaders requirements there and how we meet their requirements and driving it through and that is I think even better execution, Rob in terms of what we\u2019ve done in emerging markets. It\u2019ll be bumpy and it always is in emerging markets but I like what our play is doing there.","When you\u2019re asking about Europe we\u2019re modeling Southern Europe to stay tough, decrease is probably in the mid-teens on that. But we like what we see in Central Europe, Canada at corridor Germany, Eastern Europe, Russia. U.K. has leveled out and that\u2019s a nice job there. But I would say in these situations is probably a partially and economic slow recover and I think the right word is slow but steady and partially our execution on the model. Gary, would you add anything to that?","Gary B. Moore","I think our ability to execute the visibility we have into the business and to make adjustments. I mean even going back to the gross margin question, the discipline that we have, continued value engineering some of the things we\u2019re doing there, but the visibility that Chuck and the sales team has and discounting those kinds of things not only helped us win and close deals more quickly but it helps us with the margins.","John T. Chambers","Just to note on this, I know there are a lot of Cisco people who listen to this, you know what we\u2019re going to do right after the call, first congratulations and then we\u2019re going to say you have to move faster, we\u2019ve got to execute better. We\u2019ve got to get better coordination across our functional groups and if we\u2019re going to break away at the level we want we\u2019ve got to take it up to another level as we go into Q4 and Q1. So I don\u2019t want anybody resting on their laurels and to you as the shareholders we aren\u2019t going to rest.","Melissa Selcher","Okay. Thanks, Brent. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank.","John T. Chambers","","Good morning.","Brian Modoff \u2013 Deutsche Bank Research","Good afternoon guys. Hey John. A couple of questions real quick. Can you talk a little bit about on the switching side? What you\u2019re seeing in terms of pricing pressure in 10-gig ports? What you\u2019re seeing in terms of the adoption of 40-gig? Are you seeing that transition more rapidly perhaps and you maybe earlier anticipated? And then maybe a little bit of color around the 3850 and if that\u2019s doing anything to help your trend on the Campus side, which has been somewhat anemic at least on the order side perhaps?","John T. Chambers","Yeah but first of all I want to congratulate Rob Soderbery and Rob Lloyd, you all took the switching market after last quarter, where candidly we lost port share, and I think in less than three months have got our port share gains back going again, nice way of saying it, the total port level we\u2019re back gaining share.","In terms of the data center, I think the numbers speak for themselves on it. I think we need to do a little bit better in the modular component part. There is a transition of 10-gig to 40-gig, I think it\u2019s more a price performance issue and in any many of our large accounts, government and federal, as an example head count is actually coming down. So there isn\u2019t the normal push out of these verticals that we normally see leading it. Right now they are actually a negative drain in terms of the large financial institutions in the U.S., and the large federal government. Rob, would you have anything to that.","Robert W. Lloyd","3850 is ramping very nicely John, and we have a very unique position there, leveraging our strength in wireless and obviously the footprint we have in the wiring closets into the edge of the network. So, we\u2019re going to watch that very carefully, but we do see a very nice ramp and we expect that unique value, we have again based on Cisco ASICs, and what we\u2019ve done there will be interesting. I also watch the ramp of the Nexus 6K in the data center, and we do see the penetration rates of 10-gig driving lot of growth above 35% up in terms of 10-gig ports.","Melissa Selcher","","Okay, thanks Brian. Next question operator.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley.","Ehud Gelblum \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Hi guys. Thanks, I appreciate it.","John T. Chambers","","Hi Ehud, how are you doing?","Ehud Gelblum \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Good, how are you?","John T. Chambers","","Actually pretty good.","Ehud Gelblum \u2013 Morgan Stanley","I want to drill down a little more on your data center growth, it seemed pretty \u2013 really pretty strong. You said UCS and Nexus together, talked about 77% growth. I want to compare that if that\u2019s comparable to the 65% growth number you gave us last quarter and if it is, it means you\u2019re accelerating there, so, from that kind of a basis, that you\u2019re really taking some serious share and doing really well in the data center.","A couple of things I just want to dig down into, can you cut your customer base a little bit differently to give us some insight into these massively scalable debt data center guys, the Web 2.0 guys? And is a lot of that growth into those MSDCs or is it into enterprises and as for MSDCs, whether it\u2019s the AWSs of the world or the Microsoft Azure\u2019s as they get more cloud guys in general sort of just attract a lot of data center kind of mass, let\u2019s say, how do you see that changing the business, how you do business and the competitive environment?","So, I guess, what\u2019s happening now, in terms of growing your strength as well as, in the future? And following that into your U.S. enterprise, if you look at your order growth, the last three quarters, it\u2019s accelerated. I think three quarters ago, it was 1% order growth. This is total U.S enterprise, then 4%, then 9% and I think this quarter was 10%. Do you worry that we\u2019re on this pattern of four strong four weak, four strong four weak? I think, I asked you about this a couple of quarters ago, just how do you look at the next quarter, given, now you\u2019ve had several straight positive trends?","Frank Calderoni","I think our position, going in reverse order of your questions, I try to remember them all, the enterprise growth is on a very good trend. I don\u2019t see seasonality on that and I think it\u2019s probably a very good indicator of economic growth. It\u2019s nothing to write home about, but it\u2019s very solid economic growth in terms of slow but steady in terms of the U.S. is how we\u2019re modeling, and I think this is a solution-led sales, in a very tough environment. So, I would be disappointed if we don\u2019t continue to maintain this type of momentum in the enterprise, give or take a couple of points on it.","In terms of what we\u2019re seeing, it\u2019s all geographies and all segments of the market. You are aware of a lot of the rumors in the market with some of the things we\u2019re doing with the semi that has absolutely targeted the massively scalable data centers and the combinations of software and hardware and ASICs and UCS combined. Stay tuned if you\u2019re really very excited on that and I think it will prove a lot of people perhaps scratching their heads in terms of the architectural discussion we had before and just repeating the same thing.","If you can\u2019t win in the data center with software defined networks you sure as heck aren\u2019t going to win standalone across an architecture of $180 billion installed base with APIs of each component parts all the way through it. In terms of our relevance as an IT player, it\u2019s increasing and when you get Board of Directors coming through not the CIOs but the Board of Directors and top management, it really speaks Cisco\u2019s position in the industry is changing.","I know to some people they might have described this in some of the news media perhaps as something that is primarily a router or switch vendor type play and movement a little bit slow. But what you\u2019ve seen, I view as more as somebody flies underneath the radar, pretty much as a stealth fighter, and when we catch our competitors we usually leave them behind fairly quickly.","If sometimes Gary we take a little bit long to get focused on something but we really close well. That\u2019s a nice way of saying I am real comfortable across all key customer segments where we are going. I think we are dramatically better positioned than the traditional data center players such as HP, Dell, and IBM as this transition occurs.","Melissa Selcher","","Thanks David. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS.","Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS","Hi, thank you. I had a clarification and then a question. On the clarification, John I thought last quarter you said UCS plus Nexus was running at a $3.5 billion annualized run rate, and I thought you said that number today was $5.5 billion. Just want to clarify that.","And then a question for Frank, I believe Gary said at a conference in February that you still had about $900 million that you could extract in terms of supply chain efficiencies in your COGS line. I just wanted to get a sense of where are we with respect to that goal, is that a goal for this year, and if you could give us any sense of just other efficiencies and improvements you can make in the supply chain on your COGS line as we progress through the year?","John T. Chambers","Gary, you take the second one, while I see if I can get the numbers together.","Gary B. Moore","So, specifically what I said and someone actually put it in the paper. I think it was Simone, and I called paper, what I said in the conference was that in the first year of our transformation work, that we\u2019d pulled about $800 million improvement to gross margin for the value engineering, value design and some of the other work that we\u2019re doing around component, negotiation et cetera.","What I said for this year, it would be that we had targeted another $800 million, we had upped that to $900 million and I think Frank and I did a review on this, probably 10 days ago and we\u2019re actually moving ahead of that. So, it\u2019s going to be in that range, but I would just tell you that on the specifically, everyone here is still focused on driving value and driving the operating leverage in our business. So, we continue to see opportunities like that and we haven\u2019t dialed back on it at all.","Frank Calderoni","And it\u2019s important I mean, that just shows even as you get two years, right, and have the pressure. So we have to continue to kind of stay, going back to the comment that John made before, as we continue to look at next year going into FY 2014, those are kind of goals that we said internally, that we have to constantly keep executing on, because that\u2019s going to allow us to have that offset for what happens on the price side.","Gary B. Moore","Yeah I mean, so, John Kern and the entire team over there in supply chain not just with those types of work, but the whole manufacturing cost process, they\u2019re driving very hard and then the other thing that we can do there. So, that was the $900,000 comment that you referred to. So, hopefully that answers that second part.","John T. Chambers","So to answer your question on clarification on the numbers, the UCS plus the Nexus 2000 5000 and 7000 is the $5.5 billion run rate. The last quarter, we referred to UCS plus the Nexus 2000 to 5000, which are the bundled architectures that we do in the data center, was at a rate of $3.5 billion and that was the clarification. Also, I don\u2019t know if it was Ehad or Brent or Ben, but one if you all asked, is the UCS accelerating. I think the numbers already are spectacular, but they tend to go up and down a little bit, bookings didn\u2019t grow quite as fast as revenues this quarters and so, I wouldn\u2019t be modeling in the 70s, we\u2019re obviously very pleased with growth of 60%, which I think it more what we experience typically from the UCS side of the house.","Melissa Selcher","Okay. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian White with Topeka. Your line is open.","John T. Chambers","Hey Brian, Hello Brian.","Brian White \u2013 Topeka Capital Markets","Yeah John.","John T. Chambers","Okay.","Brian White \u2013 Topeka Capital Markets","Just on UCS, I\u2019m wondering if you could break out UCS, I know in some quarters you\u2019ve broken it out. I think last quarter, was it $2 billion annual run rate, maybe if you could break that out, and I\u2019m also curious, is UCS being driven more majority by the converged infrastructures or majority just by standalone sales to customers with Nexus?","John T. Chambers","Converged infrastructure is much more cloud, as a part of it, Nexus architecture is part of it. We even get some bare metal sold through with the non-traditional blade piece, but it is largely an architectural sale tied to a converged architecture in cloud movement.","In terms of the business, it\u2019s over the $2 billion run rate at the current time and I don\u2019t want to get too specific on it, but it\u2019s reasonably over, it isn\u2019t over by about a magnitude of 20% or 30% but comfortably over the $2 billion run rate. And I think Mel that\u2019s our last question. I want to thank everyone for spending the time today. We\u2019ve got the clear message.","You want the script cut down to fewer pages and some of you have implied that our P\/E ratio would go up in direct proportion to how many pages we took off and we intend to make it short and tight. We will try to keep the questions to the same type timeframe and Mel maybe other than end of year we ought to shoot for an hour conference call when we can.","Please give us the feedback overall. We know you got to earn your \u2013 we got to earn your trust and confidence every day. We\u2019re committed to that. We are committed to becoming the number one IT player and we are committed to beating our competitors and still maintaining very good margins in a tough market. So, Mel, your closing comments.","Melissa Selcher","Great, thanks John.

If you have any objections you may disconnect. Now I'd like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Sam. Welcome everyone to Cisco's second quarter fiscal 2017 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO, and Kelly Kramer, our CFO.","By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website.","Throughout this conference call we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise.","The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on form 10-K and 10-Q which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.","As a reminder, in Q2 fiscal 2016, on November 20, 2015, we completed the sale of the customer premises equipment portion of our SP video connected devices business and accordingly had no revenue or expense from that business in Q2 fiscal 2017. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP video CPE business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SP video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website, to help understand these impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q1 earnings call also has been normalized in the same way.","With that, I'll now turn it over to Chuck.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thank you, Marilyn, and good afternoon everyone. We performed well this quarter, delivering total revenue of $11.6 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.57. We drove strong profitability, healthy cash flow and growth in deferred revenue, continuing our shift toward software and recurring revenue. We also drove 51% growth in our product deferred revenue related to our recurring software and subscriptions which now stands at $4 billion. We're also pleased that the board approved a 12% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.29.","We are delivering against our strategic priorities, offering unparalleled value to our customers and we're executing and managing the business to deliver greater shareholder return. Through a disciplined investment approach, we are focused on expanding our growth opportunities and strengthening our customer value proposition.","We were very pleased to announce our intent to acquire AppDynamics as a continuation of our strategy to provide customers with deep analytics across the data center, the network as well as their applications. Increasingly, customers are seeing significant business value being delivered through applications and access through intelligent networks. Combining Cisco's infrastructure, networking and security analytics with the application analytics from AppDynamics, we will provide customers with unprecedented insights to improve business performance.","The conversations I have every day with business and government leaders around the world reinforce the importance of our strategy. They look to Cisco to connect everything and everyone by building highly secure, software defined, automated and intelligent infrastructure platforms. We offer these solutions through a variety of consumption options, giving our customers choice and flexibility.","I'd now like to cover some key business highlights, starting with our security business. We had another great quarter in security, which continued its strong momentum and growth. Revenue grew 14% and deferred revenue grew 45%, reflecting the strength of our best-of-breed offerings and architectural approach to security from the network to the endpoint to the cloud. Two weeks ago, we released the 10th Annual Cisco Cybersecurity Report, which highlights the increasing risk customers are facing around the world.","Of the organizations we surveyed, over one-third of those who experienced a breach in 2016 reported substantial losses to their business. Customers are relying on Cisco's comprehensive portfolio of best-of-breed security products and services, brought together in an integrated architectural approach to prevent and reduce the risk of business loss. As a proof point, deployments of our advanced threat solutions continue to be strong, as we added over 6,000 new customers, bringing the total to approximately 29,000 now using AMP, which led to revenue growth of 65% in the quarter.","Similar to our success in the advanced threat market, we added over 5,500 next-generation firewall customers, bringing our total customer base to 67,500. In addition to our leadership in network and advanced security, Cisco is leading the market in delivering innovative cloud-based security solutions. Last week, we announced Cisco Umbrella, the industry's first secure Internet gateway to address new enterprise security challenges in today's mobile and cloud world. Cisco Umbrella is designed to help users gain secure access to the Internet anywhere they go, even when they are off the enterprise network.","Now let's turn to collaboration. This quarter, we saw strong customer growth across our collaboration portfolio, with revenue growing 4% and deferred revenue growing 14%. Further expanding our portfolio of subscription-based offerings, we introduced Cisco Spark Board, the first all-in-one cloud-based collaboration and meeting room solution. Cisco Spark Board enables screen sharing, interactive white-boarding and videoconferencing and is complemented by a new version of our Cisco Spark application, a messaging and meeting platform for mobile and desktop endpoints. In the few weeks since launch, we have already had several hundred Cisco Spark Board customers who will be receiving ongoing innovation as part of the Cisco Spark subscription that they purchased together with the device.","We are seeing good customer momentum in our data center business, with customers choosing Cisco for the breadth of our private and hybrid cloud solutions. Across our next-generation data center portfolio, we saw healthy customer traction, including our ACI data center switching portfolio grew revenue by 28%. This includes 1,300 new Nexus 9000 customers and 450 new ACI customers in Q2, bringing the total installed base to 10,800 and 3,100 respectively. We are the only company to offer end-to-end visibility and security for 100-gig network build-outs.","In our core business, the network has never been more relevant in a world of increasing connectivity driven by cloud, social, IoT and digitization. Over the last year, we have been working hard on driving innovation in our core business and we are starting to see some of the benefits, such as our wireless portfolio this quarter. We believe we are in the early stages of a product innovation cycle driven by security, automation and analytics across the portfolio.","To further strengthen our cloud, software and IoT portfolio, as I mentioned earlier, we announced our intent to acquire AppDynamics, a market leader in application intelligence whose solutions are helping the world's largest companies improve their application and business performance. Customers will now have unprecedented insight into their data center, security infrastructure and networking performance through real-time application analytics in the cloud and on premise.","Approximately 75% of AppDynamics' product revenue is subscription-based, which aligns well with the way customers increasingly want to consume technology and with Cisco's strategic objective of moving towards more recurring revenue. The growing customer demand for real-time data is enabled by the increasing number of connected devices. We continue to build on the Jasper cloud IoT platform with new solutions. Today Jasper connects more than 40 million devices including over 12 million connected vehicles, and we're adding more than 1.5 million new devices per month. The number of enterprise customers utilizing data from the Jasper platform has grown from 4,000 a year ago to more than 9,000 this quarter.","In summary, we are confident in our strategy. We are delivering accelerated innovation across our portfolio and we are pleased with the momentum across our businesses and in our strategic shift towards recurring software and subscription-based revenue.","Now let me hand it over to Kelly to walk through our Q2 results and outlook in more detail.","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks, Chuck. So I'll start with an overview of our financial results for the quarter, followed by some comments about our capital allocation and the Q3 outlook. Overall, Q2 was a solid quarter with revenue of $11.6 billion, down 2%, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.57, flat year-over-year.","We continued to make progress on our strategic growth priorities while maintaining rigorous discipline on profitability and cash generation. As part of our strategy to drive long-term profitable growth, we're prioritizing key investments, both organically and inorganically, such as the intended acquisition of AppDynamics. Today our board approved an increase of $0.03 to the quarterly dividend, bringing it to $0.29 per share, a 12% increase, representing a yield of approximately 3.5% on today's closing price. We remain firmly committed to our capital allocation strategy and returning value to our shareholders.","Let me provide some more details on our revenue breakdown. Total product revenue was down 4% and let me walk through each of the product areas. Switching declined 5%, driven by weakness in Campus partially offset by strength in the ACI portfolio, which was up 28%. Routing was down 10%, although we did see growth in orders. Collaboration grew 4% driven by ongoing solid performance of WebEx, unified communications and TelePresence.","We saw good momentum again in the transition to subscriptions and SaaS offers with deferred revenue growing 14%. Data center declined 4%, impacted by the continued market shift from blade to rack, though last week we announced expansion of our UCS portfolio by offering the Microsoft Azure stack on UCS via an integrated validated system that enabled organizations to deliver Microsoft Azure services from their on-premise data centers. The joint Cisco and Microsoft solution provides the tools for enterprises to grow and modernize their applications in a highly flexible and scalable hybrid cloud environment.","Wireless grew 3%, with ongoing strength in Meraki and the continued ramp of our 11ac Wave 2 portfolio. Security grew 14% with deferred revenue growth of 45%, as we offer more solutions to customers with increasing software content that result in greater recurring revenue. We had very strong performance in our advanced threat security of 65% as well as strength in unified threat management and web security solutions. Our focus continues to be developing a best-of-breed portfolio while offering customers the benefit of deep architectural integration spanning the network cloud at endpoint which we believe is outpacing our competitors.","Services continues to execute well, growing 5% with a strong focus on renewals and attach rates. Overall, we drove 13% growth in total deferred revenue with product up 19% and services up 9%. We continued to build our product deferred revenue related to recurring software and subscription businesses to $4 billion, up 51%. We made good progress on increasing our recurring revenue, with 31% of our total Q2 revenue generated from recurring offers, up from 28% a year ago. In terms of orders, total product orders growth was flat with book-to-bill greater than 1.","Let's take a look at our geographies, which is a primary way we run the business. We're seeing continued strength in the Americas which grew 4%. EMEA was down 4% and APJC was down 5%. Total emerging markets declined 7% with the BRICs plus Mexico down 5%. In terms of customer segments, enterprise grew 1%, commercial grew 3%, public was down 6%, public sector was down 6% and service provider declined 1%.","From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total gross margin was 64.1%, down slightly by 0.1 points. Our product gross margin was 62.4%, down 0.9 points and service gross margin was 68.8%, growing 2.1 points. Operating margin was solid at 31%. We're maintaining our discipline and driving productivity with an ongoing focus of cost improvements and operational efficiencies, making the necessary trade-offs to drive operating margin.","At the bottom line, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.57 and GAAP EPS of $0.47. We delivered operating cash flow of $3.8 billion and ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $71.8 billion with $9.6 billion available in the U.S. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders during the quarter that included $1 billion for share repurchases and $1.3 billion for a quarterly dividend.","To summarize, we had solid performance in Q2 and managed the business well. We're making the investments we need to deliver shareholder value over the long term, and we are being very disciplined in driving continuous cost efficiencies.","Let me now reiterate our guidance for the third quarter. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. As a reminder, the third quarter of last year included an extra week, which resulted in higher revenue of $265 million and higher non-GAAP cost of sales and operating expenses of $150 million, netting into $115 million of non-GAAP operating income.","The guidance for the third quarter is as follows. We expect revenue in the range of minus 2% to 0% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be the range of 29% to 30%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.57 to $0.59. My guidance does not reflect any impact from AppDynamics.","I will now turn it back to Chuck for some closing comments.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Kelly. Once again we had a solid quarter and I'm pleased with how we're executing against our strategy. Let me summarize why I'm confident in our ability to bring even greater value to our customers, partners and shareholders.","First, we delivered strong innovation in key areas such as security, collaboration, and next-generation data center as we continue to also drive innovation in our core. Second, we have strong momentum in our transition as seen with 51% growth in our product-deferred revenue related to our recurring software and subscriptions as we continue to add more software offers like you see with Cisco Spark Board. Third, profitable growth. We continue to stay focused on driving productivity and operational efficiencies. And lastly, we remain committed to increasing shareholder return as you've seen with our dividend increase of 12%.","Our customers have never cared more about what technology can do for their business. They're looking for speed, agility, visibility and security in everything that they do. Cisco is uniquely qualified to meet these demands with our ability to drive automation, analytics with intelligence and security, all the way from the network to the application, and that's why I'm confident in our future.","Marilyn, now I'll turn it back to you for questions.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Chuck. Sam, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. And I just wanted to remind folks while Sam is doing that, I'd like to remind the audience that we ask you to ask one question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu with Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi everybody. Thank you for taking my question. I was trying to understand where we stand in the weakness you saw when you talked about three months ago. If I look at your guide, so it's fairly encouraging. It shows that we're getting back to a sequential growth that is better than slightly above what you've done on average in recent years. And then if I hear your current, so Campus was very weak in the quarter, routing as well. And you see all this coming back in routing, and my question would be whether you see something similar in Campus. Can we expect that part of the business to improve in coming months and coming quarters? And then maybe just more broadly, what's you're feeling about the macro today? The uncertainty and the weakness in orders you could see three months ago, is this something that is improving now already or not.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Pierre. Let me just start and then Kelly, you can add whatever you like here. I think as it relates to our core portfolio, we have seen obviously some macro dynamics. Europe is clearly stressed with all the geopolitical dynamics that are occurring in Europe right now across several countries. And we also have begun to invest pretty significantly over the last year, and you will see it over the coming year, in ensuring we had the appropriate investments in innovation in our core.","But you also see what we did with AppDynamics. And what I would tell you is, that when you combine the analytics that we can deliver out of the data center with the analytics that we'll deliver out of the core networking space with our security threat information and analytics out of our security portfolio, combined with the application analytics that they have, we believe that we can create a differentiated architecture for our customers going forward. And that's the purpose in the acquisition and what we intend to do going forward. So, Kelly, any other comments on the macro and the sequentials?","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","No, I think just to add to that, I think we do feel good about what we're seeing from macro in the U.S. certainly, and in commercial and enterprise. And I'd say to your point, Pierre, when you do adjust for that extra week last year, our guide, we always call it like we see it. And it does show a bit of improvement there on both the top line and bottom line. So I think \u2013 like Chuck said, I think the U.S. is solid, and again we're still cautious on outside the U.S. and Europe and Asia.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Kelly. Sam, we'll go ahead and take our next question.","Operator","Certainly. Our next question is from Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is now open.","Justin Wainwright - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. This is Justin on for Jim Suva. Thanks, Chuck and Kelly, for taking the question. I was just wondering if you could comment a little bit on your partnership with Ericsson. I know recently you've had a couple different rollouts and then some good press releases in terms of what you're doing. I was just wondering if you could maybe provide any sort of updates or any sort of milestones now that it's been about a year since you've had the partnership going? Thanks","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yeah, I think it was Justin, right?","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yep.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","That correct? Justin, thanks for the question. It's pretty timely, in fact. Obviously there's been a lot of uncertainty on the Ericsson side and we believe that all the original business drivers that led us to establish the partnership with Ericsson are still very valid. I think we have had some 300 customer engagements together. And their new CEO came onboard just about five weeks ago, I believe, and we have been in a great deal of discussion since then on ways in which we could accelerate the partnership. He is committed to continuing and trying to make this as successful as we possibly can. We're going to meet again in Barcelona at Mobile World Congress and I'd say we're focused right now on, how do we accelerate from here.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Justin. Sam, we'll go ahead and take the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Silverstein with Cowen & Company. The line is open.","Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC","If I could ask for a quick clarification and then a question. Kelly, I think last quarter you quantified the impact of the shift in the business model as over 2 percentage points in terms of the hit to growth as you increase your future visibility on the shift. Can you update? I don't think I heard you give an update this quarter. Then the question....","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","No, yeah, I think what I say is between 1% and 2%, right. So we're in that 1.5% to 2% range.","Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And would that be your expectation on an ongoing basis?","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Well again, as we continue to accelerate the growth, as we're continuing to grow it like we have been growing it, I referred it may get even more until it evens out, but in the last few quarters it has been in that range.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Paul. Sam , we'll take the next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I kind of want to circle back in the security piece. You guys had given out advanced threat numbers in the past and the breakdown there. So how does the margin structure change as you guys grow the advanced threat and the web security piece versus the legacy security portfolio you've had?","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yeah, we don't share gross margins by business unit, but I can tell you, the margins are growing in our security portfolio overall between the mix of the growth in these areas and the acquisitions and the SaaS businesses we've been adding. So it's very accretive to the Cisco average.","Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, got it. And then just one quick small follow up. Just on the repatriation potential, are you guys leaning more towards essentially M&A or buybacks or a dividend? Because you guys have raised it by 12% now, so I was just wondering how you guys think about that.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","I think, Mitch, first priority will be strategic investments that we'll make and then obviously followed with a focus on continued capital allocation and our commitment to returning capital to shareholders. So it would be a combination.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Chuck. Sam, let's go ahead and tee up for the next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Kvaal with Nomura. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities","Yes. Thank you very much for taking the question. One of the big themes with some of the other folks across the comm landscape of course, is web-scale. That wasn't a major theme of the opening script. I'm hoping that you could help us understand your positioning in web-scale, certainly in switching where the competition is heightened and also in routing and even DCI. Thank you.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yeah thanks, Jeff. So as we look at MSDC, what we've given you guys over the last few quarters is sort of a very fixed list of 10 customers that we have given. And I've said over and over that we have been spending a lot of time with these customers, really focused on understanding what their unique needs are. Frankly, some of them are so big, they're a market of one and to themselves. And I'm very pleased with the progress we're making.","If you look at those 10, just to give you the numbers this time, overall those 10 would be down. But if you normalize out one of those providers and you take the combination of the other nine \u2013 and that one has some pretty tough year-over-year comps \u2013 the other nine were up double digits. And we have one of the largest that was up triple digits for the second quarter in a row. So I feel like we're making good progress, but we still have a long way to go.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Jeff. We'll go ahead and take the next question, Sam.","Operator","Our next question is from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Chuck, appreciate the opportunity. I guess I'm going to sound like a broken record and ask the same question I ask every four or five quarters now, which is your data center revenue. Your server business, which is again, continued to stay in range, not showing much progress. How do you feel about the progress that you're making over there with hyperconverge? It just doesn't seem to be moving the dial yet. How do you resolve the issues in this business going forward?","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yeah thanks, Ittai. We can always count on you for that question. So first of all, I think in our next-gen data center switching portfolio, you can see continued performance and continued good adoption of those solutions from our customer base. I think on the hyperconverged, we certainly would like to see it moving more quickly. We have recently had a release of software that has helped with some of the capabilities, and I think that there are a couple more coming that should continue to give us more capabilities in that space. And I think that we're also looking, as you would expect, at our broad strategy in the data center and where we need to go to ensure that we best position ourselves going forward. So that work is going on as well right now, Ittai.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Chuck. Sam, let's go ahead and tee up the next question.","Operator","Yes, next question is from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank Securities. Your line is open.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Yeah hi, Chuck, Kelly.","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Hi, Vijay.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, hi.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Hey, Vijay.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, hi. I'd like to get your bigger picture thoughts, Chuck and Kelly, on how you plan to broaden your senior management team. Any new areas or skill sets you'll be looking for in the management team to drive top line growth through the rest of this year and over the next few years? And is the strategy focused primarily on doubling down on security, analytics, AI, automation? Or are there any new areas?","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Hey, Vijay, don't mean to interrupt. Can you speak up just a little bit?","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","We're having trouble hearing you.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Can you guys hear me now? Can you guys hear me now?","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Not really. Try a little louder.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Is this better?","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Better.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","That's better.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Yeah, I mean, Chuck, my question was more around on the senior management team. Any new skill sets, any new areas or avenues you'll be looking for to round out the management team to drive top line growth? Or will you primarily be doubling down on security, analytics, AI? Thank you.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","No, you know what, it's a great question. I think that when you look at the improvement we've been making around our transition to software and subscription business, you can assume that we'll continue to look for people who have those kinds of capabilities. And if you look at even the AppDynamics acquisition, David Wadhwadi, who is their CEO, was one of the key drivers behind the software transition that occurred at Adobe. So he very much understands how this transition will occur.","You can assume that we're adding talent in the areas of artificial intelligence, machine learning, analytics, software skills around simplicity and automation. As you know, if you look at our core, one of the biggest things our customers are looking for is to take out the cost of operating this infrastructure. And so as we build out automation capabilities that allow them to very dynamically change their environments as opposed to the manual way it's been done in the past, those skill sets as well. So it's a combination of all of those in addition to security and all the other areas you mentioned, so it's broad based.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Vijay. We'll go ahead and take the next question.","Operator","Thank you, next question is from Steve Milunovich with UBS Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Kelly, you mentioned the percentage of recurring revenue is 31%. If you exclude services, are we still around 9% to 10% of product revenue being recurring?","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yes.","Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC","And is there any way to turn that core routing switching business into something more recurring? I mean, we've never seen a hardware company do that, if you will, but through ELAs or something else, is there any way to turn that into a little more of a subscription consistent basis?","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yeah, that's a great question, Steve. Yeah. So actually product as a percentage of my total product revenue, it's up to 10% now this quarter for the first time, so we're happy about that. And we are trying to make that shift in the core part of the business. Cisco ONE is an example of where we are taking our ELAs and our big cross enterprise ELAs that really are a core networking business to do that. So we're trying to find ways to find other offers.","I'll just point to another example though like the Spark Board that Chuck mentioned. It's a great new innovation and extension of TelePresence, but it's a great example of where we're selling that. We used to sell it always as a system. Now we're selling the equipment, but we're selling it with a subscription. So that's an example of how we've been able to kind of to drive new offers that had been traditionally just pure system or hardware. And again, the teams are driving hard to find more ways to accelerate new offers that way.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yeah, Steve, just I want to just make a couple of comments on this. One, if you look six quarters ago when I came into the job, our overall revenue, our recurring revenue was 26% in the first four quarters. We spent time taking our teams and helping our teams understand the transition that we were going to make. So in the first four quarters, we gained 2 points. We took it up to 28%, and in the last two quarters we've added 3% so we've accelerated it. So it's going to 31 in the last two quarters. And on the product side, that went from 6% to 7% in the first year and then in the last two quarters, it's gone from 7% to 10%. So I think we're finding ways to move that forward.","As it relates to the core, I think you'll see us come out with services around automation and analytics and other things that will be sold as subscriptions on top of the platforms. And the last thing I'll tell you is that we pulled one of the key leaders from the security portfolio, who had really driven the whole product management portion of that transition to the heavy content of software and subscription that you see today, and he is now leading that force in our core networking space in the enterprise networking. So it's clearly a focus that he's trying to drive for us.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","We'll take the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. Just following up on the cash repatriation M&A question, Chuck. I just want to get a sense going forward, should we think about a continuation of more the string of pearls approach to more to AppDynamics, or you make more sizable acquisitions? And then, Kelly, I wanted to get a sense if you could help us understand how we should think about deferred revenue? Clearly growing nicely. What is the feedback loop a year or a year and a half out from now in terms of does the gross margin start to trend higher because of the deferred revenue mix has become a recurring configuration? Thank you.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Hey, Mark. First off, I'll take the repatriation and the M&A question and, Kelly, you can take the next one. So and you're free to make comments on mine as well, so.","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thank you.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","I think our M&A strategy is going to remain intact. Repatriation doesn't fundamentally change how we think about what we're going to do going forward. You can assume that we'll continue to look for opportunities that drive the business value and the relevance to our customers like we did with AppD. I mean, they have a tremendous platform that really translates application analytics to real business performance information for our customers.","And just to comment on AppDynamics, they have a very robust enterprise solution that is delivered either from the cloud or on premise and can be delivered to the customer on premise or in the cloud. So it's very flexible. And they basically have 275 of the Fortune 2000 and they really have never had a substantial partner model. So those are the reasons we think that makes a lot of sense. So strategic alignment and the ability for us to take it through our ecosystem are always positive. So, Kelly, comments on the deferred and the margins.","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yeah, on the deferred, Mark, I mean that is part of why we're trying to make this shift to software. It's our customers want those offers and to have easier way to run their IT departments. But it clearly enables us to get higher margins, for sure. And it's not only just the gross margin coming out of deferred revenue, but we're looking at our whole end-to-end operations, and how we go to market, how we drive operations in the back end here. And there's real opportunities to drive both gross margins and operating margins. So that's why we're so focused on it. That's why we're looking at acquisitions to add to it, and it will continue to help improve our mix on the margins line.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Chuck and Kelly. Sam, let's go ahead and take the next question.","Operator","Yes, our next question is from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. I just wanted to ask about product gross margins. They were a bit weaker than we had at least modeled, and I think in the 8-K there is some indication there was some pricing, but would like some more color there. I guess particularly, one thing that we noticed that the A-Pac margins were \u2013 looked particularly weak. Is this related to customer geography? Just a little help on understanding kind of where the pressures are on product gross margins.","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yeah, sure. I'll take that one, and a great question. Gross margins, we've been \u2013 again continue to operate well. I'll say there were two specific kind of headwinds that we faced this quarter. And to your point on APJC, I'll refer back to a year ago, we were benefiting from a national program in China where they were rolling out set-top boxes to tier 2 and tier 3 cities. Not our set-top boxes, but we were providing the smartcards to go with that, which they're basically for secure access and it was very, very high margin. So we had, if you go back a year ago, SP video in Asia was extremely strong because of that. That program has dramatically slowed down. And again, that pure margin just isn't there anymore, and you're seeing that flow through both the margins and the year-over-year revenues for both SP video and APJC.","The other item that's a headwind for us this quarter is we are facing a significant cost increase to our memory costs, our DRAM memory costs that we're paying. It's a very tight supply right now and we're seeing dramatic increases there. So that's hurting us quite a bit as well. But other than that, I'd say the color's in the same line. Our pricing is in \u2013 it's in the ranges that we've been the last six to eight quarters. I'd say a little on the higher end, but in line with where we were Q3, Q4. A little worse in (37:06) last quarter, but we were very low last quarter. So in the normal ranges. But really it's those two specific things. And I will say that I do anticipate those two headwinds to remain there next quarter as well as we had very strong SP video, that China program, in Q3 as well. Okay?","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","All right. Let's go ahead and take the next question, Sam.","Operator","Yes. Our next question is from Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a nice quarter. First, just had a clarification. There are a number of articles regarding a faulty clocking component over the last few weeks. Just wanted to see if you could comment to what degree that is or isn't impacting customer activity.","And then the question, I was hoping you might be able to update us in a little greater detail regarding the trends you are seeing in the service provider vertical. You mentioned some encouraging order development. So was hoping you can help us understand what you're seeing across geographies, what you're seeing from a product perspective, and to what degree that improvement is coming from routing, optical, security or some other part of the service provider business.","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Sure. I'll start on the supplier component issue. So yeah, those articles are out there. We have had an issue from a supplier come out, and we did book a reserve for $125 million, you can see in our GAAP results and in the press release, to cover that. We always, and continue to stand by our customers through any situations like this. This is very proactive. This is a failure rate that will happen over time, but we're working with our customers to work through that. So we're not anticipating any impact from that from a top line perspective.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yeah, I'll take the SP question, Kelly. So, Jess, on the service provider space, it's really similar to last time. We talked about SP CapEx. Different service providers are looking at different areas of investment depending on what's going on in their network. So you have some who are looking at macro radio densification as an example and others are looking at building out capacity in the core. And it's a segment that is very dominated by large customers. So from a quarter-to-quarter basis, any number of customers that make any sort of shift in their buying behavior can have an impact either positively or negatively. So it's a space that I would just encourage you to look at longer term.","But we did see, you know, we saw definite improvement. We saw, I would say from a regional perspective, what I would tell you is the Americas was very strong and we saw general weakness in Europe and in the China space you had a lot of this SP video implication that Kelly was talking about earlier. So overall, I think the teams did a great job. I think the teams are working incredibly well on sort of the next generation of capabilities in the platforms and in some of the software and automation, and some of the same themes that we've been talking about in the enterprise core networks, and I feel good about where they are right now.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Jess. We'll go ahead and take the next question, Sam.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you for taking my question here. I wanted a little bit of hand holding and help with interpreting this deferred revenue growth. So 51%, obviously a very big number. Looking at the balance sheet, it looks like it rose year-over-year by about $1.9 billion and you talked about the total of, I guess, software and recurring revenue at $4 billion. Could you help us get a better understanding of what are the components? And I'm presuming there's some elements that maybe are growing much slower, some growing faster. So help us understand what are the big drivers for that 51% growth. Thank you.","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Sure, so yeah. So that 51% growth is year-over-year growth of over $1.3 billion and everything's growing in that space. I'd say from a pure size, collaboration and security and Meraki are the biggest pieces of that, because they have just continued to grow their businesses significantly. And they're all growing huge double digits. But I will also say my switching, my routing, as well as data center and we've done Cisco ONE bundles as well as big enterprise license agreements. They've also been growing huge double digits as well. So at the end of the day, the year-over-year increase is across the board. Everything is up massively to drive to that 51%. And again, just the biggest chunk of it between collaboration, security and wireless, they are two-thirds I'd say of the balance, but the other pieces are rapidly -","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Wireless being Meraki.","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yeah, wireless being Meraki, yes. Hopefully that gives you the color you're looking for.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Kelly. Sam, let's go ahead and take that next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird. Your line is open.","Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you. And, Kelly, just to clarify, there's no expectation of revenue or earnings impact from this clock issue in the current quarter?","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Not as of right now. Again, we're working very proactively with our customers and in terms of how quickly and where they want to do their replacement. So we're working very, very closely, but as of right now we have not seen and don't anticipate any massive revenue impact from this.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","All right. Well, thank you. And that was our last question for today. I'm going to turn it over to Chuck for some closing remarks.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yeah, just a couple of comments, and first of all, I want to just thank you all again for joining us today. We did deliver strong innovation I believe which was reflective in the performance that we've had in security, collaboration, next-gen data center, and we continue to drive innovation in our core enterprise and SP portfolio. The deferred revenue from our subscription and software businesses is indicative I think of the transition that you should continue to expect from us.","We will continue to focus on driving profitable growth with productivity and operational efficiencies, and you also can count on the fact that we remain very committed to our shareholder return as was indicated in both our buybacks and our dividend and then the increase in the dividend this quarter. So I just want to thank all of you for being with us today. And then, Marilyn, I'll let you take it from here. Thank you.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thank you, Chuck.

Ma'am, you may begin.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Thanks, Kim. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our 101th quarterly conference call. This is Melissa Selcher, and I'm joined by John Chambers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Kelly Kramer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Rob Lloyd, President of Development and Sales; Gary Moore, President and Chief Operating Officer; and our future CEO, Chuck Robbins.","I would like to remind you that we have a corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information that will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call.

We delivered revenues of $12.1 billion, up 5%, and grew non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.54, up 6%. We maintained strong non-GAAP gross margins of 62.5%, generated $3.0 billion in operating cash flow this quarter, and returned $2.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","Last week was a great week for us as we announced the CEO who will lead Cisco in its next chapter. I am extremely excited to be joined today by Cisco's newly named CEO, Chuck Robbins. Chuck, welcome very much.","Charles H. Robbins - CEO Designate, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Field Operations & Director","Thanks, John.","John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I am confident you will come to understand why the Cisco Board of Directors and I are so convinced he is the right leader for Cisco right now.","As I reflect back, I'm extremely honored and proud to have led Cisco for the last 20-plus years. We set out to change the way the world works, lives, learns, and plays. And while many thought this was a very ambitious and not unobtainable goal, we absolutely have achieved that goal. We have delivered incredible innovation and have disrupted markets and at times ourselves. We have seen many competitors come and go. We've had our setbacks but always come back even stronger, something almost no other technology company has done. We have remained incredibly focused on delivering for our shareholders. We are a cash and profit machine and have maintained our margins over time by delivering sustainable differentiation through integrated architectures based on intelligent networks.","What I am most proud of, however, is how well positioned we are to repeat the success of this last 20 years. Across every market and every industry, we are moving from the information age to the digital age, and the pace of change is only accelerating. Cisco is a very strong leadership position. Our vision and strategy are working as every company, city, and country becomes digital. They are realizing Cisco is best positioned to help them as they become digital organizations.","What our customers recognize is Cisco's unique track record and ability to anticipate transitions and deliver the innovation to help our customers adapt and accelerate in this new environment. Cisco's sustainable differentiation over time, as reflected in our strong gross margins, profitability, and cash generation, is the result of our ability to deliver integrated architectures and solutions with scale, speed, and security no one else can. We've moved from selling boxes, cloud, mobility, or any other solution to partner with customers on their outcomes; 44,000 jobs in Barcelona, education and healthcare accessible to virtually every home in Israel, entirely new cloud-based revenue streams for service providers, and General Motors' smart factory of the future.","Competitors selling low-cost technology building blocks can't compete with our total cost advantage, operational efficiency, security, and speed to results that Cisco provides. And when there is an issue, we have all seen the nightmare of trying to identify where and who to call translate in billions in lost business and reputational damages. When companies and countries go digital, IT becomes a board-level concern; and reliability, security, trust matter more than ever. The Cisco brand behind every one of our architectures matters more now than ever.","We are seeing our moves from selling boxes to selling outcomes translate into strong execution in a tough global market. We are seeing many areas of strength, including global enterprise with order growth of 7%, global commercial orders up 6%, and global public sector orders up 7%. The U.S. excluding service provider was particularly strong, with Brian Marlier's U.S. enterprise order growth of 21%, U.S. commercial order growth of 11%, and U.S. public sector order growth of 10%. We saw good revenue growth across almost all of our technologies.","The volatility in service provider and emerging markets we have discussed in prior quarters continues. Our service provider business remains challenged both globally and in the U.S. Service provider orders globally decreased 7% and U.S. service provider orders declined 17%. Emerging market orders were flat, with the BRICs plus Mexico down 6%, while the remaining emerging markets grew 6%. I believe we have organized well to capture more than our share in these markets and positioned ourselves for their inevitable upturns.","Like every other company, we're also managing the impact of currency fluctuations globally. Kelly and I are both very pleased with the focus of the whole company on maintaining stable gross margins in this environment. We were especially pleased with how the sales teams have held gross margins in a very tough foreign exchange environment. Repeating the common theme, those critics that felt new software or business models would have a major negative impact on our business and our margins were just wrong.","Clearly there are more positives than headwinds, and I am very pleased with our solid execution. At a time when many of our peers are seeing revenues decline, we delivered profitable growth, as we said we would, and over-delivered almost on every metric we set.","Now I will move on to guidance. I continue to be pleased with our execution in a tough environment, the strength of our financial model, and the return we continue to drive for our shareholders. For Q4, we expect to see revenue growth in the range of 1% to 3% and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.55 to $0.57.","Let me now provide some additional details on the business momentum we see in our geographies, customer segments, and product and services business within our portfolio. As a reminder, geographies are the primary way we run our business. For geographies and customer segments, I will speak in terms of product orders year over year unless otherwise noted.","We finished the quarter with product orders up 2% and product book-to-bill of greater than one. Moving first to the Americas, the Americas grew in total 2%. I discussed up front the U.S. public sector growth of 10%, with the U.S. federal growth of 24% and state and local up 1%. We also discussed the very strong U.S. enterprise growth of 21% and U.S. commercial growth of 11%. And the U.S. service provider was down 17%. Latin America had another strong double-digit growth quarter.","Moving on to Europe, Middle East, and Africa, we saw Europe, Middle East, and Africa growth of 2%. Europe first turned up for us five quarters ago, and since then has averaged mid-single-digit growth, including this quarter. If you take out Russia, we saw solid growth across all of Europe, Middle East, and Africa of 4%.","We were pleased to see Asia-Pacific, Japan, and China return to growth, growing 1%; and just to give you an idea of what sometimes the emerging markets have an impact on in terms of our business, with Asia-Pacific, Japan, and China minus China growing at 8%.","And finally, emerging countries; emerging markets in total were flat. The emerging markets excluding BRICs plus Mexico grew 6%. As discussed, we continue to see the BRICs plus Mexico challenged, down 6% in total, with Russia down 41%, Brazil down 10%, and China down 20%. We did see strong growth in Mexico, up 53%, and India up 6%. We are modeling the volatility in emerging markets to continue for several more quarters.","Now moving on to customer segments, we discussed the strong growth of total global enterprise, up 7%, with total global commercial up 6% and global public sector up 7%. The new models we have implemented globally in each of these segments are working. In enterprise, the shift to selling outcomes, not products, is resulting in larger opportunities and dramatic increases in pipeline. In U.S. enterprise, for example, the value of our pipeline of deals over $1 million increased approximately 60% year over year, with the average deal size up over 30%.","We are managing continued challenges in our service provider business, which declined 7%, as global service provider CapEx remained under pressure and industry consolidation continues. We believe the organizational changes we have made in our global service provider organization are working, and we are very focused on growing our share of wallet. At Mobile World Congress earlier this year, we issued announcements with over 10 global service providers, including the launch of Cloud VP and service with Deutsche Telekom, Connected Car service with AT&T, and a small sales solution for large enterprise deployments with Vodafone.","Now moving on the products and service, I will discuss products and service business in terms of revenue year over year unless otherwise stated. Starting with switching, we saw another solid quarter in switching, with growth of 6%. The strong momentum of our application-centric infrastructure portfolio continues. The Nexus 3000 plus Nexus 9000 grew 144%. We added over 970 new Nexus 9000 customers and ACI customers this quarter, to reach a total over 2,650 customers. The 8-bit controller customers grew from over 300 last quarter to 580 this quarter. Nexus 9000 orders plus ASIC grew sequentially 27%, and we expect that sequential growth to accelerate in Q4. We also saw good momentum in our campus portfolio, especially in fixed.","We did see some pressure in our modular switching as we managed the transition in the high end of our switching portfolio. As we've discussed, we expect this transition to continue for a few more quarters. I am particularly pleased that we have kept gross margins extremely stable in switching, even as we are driving our product transition in the data center.","Moving on to the data center, UCS momentum continues with over $3 billion in revenue run rate, with over 43,800 UCS customers. The number of repeat UCS customers grew 34% year over year. The innovation UCS brought to the market, an architecture that converges networking servers and storage, has disrupted the market, and Cisco went from nowhere to the market share leader in x86 blades in the U.S. and the number two player worldwide, with more than 85% of the Fortune 500 companies now investing in UCS.","We continue to see significant growth with our converged offerings, including VCE and FlexPod, in addition to the positive initial ramp with our IBM VersaStack solution. We had a solid quarter in NGN routing, which grew 4%. We saw solid performance in high-end routing again this quarter, up 5%, supported by strong momentum in our new product introductions, including the CRS-X and NCS, which were both up over 200%. This growth is a direct result of the transition we drove in our core routing over the last several years.","During the quarter, Verizon announced it is moving to a next-generation 100-gig Metro network in the U.S. and that it will test and deploy Cisco networking convergence systems, the NCS. No one thought we were even in this game. Our ability to win the deal was entirely driven by our new generation in terms of engineering organization, our ability to deliver integrated architectures, our agility with engineering to realign resources quickly, the speed of our innovation, and our unique ability to partner with our customer to shape their future and the future of the industry.","Moving on to wireless, we saw solid growth of 9%. Meraki continued with just very strong momentum, up 92% year over year, and it drove most of our growth this quarter in the wireless category, as they add new customers to their cloud-managed wireless platform. We did see some softness in the public sector wireless spending, driven primarily by E-Rate funding timing.","Security growth rebounded to a strong 14%, with orders growing even faster. We saw a number of strong trends and data points that support our strategy to drive to an integrated security architecture across our customers' organizations. Customers are realizing that dozens of security vendors hinder business by not solving their challenges.","As everything in the world becomes digital, they want a player who can step up and be their trusted partner across the board. No one is better positioned than Cisco. We believe we are the only player capable of providing an integrated architecture across intelligent networks and are confident in our strategy to be the number one security company for our customers.","A few examples of our momentum include in this quarter we signed a record number of security enterprise license agreements. Our FirePOWER series, which integrates our Sourcefire software, are continuing to show very strong momentum, far exceeding our initial forecasts. And we saw continued strong traction and growth in our advanced threat solutions, including Advanced Malware Protection Everywhere and Cyber Threat Defense.","Moving on to collaboration, our collaboration momentum continues, with revenue growth of 7%. This quarter was a strong quarter for TelePresence end points, with revenue up 19% and unit orders up a record 66%. The team is on a mission to put collaboration into every office and every room. Our strategy is to deliver a new generation of product experiences at significantly lower prices, and it is working.","We also saw strong performance of our cloud-based offerings, with conferencing growth of 11%. More people than ever are using WebEx, with the number of billable users growing over 28% to over 15 million users. In the quarter, we launched Spark for Teams, which is proving to be a strong play in the very hot business messaging market. SP video declined 5%. We continue to focus on improving profitability in this business as we develop next-generation end-to-end video solutions combining hardware, software, and services.","Services revenue grew 3%, with orders growing faster than revenue. We saw growth in both technical and advanced services. And our portfolio of cloud, security, consulting, and analytics grew in double digits again this quarter. Our gross margins continue to lead the industry by a significant amount and remain very stable in terms of services gross margin, in the 65% range plus or minus a point or two.","We continue to believe our strategy to provide higher value to our customers by delivering business outcomes is working. The opportunities that are ahead of us as we move into the Internet of Everything [IOE] are very real. We look at the increased security requirements and the demand for security consultancy services. We also focused on the need to manage and capture insights for data distribution across the enterprise and network. We are moving rapidly to build the capabilities across our portfolio to differentiate Cisco's leadership in the Internet of Everything.","Now let me provide an update on Cisco's momentum in cloud. We continue to lead in the hybrid cloud market and increase our intercloud momentum. This quarter we launched Phase 2 of our intercloud strategy, linking different clouds together using interoperable and app-centric software to create hybrid clouds. Rob, thank you so much for your leadership here; your team is doing a great job.","Robert W. Lloyd - President-Development & Sales","You're welcome.","John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","During the quarter we announced Cisco and Microsoft will integrate Cisco cloud innovations with Microsoft Azure to help service providers more quickly and cost efficiently launch new applications. We will also extend the enterprise-class security and services and customer private clouds to Microsoft Azure with Cisco Cloud Services Router, the 1000V. Within our strategy to work across hypervisors and stacks, we continue our investment in OpenStack with the launch at our Worldwide Partners Conference of Cisco OpenStack Private Cloud Solutions, aimed at on-premise cloud capabilities for application developers.","To summarize my comments, our customer conversations today are not about standalone products. They are simply about digitization, growth, new revenue streams for them, innovation, and business outcomes. We believe we are pulling away from our competition using the same formula that we've always used, integrating our industry-leading products in every category into architectures and solutions that deliver real outcomes. We've created this opportunity and it is ours to execute.","I will now turn the call over to Kelly for her comments in the quarter and guidance for next quarter; to you, Kelly.","Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, John.","Overall, we had a very solid quarter and executed well. From a top line perspective, total revenue was $12.1 billion, increasing 5%. And we expanded our non-GAAP operating margin to 28.6%, with both non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS growing 6% to $2.8 billion and $0.54 respectively. Our GAAP net income was $2.4 billion, and GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis was $0.47. Product revenue increased 6% and service revenue increased 3%, with product book-to-bill greater than one.","For Q3, our total non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP product gross margin came in at 62.5% and 61.8% respectively. The increase in our non-GAAP product gross margin as compared to Q2 was driven by improved productivity, partially offset by product mix and pricing. Non-GAAP service gross margin was 65.0%.","Looking at our geographic segment results in terms of total revenue, our Americas segment was up 8%. EMEA was up 2%, and APJC was down 1%. Total gross margin for the Americas was 62.9%. EMEA was 62.5%, while APJC was 61.2%.","Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.1 billion, up 3% or 33.9% as a percentage of revenue as compared to 34.6% in Q3 of fiscal year 2014.","Our head count increased by approximately 800 to 70,951, reflecting investments in key growth areas such as security, cloud, and software.","The non-GAAP tax provision rate of 22% for the quarter was consistent with our expectations.","Our GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share included a benefit $164 million or approximately $0.03 per share related to the charge we recorded in Q2 of 2014 for a supplier component matter. The adjustment is a reduction of a liability reflecting lower than expected costs to remediate the impacted products with our customers. This amount is excluded from our non-GAAP results.","From a balance sheet and cash flow perspective, total cash, cash equivalents, and investments were $54.4 billion, including $2.6 billion available in the U.S. at the end of the quarter. We generated operating cash flow of $3.0 billion during the quarter.","Deferred revenue was $14.2 billion, up 8%. Product deferred revenue grew in the double digits again this quarter at 12%, driven largely by subscription-based offerings, while services deferred revenue also grew, up 6%, reflecting an increase in multiyear service arrangements. We continue to build a greater mix of recurring revenue, as reflected in our deferred revenue.","Our DSO was 37 days as compared to 35 days in Q3 of 2014.","In Q3 we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders. That included $1.0 billion through share repurchases and $1.1 billion through our quarterly dividend, which we increased 11% last quarter. So far in fiscal year 2015, we have returned approximately $6.2 billion or 83% of free cash flow to our shareholders, comprised of $3.2 billion of share repurchases $3.0 billion of dividends.","Now let me provide a few comments on our guidance for the fourth quarter. Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors. And understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements, and actual results could be above or below guidance. The guidance we're providing is on a non-GAAP basis with reconciliation to GAAP.","As John mentioned, we expect total revenue to be in the range of 1% to 3% growth on a year-over-year basis. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 62%. As we have said in the past, forecasting non-GAAP gross margin has always been challenging due to various factors such as volume, product mix, cost savings, and pricing. As a reminder, non-GAAP gross margin may vary quarter to quarter by a point in either direction of our guidance range.","Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 is expected to be in the range of 27.5% to 28.5%. Our non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be approximately 22% in the fourth quarter.","Our Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.55 to $0.57. We anticipate our GAAP earnings to be lower than our non-GAAP EPS by $0.10 to $0.13 per share in Q4 of 2015. The range includes a pre-tax charge of approximately $100 million as a result of the restructuring actions that we announced in the first quarter. During Q3, we recognized pre-tax charges to our GAAP financials statements of $24 million related to that announcement, and we expect total charges not to exceed $600 million during fiscal year 2015. Please see the slides that accompany this webcast for more detail.","Other than those quantified items noted previously, there no other significant differences between GAAP and our non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructurings, and tax or other events which may or may not be significant.","We believe we are executing well in a rapidly transforming market, and we'll continue to provide our guidance with all the appropriate caveats one quarter at a time. We encourage our shareholders to have similar considerations. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.","I will now hand it back to John for his summary comments.","John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Kelly, thank you very much and nice job.","I believe Cisco is at a very positive inflection point. In our 1997 Annual Report, when it was not obvious that the Internet would take off, we boldly declared that an Internet revolution would alter the fortune of companies, countries, and people, and we saw it come to life. A number of years ago we started talking about the next phase of the Internet, the Internet of Everything. That will be much bigger than the last, and it will require everything to become digital. At the time, almost no one understood what we saw. Today, it's everyone's idea. The conversations we are having today with our customers are so similar in many ways to those that we had 20 years ago. We have always been the example and saw the transitions early. And when others start noticing them, they are well underway.","As we help companies, cities, countries digitize, the outcomes are exciting, job creation, quality of life, efficient use of resources. Our customers feel the pace of change accelerating, and they see this disruption in every industry and market. They know their success depends on fast innovation, digitizing their business, entirely new IT organization structures and business organization structures. Whether they are the disruptor or the incumbent, they are coming to Cisco as their strategic partner in the digital transformation. As they build their businesses around mobile, cloud, social, data, and analytics, they recognize that integrated architectures with the intelligent networks at the core will accelerate or, if they don't take advantage of it, inhibit their ability to move with the speed, scale, and security required. In simple terms, they know they will either disrupt or be disrupted.","I am spending more and more of my time with CEOs, boards of directors, and government leaders to explain the combination of technological, organizational, and process transformation to meet these goals of our customers. And, as in the 1990s, in order to be a true partner to our customers, we have to lead by example. This goes to the reference point for how you reinvent yourself to embrace the opportunities of digitalization and the speed of innovation required for the future. We are three years ahead in making our own transitions. And with the pace of change in our market, three years makes a huge difference.","What does this mean for Cisco and our shareholders? First, we spent the last 20 years moving everything to IP and taking advantage of convergence. The intelligent network is at the center of every market transition, and no one comes close to Cisco when it comes to the network. As 50 billion more devices come online, we have a strong hand to play, and we are playing it.","Second, we are driving outcomes for our customers through architectures. This is how we differentiate against white label and single-product companies, and you can see this in our financial results, our margin stability, operating leverage, market share, and growth.","Third, in a digital world, security becomes even more important. Cisco is the logical choice as we combine a security architecture across the intelligent network. Understanding the direction of the market and challenging ourselves to reinvent is how we address this opportunity and drive long-term value for our shareholders.","There could not be a better time to begin Cisco's next chapter, and there is no one more excited than I am to have Chuck Robbins as the next CEO for Cisco. I want to thank the Cisco employees who are leading our change and driving our innovation, and your patience and energy is making Cisco's future possible. Chuck, I know you will leverage the things that have made us great to date. I also know you will make changes when needed and drive innovation and new capabilities at a faster pace.","Cisco's momentum is strong, and we are extremely well positioned for the opportunities created by digitization. Every business and government leader is learning the benefits of becoming digital, growth, leadership, efficiency, productivity, conservation, safety, quality of life, and education, these outcomes that are at the core of what Cisco has enabled for the last 20 years. We wanted to use the Internet to change the way we work, live, learn, and play, and that's exactly what we've done in the past and what we will do even more in the future.","With that, Mel, we will move to the session that I enjoy most, which is the Q&A. I'm going to turn it over to you.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Great, thanks. All right, Kim, we're ready to open for questions. I'd like to remind anyone asking a question, please ask just one question. First question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The first question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Simona.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, John, and congratulations on all that you have accomplished in the last 20 years. And I also want to wish Chuck all the best of luck going forward.","In terms of my question, so, John, you spent quite a lot of time on this call talking about a very positive inflection point, and I just wanted to understand if that is something that you expect us to see externally in terms of accelerating revenue growth. Or do you think that because you're also transitioning to more software in a recurring revenue model, that's going to really mask it because we're going to have the business mix?","And then in terms of timing, if it is something that you think will accelerate the business, are you looking at the next couple of quarters or more the next couple of years? I just wanted to get a sense of the timing of the inflection.","John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Got you. And it's always fun. Mel, I'm probably going to break a couple of my golden rules of 20 years with some of my comments today. And, Chuck, you can do the same thing after 10 years on the job. But I'm answering them in sequence. First of all, the opportunity is absolutely in revenue growth and profit growth. And as you sell solutions moving to outcomes, and you can do that much faster because of your architectures in the intelligent network, you get margin stability and premiums to go with it. Let me use maybe just a couple quick examples of how I'd illustrate that.","In the U.S. enterprise, if we would have told you that the top U.S. enterprise accounts under Brian's [Marlier] team were to be able to grow at 21% year over year, you would say I doubt that. But it took us a while and there were a couple bumps in the transition, but when you now grow at that rate and have the number of large opportunities increase at the pace that we saw, you can see an inflection point which will absolutely translate not just to growth in U.S. enterprise but globally. And let me give you an idea how that pipeline is expanding.","We now sell business transformations, what Brian and Sandy [Hogan] do there together. In the present time, we have 1,200 projects going on business transformation and outcomes. That is a pipeline of $3.7 billion in opportunity over the next 18 months. Now we won't get all of that, but it gives you an idea of how rapidly that project has changed. They sell to the business community with support of the CIO as opposed to respond to RFPs. In the last quarter alone, you had 540 new projects in the quarter put into this pipeline, and they had a potential of $950 million. What Chuck has done so well, whether it's in the enterprise business and you take it globally, Chuck, and taking that model and rebuilding it to our vision and strategy make it together, it's exactly one of the reasons he got this job.","The commercial marketplace in the U.S. has grown for six quarters in a row at approximately 10% to 11%. No one else in the world is doing those numbers. Again, Simona, it is purely business-based outcomes and selling architectures. And what Chuck has done there is he's taken what Alison Gleeson did and taken it on a global basis, and so you see the same opportunity from that perspective.","In terms of our two headwinds, the emerging markets is hard to call, and I think it's awful easy to take out a couple pieces and say this is what our growth would have been otherwise. But think about it. Our problem in emerging markets is now down to three major countries. It's China. Asia-Pacific without China, instead of growing at 1%, would have grown at 8%. Chuck, you and I are going over there every quarter, which is mainly you going and me occasionally following. But we'll eventually get that one turned around assuming our governments get along.","Russia in Europe, 41%, and it took down the numbers there a fair amount. But service provider, which was our biggest hit this quarter versus last quarter, instead of being down 1% was down 7%. And, Mel, we said last quarter it's going to take us time to get this fixed. We didn't expect a positive upturn. Here I'm going to break one of my rules. I feel very comfortable that you'll see in the next several quarters \u2013 Kelly is cringing, but that's all right, Kelly, you'll get used to it. Chuck, this is one of my bad habits I want you to keep.","But if you look at service provider, we'll turn that back positive. The organization changes that Chuck made in the field that Pankaj [Patel] turned the engineering organization sideways to focus on outcomes, knocking down literally silos over 60 business units that now are integrated toward outcomes together. That will turn back positive. And we aren't modeling it because CapEx is going to increase. We do not think it will in the second half of the year. We think actually our share of wallet is going to change.","Now let me put these pieces together. When you win a Verizon deal, people didn't get what that was. That was optical in an area that we've traditionally not been strong in. Because we organized our sales engine different, our service engines different, and our R&D engine different, we understood what the customer wanted. We understood on the fly how we'd realign resources. We understood how you're going to have a win rate that is much higher than ever before in markets that we haven't traditionally been as strong. So all those, Simona, translate into revenue growth and profit growth.","So am I pumped? Oh, yes. And could I be more excited than ever to turn it over to Chuck and watch what's going to happen? I feel real good about our future, a lot of growth in revenues and a lot of growth in profits.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Great. Thanks, Simona. Operator, next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS Securities.","John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Amitabh.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. How are you, John? Congratulations again from my end; and, Chuck, congrats to you as well. I guess, John, the one area I wanted to maybe get your thoughts on, you've been talking about Intercloud. It's a key pinnacle to your cloud strategy over the last couple of quarters. Yet I think outside of some of the larger metrics you've shared in terms of the traction with data centers and customers, is there any help you can give us in terms of how we think about the monetization potential with Intercloud and how that's tracking for you?","John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Rob has been the sponsor of this and the father, but let me start with a very positive area. Our service provider position is changing all for the positive. They look at us in terms of mobility leadership. They look at us in terms of video leadership. They look at us in terms of data center leadership. They look at us in terms of security leadership. And with our NFV and SDN capabilities, we are leading in software.","And the pieces that were missing was how do you go into this new environment where each of these \"public clouds in clouds\" are separate and you have to be on different vendors or different companies' ability to go into it. And so what we're looking at, it first is an architecture and it cements our relationships in service providers. And then it really comes through to how you monetize it over time. This will just take time to monetize, but the effect we see indirectly is already huge when you talk about a Deutsche Telekom or a Telstra and our relationships with those. So, Rob, a little bit in terms of how you measure success but prior to when we get into the monetization stage.","Robert W. Lloyd - President-Development & Sales","Okay. So, John, I think the metrics that we study, and we actually get together once a week, one year into the announcement of intercloud, we have three key areas that we focus on. The first is the impact we're having in accelerating Cisco's success in private cloud. You just mentioned the 21% growth of UCS. You mentioned the increase in the number of customers, up from 300 to 580 with APIC. We've seen success with converged infrastructure. So maintaining that leadership position in private cloud, and now starting to track our success with the Cisco ONE Cloud Suite, which will bundle up our capabilities in UCS, UCS Director, the intercloud fabric, and all the client service catalogs. So if you look at all the metrics, we really do think on the scorecard of private cloud we're doing extremely well.","The second thing we're looking at through intercloud is driving innovation through open source development. And you mentioned in Montreal that we had announced a private cloud version of OpenStack, OpenStack Private Cloud for developers inside the firewall. I will be tracking very closely how well we do in that environment with OpenStack. And clearly, with 65 partners embracing OpenStack in the public cloud, something you just mentioned, we're really tracking how well we do in delivering OpenStack in the public cloud. The monetization model is infrastructure, and we should measure how well we do in building the infrastructure that will sit in private and public cloud underneath this OpenStack innovation.","And the final thing, and this is just emerging but you've seen some recent examples, is the richness of the software catalog that Cisco brings to the intercloud marketplace. We've seen very good momentum recently with hosted collaboration solution, delivered by over 60 partners. You mentioned Rowan's [Trollope] announcement of Spark for Teams, and that's a pure SaaS offer. And something a lot of people might have missed was the Cisco Collaboration Knowledge SaaS offers. So in the area of collaboration, you see a very rich set of offers. We're looking at that marketplace, which will be a combination of Cisco and our partners' offers, and we measure those going forward. So those three areas I'd say lots of work left to do, but the scorecard is looking pretty good.","John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Rob. Amitabh, thank you.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Great. Thanks, Amitabh. Next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank.","John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Brian.","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, John, and congratulations as well on your new role. It's been nice working with you over the last 20 years. And, Chuck, good luck in your new role as well.","Charles H. Robbins - CEO Designate, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Field Operations & Director","Thank you.","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So my question, John, is by fiscal 2016 you could see the Web 2.0 CapEx higher than what you're seeing out of the carriers, the AT&Ts and Verizons. So how is Cisco positioned to sell into the web cloud customer base as trend setters in the spending market? And then how is Cisco preparing for the CapEx to OpEx transition you're seeing as cloud services shift from buying boxes to buying services? Can you talk a little bit about how you're seeing that play out and what you think that growth will be for Cisco over the next few years? Thanks.","John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. If you look at where we are, and let's call it the massively scalable data centers, the top 10, our role in that is evolving, and candidly we're starting to move much faster. If you watch our ability to bring new products to market, you're going to see us have all 10 of the major players as key customers shortly. And up to recently, as you know, we were missing largely in one of those.","Secondly is Pankaj has turned this engineering organization sideways and began to really focus on speed of small agile teams. And I can walk through a number of examples from mobility to security, but let's just talk about now how we'll develop our high-end products. We used to think about developing a high-end product with maybe 3,000 people, at least three to five years to do it. Watch how we develop our next generation of router products for these major players, and we'll do it in less than 12 months with probably 225 people. And so you're talking, and what these players would say, Cisco, you're finally getting it. You're getting your speed of change with that. You understand how to make the transition.","So I look at this as a very good opportunity for us to play in those with an increasing share of their spend. And different than our peers, we will do it with software independent where appropriate or a combination of software, hardware, and ASICs. And I really like our momentum we're starting to get in these accounts, and it ranges from the Microsofts of the world to the Googles of the world to the Facebooks, to the Amazons. Chuck, any thoughts on that one?","Charles H. Robbins - CEO Designate, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Field Operations & Director","Yes, John. So one of the key tenets that I've talked about over the last couple weeks is our need in the future to rapidly realign and adjust our portfolio based on what we're seeing with our customer base. And I think that the moves that Pankaj has made are really going to allow us to do that more effectively. And I think that will allow us to deal with, Brian, the shift that you highlighted from CapEx spend to some of the Web 2.0 players, and we're working that portfolio now. We're working closely with many of them, and I think you'll see us evolve that as necessary over the next couple quarters.","I think when you think about the SP space, I think the biggest thing we've done over the last year, year and a half is that we've really achieved architectural alignment with our SP customers, understanding where they want to go, and aligning our portfolio. And I think that our speed with which we've moved into the virtual managed services space and some of the wins that we announced that John referenced at Mobile World Congress and some of the wins with Verizon and others are indicative of our alignment with where they want to go, and I think you'll see more of that from us in the future.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Great. Operator, our next question?","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley Investments.","John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, James.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, congratulations to John and Chuck from me as well. I just wanted as quickly on security, and it's an area that obviously saw good growth. But I'm wondering how security and security concerns may be impacting demand in some of your other product segments firstly. And secondly, also related to security, how should we think about your efforts in security in areas where you may see some room for improvement in the product portfolio, et cetera? Thank you.","John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Got you. So security is the ideal market for us. It basically is made up of hundreds of fragmented players. We're the largest volume player at only 7.5% of the market. And you know our view, we don't enter markets where we don't have a good chance of getting to 40% market share with sustainable differentiation. We believe it's going to be set up for an architectural play, and it's going to require integration with intelligence throughout the cloud, throughout the data centers, the WAN down to the access, combining mobile with the Internet of Everything and digitization, et cetera.","We're on a journey here. We love the momentum, 14% growth with orders growing faster, which I think was 20% growth, and I expect us to do a lot better than that over time. The pull-through on it is very interesting because now this goes back to when we sell, we don't sell a product or just an architecture. When you go in and you talk about digitizing your company, we talk about how all of our product architectures come together. And then when we talk about security together with IOE, digitizing your company, mobile, et cetera, you suddenly see how security ties across all those. So we're starting to get upgrades and we're learning how to sell this better. And probably again, Brian and Sandy's group have done the best job. We get whole \u2013 getting $10 million to $50 million upgrades of the whole network because of the security implications, how it ties together.","It also gives us a seat at the boardroom where on the one hand, we can say you either disrupt or you die. And on the other hand, your major fear of a CEO or a board is what happens if we have a problem? How do I minimize it? How do I know I've done everything possible? And don't save me a couple hundred thousand dollars on a white label box that causes me a problem. So our win rate goes way up and our relevance goes way up. And you will continue to see us move in terms of additional moves as we go in the future.","Chuck, I'm going ask you maybe just to comment about his indirect question, which is acquisitions. Don't tie down to a specific industry, but your overall view of innovation, how we defined it before, and your thoughts about are we going to continue with the model if that includes acquisitions in that model.","Charles H. Robbins - CEO Designate, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Field Operations & Director","Yes, John. So as I think about M&A activity going forward, I think if you look back at our strategy for innovation, it has always combined a combination of internal R&D partnerships and acquisitions. If you just look at the landscape today that we see in the consolidation of many of our peers and competitors, and, John, you've been talking about brutal consolidations for a few quarters now. Many of those that we see out there now are really around cost synergies, candidly that are between players that perhaps aren't as strategically well positioned. And when we see that happen, that usually creates opportunity for Cisco, and that's when we usually take advantage of those situations.","The others that you see out there are more driven based on real strategic alignment and strategic acceleration, and those are typically done I believe by companies who are strategically better positioned in the marketplace relative to what's going on, which is where I would argue we are right now. So when I think about it, you'll see us take advantage of the latter. We'll leverage our go-to-market, our scale, our channel to accelerate time to market. And what I would \u2013 the example I would give you is Meraki. We paid $1.2 billion for Meraki when it had $100 million in bookings, and now we're on a $600 million bookings run rate by bringing that inside and leveraging what we're able to do. And that's what you'll see from us in the future, which is really I think M&A that fits within our innovation strategy with a great deal of accountability.","John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Now Mel always kicks me underneath the table. And since it's my last one, we won't comment on rumors about acquisitions or not, but I wouldn't bet on the one that you heard today. Sorry, Mel. I know I'm going to break all kinds of rules today. Chuck, they're yours to rebuild.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with Sanford Bernstein.","Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, thank you for taking my question. I'd like to discuss a bit the transition, the CEO transition, Chuck and John. Could you tell us about, John, how you see your role going forward as an Executive Chairman? How are you going to keep yourself busy? Are you going to have a day-to-day role with clients, and maybe if you can make a difference between maybe like a transition period and on a more like run rate basis to the back of that, how you're going to continue to be involved, if any?","John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So let me first say it very crisply. Chuck is the CEO, period. He will make the decisions. I will be an advisor to him and I'll be very involved where he wants me to be. The things I love most are vision and strategy. I love time with customers, strategic partnerships, acquisitions, and whatever else Chuck wants me to do. I will be his wing man, period, in terms of how we do this. We were beginning to graph out our time. I think, Chuck, both your and my calendar is full, full time for about four months, and I'm trying to in this job be working about half-time. So, Chuck, the one assignment I give on this transition is to get me to half-time sometime in the fall because the hunting season is coming up.","Charles H. Robbins - CEO Designate, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Field Operations & Director","You realize your wife is paying me to keep you busy.","John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. My wife got Chuck's number so she could text him when it was time for me to go on the road again. But it's a nice way of saying that as we look forward, the transition will be very smooth. I will be an advisor and a coach for Chuck. We will not talk about that publicly. And I will do work where we can add value.","I think a model that's similar is what Intel's done with Andy [Bryant] and BK [Brian Krzanich], where BK uses Andy very effectively with the board in key projects areas. And candidly, I think, Chuck, you went down to talk to BK \u2013 Brian about what that role might be. But it's Chuck's decision on this. And, Chuck, maybe your comments and you could also share what you plan to do over the next 90 days, if you want.","Charles H. Robbins - CEO Designate, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Field Operations & Director","I think, Pierre, I would say that the one thing John has been very clear with me is exactly what he just said to you, and he's been unwavering in our discussions on that. What I would say is that everyone's been asking me what our priorities are, what we're going to be focused on. And as I've said to everyone, we went through the process with the board and we prepared a great deal of our thoughts around strategy and what we would do. And now I want to just test that with our team. I want spend the next 90 days just talking to our leadership team, our employees, our customers, our partners, our shareholders, analysts to really just make sure that the theories and the things that I think we should be doing are in alignment.","And I'm going to focus \u2013 beyond that, we're going to focus on aligning our resources against the best priorities for the company. I really want to focus secondly on clarity and simplification of our messages, and that's internal and external. We'll take what Gary's done and built with a lot of the operational capabilities and the processes that he's built, and we'll double down on that and continue to work. And that includes across revenue opportunities, expense areas, as well as gross margins. And then finally, we'll double down on our culture, because I think one of the things that has just made Cisco fantastic are our people. So that's a big focus area for me as well.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Operator, next question?","Operator","Yes, thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.","John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Mark.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you, John. Hi, thank you, John, and welcome, Chuck. So Cisco is steadily growing its SaaS business and the recurring revenue. So with this uptick in the pace of software growth as we transition from boxes to solutions, should we start thinking of and planning for a long-term lift to margins? And with more software comes higher cash flow. Should we start to also think about more cash ultimately coming back to shareholders?","John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So a series of questions. Let me take part of them, and then Kelly can kick me or not. You are going to see us move more and more into recurring revenue and deferred revenue. The art is to do both at the same time, Chuck, and I believe in 'and'. We want to grow our revenue in the short term and long term and our profits in the short term and long term faster than revenue. But we clearly are moving rapidly through that transition. Probably the best example to give you on what's been successful would be the example in terms of what we're doing in the security space in terms of Meraki where you begin to probably split it two dollars for one dollar. Two dollars for current, one dollar is for later. And as Chuck said, you start with a $100 million pace and you go all the way to a $600 million pace fairly quickly.","The second would be collaboration. The numbers were great on collaboration at 7% growth in TelePresence units and 66% year-over-year growth, and the new products being developed in I think was 12 months with the deferred pipe and 18 months to market with only 200 people. But what I loved about this quarter with collaboration is their deferred revenue went up 20% to $1.1 billion on the quarter, so you're beginning to build recurring revenue and deferred revenue pipeline that feels very good.","In terms of our capital allocation, you're going to see us remain committed to delivering our capital allocation, as Kelly has outlined, and we'll continue to be aggressive with a minimum of our free cash flow going to our shareholders. And you'll see us \u2013 we wouldn't have started the dividend if we didn't anticipate regularly raising it. And you're going to see us be active in the share repurchase as well in terms of the capital allocation. So no major change there, Mark.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Operator, next question?","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Tal Liani - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Yes. Hi, guys. I'm adding my own congrats to John and Chuck. I wanted to ask about switching. You're into a major cycle of switching, new products that brings you into new markets or develop new markets, et cetera, and creates a replacement cycle. But still, the numbers are not that impressive, at least on a sequential basis. Revenues were down 6% in January and down 1.5% this quarter. I know on a year-over-year it looks good, but that's because last year was so bad. So I'm trying to look at the sequentials to see what the growth is looking like. And the question is why don't we see higher numbers with switching? What prevents the numbers from going up? And maybe you can relate here to units versus prices. I'm trying to see if it's a pricing issue rather than a units issue. Thanks.","John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Tal, we've known each other for a long time, but I'm going to be very direct. When you have switching revenues up 11% last quarter, up 6% this quarter, it's off the charts. And if I would have told anybody on this call two years ago that I'd be getting questions about switching revenues only growing 6% in the quarter, you would have said you've got to be kidding me because everybody was modeling zero and they were modeling margins to go down. Kelly, our margins on the switching actually were at the higher end of our range. They've been remarkably consistent for the last eight quarters. So all this garbage about new players coming in and software coming in and white label killing our approach was entirely wrong.","And the feeder system looks really good. If you watch at the campus level, you have all of the drivers of low-end switching, from IOE to digitization to security to mobility all driving this upgrade in wireless. And then at the high end, we're in the middle of a transition, which we executed remarkably well and we took the pain. We announced the products early. We knew there would be a transition from the Nexus 9000 to the Nexus 7000. The Nexus 9000 growth is off the charts. I want to be careful with my word selection. We are beating our competitors that you all were worried about. We moved past them in less than one year of shipment. We're growing sequentially 27% where our competitors are modeling to the market flat sequential growth. That is market share gains at tremendous speed.","Now it will take us a couple more quarters to work through the Nexus 7000 decline and get it balanced out and you'll see us move a lot of the capabilities of the Nexus 9000 to the Nexus 7000 over the next couple of quarters. I know, Chuck, you've got that with one with Pankaj and the balance. So the bottom line on switching, we're taking share, we feel really good, we're going to kick the other competitors, and it's a very good growth market, and I will never apologize for growth in mid-single-digits on switching.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Thanks, Tal. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Bracelin with Pacific Crest Securities.","Brent A. Bracelin - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you for taking my questions here. John, you started out breaking a cardinal rule. I have a follow-up on that one. Hopefully, you'll be willing to share more color. As you think about, as you look at digital transformation projects, the 1,200 projects, $3.7 billion pipeline certainly is, and a proven proof point, shows you at least why you're seeing some of the strength in the enterprise and commercial side. My question and the question I get from investors a lot is, how is Cisco doing relative to expanding the footprint beyond the core switching and routing business? It's still 45% your revenue today. So as you look at that pipeline around digital transformation, what's the attach rate on servers, software, services? Can you give us some color that, some leading indicator that will let us understand how you well you're doing relative to expanding the overall footprint as you help enterprises transform their businesses?","John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's interesting, and I want to think about how to answer that or maybe have Chuck answer it on the next conference call in more detail on it. But almost all of these sales are no longer about switching and routing. They are purely outcome-based, and it is GDP growth, it's inclusion of minorities, it's job creation, it's healthcare, it's education, it's the citizens experience, and the businesses it goes across all industries, and what you do is you pull through everything at one time. And so when we think about the total value of digitizing a company or a country, you suddenly see where we do these programs, those accounts grow at 10% \u2013 15% faster than what they did during our prior model in terms of the opportunity on it.","And in terms of routing and switching, you can see the numbers. I would expect that other segments of the market, as SP and emerging come back to life, and they will. I think SP we will see in a couple of quarters, not because of CapEx spend but our positioning. In emerging, eventually these three countries will level back out. You will see the architecture sales where that segment outside switching and routing grow well. Now the point the Tal just asked, every time we sell these others, it bolsters switching and routing. And this is where intelligence in the network and our speed of architectures get outcomes that those do not. And that will drive the services, Gary. That will drive the margins, Kelly, across the board that we get.","We might think about a way of defining it a little bit more, but the bottom line is most of our customers that are with us on the digitization don't even think about us as routing and switching anymore. And the fast-growing areas of collaboration, business messaging is one of the hottest areas growing period across the board in terms of the approach. Collaboration, if we can get 3% to 5% productivity in a company, and I think what we're doing around the Spark capability and the TelePresence and this all came together, we can do it. So it's nice way of saying I think you're going to see our areas outside of switching and routing grow rapidly. The cool thing is it pulls through switching and routing. And the best of all, architectures beat white label and free software.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","Great. Great question, Brent. Operator, next question?","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer & Company.","John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Ittai.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi, John, and again, congrats to you; and, Chuck, good luck to you in your new role.","Charles H. Robbins - CEO Designate, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Field Operations & Director","Thanks, Ittai.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","John, I had a couple of questions. First, going back to the service provider comment, you talked about it being sit down 7% globally. Your routing business was actually up on a year-over-year basis, and yes, your service provider video was down 5%. But can you give us a little bit and make up the difference? What are the other product categories in which you're seeing issues or challenges on the service provider side?","And then second, regarding the transformation point, which is very evident in your U.S. results, which are quite impressive, what is it in that pitch that doesn't resonate or takes a long time to resonate everywhere else? Why is that not something that drives Europe up as well 10% \u2013 15%?","John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Got you, so several things. First of all, on the service provider video piece, the orders were down about 20% in SP video, so I don't want to mislead anybody with the 5% revenue number. But the exciting part is we're picking up momentum in the cloud segment of this and the software in the cloud, which is clearly where we want the revenue to go. The architectural play wins here. Set-top boxes are tactical, but cloud winning on video like [Khaled] is doing there is strategic to us. Go to the U.S. If you take out one of the large service providers, you're all of a sudden instead of talking down 17%, you're talking down 6%, and the cable players had the other part. So we're starting to grow in many of these players globally, and it's just a few of them that have a major impact.","Through the third part of the question, it takes a while. When Chuck announced and did the commercial operation here, Chuck then put Alison in charge of this on a global basis. But it takes literally a year to go through this transformation. Some countries pick it up quicker than others, and sometimes you have to give some of these countries and nudge after the fact. Brian's total business transformation that he and Sandy are leading, that takes longer to roll out and more time. So even if you've watched with them, there was a disruption as they moved rapidly. That's where you saw the business actually slow for a couple quarters before it took up. And then there's the whole coordination with engineering. And one of the key reasons that Chuck got this job, among others, is his ability to coordinate these resources together in division and strategy to determine the outcomes in terms of the direction.","It's a nice way of saying it's a multiyear journey. The cool thing is using U.S. enterprise as an example. Once they got it going the pipeline is accelerating, and you'll see that around the world. And that's why we feel comfortable with the long-term growth, Simona, not just looking out a year or two. But we will get more than our fair share.","Now let me put this in proper perspective. If you watch where we are, all of our major IT players almost without exception are going down year over year. It's a disaster in the market. If we had our midpoint of the numbers we just gave you, we will be at a record earnings per share and a record quarter in terms of revenue. So we're taking share, spend, and position the market extremely well as we go forward. So I feel very good about where we're positioned, Mel, and you're nicely saying that's going to be my last question.","John T. Chambers - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Let me move to close a little. It's been an honor. First, I want to thank all of you around this table. This leadership team is amazing. Our virtual table of the operating committee and leaders, it really has been an honor. It has been fun. It's been challenging, and I'm just very humbled by having this chance for 20 years. Chuck, you're going to love this job.","When I look about where we are today, what excites me the most is what we've done on culture and how we've built an engine platform innovation. And if you watch the innovation we're talking about in many of these areas, what used to take thousands of people, Pankaj does with 20. We do the new mobility capability with data combining Wi-Fi with 3G and 4G in a way with 18 people in eight months. You make moves in security the same way. You bring Spark to life with business messaging with 200 people. We can now rival the best startups there are in the world and out execute them because they can build off of that capability.","What gets me very comfortable about our future, I said nicely, our competitors come and go. Chuck, I'm thinking about playing golf lately. But the exciting part about where we are is that you and I are on the 18th hole and we're already ahead by five strokes in team play. And all of our competitors have hit their golf balls off into the woods they're looking for it. And we're going to finish off this game, and by the time we're through, they're still going to be looking for the golf balls.","If you really look at the market and you think innovation is breaking a company in half and having to roll the dice of combining two companies that are really five companies into one, and you begin to think about having to cut expenses dramatically and then double-down that you can move to a software play only. And when we said this year at the sales meeting, and people forget that's just eight months ago, that if you look at key competitors like HP and Alcatel-Lucent and Arista and VMware and Avaya and we name several more, we said half of those won't exist in a meaningful way as competitors to us in a year. And everybody said, yeah right, look where we are already in eight months. It's a nice way of saying we're going to become the number one IT company.","It's been a tremendous honor to lead this organization. It's one that will do better after me than during my time, and that's a way of saying like your kids, this team has built tremendous strength. They're going to do even better in the future. So it's really been fun for me. It's also going to be fun being your wing man, Chuck, but I'll just spend my time where you want me to spend it and enjoy this moment.","And it's much like when I ran today. Mel, you judge. She said go out and run a lot this morning. I did and I was determined to set my new course record when I ran. I got stopped in the first half mile. I'd never seen this before in my life, but the biggest buck I've never seen. It was probably a 12 point, maybe 14 point. It was right in my path 10 feet from me. And I looked it right in the eyes and at first I was annoyed because I was trying to set my timing. And then I realized you want to enjoy the moment and how special that was.","But I lost, I missed my timing, Mel. I didn't make it by 10 seconds. But it's a nice way of saying that we're a competitive organization, one that is far from perfect, and I've been a far from perfect leader, but one that I'm very honored to have lead and it's really nice, like a family that I want this to do even better as I move on to the next stage of my career, which is more one of a coach. So, Chuck, enjoy the moment. You're going to be a fantastic new CEO, and you're going to great things here at Cisco. And this team is literally unbeatable.","Melissa Selcher - Vice President, Chief Communications Officer","So to close the call, Cisco's next quarterly call, which will reflect our FY 2015 fourth quarter and annual results will be on Wednesday, August 12, 2015, at 1:30 PM Pacific, 4:30 PM Eastern.","Again, I'd like to remind you that in light of Regulation FD, Cisco plans to retain its longstanding policy to not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it's been through an explicit public disclosure.

Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise stated.","I will now turn the call over to John for his commentary on the quarter.","","John Chambers","Mel, thank you very much. As we closed fiscal year \u201813 we are pleased to announce another strong quarter and strong end to our fiscal year. Q4 was a record quarter on many fronts with record revenues of $12.4 billion and record non-GAAP operating income, record non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.52. In every case, we exceeded the midpoint of our guidance. We generated $4 billion in operating cash flow in the quarter, another record as well.","Delivering the record results we did this quarter and every quarter this year despite the challenging macroeconomic backdrop speaks to our increasing strategic position in the market and our ability to manage our overall business as a portfolio across technologies, customer segments, and geographic regions.","With this backdrop in mind, I want to highlight five key takeaways from Q4. First, our results, we continue to consistently deliver. Our performance in Q4 FY \u201813 was differentiated versus many of our peers. We drove both top line growth of 6% and bottom line growth in terms of non-GAAP EPS growth of 11% with stable gross margins for the year and strong operating margins. From the $4 billion cash from operations, we returned over $2.1 billion to our shareholders in buyback and dividend. Secondly, we are leading many of the technology transitions in the market which are increasing in pace. With the networks squarely at the center of cloud, mobility, BYOD, security and the internet and everything. We believe we\u2019re uniquely positioned to help our customers meet their business goals and they are asking us to play this role. An example is our continued success and mobility where we are driving the transition to a unified access architecture and cloud and saw revenue growth of over 30% in our wireless business this quarter. Our data center business is a tech improved point. We successfully drove the transition to a converged architecture and you see this is in our data center results, a 2 billion plus business in five years growing revenue over 40% year-over-year in the most recent quarter and we\u2019re not stopping.","At Cisco Live in June we previewed our application centric infrastructure strategic within SEMI (ph). We\u2019re delivering the next wave of industry innovation from the cloud through the campus and driving our continued market leadership. Third, we delivered the strong performance and what continues to be a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment. While we saw continued momentum in year-over-year orders in the U.S. enterprise up 9% U.S. commercial up 12% and an upturn in U.S. public sector which grew at 4% and APJC our Asia-Pacific, Japan, China operations we saw the same weakness many of our peers experienced with orders down 3%. Along with economic challenges impacting several of our Top 5 emerging markets.","Last quarter I described a continued slow recovery and I haven't seen anything to suggest that this dynamic will change in the short term but this recovery is more mixed and inconsistent than the others I\u2019ve seen.","Fourth, we\u2019re committed to our long term financial model including driving profitable revenue growth of 5% to 7%. In this tight environment, we as leaders must continue to see rebalance our resources to indepth into opportunities, in my opinion we\u2019re managing our opportunities and our business better than we have ever have and our customers and shareholders are seeing the benefits.","And fifth, we believe our vision and strategy are working. We\u2019ve never lost when we are aligned with our customers, helping them to solve their most important business challenges. You saw that in our U.S. enterprise and commercial business, global search for other customers and even entire countries. When we partner with our customers on their business priorities the results speak for themselves. As an example I look at our success selling solutions that deliver business results not selling products in (inaudible) as U.S. enterprise business resulting in terms of pipeline more than 50% year-over-year increase in orders of over $1 million in that territory. At the country level I look at 27% year-over-year increase in orders with Israel in Q4. As we align across all political parties to focus on the countries priorities, job creation, inclusion, education, healthcare, future infrastructure and technology industry development. When we partner with a customer and in this case a country is real to drive their success our business benefits which Forbes refers to as profits through peace.","The latest industry data shows our relevance with customers is only growing as we move to become the number one IT Company, to provide additional details on our Q4, FY \u201913 results I would like to turn the call over to Frank. After Frank I will then walk through some additional details in terms of what we\u2019re seeing in the business, Frank will then detail our guidance and then we will wrap up with a quick summary and move in to my favorite part which is the Q&A. Frank, to you.","","Frank Calderoni","Thanks John. I\u2019m pleased with our strong performance in Q4 and throughout FY \u201913. We delivered top-line growth for the full fiscal year of 6% and grew profits faster than revenue for each quarter and for the full year. We effectively managed our business with strong operational execution while maintaining stable growth margins and delivering profitable growth and return for our shareholders. Starting with the full fiscal year performance our total revenue was $48.6 billion, our non-GAAP net income was $10.9 billion and this was up 8%. Non-GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis was $2.2 per share which grew 9% year-over-year.","As for our GAAP net income it was $10 billion or $1.86 per share on a fully diluted basis representing increases of 24% and 25% respectively. We generated strong operating cash flows of $12.9 billion increasing 12%. We returned $6.1 billion of cash to our shareholders through our dividends and share buybacks representing 52% of free cash flow, which is $11.7 billion. This is consistent with the capital allocation strategy that we introduced a year ago.","Moving on to Q4 results, we had solid execution which results consistent with our expectations. Total revenue was $12.4 billion growing 6% year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS was $0.52 per share growing 11%. Our Q4 marked the seventh consecutive quarter, where we grew profits faster than revenue as measured through earnings per share. In this quarter, we closed three more acquisitions, including SolveDirect, Ubiquisys, and JouleX and we announced two more acquisitions in security and software. Composite Software provides enterprise data virtualization software and services, and Sourcefire is a leading intelligent cyber security solutions company. These acquisitions are aligned with our portfolio approach of driving long-term returns in complementing our innovation engine.","In terms of our business momentum, we saw product and service revenue both grow at 6% with total product book-to-bill comfortably over 1. Total revenue from a geographic perspective grew 7% for the Americas, 12% for EMEA, and decreased 3% for APJC. We delivered strong and consistent non-GAAP operating margins of 28.2%. Within our operating margins, we have driven stability in our gross margins and maintained a concentrated focus and discipline on our operating expenses. In Q4, our total non-GAAP gross margin was 62.1% and this compared to 61.9% a year ago and 63% last quarter.","Our non-GAAP product gross margin was 60.8%. This compared to 60.4% a year ago and also 62.1% last quarter. We saw good gross margin stability across most of our product areas. Our non-GAAP service gross margin was 67.1% and this also compared to 66.5% last quarter and 67.1% in Q4 of FY \u201812. Total gross margins by geography where Americas is at 61.8%, EMEA was at 64.4%, and APJC was at 59.5%.","Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.2 billion, or 33.9% as a percentage of revenue compared to 34.4% in Q4 fiscal year \u201812. We made headcount investments this past quarter of approximately 900. These additions were driven by our acquisitions and portfolio investments in sales as well as in services.","Now, moving on to the non-GAAP tax provision rate, that was 20.1%. Our non-GAAP net income was $2.8 billion, and this represents an increase of 13%. As a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP net income was 22.9%. As I mentioned earlier, our non-GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis was $0.52 and this is versus $0.47 in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, and it represents 11% increase.","From a GAAP net income perspective, it was $2.3 billion representing an increase of 18% as compared to $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year \u201812. Our GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis was $0.42 versus $0.36 in the same quarter of fiscal \u201812 and this represents a 17% increase. As a reminder, we announced in June that our GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share for Q4 FY \u201813 included an impact of the TiVo patent litigation settlement. We recorded a charge of $172 million, or $0.03 per share. The non-GAAP earnings this quarter exclude this charge. During the quarter we returned $2.1 billion to our shareholders including 1.2 billion through the share repurchase and 918 million to our quarterly dividend. Total cash and cash equivalents and investments were $50.6 billion including $10.2 billion which was available in the U.S. at the end of the quarter. Cash flow from operations was a strong $4 billion up 29% and this was an all-time record. Our product backlog at the end of fiscal 2013 was approximately $4.9 billion as compared to approximately 5 billion at the end of fiscal 2012.","In terms of our key balance sheet metric, DSO or day sales outstanding was 40 days reflecting a slightly reduced linearity profile of product and service billings this quarter. This impact was partially offset by strong collections on our receivables and finally our non-GAAP inventory returns was strong at 12.8.","Overall our priority of long term possible growth is proving to be effective. We\u2019re driving focused and discipline in the right areas of the business which helps us to continue to be ahead and innovate IT solution for our customers. We remain highlight focused on shareholder value through rigorous expense management and strong cash return to our shareholders. We remain confident in our ability to continue to execute. John I will now turn it back over to you for more detail on the business moment.","","John Chambers","Thank you Frank. I will now provide some additional detail on the performance in Q4 and trends we\u2019re seeing in our business and in the market. I will first walk through our product portfolio in terms of year-over-year revenue growth followed by discussing geographic and customer segments in terms of year-over-year orders. First in core networking, we have driven innovation in execution of (inaudible) switching portfolio which has resulted in solid growth of our switching business this quarter of 5%. Our Nexus switching product line continues with it's strong double digit growth over 20% and in the campus our full converged wired and wireless Catalyst 3850 platform continues it's very strong performance with the current quarter order rate of over a 150 million after only two quarters in the market.","Despite how you program new technologies and potentially disrupt your competitors. Our performance in switching has been extremely solid and we\u2019re innovating to continue to lead in the future and we saw another strong record quarter in our wireless business up 32%. We were particularly pleased with the performance of our cloud networking business based upon our acquisition of Meraki, this quarter which grew orders over 100% from the prior quarter within order run-rate now annualizing Q4 of over $250 million. This speaks to the power of industry leading technologies, in this acquired integrating to architecture accelerate about world leading channel organization.","We\u2019re also pleased with the initial uptick of 802.11ac modules for the AP 3600 leading the adoption of gigabit lap out the new industry standard for wireless LANs. In NGN routing total revenue for NGN routing was flat, the story across the industry this quarter was one of the edge, we saw our ASR 9000 revenues reach a record high with growth of 69% well outpacing our peers and the high end core we experienced weakness from our peers. In the quarter we introduced the CRS-X system with over 400 GPS capacity to address a surging demand for video, mobility and collaboration. We are very comfortable with our product leadership and plans for the future in this market.","In mobility we expanded our customer penetration with our newest ASR 5500 series with several key wins, this product tends to be large order driven and my word is i.e. lumpy even though I know you don\u2019t like it now and so following strong growth for several quarters we saw a slight decline this quarter. We\u2019re bringing advance software and management tools to carriers that will enable them to lower operating cost and drive efficiencies around their overall network spend. We believe our internal innovation coupled with the recent acquisitions of BroadHop, Cariden, Intucell and Ubiquisys position us to be the clear number one in this mobile market over the long run.","Cisco ONE continues to gain strong customer momentum by delivering in our view the most comprehensive framework for network programmability and SDN. We have more than doubled the number of beta customers to over 120 are utilizing Cisco ONE to program, orchestrate, and manage their networks. We also are continuing to invest in open source communities like OpenDaylight and OpenStack as a means we help accelerate our customers\u2019 adoption to SDN and cloud. Technology from Sourcefire, our most recent announced acquisition is based on industry leading open source platform for security.","Moving on to the data center cloud, where we grew revenue 43% year-over-year growing across all regions. We are pleased to have moved into the number two position worldwide in the x86 blade market with approximately 20% market share something our peers would have considered impossible a few years ago. We saw this strong performance despite a very challenging compared to Q4 FY \u201812, where a year ago we blew out the numbers with 90% year-over-year growth.","Our partner ecosystem, including VCE and NetApp as well as hundreds of application partners continues to accelerate the adoption of our unified data center architecture as the leading data center platform. VCE specifically had a very strong quarter with order growth over 50% and strong demand from new and existing customers. We are seeing similar momentum with our FlexPod solution with NetApp, where FY \u201813 orders also grew over 50% compared to FY \u201812.","Moving on to video, total SP video revenues grew 23% driven largely by our NDS acquisition. We continue to see good performance with our video software and solution business that includes NDS driven by new innovative solutions like cloud, DVR, and compelling user interfaces.","Moving on to collaboration, we continue to improve our collaboration execution. Revenue was flat normalized for the underlying server revenue. Momentum as measured by collaborative orders reached a record high this quarter growing normalized 5%. That\u2019s the first quarter in five quarters that we have grown positively from now. Revenue growth lagged as the profile of this business shifts to recurring revenue. We saw this trend in our conferencing performance, which was flat and UC when normalized was down 2%. TelePresence was up 3% driven by strength in endpoints.","Moving on to security, where revenue of $346 million was flat year-over-year. Network security is flat and content security was slightly down. A continued shift in the security business to term-based software licensing, i.e., recurring revenue is having a short-term impact on year-over-year revenue growth. Last month, we announced our intent to acquire Sourcefire for $2.7 billion, and we expect this acquisition to close in the second half of the calendar year. With this move, we made a major step forward to be our customer\u2019s leading security partner and our aspirational goal to become the number one security company.","Finally, services, services revenues grew 6% representing 22% of total revenue. As we said before, we are committed to our long-term growth rate to 9% to 11% in services. Together with our partners, we are winning large multi-year service deals as our customers ask us to partner with them to meet their business goals. In summary, we believe our innovation to build by partner combined with our architectural approach is working extremely well. We continue to focus on market transition and customer priorities to drive our innovation and focus.","I will now move on to provide some color on our geographic and customer segments. The following geographic and customer segment growth rates are in terms of year-over-year product orders for Q4 unless specifically stated otherwise. In Q4, Cisco\u2019s total product orders grew 4% year-over-year. Looking at the numbers from a geographic perspective, the Americas region grew 5%. As I discussed upfront, we continue to see solid minimum in the U.S. with U.S. enterprise up 9% and commercial up 12%. U.S. public sector growth of 4% was driven by state, local, and education strength in their buying season which was up 9% and federal business was \u2013 growth was up 3%. U.S. service provider was down slightly. We saw challenges in the Asia-Pacific, Japan, and China region down 30% due largely to macroeconomic challenges. We saw challenges in Japan due to reduced large SP CapEx and economic challenges. We also continue to work through the challenges in China and so only 6% decline in our business there. China is less than 5% of Cisco\u2019s total revenue from an overall perspective. India recorded a highlight in Asia-Pacific at 19%. One of the most positive trends we saw in Q4 was the continued improvement in our Europe, Middle-East, Africa and Russian Region which was up 6% and Europe itself was up 6%. Economic conditions in Europe still vary significantly by region with the North and UK showing very positive progress, we remain cautious however given the instability of the southern region.","Our emerging markets business was up 8%, however we saw mixed results in our top five emerging countries, with India and Mexico up in double digits, Brazil and Russia approximately flat and China down 6%. The changes in macroeconomic conditions in the emerging markets both positive and negative are driving more inconsistent growth than in the past. Now on moving on to customer segment view again and from an orders perspective.","Enterprise declined two percent the decline was driven largely by EMEA Enterprise which declined 10% year-over-year. Commercial grew 5%, service provider were 6%, global public sector grew 6%. This once again has been a very positive trend with global public sector and if you would have just looked back over the last year Q1 of this last year global public sector was down 6%, Q2 was flat, Q3 up 1% and Q4 up 6%.","Our results demonstrate the mixed nature of the market. In technology areas we\u2019re seeing switching and data center strength offset by routing and set-top box weakness. In customer segments we see public sector moment offset by softness this quarter in enterprise. In geographies we see improvement in the EMEA and Europe if you will offset by weakness in APJC.","Despite these trends we continue to grow. Our total product order growth continues to slowly increases over the last four quarters excluding acquisitions and divestures so they are apples to apples. Speaking to the power of our portfolio and our execution. While the trends of ICT spending and global GDP growth according to industry experts continue to be revised down for calendar year \u201913.","Industry estimates have the growth of our total available market and we\u2019re looking through calendar year 2017 in the 5% to 7% range once again echoing our view to this is the area that we ought to grow in over the longer time period. In summary I believe the macro effects will purely continue mixed environment but I feel very good about how we\u2019re positioned and about what we can control. I will now turn it over to Frank to provide Q1, fiscal year \u201914 guidance.","","Melissa Selcher","Before Frank continues I want to clarify one number the Asia-Pacific, Japan, China region was down 3% in terms or orders year-over-year not 30%.","","Frank Calderoni","Thanks John. Let me now provide a few comments on our outlook for the first quarter, let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements and you should review our recent SEC filings that identify some important risk factors and understand that actual results can materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements and that actual results could also be above or below the guidance. This guidance we\u2019re providing is on a non-GAAP basis with reconciliation to GAAP.","For Q1 FY '14, we\u2019re managing the business to account for a slow and consistent recovery. With that in mind, we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 3% to 5% on a year-over-year basis. For the first quarter we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 62%. Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 is expected to be in the range of 27.5% to 28.5% and our non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be approximately 21% in the first quarter.","Our Q1 FY \u201914 non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.50 to $0.51. We remain committed to our long term financial model of driving profitable growth, our growing revenue of 5% to 7%, and non-GAAP EPS 7% to 9%. As you would expect, we continued to make portfolio trade-offs to ensure we are investing in future growth through innovation such as cloud, data center, mobility, services, software, and security as well as driving operational efficiencies.","In the past two years, we have managed the business with discipline and focus. In order to execute on the portfolio investment and operational efficiency opportunities that we see in FY \u201814, we are rebalancing our resources with a workforce reduction, which will impact approximately 4,000 employees or 5% of our global workforce. We expect to continue to deliver non-GAAP operating margins as a percentage of revenue in the high 20% consistent with our long-term financial model. We expect to take this action starting in Q1 FY \u201814 and currently estimate recognizing pre-tax charges to our GAAP financial results of up to $550 million. We expect that approximately $250 million to $300 million of these charges will be recognized during the first quarter of FY \u201814 with the remaining amount recognized during the rest of the fiscal year.","We anticipate our GAAP earnings in Q1 to be $0.16 to $0.20 per share lower than our non-GAAP EPS. Please see the slides that accompany this webcast for more detail. Other than those quantified items noted previously, there are no other significant differences between our GAAP as well as our non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructurings, and tax or other events which may or may not be significant. And as a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. John, turn it back to you?","","John Chambers","Frank, thank you very much. The most difficult decisions we make as leaders are those that impact our employees. However, we will always take the necessary actions to efficiently manage our business for the long run. Consistent with what we have said over the past two years, we are positioning Cisco to accelerate and lead with greater speed, flexibility, and agility. As we closed a very successful fiscal year \u201813, I am very pleased with how we are operating as a company and the value we are delivering to our customers, our partners, our employees, and our shareholders.","We have delivered on and remain committed to our long-term profitable revenue growth of 5% to 7% and capital returns of the minimum of 50% of free cash flow annually and believe Cisco is better positioned in the market today than ever before. As I look at the area as a very-sought momentum going to Q1, I feel extremely confident. I know it is a long list, but I ask you to bear with me as I think these areas of strength are proof of our increasing relevance and strong execution over the next number of years. Specifically, I am very pleased with the following: U.S. enterprise and commercial momentum, beta center and cloud leadership, mobility and wireless strategy, switching growth and leadership, European momentum and execution, SP strategy and architecture, global public sector improvements.","We have seen two things that have changed over the course of this year. First, the economic recovery is slower and more inconsistent with global GDP continuing to sit down for calendar year 2013 and global challenges in Southern Europe, several of the large emerging markets and Asia-Pacific. Second, the pace of change has continued to increase. This is an environment that we are very effective at and very much want to lead. We are going to focus on aligning our resources to our top opportunities, speeding the decision cycles and time to implementation, balance sheet expenses to revenues, and driving efficiencies in the business while investing in growth. We never convinced ourselves. The market will evolve a certain way because it\u2019s convenient to our current business rather we align closely with our customers to transform to meet the long-term market needs.","We prioritize and invest for where we believe the market is going. Every technology company should move with this agility, many don\u2019t, and those companies that don\u2019t get left behind. Investments we made many years ago are paying off today. Nothing is more evident than what we discussed earlier in terms of our movement in the datacenter. It's started over seven years ago. We've recognized the impact of datacenter and cloud would have on networking and opportunity to bring innovation in terms of product architecture and go to market. We move from being unknown in the market to the number one cloud infrastructure provider today as reported by Synergy Research. We're driving the same strategy across our business using innovation, acquisitions, spin in and partnering to drive our agenda making strategic bets and investments to position us well for the future.","My confidence in our ability to be the number one IT Company is increasing. This leadership is evident and our customer and partner satisfaction scores that are the highest in the industry and our customers want us to do more. Now more than ever our customers and our partners want Cisco's help navigating these challenging landscape successfully. They recognize the benefit of a partner who is not only the leader in their product categories but can bring technology and solutions together in an architecture to lower operating costs, reduce time to market and future proof their investments.","I'd love any player to take us on in this strategic approach. This is a strategy we invented and have delivered on successfully for over two decades and we\u2019re moving aggressively to play on in even broader scale. While we\u2019re planning conservatively given the broader macro environment we remain very much a company on the offensive and very comfortable with maintaining our position as the disrupter in the industry. Both today and in the future, we'll measure our success by the value we deliver to our customers, partners, employees and shareholders.","Mel, let me turn it over to you for questions.","","Melissa Selcher","Thanks John. We'll now open the floor to Q&A. We still request that sell side analysts please ask only one question. Operators please open the floor to questions.","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Your first question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","","Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I have a kind of a blunt question if the environment is improving why are you guiding a little bit conservatives and why are you laying off 4000 people which is about 5% of your work force if I understand correctly?","","John Chambers","Sure so the environment in terms of our business is improving slightly but nowhere near the pace that we want. You know what product orders have done, minus the acquisition and spin offs because that gives you a feeling for what our growth is going to be and those will bump them up or down. It's just not growing at the speed we want, the inconsistency of global GDP growth and about the time you see Northern Europe start to get stronger, you see the issues in emerging markets start to get softer. You see us successful in one category switching and you see us not as successful except in the edge in terms of the routing. You begin to see a balance which was 13% growth in emerging markets back down to 8% in terms of the opportunity and so the combination of weakness in APJC offsetting what went on in Europe the strength in the U.S. offset by what went on in emerging markets, et cetera, is kind of leveling off. So, Tal what we see is slow steady improvement but not at the pace we want.","Now if we're going to lead in this industry the one thing I have learned over the years is you're the first mover. We have to very quickly reallocate the resources. So, you know a fair amount of that 4,000 people will be allocated to new growth opportunities.","The second thing is even though Gary I think you and I would agree we were very pleased with how we made progress in the last two years on speeding up decisions, in today's marketplace, they're almost up exponentially on how quickly not only decisions have to be made, but how quickly you implement those.","Those need to be done with small things. We just have too much in the middle of the organization. When you have that type of layers and standard controls without meaning to, very well-meaning people begin to really look at how they add value to the decision made and probably we\u2019re just not moving with the speed that we need in this area. So you can see us focused very much in this area on expanded control and also layers.","It's all about speed and pace in this new industry which we intend to balance in. Third, we make commitments on our financial model which we're absolutely sticking to. You heard our commitments 61%, 62% gross margins. You heard our commitment operating margins 27.5 and 28.5, you\u2019ve seen our commitments to growing earnings on most quarters faster than revenues and we see our markets grew, we\u2019re gaining market share even at these lower numbers. Everywhere we run business in the world grows and keeps expenses in line with revenue growth and driving up productivity. Candidly, we didn\u2019t drive productivity this last year. So, with the change in the macroeconomic environment and you saw this from the better officials, you\u2019ve seen it in all the forecasts on emerging countries, etcetera and you saw it in our business numbers with inconsistent data even in our own operations, which tends to be more lumpy than I like to see. This is just good business management. And I\u2019d learn in this industry you lead with you mind, not with your heart and this is something that we think will allow us to grow our profits, but also most important to achieve the number one position in the industry and move our resources very quickly to the growth opportunities. If this were a normal pace, you can move those resources over two years with attrition and realignment.","But I think Gary given what we want to do on speed and organizational structure and our ability to move fast, you are going to see us target that 4,000 people, we are obviously going to hire that part of them and in other categories and realigned where we need to go for growth. So, Tal, that\u2019s a blunt question. My key takeaway is I am real pleased with our momentum in the market it just is not growing as fast as we need. And there are enough inconsistencies in the market we think not to remain agile and flexible to be able to grow for our growth markets quickly putting the resources behind that is needed. This is what we strongly believe we will do as a company.","","Melissa Selcher","Great, thanks Tal. Next question please?","","Operator","And your next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs","Hi, thanks very much. I just wanted to clarify some of the moving pieces around the guidance, and then I had a question. But in terms of the clarification, there were just a bunch of data points that pointed in opposite direction I think you said your book-to-bill is conformably above 1, I saw your deferred revenue was up 6% sequentially yet the backlog was down and the guidance was for some deceleration. So, if you can just kind of reconcile those conflicting data points? And then in terms of question, it seems like some of the weakness was in your service provider business and orders, I think you said in the Americas they are declined, the routing was also flat, but when we look at the carrier spending in North America, in particular, it seems actually to have strengthened in the last few months. So, if you can just help us understand that as well?","","John Chambers","Okay, Simona. We will answer all the questions, but we will try to ask in the future for just one. Let me take the book-to-bill, you take the other two financial questions, then I will take the service provider question. The book-to-bill was in line with our normal Q4s. It was very comfortably over 1 and I mean very comfortably in line with what we normally see. In terms of the quarter linearity to the indirect part of your question, the first month of the quarter was lighter than we would like, second month was very consistent, third month was more stronger in terms of the linearity. Maybe Frank to the other two issues and then I\u2019ll do the service provider question.","","Frank Calderoni","Yes, John. So, overall, Simona I would say that we were very pleased with the performance throughout the year, 6% top line growth, 9% from a non- GAAP EPS growth. And if you look at the momentum throughout the year, I think we were fairly consistent we started to see improvement as the year unfolded, especially in the back half of the year if you start to look at the order rates. As you know, we have flat orders in the first two quarters and then we started to get order growth rate about 4% in Q3, 4% in Q4. So, we got some good momentum. I think that also helped with the backlog kind of where John mentioned before. And then we also have deferred revenue as you mentioned which was up 6% at the end of the year. So, I think from a trend standpoint, we are first of all pleased with how the quarter closed, the year closed, and we are also pleased with the momentum that we started to see at the end of the year.","Now, the guidance for Q1 that I gave was 3% to 5% on a year-on-year basis from a revenue standpoint and then also from an EPS of $0.50 to $0.51 non-GAAP EPS. So, that\u2019s slightly down from what we normally see sequentially. Some of that has to do with what John was talking about some of the inconsistencies that we are seeing. And we are trying to be with those inconsistencies a little bit conservative as we are looking into the start of the fiscal year and as fiscal year going into Q1 always has some challenges here or there. And so we are taking that into consideration. Again, the slight decline from a profitability standpoint, we want to make sure that we can continue to drive the margins very consistent margins for the last two years from a growth and then improving margins from an operating income, we want to make sure that we are consistently following through staying committed to the long-term model, 5% to 7% long-term growth, 7% to 9% non-GAAP EPS growth getting operating margins as I said in that high 20% range. And so we are trying to balance all that as we go into a new fiscal year and making sure that everything is aligned to investing in the most effective innovation growth opportunity that we see over the next 12 months.","","John Chambers","Now Simona to your question on service provider, I could not be more comfortable with where we\u2019re in our service provider architecture and key customers. They are spending does seem to be lumpy by service provider group and category and if you watch to the indirect part of your question we did extremely well in the edge with the ASR 9000 which compares to the Juniper MX although I think it's vastly superior which grew 43% in the quarter. We do a little bit more revenue I think than the Juniper MX does but if you were in the edge market in fixed edge this quarter and you didn't do well you had a real problem.","Now if I back into that number mill, Juniper's total growth was 6% and you take 43% for 350 million, all their growth was in this one product category. There is a little bit of bleed over with ASR 9000 into the core and a little bit of bleed over in terms of other peer added products in the quarter but we outgrew all of our peers here comfortably. Our problem in service providers was in the cable set-top boxes and the cable companies. Our business was down Q3 to Q4 about 40% usually Q3 to Q4 goes up comfortably. This is part of our focus on profitable set top boxes in the market that is becoming very tough, almost commodity like. We got to be able to fix set top box business and migrate it to the cloud and implement it very successfully within that.","To the other part of the quarter, we did extremely well in the large two carriers growing comfortably well above 20%. So, this is an issue that you are talking about core networks being loaded not at the level of quite that I would like to see the number of accounts, and the CapEx slowed down but largely and issue a step boxes effecting us disproportionally. And again this is part of a conscious decision to drive profitability on our overall gross margins.","","Melissa Selcher","Great, thanks. Next question.","","Operator","Your next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays. Your line is open.","","Ben Reitzes - Barclays Capital","Could you give a little more detail on this workforce rebalancing, when you're going to see the savings and how does that play out as we go throughout the year and also with regard to your revenue outlook you're below your target model at 4% next quarter. So when do we get back into the 5% to 7% range as we place that?","","John Chambers","A bunch of questions Dan and today because I think we wanted to spend a little bit more time on the questions asked, we'll do that and I'll ask please hold them to one as we go forward. In terms of 3% to 5% guidance that is at the low end of what we said before. We were at 6, 5, 5, 6 this last quarter, last year for all four quarters. We're very comfortable with the 5% to 7% over the long run.","A lot of it depends on emerging markets and GDP growth. We need some consistency there, we're not seeing it. And we are often the first ones to see changes and i think you've all seen our ability to gain market share. I have no worries here on any major competitive issues across the board. Our ability from an architecture and position overall I think is an unmatched in the industry. And I think in each categories and including some like security and collaboration we haven't been growing this fast, so I would like to see. We are starting to slowly pick up momentum there and you looked at the second half of this fiscal year, I am comfortable that you will see us exited higher levels within that.","But according to me is the consistency of GDP growth and an issue where we began to take revenues which used to occur at a given point in time and began to get them recurring that means you have got all the expenses upfront and you get the revenues over a longer period of time that's great for shareholders in the longer term but short term it puts a lot of pressure on the profits and doesn't show you the growth that you would have seen under other models from a top-line growth. Frank to the other part of the question but before you do let me help you.","We're obviously not going to discuss where this is going to occur in timing. We\u2019re just now getting our communication put there, there are our employees at the time of this call is going on we will spend time with our employees and spend time talking with them on these key items. So we're not going to share any detail now or in the near term future which geographies are going to be affected at which level. So, within that framework may be a clarification on the write-downs and why the write-downs.","","Frank Calderoni","So, I think Ben to get your question and correct me if it's not addressing the question directly. I think you asked about as far as the savings going forward associated with the workforce reduction. One of the things that I think it's important to know here, is that what we\u2019re talking about is a workforce rebalancing. And so, we\u2019re looking at the areas of most focused for us from an innovation standpoint as we\u2019ve talked about data center cloud, security, software and services as well as video, those are the areas that we are looking to continue to invest in. And as we go through this and focusing that we were making some trade-offs and that\u2019s what we are talking about and we expect to continue to drive.","The other thing I think is important which I mentioned in the prepared remarks is as you look at the operating income as a percentage of revenue, and this goes back to even what I shared in the financial conference that we had last December and that we are looking at high 20s. I mean, we have been to execute at high 20s the last two years. We expect to continue to follow through that model. This workforce rebalancing allows us to position the investment for growth as well as John mentioned before continue to drive operational efficiencies in line with many of the things that we have had underway and improving over the last two years.","","Frank Calderoni","The timing is purely dependent upon treating our employees fairly as you would expect us to do and also local rules and regulations and laws by country.","","Melissa Selcher","Great, thanks Ben. Next question?","","Operator","Our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James.","","John Chambers","Hey, Simon.","","Simon Leopold - Raymond James","Thanks. Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if you could speak a little bit more about what\u2019s going on currently in the data center market and I am asking the question as a market vertical not the reporting segment, but what I am specifically trying to get an understanding of is how much of your business comes from that market vertical, so including Ethernet switches and anything else like services? And then within that context, how do you see the trends in that marketplace from this quarter out into the future?","","John Chambers","Okay. Simon, we don\u2019t break it down that way. I don\u2019t think I have a problem at all answering that if I had the data to be able to combine services and switching depending on what campus what\u2019s in the data center etcetera. To your question about growth, we understand the growth from this market in many peoples opinion is slowing, ours has been the reverse. We feel very good about our data center growth and balance into the future. I love our architectural play and I love our next generation products coming up from what we have planned for UCS, to switching, to what we are going to do within semi and a total cloud architecture. Very simply, we are going to lead in this industry and it will be a combination of software, basics, hardware, management, orchestration, wired and wireless, global multiple clouds, etcetera coming together architecturally, and there is nothing that points that out more than the internet of things in terms if you will see processing power storage applications run throughout the network and just an embodiment of the SDN in terms of implementing from maybe things we discussed last quarter to our 86 design, etcetera. So, we are extremely bullish on the data center. I want to be careful in saying it will be our fastest speed growth area for next year, but I feel very comfortable on it. Rob, would add anything else to them?","","Rob Lloyd","John, I just add that if you look at the data center portfolio of switching, obviously the Nexus portfolio has done very well, growth in the Nexus this quarter was over 20%. We have a very good innovation pipeline. We have just now started to see the Nexus 6000 the new platform start to ramp quite nicely. Couple of weeks ago, we introduced a 7700, a 40 and a 100-gig switch for the data center as well as 40-gig interfaces for the existing 7000. So, the portfolio is very, very strong there in addition to what we see happening with the UCS. And actually I think architecturally in the current environment and as we shift to more of the application centric opportunities in the future, I feel really good about the roadmap and great about our innovation.","","John Chambers","Yes.","","Melissa Selcher","Thanks, Simon. Next question please?","","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank.","","John Chambers","Hey, Brian.","","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank","Hey, you have talked about the set-top-box business has kind of been challenging I think for at least the last year, can you talk about where do you see that is and what\u2019s your long-term deal that and when you see your customer base, was it shifting to more of a cloud-based STP model? And then real quick if I slipped it in, you did really well again in the wireless LAN space growing over 30%, what you see going on there, is it the incremental growth of Meraki or is there more share gain occurring and what\u2019s driving that if that\u2019s the case? Thank you.","","John Chambers","Got you. So, in terms of the set-top-boxes, it\u2019s a big market for us, not real profitable, which is one of the reasons you have seen how profitability do very well. At the same time even though, our revenues have dropped off. The volume literally Q3 to Q4 as I said earlier was down 40% in terms of the run rate. In terms of the transition, the customers, none of them are completely into the cloud yet and a lot of them are in between. And so this will be a transition over the next three to five years, a lot depends on how quickly we can help our customer\u2019s transition through that and how they get their business models set up effectively on it. So, we continue to model in our expectations, the set top box is coming down. There might be quarters where we have a profitable deal or an emerging market deal that we go after by continuing to come down it to $2 billion base.","Now in terms of the question about overall search provider with this, let me reiterate like I said earlier in very good shape product rise and otherwise Rob mentioned the numbers and if you look at our core search provider market the CRS it was down 30% but that 30% was one company one account that did great with us last year and the year before and they are not by anybody else's gear but the network load and we put in tremendous capacity isn't anywhere near where they require additional capacity. So you\u2019re almost talking 30% off of our core product areas like CRS just because of the year-over-year comparison with the company is not buying more.","So Brian that would be the way I would answer the first part and the wireless it's both, the wireless LAN is hot, Meraki is hot, remember that I think it's almost 30% or 35% Meraki's businesses unfortunately is recurring. So when you talk about the number of bookings, third of that just goes into the recurring revenue and that's great for future earnings but it means you got your expenses your implementation upfront and you get the recurring revenue over a period of time. What's causing it is architecture, the minute we move the discussion in the architecture and remember we get the choice to our customers they can buy (inaudible), buy the piece or they can buy into an architecture bundle, they can pick through that and when you begin to provide a product like the 3850 which is just on fire, the ability for them to pick and future proof of environment fits very good.","Going back to the issue of software, when you look at what we\u2019re going to do, we\u2019re going to put software over our A6 and over core UCS architecture and over storage throughout the network. This is why I think you are going to see our customers begin to think about how they future proof their environment as opposed to go for an area that adds tremendous complexity with potentially I\u2019m opinion very little benefit. So, thanks Brian.","","Melissa Selcher","Thanks Brian. Next question?","","Operator","Your next question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS.","","Amitabh Passi - UBS","Thank you. Frank I apologize but I wanted to clarify this one more time on the workforce rebalancing is that a net reduction of 4,000 people or again are you basically re-allocating and moving folks from one organization to the other? And then John I just wanted to pick up on your public sector comments, sounded like things were improving this quarter, September, October quarter tends to be the strongest in U.S. federal. I was just wondering what's your outlook is for the federal sector particularly as we look over to the next quarter?","","John Chambers","Yeah the first part of the question is obviously a combination it's a workforce realignment and rebalancing, we need expenses back in-line with revenue growth, granted all for conservative number we hope and believe overtime but we've got to move this quickly and this is where we can't free up the headcount through attrition or normal means to move it over and then Gary and the rest of the team we\u2019re completely (inaudible) we got a speed time to market, small teams moving much faster and we have got to take a lot of this structure out mid-level management in terms of the opportunity and get moving quicker overall.","In terms of public sector I do think to be a direct part of your question it's turned to corner, I think it turned the quarter and state, local government in the U.S. about two to three quarter ago I think you\u2019re seeing on a global basis where there is also trend in quarter in terms of growth. That's too early to call.","We grew 3% this quarter; Pat's group did amazing on that as well as on state and local government repeating the 9% number. This is the busy season. So in the U.S. Public sectors is probably 50% state and local 50% federal.","In last quarter it was clearly the busy time for state and local this quarter as you said it's for federal, it's too early to call. There are lot of moving parts as you all are aware there. I like the trends it is moved consistently upwards in the federal side of the business but I would say it's too early to say for sure that the market is turned as much I would like to see it. And I want to verify some just before I give you numbers in terms of the trend on state and local government and make sure I got it right.","The federal just to give you the balance, it started off Q4 last year at minus 11 Q1 of this fiscal year '13 minus 15 then minus 5 then minus 3 then plus 3 . So this is the first positive quarter we have seen, too early to call the trend on that, the state and local government however started the year at 3% then 7% then 13% then 9% that's the trend that I do feel comfortable which is going to surprise and the economy calling. So Fed I would say it's still a question mark and this goes back to the inconsistencies. I think that we\u2019re going to consistently gain market share and list all of our top 18 product families is just that we are having fits reading the data just like our owned economists are doing. Hopefully, we do better that they do about interpreting where we need to go. So, that will be how I\u2019ll answer public sector that will still \u2013 U.S federal still a question mark, but not down like we saw before at the extent we were seeing.","","Melissa Selcher","Great, thanks Amitabh. Next question please?","","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.","","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you. John, with all the data \u2013 hi, John, with all the data that you have and the actions you are taking today does 5% to 7% growth become increasingly aspirational or is it conditional so when the economy does well, Cisco will be in that band, but if not Cisco will be below that band and if we do see more economic inconsistencies, is it possible that growth can actually turn negative and follow the trends in your backlog, or should we rather see it as the actions you are taking today more related to active portfolio pruning and just cutting declining businesses before they actually get worse?","","John Chambers","So, a bunch of questions, I will try to go in reverse order. Again, the actions we are taking today, the first goal is all around realigning resources. And so it\u2019s about a growth objective goal of putting resources where the growth is going to be, but if you are not going to be able to increase headcount, by definition you have to move them. Some of them have the talent to move over. Candidly, some of them were going to have to hire with the given expertise. Second area on rebalancing the resource, we got to take out a middle of a management in terms of this just not a large enough span of control, we improved from what 5.9 to about 6.9 in the last two years, but that number needs to be much higher. And this is the time where we need to get after span and layering. What I am really after there is speed of decisions but more importantly speed of implementation. Even when you push things down from the top, it can take longer than it should in this new environment which is moving at a much faster pace. And that\u2019s where we really enjoy it.","In terms of the market momentum, let me say very specifically. Our product orders have steadily improved for four quarters. It\u2019s just been slow. And in terms of the approach that is not taking into consideration anything with acquisitions up or down or spin-outs, so you compare apples-to-apples, we are clearly projecting that continuing into Q1. We just do not have the benefit of NDS, which is what Frank said, it\u2019s 2 points in Q1 and we don\u2019t have the benefit of Linksys, which is 1 point. And Sourcefire hasn\u2019t kicked in till later in the year. So, you\u2019ve got an issue here where the acquisitions have helped us by 2 to 3 points, now they are not going to help us and you have got an issue on recurring revenues.","Nice way of saying even in this environment which is very mixed, very comfortable about our momentum, it\u2019s just not fast enough. And I am not going to let us miss a window of opportunity, which could get this company into trouble. And I think we are doing this with very much proper focus on our customers, but also our shareholders and our employees. The shareholder return and projections is good. So, 5% to 7%, very comfortable with, it\u2019s one that I would measure our leadership team here. It would not surprise me at all if we go above it over the next couple of years. It would not surprise me if there are a couple of quarters, where we are slightly below it. Given today\u2019s environment I don\u2019t know anybody that\u2019s doing back flips in terms of their growth. And most of our peers in the high-tech industry, many of them are going flat or negative that\u2019s clearly not the case with Cisco.","","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets","7% in \u201812 and 6% in \u201813.","","Melissa Selcher","Alright, thanks Mark.","","John Chambers","Yes, thanks for clarification, Mark because I know a lot of people had the exact same questions and I hope I got all of them if I remembered them.","","Melissa Selcher","Next question please?","","Operator","Our next question comes from Rod Hall with JPMC.","","Rod Hall - JPMC","Yes, hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions.","","John Chambers","Sure.","","Rod Hall - JPMC","I just wanted to clarify some of the commentary on order growth John and Frank if I could, you guys are talking about the year-over-year growth here being 4%, so that\u2019s flat year-over-year on last quarter. Were orders up sequentially and can you give us any idea how much? I mean, it feels like maybe they were up just a few percentage points sequentially, but I would like to get clarification on that. And then I also wondered if maybe you could drill down into the APAC order decline with a little bit more detail and help us understand, you gave us China and India, but what was the most surprising thing about APAC to you? Was it a product area that was weaker or was it a particular country or are we just talking about across the region sluggishness? Thanks.","","John Chambers","Okay. In sequencing, the product quarter growth in Q3 was 4%, including obviously 2% from Meraki \u2013 I am sorry not from Meraki, from NDS. And the product order growth was 4% in this quarter, including NDS. NDS will not be in Q1. In terms of the sequence on the numbers, it actually rounded up a little bit. So, it did continue on the line, which has been steadily improving and we anticipate it continuing to steadily improve in Q1. So that's exactly why I wanted to say very specifically, apples-to-apples its just slowly increasing but it is painful and it's speaks to the inconsistencies in the market.","In terms of sequential, few Q4s always are much powerful quarter. It increases dramatically year-over-year from Q3 to Q4 in terms of sequencing numbers. This one was very much inline. So, asking about your indirect question are we see sequentially the same data that would support what we are saying in terms of year-over-year, yes we are.","Q1 is always down. So, if I was to not give you specific numbers, but you use a Q3 to Q4 in double-digit increase Q4 to Q1 double-digit decrease that's why you build a lot of backlog in Q4 and we did once again this year although it's a little bit more back end loaded than we would like to see. In terms of APAC, a uniqueness is there, China is little bit unique to Cisco because of the some of the issues going on which you all are aware of but over there I think you all have seen the numbers on it, APAC and most of our peer\u2019s impairment has slowed. We're doing better in India than most of our peers. We're doing pretty well in emerging markets there, we're getting hit hard in Japan. Japan was down in the teen and this again has to do with our successful last several years in Japan especially in search providers and it is in question, we\u2019re losing business we just build up the networks with tremendous capacity and the great news is it is running smooth as can be, the bad news is we haven't got a loaded it at the pace that we want and the CRS is what we market demand, so you just build them up, you multi-chassis them together and those suckers hum and produce it.","So Japan is not a surprise but they are down in the teens, and when it's big or bigger than China in that then you see the challenges of the two. But APAC overall is just weak and I guess what you're seeing from our group there I am not doing back flips on any of the major countries there other than India but the emerging countries, the smaller emerging countries we saw a reasonable growth on otherwise you wouldn't have got to 8% total in emerging countries if you have your top five which represent half of that in very low single-digits.","","Melissa Selcher","Great. Thanks Rod. Next question please.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities.","","Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities","I wanted to ask about the service business, which decelerated for third consecutive quarter and delivered growth well below the 9% to 11% range you have been targeting. So, while I understand you have had some difficult comps over the last few quarters with your solution oriented approach preparing to drive better product growth each of the last two quarters I was hoping to understand how come we\u2019re not seeing that drive better results in the service business and perhaps you can help us understand if you expect the service business to get back to your target range in fiscal 2014 and what are the keys to driving reacceleration there?","","John Chambers","Gary, if you can take that for us?","","Gary Moore","Yes. So Jeff I mean first of 6% growth 67.1% gross margin. This is a very important business for Cisco and as I said last quarter our service revenue would be slower growing because of the slower quarter product growth that we have seen for a number of quarters. But we see a solid opportunity relative to the business model, relative to the new things that we're looking at and the long-term plan there. So I'm very confident in our ability to get back to that long-term 9% to 11% growth over the next three to five years is what we said in December. I actually we see very strong potential but as the core product bookings reaccelerate which we see, services will follow that, normally a couple of quarters behind. So as you see that core grow, better attach rate and some of the programs that we have to drive even higher attach rate right now we are very comfortable getting back there.","So hopefully that makes sense to you. But if not we\u2019re not surprised here and I actually mentioned that last quarter.","","John Chambers","In terms of, this is a compound growth number we are talking about. We are not talking about just spiking in and back down or spiking above and back into it. So, both on our 5 to 7 and 9 to 11. We expect that to be on the average if we execute well. If we don't hold ourselves accountable for the results on, so we are not sending mixed message but it's going to take us several quarters even with economy picking up to get back to where Gary and I will be more proud of the numbers which is a 10% give or take a point or two in terms of that approach.","","Melissa Selcher","Great. Thanks Jess. Next question.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird","","Jayson Noland - Robert Baird","John I wanted to ask about strength in U.S. enterprise and commercial. What the driver there is versus what you're seeing in emerging markets in Asia. Is the divergence mostly macroeconomic or is there something else you can point to as a contributor?","","John Chambers","Well, kind of the good news and part of the challenge is the U.S. economy is one of the strongest engine right now in the world as far as moving to the rest of the world. And we all know GDP growth has been projected decelerating here versus what we would have thought just one or two quarters ago in terms of the direction. So, it\u2019s a better number to work with and that\u2019s part of it, but the real issue is we are learning how to sell architectures and solutions to our customer\u2019s needs. And the numbers that I have talked about with Brian think about it for a moment, in a business that is growing primarily as U.S. enterprise group, a 9% year-over-year \u2013 and it\u2019s been in high single-digits for several quarters now, the number of million dollar deals in the pipeline is up 50%. They are selling solutions. That\u2019s how you beat it. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a different consumption model, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s IT as a service from Amazon, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s individual companies trying to put together product solutions, and in that, that\u2019s where you sell to the business leader as well as the CIO.","Now, interestingly enough, Alison Gleeson\u2019s 12% is very similar. She sells if I remember right Rob almost as many as UCSs and new architectures, including Cisco ONE in terms of leading-edge in the commercial market and it grew 12%, but she doesn\u2019t sell in the indirect part. She sells total architecture. We respond to RFPs with their commercial group, but it is a machine, both of those average if you can imagine 10 million per sales rep in terms of the ability to Frank, and you will see us selectively add sales reps and SEs around the world, that goes back to rebalancing probably to the tune of 400 people in terms of sales reps and SEs to really go after these opportunities. It\u2019s our fuel for the market.","So, the answer is they sell what our strengths are. They sell architectures. They sell solution to customer needs. They deliver on those. And they are often the number one IT partner within the organization. Mel, you give me the signal that I have talked a little bit too long, I want to close, first, unbelievably strong results. Well, I will leave you with that message. In my view, I don\u2019t see an area that I think that I am overly concerned at that we control, within that period of inconsistency of GDP growth and the importance of moving rapidly to take advantages of new opportunities. So, when you talk about workforce rebalancing more than two-thirds the reason for that is they are aligned to move very fast on new opportunities and get our mid-level management back to a number that will support our growth objectives as we said. We have strong momentum. I mentioned it in probably nine major categories. Mel gave me a hard time about it being too long, but thank you for bearing with me. That\u2019s the type of momentum we are going in with. And it\u2019s a very solid execution even though Gary, Frank, and I and Rob would be critical of our sales about what we have to better, I would argue very strongly, we are hard at executing our peers and we are winning in architectures and we are winning on new trends that perhaps 3 or 6 months ago people will be concerned about. And candidly, we are going to lead in these areas as opposed to play defense. We are going to be disruptor and we are going to be the company on the offing. So, I am very comfortable. I think if you look at the other five IT companies that Gartner has in their top six I think we have shown this year in terms of our appreciation, return to shareholders, growth, market share execution, we have beaten them all, and we intend to as we move forward. So, Mel, let me turn it back to you.","","Melissa Selcher","Great, thanks John.

At the request of Cisco Systems, today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect.","Now I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks, Sam. Welcome everyone to Cisco's fourth quarter fiscal 2016 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO and Kelly Kramer, our CFO.","By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides including supplemental information will be available on our Web site in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheet, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the financial information section of our Investor Relations Web site. Throughout this conference call we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise.","The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements including the guidance we will be providing for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. As a reminder in Q2, on November 20th, we completed the sale of the customer premises equipment portion of our SP Video connected devices business and accordingly had no revenue or expense from that business in Q4 fiscal 2016. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP, product orders and backlog information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP Video, CPE business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SP Video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our Web site to help to understand these impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q3 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way.","So with that, I'll go ahead and turn it over to Chuck.","Chuck Robbins","Thank you, Marilyn.","We executed extremely well in Q4 with revenue growth of 2% and record non-GAAP EPS which grew 9%. This was another strong quarter wrapping up a great year. We closed out our fiscal year with $48.7 billion in revenue, up 3%, and non-GAAP EPS which grew 8% to a record $2.36. Gross margins and operating margins were consistently strong throughout the year. We continue to manage our business well and these results underscore our ability to execute against our strategic priorities and our rigorous discipline on profitability.","Over this past fiscal year, we experienced a challenging environment with significant volatility. Our fourth quarter was no exception. After three consecutive quarters of growth, both service provider and emerging markets turned negative. Service provider orders declined 5% reflecting the many challenges in that customer segment that you've heard from our peers.","In addition, emerging markets orders were down 6%. The remainder of the business remained healthy, with orders growing 5%. While the overall macro environment remains uncertain, we are well positioned to capture the benefits of any tailwinds. At the same time, we're aggressively investing in priority areas to drive growth over the long-term, regardless of the environment. We had strong performance in security; data center switching, collaboration and services as well as continued success in the transition of our business model to software and subscriptions. We remained focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio and we've made great progress over the past year in these priority areas where we continue to see momentum.","First, security; Security is the number one priority for every customer. As the global leader in networking, Cisco is uniquely positioned to deliver security at scale with leading edge innovation as we lead the transition to cloud delivered security. Our team has done a phenomenal job of capitalizing on this distinct advantage that Cisco has in the most critical area for our customers.","For example, we've been rapidly shifting our model from a primarily hardware business to a software and services business. This past quarter we delivered our third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth with revenue up 16% and deferred revenue growing 29% as a result of this shift. We continue to add significant features and functionality to our security portfolio, both through internal innovation and M&A to meet our customers' most pressing needs, such as cloud defense orchestrator which provides cloud-based security policy management, stealth watch learning networks, which leverages a network infrastructure, analytics and distributed machine learning to provide visibility and security intelligence across the enterprise.","We have also extended our cloud-based security platform through our acquisition of CloudLock, an as a service offering enabling the ability to secure cloud applications. Over the past year, we've demonstrated tremendous success and rapidly deploying Cisco's advanced threat solutions to our global customer base with our amp solution now deployed at over 17,000 customers around the world. As we have done in the advanced threat market, we are now deeply focused on winning in the next generation firewall market. We launched our full featured next generation firewall in March and we added over 6,000 customers this past quarter.","Second, next generation data center. Over the past year we have continued to invest heavily in our data center portfolio, building upon our core networking foundation as customers look to Cisco for an open programmable and automated infrastructure that accelerates application deployments and provides network services in an agile way. We are delivering technologies across physical, virtual and cloud-based deployments.","In Q4, we launched our Tetration Analytics platform, providing complete visibility across the data center. Combining Tetration with Cisco cloud center, we can automate and orchestrate data center application workloads real-time between hybrid and private clouds while enabling policy management with ACI. Our ACI family of products continued to see strong revenue growth in Q4, growing 36% at over a $2.3 billion annualized run rate. In addition, this past quarter marked our first full quarter with HyperFlex, our hyper converged solution and we already have approximately 500 customers and over a quarter of these are net new to UCS. We're off to a great start with a solid pipeline and strong customer feedback.","Third, collaboration. This continues to be a consistent growth driver for us. Our strategy and highly differentiated portfolio delivered both on-premise and from the cloud enabled us in FY 2016 to grow revenue 9% to $4.4 billion. In Q4, we delivered another consecutive quarter of solid growth with revenue growing 6% and deferred revenue growing at 13%.","Lastly, we continue to see great progress in our transition to software and subscription based models. I've mentioned the success we've had in this area in both security and collaboration and overall our product deferred revenue related to our recurring software and subscription businesses grew 33% in Q4. Our momentum here is strong and we'll continue to accelerate this transition.","Today's market requires Cisco and our customers to be decisive, move with greater speed and drive more innovation than we've seen in our history. Today we announced a restructuring enabling us to optimize our cost base and lower growth areas of our portfolio and further invest in key priority areas, such as security, IoT, collaboration, next generation data center and cloud. We expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from these actions back into the businesses and we'll continue to aggressively invest to focus on our areas of future growth.","Now, I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more detail on our financials.","Kelly Kramer","Thanks, Chuck.","We executed well on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value. First, on delivering profitable growth. We had another good quarter with revenue growing 2% and non-GAAP EPS growing 9%. For the full fiscal year, we grew revenue 3% and non-GAAP EPS 8%. For the quarter and the full year we expanded both our gross and operating margins. For the full fiscal year total revenue was $48.7 billion with product up 2% and services up 5%.","Let me now walk through the details for Q4. Total revenue was $12.6 billion, up 2% with growth in product revenue of 1% and services of 5%. Switching grew 2% driven by strength in data center switching with continued momentum in ACI and the next generation data center. Routing declined 6%, largely driven by the weakness we saw in service provider. Collaboration grew 6%, driven by continued strength of our TelePresence portfolio which grew in the double digits and continued solid performance of WebEx. Deferred revenue grew 13%. Data center declined 1%.","Our hyper converged offering, HyperFlex, is experiencing solid early up tick by our customers led by its highly differentiated architecture. Wireless grew 5% led by growth in cloud-based Meraki partially offset by a decline in controllers. Security grew 16% with deferred revenue growth of 29%. We had strong performance in our advanced threat security and web security solutions, which grew over 80% and 50% respectively. SP Video declined 12% driven by the weakness we saw in China this quarter. Services grew 5% driven by our focus on renewals and attach.","So we continue to make solid progress in our goal of driving more recurring revenue, total deferred revenue grew 8% with product up 8% and services up 9%. And as Chuck mentioned, the portion of our deferred product revenue related to our recurring software and subscription businesses grew 33%.","From an orders perspective, total product orders grew 1% with our book-to-bill comfortably above 1. Looking at our geographies, which is a primary way we run the business, Americas grew 3%, EMEA was down 3% and APJC grew 4%.","Total emerging markets declined 6% with the BRICs plus Mexico down 2%. India was up 20%, while we saw declines in China of 12%. In terms of customer segments, it was good to see a return to growth in enterprise of 3% as well as a solid performance in commercial of 5%. Public sector grew 1% and service provider was down 5%. Our product backlog as we ended Q4 was approximately $4.6 billion, up 1%.","We drove strong profitability with expanding leverage in Q4. From a non-GAAP perspective, total gross margin was 64.6%, growing 0.7 points with product gross margin of 63.9%, up 0.7 points and service gross margin of 67.0%, up 1.1 points. We increased our non-GAAP operating margin to 31.4%, up 1.3 points.","We also saw good momentum and improvements in the profitability for the full fiscal year. On a non-GAAP basis, our total gross margin for the year was 64.7%, an increase of 50 basis points with increases in both product gross margin and service gross margin, up 0.3 points and 1.4 points respectively. Our non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 31.0%, up 1.4 points. We remain disciplined and focused on continuing to drive operational efficiencies and productivity.","In terms of our bottom line, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.63, up 9%, GAAP EPS was $0.56. For the full year, we had record non-GAAP EPS of $2.36, up 8%, while GAAP EPS was $2.11.","Moving to our portfolio and strategic investments. In Q4, we announced our intent to acquire CloudLock, which has since closed early Q1. The CloudLock acquisition will further enhance Cisco's security portfolio and build on our security everywhere strategy, designed to provide protection from the cloud to the network to the end point and also aligns with our strategy to deliver more cloud-based subscription services.","We continued our strategy of investing in key growth areas including security, but also cloud collaboration and IoT and we are committed to looking at the right acquisitions at the right price to drive our growth strategy.","Moving on to shareholder value. In Q4 we delivered operating cash flows of $3.8 billion. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of Q4 were $65.8 billion, with $5.9 billion available in the U.S. We returned $2.1 billion to shareholders during the quarter that included $800 million of share repurchases and $1.3 billion for our quarterly dividend.","For the full fiscal year, operating cash flow grew 8% to a record $13.6 billion, with free cash flow of $12.4 billion. We returned $8.7 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends which represented 70% of our total free cash flow. We are firmly committed to continuing our capital allocation strategy of returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders annually.","To summarize, in Q4 and for the full fiscal year we executed well despite a volatile environment. We focused on consistent, solid execution driving profitable growth, cash generation and operating leverage. We're making the tough decisions and key investments to drive strong financial performance over the long-term and continuing our firm commitment to delivering shareholder value.","Let me now reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. The guidance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 is as follows. We expect our revenue growth to be in the range of minus 1% to plus 1% year-over-year normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from Q1 fiscal year 2016.","We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29% to 30%. And the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.58 to $0.60. The restructuring action Chuck discussed earlier will impact up to 5500 employees, representing approximately 7% of our global workforce. We will take these actions starting in Q1 of fiscal 2017 and estimate that we will recognize pretax charges to our GAAP financial results up to $700 million. We expect that approximately $325 million to $400 million of these charges will be recognized during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, with the remaining amount recognized during the rest of the fiscal year.","I'll now turn it back to Chuck to summarize the call.","Chuck Robbins","Thanks, Kelly.","To wrap up, I want to summarize our priorities as we head into the year ahead and why I'm confident about our opportunities. First, we expect to continue to execute against our strategic priorities and drive profitability regardless of the market conditions. We are committed to making the necessary decisions to drive our future growth and that of our customers and our partners.","Second, we believe we will transition more of our revenues to a software and subscription based model and accelerate our shift across our portfolio.","Third, we remain committed to increasing our pace of innovation that will help our customers succeed.","Lastly, we will continue to execute on our long-term strategy to create even greater value for our customers and shareholders while positioning Cisco for long-term success.","Marilyn, I'll turn it back over to you for questions.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks, Chuck. Sam, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. And while Sam is doing that I would like to remind the audience that we ask you to please ask one question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank Securities. Your line is now open.","Vijay Bhagavath","Thanks, Chuck, Kelly, Marilyn. My question is around demand trends, a lot of clients are asking me this since the press release came out. Help us with any color you can in terms of end markets, product categories, product cycles, anything and everything on demand trends looking into the rest of the year.","Chuck Robbins","Thanks, Vijay. So I'll provide some comments and ask Kelly for anything else that she'd like to add. So when you look at in Q4 what we obviously saw was after three quarters of growth in the service provider and emerging countries, we saw those turn negative, as I said. And the rest of the business was up 5% from an orders perspective. We also highlighted the fact that enterprise was up 3, a little more color on that is that every geography around the world experienced positive enterprise growth. Commercial was up 5. Every geography around the world experienced positive growth in commercial. And then in public sector it was up 1% and I believe all except perhaps Europe were positive as well in public sector. So outside of SP and emerging, we saw fairly consistent demand and I think that pretty much summarized it. Kelly, what other comments do you have?","Kelly Kramer","No. I think you summarized it well.","Marilyn Mora","Okay, Sam. Let's go ahead and tee up for the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Ittai Kidron","Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Couple things from me. And Chuck, this is the same question I asked last quarter. Your UCS, your data center business has now been stuck in range for seven quarters in a row and I understand that HyperFlex is seeing some traction, but how do we get that business back to growth again? What is the time line by which you think that could happen? And will you consider going after parts of the market that are maybe more margin sensitive?","And then just another small question there, Tetration solution you introduced. Can you just remind us in what product category in the future that will be included and maybe some color on first comments from customers?","Chuck Robbins","Absolutely, Ittai. Thank you very much. So on the UCS front, we talked about a couple of things. There's an overall sort of macro demand issue in that space. I think the overall blade market has been somewhat benign. But we've also had -- we've also experienced, as we talked about, a transition to rack and our teams have been working on subsequent innovation across both the blade and the rack business, as well as the introduction of the HyperFlex system.","So we have -- I believe the team has a real clear plan. They've got innovation priorities outlined across all of those platforms. And we'll be executing that over the next few quarters. So, Kelly and I actually reviewed this just a couple of days ago. So I feel good about the leadership there. I feel good about their plan and now it's about execution.","Kelly, any -- on the Tetration front, let me give you a little color and then Kelly you can talk about how we're going to report it. So, Tetration is -- we announced it in Q4. We're generally beginning order ability I think sometime around now. It is a combination of premise based hardware with subscription software. And so we're just very much in the early days. We have taken a couple of orders from customers. I will tell you that the general feedback from our customers is that it solves a problem that they've had for a very long time that nothing else has solved.","So again, we've got that offer ready to go in a combination of premise based and subscription based solution and it is just being turned off from order ability perspective.","Kelly Kramer","Right now since it is in the data center solution, it will be in data center switching. We expand that portfolio across we can be really able to give.","Chuck Robbins","We'll call it out.","Kelly Kramer","Yes.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks, Chuck and Kelly. Sam, we'll go ahead and take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our neck question is from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs & Company. Your line is now open.","Simona Jankowski","Hi. Thank you. I just had a clarification first which is, what percent of the business right now is recurring software and subscription revenue? And then as far as my question, gross margins and operating margins were ahead of your target ranges and that's in a quarter when gross margins are typically seasonally down. So just curious, Kelly and Chuck, are you thinking about raising your target margin ranges over time? And just more broadly, how are you thinking about the tradeoff between margins and revenue growth?","Kelly Kramer","Yes. So I'll start and Chuck you can jump in. But, to your first question, the portion of our business that is recurring revenue is up to 28%. And that compares to a 25% in Q4 of 2015. So we made really solid progress this year.","In terms of the margins, this has been a huge focus for us all quarter long and it is really great to see that we actually had our margins -- gross margins and operating margins up year-over-year for us this year. Its part of what we're driving with our shift to software. Those businesses have great margins and its part of the overall transition. In terms of when do we change our model or our guidance, I think that will come over time as we make bigger shifts at the company level. But that is our goal as we shift to more software that have those nice, great margins.","Chuck Robbins","The only other comment I'd make is that when we look at our success relative to subscription and software businesses, we have the product deferred revenue that's associated with software and subscriptions that we said was up 33%. We also have another category of total contract value that we have not recognized revenue on yet that we will be billing customers on, on a monthly basis going forward that we track both those numbers.","The second one doesn't show up on our balance sheet yet. If you look at those two combined, which is really reflective of our progress here, that number was actually up 43% over the same period a year ago, just to share one more data point there.","Marilyn Mora","Next question, please.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America Securities. Your line is now open.","Tal Liani","Hi, guys. My questions are about the restructuring program. Two things. First is, are you -- you said that you're doing it in order to increase investments in growth areas versus areas that are not growing. Are you anticipating further decline in growth rates or any issues beyond what we're seeing now in the legacy areas that prompt this kind of program?","And second, when we talk about lower growth areas, these are your largest areas, so switches and routers and the question is how do you deal with -- how do you balance between the need to compete and the need to invest and maybe you can give us some colors on the restructuring and what you plan on doing. Thank you.","Chuck Robbins","Yes. I'll make some initial comments and again pass it to Kelly. So, Tal, good questions. Primarily we are looking at the areas of growth that we believe will grow faster than others. So it's more of a relative statement than it is an absolute statement. At the same time, we actually are working very diligently on bringing innovation to our core. We're focused on a tighter coupling of security into the core. We're focused on policy and orchestration and cloud-based management across the entire portfolio. So there is a significant amount of innovation the teams are working on there over the next several quarters as well. So it's not that we're ignoring one in favor of another. We just want to make sure that our investments are commensurate with the growth opportunity from a relative perspective. Kelly?","Kelly Kramer","No. I think you said it well. We are investing in basically every business unit we have, right. So we're investing in the core in key areas. We're looking for those pockets of where the growth is, whether it's in core routing and switching or security and collaboration. So we're being very smart about where we're putting our money and that's how we're looking at this.","Marilyn Mora","We'll go ahead and take our next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Milunovich with UBS Securities. Your line is now open.","Steve Milunovich","Thank you very much. Could you talk a bit more about the factors behind your first quarter guidance, revenue being flat is clearly below the recent growth rate and the gross margin is also down a fair amount sequentially. So what do you attribute that to?","ChuckRobbins","Yes. I'll give a couple of macro comments here. So we obviously are calling out the weakness we saw from a demand perspective in Q4 relative to SP and emerging countries. We also -- obviously as we look forward, we just -- we're uncertain how to model any improvement in those two in particular going forward. And the other issue is that there is some impact from the transition in our business model. I'll give you a quick example.","We restructured and drove new value and how we put together certain Cisco One software packages for our customers. And in Q4 as an example, there was about $139 million that would have been recognized as revenue that because of the way we have now structured those offers and the value the customers see in those, those are going to transition to ratable revenue recognition. So there is slight impact from that as we look forward as well. And those are the key things that led us to our guide.","Chuck Robbins","Yes. And just on the only thing to add to that, again, we base it on what we see and again, we did see the additional slowdown in SP and emerging. That makes us a bit cautious. On the margins, Steve, we're going to be driving as much as we can in those margins and we'll be working that. But as of right now, this is what we see.","Marilyn Mora","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","James Faucette","Thank you very much. I just wanted a quick question, I think this ties into service provider. Routing was surprising to us that it wasn't a little bit better and I think that's probably attributable to service provider. I want to make sure that's the case. And I guess I'd like kind of your view, seems like with new products in that category that maybe that that category at some point becomes pretty spring-loaded as at least we would expect the valuation units to be shipped in and pent-up demand to develop. But I want to know if we're thinking about that correctly and kind of how we should think about the router segment going forward. Thanks.","Kelly Kramer","Yes, James. You're correct in that. Over 50% of our routing business comes from service providers. So there's a direct correlation there. And I think if you look at the discussions that have taken place with our peers, you look at some of the analyst reports on SP CapEx, we actually saw exactly what the analysts have talked about. I saw one report that discussed double-digit declines outside of the United States and maybe flat to slightly up inside the U.S., which is effectively what we saw from a demand perspective. So it was very much in line with that.","As far as what we see going forward, look, we certainly don't expect that these networks over time, that the traffic will decline. So I think it's a matter of timing. The video loads on the networks continue to increase. So we would think about it the same way you do, but we also know that in uncertain times that customers' tend to sweat assets as long as they possibly can.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks, Chuck. Sam, we'll go ahead and take our next question, please.","Operator","Yes. Our next question is from James Suva with Citigroup Global Markets. Your line is now open.","James Suva","Thanks very much. And I appreciate the opportunity. Congratulations, Chuck and Kelly to your good results. My question is just one part and pretty simple is, regarding Brexit, you're one of the first major tech companies to report that have a full month post the Brexit event happening. Can you talk about, did that influence your visibility, your spending patterns or demand orders or book-to-bill or anything like that, any push-outs, any hesitations? Chuck, you talked many times about uncertainty in economic times we're in. I was wondering has it been compounded by Brexit or was that kind of built in and actually you didn't see much of an impact. Thank you very much.","Chuck Robbins","Thanks, Jim. I'll tell you after the first year in this job, I know for a fact that every month there are you new things that we face and the good news is we tend to execute well and we deal with those. As it relates to -- first off, let me just say, in the EMEA business the decline there was largely attributed to service providers. So I just want to make that clear. We would not suggest that the broad-based shift in the EMEA results was solely dependent upon Brexit. What we saw from a Brexit perspective is exactly what you would expect. In the U.K. proper, we saw customers pause. We saw them just kind of slow a bit because they're uncertain. And we also saw the impact of the currency devaluation which you would expect. But we remain very committed there. We think we'll work through this. But those are the real impacts.","Marilyn Mora","Great. Thanks, Chuck. Sam, let's go ahead and take the next question, please.","Operator","Yes. Our next question is from Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Mark Moskowitz","Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask a follow-up around the restructuring. Can you give us any sense, Chuck or Kelly, is there any benefit here from the early stages of the Ericsson relationship allowing you to leverage that JV so you can actually drive some of this restructuring, does that imply there could be incremental restructuring down the road?","And then my question is around the cloud. We keep getting a lot of questions around what is Cisco's exposure to the cloud in terms of can you give us any sense around the percentage of revenue at least to private cloud or public cloud deployments that you're serving from an infrastructure perspective. Thank you.","Chuck Robbins","So, on the Ericsson front, I'll tell you that the partnership continues to move forward and there was really no correlation or discussion of the Ericsson partnership as it related to the decision on restructuring. We think that, again, the original benefits that we saw with that partnership with their global scale for services, their OSS capabilities, their radio expertise combined with our IP expertise and data center and security and other capabilities as well as the enterprise and IoT were really the drivers there. So, we see that continuing.","As it relates to the cloud impact, I think when we look at sort of next generation data center build out in the private cloud, we look at our ACI portfolio and we saw a $2.3 billion annualized business that grew 36%. So we feel like customers continue to move towards a hybrid cloud environment. The orchestration capability that we talked about with cloud center, which is from the CliQr acquisition, combined with the knowledge that we're going to be able to provide the customers through Tetration. So think about Tetration providing analytics about what's going on, CliQr and ACI then being able to deploy policy and move workloads between public and private cloud and that's what we think customers are going to look for and we think we're in a pretty good spot there.","Marilyn Mora","Sam, let's go ahead and take the next question, please.","Operator","Yes. Our next question is from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Mitch Steves","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So my first part is kind of on the product gross margin. So looks like it was actually down sequentially in July. And I think that's primarily due to selling more switching and routing. So does that mean in October quarter you think that the mix is going to shift more to legacy kind of routing and switching versus the remaining I guess call it advanced portfolio?","And then just one small one. What was the total acquisition revenue you guys got from all the acquisitions this quarter?","Kelly Kramer","Yes. So I'll take that. So on the gross margins, we do have seasonality of when different mix of our products are bigger. For example, data center and services are bigger in Q2 and Q4. So, you can see that normal seasonality in there. As I said to the earlier question, I think from an overall perspective we feel great about our gross margins. We are being smart about the tradeoff on top line and bottom line. And the teams continue to do great work in terms of driving productivity and costs out of the products that allow us to do that.","From a pricing perspective, our price -- ASP price erosion that we saw in Q4 was basically in line with what we saw in Q3. Actually, 20 basis points better. So we're still in that same range. We're not seeing any change there. In terms of acquisition revenue, we don't typically disclose that but I can tell you it was roughly less than a point.","Marilyn Mora","Next question, please.","Mitch Steves","Thank you very much.","Kelly Kramer","Yes.","Operator","And our next question is from Jeff Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Jeff Lubert","Hi, guys. I was hoping you could touch upon the activity you saw from some of your top cloud customers, to what degree you're continuing to see strength in that vertical. And then on the switching business, which saw a return to growth following several soft quarters, I was hoping you can help us understand to what extent ASI revenues are now greater than some of the legacy data center offerings and presuming the mix of legacy and the data center is now smaller than ASI. Would you expect the switching business overall to grow moving power or their offsets that could cause that bad going forward?","Chuck Robbins","Thanks Jeff. So, on the WebSkill players, what we reported in the last couple of quarters was our -- our top ten WebSkill customers and that business was up 2% this quarter. But, it is a -- when you have 10 customers in sort of a reporting segment like that, it's highly dependent upon ordering cycle. So, I'm not concerned about our relevance or anything relative to that.","On the switching business, I think it's important to understand a couple of things, number one, your question relative to the ASI portfolio and has it exceeded the traditional portfolio, I think we -- the answer to that is, yes. And our orders there were, I think grew in the data center switching business where up mid-single digits.","Kelly Kramer","Yes. In the revenue side.","Chuck Robbins","On the revenue side. And so, that transition continues to go well and we see customers that are investing in new cloud-ready architectures are choosing the ASI platforms which is shown in the results.","When you look at our overall switching portfolio, it's just important to understand the math on what percentage of what business is still attributed to our campus portfolio and as we said, anytime we have these macro -- these environments where customers have any level of uncertainty that tends to an area that they will continue to sweat, if they can. And our job over the next several quarters is to drive innovation in that portfolio, integrate security more tightly. And again, focus on orchestration policy and helping our customers lower their costs and that's what we are trying to do.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks Chuck. Next question please.","Operator","Yes. Our next question is from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird. Your line is now open.","Jayson Noland","Okay, great. I wanted to ask about long-term revenue growth. I think Kelly 3 to 6 has been -- 3% to 6% has been discussed in the past. But, with shift to software and subscription and service provider uncertainty that seems like a stretch, I'm not asking for specific guidance. But, is there some direction that you would suggest for a long-term models?","Kelly Kramer","Yes. I think that's a great question Jayson. If you back to -- I think that was back in June of 2015 with our last financial analyst conference. They have changed quite a bit. Our transition has accelerated with -- that we have been accelerating. And I would say the other major change from that long-term guidance was certainly our expectation the data center business in that market has changed.","So, I would say, there is no long-term model change per se right now. But, we are in the process of planning an analyst conference hopefully at the end of the calendar year here. And we will update that. But, I would say those are the two major assumption changes since we did that.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks Kelly. We have one more question. Time for one more question.","Operator","Yes. And our last question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Simon Leopold","Great. Thank you very much. I wanted to see if we can talk a little bit about the longer term on the routing business specifically. What you laid out sounds like very much the cyclical challenges facing your peers as well as weaker CapEx. But, if you could help us understand some of the longer term themes around what's going on in routing and how that sector may grow and your business may grow. I'm pondering the implications around sort of FDN as well as some of the architectural shifts of pretty more over the burden into the optical space. Thank you.","Chuck Robbins","Yes. Simon, thanks for the question. So, when I think about routing, I actually think about it in several different ways. Number one, you got SP traditional portfolio with edge access and core, which we discussed earlier which is largely just a consumption driven cycle that we go through. In the enterprise space, we have this transition to software defined wide area networking, which we are very well positioning right now with our IWAN portfolio and we are actually working on -- a key differentiator for us which I think is -- as our teams have built out the ability to really drive the next generation secure edge with our cloud security capabilities, the combination of dynamically provisioning those branch solutions with the ability to have robust cloud security and edge security is going to be a real differentiator for us. So we see that being another opportunity for us going forward in the routing space.","And then, finally, when we talk about the security and the security driven refresh of our core, in Q4, we actually had a couple of customers, I talked earlier in the opening comments about stealth watch learning networks, which is effectively a machine learning algorithm that runs at the edge of the network in the branch. And it actually does machine learning and a little of AI to determine normalcy for customers, and then, flag for them, when they see abnormal behavior going on.","And we saw a couple of customers that actually made the decision to do a branch router refresh based on that capability, which we just launched in July. So we believe that there is innovation that we can bring that will lead us to a refresh opportunity in the core and we think that's largely going to be driven around security. And we are seeing some real early examples. We need to see how it plays out. But, we are seeing some early examples there.","Chuck Robbins","All right, Marilyn. Thank you very much.","In wrapping up, I just want to summarize our priorities again as we think about the year ahead. First off, we're committed to executing against the financial model and against our priorities, regardless of the conditions of the market and we're committed to making the decisions that are necessary to drive our growth and also to fulfill the commitments and obligations that we made to our customers, partners and shareholders.","We also are pleased with where we are on the transition to software and subscription models and you can assume that we'll continue to accelerate that over the next year. We also, I believe will drive a greater pace of innovation than you've seen in the last several years from Cisco. Our teams are very excited. There's a lot of things going on. So we're very committed to driving innovation.","And then finally, just to reiterate, our long-term strategy to create greater value for our customers and our shareholders while ensuring that we're also making the decision for Cisco's long-term success will remain at the forefront.","So I want to thank everyone for spending time with us today. And we'll look forward to talking to all of you soon. Marilyn?","Marilyn Mora","Thanks, Chuck. Cisco's next quarterly call which will reflect our fiscal year 2017 first quarter results will be on Wednesday, November 16, 2016, at 1:30 PM Pacific time, 4:30 PM Eastern time.

At the request of Cisco Systems, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect.","Now, I\u2019d like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks, Michelle. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2018 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I\u2019m joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO.","By now, you should have seen our earnings press release, a corresponding webcast with slides including supplemental information will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the financial information section of our Investor Relations website.","Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic, and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise.","The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements including the guidance we will be providing for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and the press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.","With that I\u2019ll now turn it over to Chuck.","Chuck Robbins","Thank you, Marilyn. Good afternoon, everyone.","We had another great quarter. We are executing well against the strategy we put in place three years ago. Our innovation pipeline has never been stronger and we continue to transform our business to reflect the way customers want to consume our technology.","We delivered another quarter of accelerating revenue growth of 4%, solid margins and record non-GAAP EPS of 10%. Our performance was driven by the acceleration of our intent-based networking portfolio, continuing strong customer demand for our innovative solutions, and the increasing value of the network. We also made steady progress in shifting more of our business toward software and subscriptions. This resulted in broad-based strength across our products and geographies.","As I talk with customers around the world, it is clear that the network is playing an increasingly critical role in helping them manage their complex environments. They\u2019re consuming services from multiple cloud providers, multiple SaaS applications, connecting billions of new devices, which are generating massive amounts of data and the network is pervasive across all of these environments. We have been evolving our portfolio to help our customers deal with this complexity and provide unprecedented simplicity, visibility and security across on-premise, hybrid and multi-cloud environments.","Now, I\u2019d like to review our momentum across key priority areas and share some of the innovations we\u2019re driving across our portfolio. First, let\u2019s start with Infrastructure Platforms. We are leading the network industry\u2019s transformation to intent-based networking across the campus, branch, data center and the edge. We are paving the way to help customers simplify and managed the network. Always Cisco offers an end-to-end intent-based networking portfolio that delivers assurance, industry-leading security, policy-based automation and segmentation.","We continue to see very strong adoption of the Catalyst 9000, the fastest ramping, new product introduction in our history. This includes another quarter of high uptake of our advanced subscription offer and DNA Center, our automation and analytics platform. The Catalyst 9000 now has over 5,800 customers, up from 3,100 last quarter. This is an excellent example of how we\u2019ve begun to scale our enterprise networking business into a subscription model. We\u2019ve also recently introduced additional intent-based networking innovations. These include new access solutions and routing software subscriptions, which expand our software-defined WAN capabilities onto any platform.","We are extending our leadership in data center and cloud by providing highly secure and differentiated offerings such as ACI SDN solution. With growing 100 gig deployments especially in cloud infrastructure, we remain well-positioned for future growth with our data center switching and intent-based portfolio. We also announced new hybrid cloud workload management solutions with ACI multi-side management and new flexible consumption models including SaaS delivery for our titration platform. Whether deploying enterprise applications or containers in a multi-cloud environment, customers are increasingly turning to Cisco\u2019s unique architectural approach. This is leading to strong momentum with UCS, our compete platform and HyperFlex, our hyper-converged offering as customers benefit from simplicity and scalability to support their hybrid cloud strategies.","Now, turning to security, which is foundational to everything we do. Our architecture delivers highly effective security from the network to the endpoint, to the cloud. This unique ability to bring together networking and security at scale gives us a huge competitive advantage. With the largest customer base and enterprise security, it is clear that our strategy is working. The strength we saw in the quarter is driven by our integrated architecture combined with best-of-breed products. We\u2019re also leveraging artificial intelligence on machine learning to reduce time to detection and remediation.","A great example of this is our Talos intelligence platform where we block 20 billion threats every day. We continue to rapidly innovate in security to address key areas of concern for our customers such as security in their complex of data centers. We introduced a comprehensive, integrated data center security architecture that is designed to protect the modern data center by seamlessly following any workload anywhere across physical and multi-cloud environments.","Now, moving to applications. This quarter, we introduced new innovations across our collaboration portfolio with the convergence of the Cisco\u2019s Spark and WebEx platforms combined with new WebEx Meetings and WebEx Teams applications. We further enhanced our AI and machine-learning capabilities across our collaboration portfolio with the acquisition of a company, a relationship intelligence platform with robust insights and intelligence to improve meeting and team experiences. We completed this acquisition last week.","We are pleased with the consistent progress we\u2019ve made to deliver on the strategy we put in place nearly three years ago. We have solid business momentum. We are confident in our pipeline of innovation and future growth opportunities. And our commitment to driving value for our shareholders remains as strong as ever. This is clearly demonstrated by the fact that we delivered record capital returns this quarter.","As part of our commitment to shareholders, we are also very focused on our responsibility as a company to drive impact within our communities through innovation and active engagement. It is not only the right thing to do but a key requirement for long-term business success. We are deeply committed to our long-standing efforts around sustainability, education and disaster relief as well as other key issues such as hunger and homelessness. I could not be proud of our achievements. We\u2019re more excited about the impact we will have going forward. ","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kelly, to walk through more detail on our financials.","Kelly Kramer","Thanks, Chuck.","I\u2019ll start with the summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by the guidance for Q4. We were pleased with the financial performance in Q3 with broad strength across the business. We executed well with very good orders momentum, strong revenue growth and solid margins.","Total revenue was $12.5 billion, up 4% and non-GAAP EPS was $0.66, up 10%. We continue to focus on driving margins and profitability with the strong non-GAAP operating margin rate of 31.5%.","Let me provide some more detail on our Q3 revenue. Total product revenue was up 5%, demonstrating the strength of our portfolio. Infrastructure platforms grew 2% with strength in all businesses with the exception of routing. Switching returned to growth with revenue growth in both data center and campus. Campus growth was driven by our new switch, the Cat9K. We saw solid growth in wireless with strength in Meraki and our Wave 2 offerings. Data center had very strong double digit growth, driven by servers as well as HyperFlex.","Routing declined largely with the continued weakness in service provider. Applications was up 19% in total with broad strength across the businesses. We saw a very solid growth in TelePresence endpoints, UC Infrastructure and AppDynamics.","Security was up 11% with strong performance in unified threat, advanced threat and web security. Deferred revenue grew 38% as we continue to drive more subscription-based software offers.","Service revenue was up 3% driven by growth in advanced services as well as software and solution support. We continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions and recurring revenues. In Q3, we generated 32% of our total revenue from recurring offers, an increase of 2 points from a year ago. Revenue from subscriptions was 55% of our software revenue. We drove good growth in deferred revenue, which was up 9% in total with product up 18% and services up 4%. Deferred product revenue from our recurring software and subscription offers was $5.6 billion, up 29%. We saw strong momentum in Q3 product orders, growing 4% in total.","Looking at our geographies, Americas grew 4%; EMEA was up 6%; and APJC was up 3%. Total emerging markets was up 7% with the BRICs plus Mexico up 12%. In our customer segment, enterprise was up 11%, commercial grew 7%, public sector was up 2% and service provider declined 4%.","From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q3 gross margin was 63.9%, down 0.5 points. Product gross margin was 62.9%, down 0.3 points and service gross margin was 66.9%, down 0.9 points. We continue to be negatively impacted by the higher memory pricing we have discussed over the past several calls, which we expect to continue in the near-term. Our operating margin was strong at 31.5%.","When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our results year-over-year, there\u2019s been 120 basis-point positive impact on revenue and a negative $0.01 year-over-year impact on our non-GAAP EPS. In terms of the bottom line, non-GAAP net income of $3.2 billion was 6% while GAAP net income was $2.7 billion. We grew non-GAAP EPS 10% to $0.66, while GAAP EPS was $0.56.","We delivered operating cash flow of $2.4 billion, down 28%. We paid $1.3 billion of one-time foreign taxes during the quarter related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Operating cash flow increased 11% normalized for these tax payments. We repatriated $67 billion of our offshore funds to the U.S. and ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $54.4 billion with $47.5 billion available in the U.S.","From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $7.6 billion to shareholders during the quarter that included $6 billion of share repurchases and $1.6 billion for our quarterly dividend. We recently announced an agreement to sell our Service Provider Video Software Solutions business. We expect this transaction to close in Q1 fiscal year \u201819 subject to any regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. We are continually looking to optimize our portfolio.","To summarize, Q3 was a good quarter with solid top-line growth, strong profitability and order growth. We continue to make solid progress on our strategic priorities, making key investments to drive our long-term growth.","Let me reiterate our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal year \u201818. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 6% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29.5% to 30.5%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 21%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.68 to $0.70.","I\u2019ll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move on into the Q&A.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks, Kelly. Michelle, let\u2019s go ahead and open the line for questions. And while Michelle is doing that, I\u2019d like to remind the audience to ask just one question so that we have plenty of time for others in the audience to ask a question. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it to you, Michelle.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. James Faucette from Morgan Stanley Investment Research, you may go ahead, sir.","James Faucette","Great. Thank you very much. Chuck and Kelly, I guess, I wanted to ask, as you -- one of the key things that investors are looking at is the continued growth in subscriptions, et cetera and it seems like deferred continues to grow nicely. One of the key questions that we have though is, as you continue to show good demand for the new Catalyst 9K products and distribution expense, what are you seeing in terms of attach rates for subscriptions to that new product? Are they maintaining the levels that you\u2019d seen at the early stages of launch or are they starting to normalize back to more traditional levels? Just trying to get a little color on how well that tying strategy is working for you? Thank you.","Chuck Robbins","Yes. James, thanks for the message. I\u2019ll comment, and then if Kelly wants to add anything, will let her do that as well. I would say, it\u2019s been very consistent over the last four quarters, I think since we put it in the marketplace in Q4 of last fiscal year, I think we had one month of activity. So, it\u2019s been incredibly consistent. We\u2019re really pleased with the acceptance of this product, I think adding 2,700 more customers in the quarter, if you think about that. That means we added over 40 customers per day that acquired the Catalyst 9000 for the first time. And the acquisition of that product in my opinion is a clear belief in the next generation architecture with the automation platform that we\u2019re announcing, which is what the advanced subscription model requires. And so, I think that\u2019s reflected in the continued high uptake that we see on the advanced subscription. Kelly? ","Kelly Kramer","Yes. No, I think that covers it. Vast majority is the advantage which has the advanced features and the higher margin profile. And then, the only other thing I would add is, it is very evenly spread across commercial enterprise and public sector in terms of the demand and where we\u2019re seeing all the business.","Operator","Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs, you may go ahead, sir.","Rod Hall","Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to try to dig under the covers a little bit on the revenue guidance. Obviously, service provider orders are weak and it sounds like routing is weak in line with that. Just wondering if you could, Kelly, maybe give us any idea how much Service Provider Video is affecting that guide and also the routing within that guide, what are you assuming there, are you assuming routing continues to kind of drag that growth down? And then, I have a follow-up.","Kelly Kramer","Yes. So, in general, I think, the trends on both, routing and Service Provider Video which is in the other bucket have been consistent, and we\u2019re not assuming any improvement in either of those. So, I would say, our guide includes what we see -- we feel really good about the rest of portfolio, actually and we see very good growth there, but those two trends are not improving. So, that\u2019s basically what I have included.","Rod Hall","Okay. And then, Kelly, could you also comment OpEx to sales? It\u2019s picking up a little bit in the guide and it was implied. And I am wondering if you could maybe give us any color on what\u2019s moving around in OpEx for Q4? ","Kelly Kramer","Yes, sure. On OpEx, it\u2019s mainly driven by -- the increase is mainly driven by the acquisitions we brought in, specifically AppDynamics. As you know, when we bought AppDynamics, very early stage, we\u2019re in heavy investment phase with them. So, that\u2019s part of it. As well as we have consolidated now BroadSoft that also has a fairly high OpEx impact. If I back out -- if you look at my OpEx growth for the quarter, which was up little less than 6%, 4 points of that alone is just purely the acquisitions. And that\u2019s as I mentioned the impact of acquisitions on my top line and it\u2019s hurting then EPS. It\u2019s mainly in the OpEx line. So that\u2019s what\u2019s driving that. We are being very disciplined within the rest of the business, so managing the portfolio. So, I think it will continue kind of in that range as we look forward to Q4. But that\u2019s kind of the underlying driver.","Operator","Thank you. Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer & Company, you may go ahead, sir. ","Ittai Kidron","Thanks and congrats on a good quarter, Chuck. I had a couple of questions. First on the Catalyst 9K, good progress, but help us understand how big is your Catalyst install base from a customer standpoint? What percent of it do you really think, the Cat9K is relevant to, because it\u2019s hard to gauge whether you\u2019re moving too slow or too fast. 40 customers a day sounds like a lot, but maybe company like Cisco, it\u2019s not fast enough. So, help me understand how do you think about driving that throughout your install base, especially with now Arista potentially coming to the marketplace? And then second question, I had a question about China. Clearly, relations there have not been on the good side recently. And you\u2019ve been somewhat a little bit more optimistic on that country over the last year. What are you seeing out of there and how do you take that into your outlook commentary?","Chuck Robbins","On the 9K, I think that -- we have roughly 840,000 customers. And I would say that there is a very long list of customers that are still available to us to deliver this platform. If you look at the products that we have put in the market in the new Catalyst 9K family are sort of like -- if you stack our portfolio and you say we have a very low in switch and then you have the old Catalyst 3000, and the old Catalyst 4000, those are kind of platforms that current 9K family replaced. So, there is still a very long tail of customers. The other thing you have to remember is, many of these customers are buying the 9K and then it will become the standard platform and they\u2019ll refresh the balance of their networks. The other thing, I\u2019ll point out is that I think we said on one of the calls a while back that the enterprise segment, we would expect to take flag [ph] the commercial segment with the 9K and we did impact to see the enterprise business improve in the 9K was part of that.","So, I think, we still feel good about it. And this architecture has a long future for us. And there is a portfolio of products that fit within it. So, I think, if we\u2019re really honest, the number of customers, who are making the decision to upgrade to the 9K, I would say, it\u2019s not necessarily because, wow, what a fantastic new Ethernet switch, it\u2019s really because they\u2019re buying into this automation strategy of which the entire portfolio will fit over time. And I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re banking on and that\u2019s we\u2019re banking on a long-term success. So, the China question, if you look at our China business this quarter, we actually saw strength in switching in both the enterprise and commercial segments.","And overall, I think there is still uncertainty there. But, I believe and I have been optimistic and I remain optimistic that the two countries will come to some closure on the trade issues and that we\u2019ll get stability there. And I think we still believe in it. It\u2019s going to be obviously largest economy in the world in the coming decade. And we remain committed. And actually, we\u2019re doing pretty well. If you look at the SP routing business in China, it continues to be stressed like it is around the world. But much of the other portfolio elements we\u2019re very pleased with.","Operator","Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank Securities. You may go ahead.","Vijay Bhagavath","A quick question for you, a bigger picture question actually, Chuck and Kelly as well, which is, as your software subscription attach rate sees strength, could we see the sales OpEx for example start to trend down? Are you already seeing that impact in your sales OpEx line? And then, just a quick tactical question in terms of approximately what is the run-rate of the SP video business you sold to Permira? Because that would help us to inflate your July quarter guidance, if it wasn\u2019t sold so that it helps with this kind business. [Ph] Thank you. ","Chuck Robbins","Let me give some color around how we see the sales model evolving and then I\u2019ll let Kelly answer the financial side of those questions for you. I think, what you\u2019re going to see is that we\u2019re actually building a traditional, I\u2019ll say, a traditional software model where we have a customer success organization that over time will take on more responsibility for all of the functions in the software company, the whole adoption, expansion and particularly the renewal space, which will allow us to renew a lot of these offers over time, it\u2019s a multi-year renewal window. But renewing over time at a much more cost of sale, I would suggest that that may give us either some obviously operating leverage or it may give us the ability to invest in more R&D or other areas. But that\u2019s the model, that\u2019s one of the key reasons that we brought in Maria Martinez, who is now our Chief Customer Experience Officer, who is helping us build out that capability who has a long experience of doing that in several software companies. So, that is one of the major efforts that we have underway right now to not only increase our ability and our rates of renewal but also to do that at a much different cost structure going forward. Kelly?","Kelly Kramer","And just on the SPVSS business. We will -- it is in my guidance right now, because we\u2019re going to obviously -- we continue to run this business until the deal closes. It is majority of what\u2019s in the other bucket, Vijay. So, it\u2019s the bulk of that. But, like we did when we divested the set-top-box business, once we close the transaction, we\u2019ll give you all the history, so we can adjust the models and go forward from there. So, you\u2019ll have complete visibility all the way through the P&L once we close the transaction.","Operator","Thank you. Pierre Ferragu you may ask your question from New Street Research.","Pierre Ferragu","Okay, thanks. So, on the gross margin. So, you still suffer from these DRAM prices. Has it like improved or is that -- has the pressure like increased sequentially compared to last quarter? And then, we\u2019ve had this pricing for some time now in the market. And I was wondering if -- how are you going to reflect that in your pricing strategy and when should we expect you to start passing on these extra cost to your client? And then, lastly, on the gross margin, I assume that you see like increasing very fast the share of software and subscription services in your revenue. So, it should have a positive impact on gross margin. If you can comment on that as well that would be great. Thank you.","Kelly Kramer","Sure. So, I\u2019ll take that. So, first on the memory. So, yes, memory is still hurting us year-over-year. It in my product gross margin it hurt us to the tune of about 60 basis points year-over-year, so more than what we were down year-over-year. It is marginally less bad than it was last quarter, which was marginally less bad than it was a quarter before then. So, the slope of the increases are getting less though it\u2019s still increasing year-over-year. So, it\u2019s about 60 basis points. I would say in terms of pricing, we had another very, very good quarter for price. We always have price erosion, but like you saw last quarter, our price erosion was at the very low end of what we\u2019ve seen over the last three years and that continues. And part of that reason of why that continues is we have been passing on the memory, DRAM cost increases through price increases on our servers like we have been as well as a lot of our peers as well as our product managers in other parts of the portfolio have been really being very disciplined about looking at where we have some price elasticity and have been selectively and surgically looking for areas that we could take advantage of price elasticity. So, I feel really good about where our price index was this quarter, much in line with where it was last quarter.","And then to your third point, on the software being a benefit. That is true, though I will say a portion of that is getting offset, now that we\u2019re ramping the Catalyst 9k so quickly and as you know a portion of that gets deferred because it\u2019s a subscription, that has a negative impact on our rate as well. So, this quarter, it was up 30 basis points alone just for the Cat9K alone, now becoming bigger in the revenue contribution and impact on our rate. So, again, the three things are 60 basis points on memory, 30 basis points on the Cat9K impact, and then we had pretty strong price and some favorable mix coming through from software. The only other last point I will make, we had a very, very strong quarter on our UCS, our server business and that had a little bit of negative mix for us as well.","Operator","Thank you. Paul Silverstein from Cowen & Company, you may go ahead.","Paul Silverstein","Thanks. Guys, against my better judgment, I\u2019m going to ask you wide open question, which is for either or both of you Chuck and Kelly. What are you most excited about in terms of upside opportunity, whether revenue or margin, and what are you most concerned about in terms of downside risk?","Chuck Robbins","So, I\u2019ll start, Paul, and thank you for that the opportunity. Listen, I think that what I am most optimistic about is the renewed innovation that we have brought and will continue to bring in our enterprise portfolio, particularly into our core franchises which was one of the things that when I spoke to many of you when I became CEO three years ago and even when we were on the road last year, I said the number one priority for us right now -- and obviously we\u2019re going to continue the business model evolution, but the number one priority was to get the enterprise portfolio and particularly the switching business stabilized, which our teams have done a great job. And even if you look at the security portfolio with the team and then, I will tell you on the enterprise routing space. Kelly, talked a lot about the overall routing business, but SP routing is about half. And the enterprise routing, I will tell you that our teams have been working hard on the integration with the Viptela acquisition into our enterprise routing portfolio. And I actually feel really good about how that\u2019s coming along and I\u2019m optimistic about where that goes in the future. And I\u2019m very optimistic about the overall innovation within the intent-based networking portfolio that we\u2019re going to bring forward over the next months, quarters and years.","I guess, if I had to say what I would be most concerned about in general, it\u2019s just sort of the macro and\/or some geopolitical risk. I mean, you\u2019ve got -- you\u2019ve obviously got lots of trade discussions, which I remain optimistic on, but as long as there\u2019s uncertainty, then we wait and see. Obviously, the dollar rising while we had a good quarter in emerging countries and we\u2019re pleased with our execution there. The rising dollar obviously is another macro issue. But, I\u2019m very pleased with what the teams are executing on right now. And that\u2019s how I\u2019d leave it. Kelly, any comments? Good.","Operator","Jeff Kvaal from Nomura Securities International, you may go ahead, sir. ","Jeff Kvaal","Yes. Thanks very much. You spoke about your progress in the data center switching side of things. I\u2019m wondering if you could help us understand how things are going in the enterprise data center market and how your relationships are progressing in the web scale data center market -- or just web scale in general would be helpful to us, outside of data center switching. Thank you. ","Chuck Robbins","Thanks, Jeff. So, I\u2019m very happy with what our teams are doing in the data center switching market in general. I think that the 100 gig transition, we\u2019re pleased with, the return to growth in both the data center and the campus from a switching perspective. On the web scale side, I would say the story continues to remain, as I\u2019ve articulated, we continue to make progress. You\u2019ve seen the announcement we made obviously with Google, we continue to work and execute on the details of those solutions that we announced with them. You\u2019ll see more coming out later this year from us there.","We continue to engage deeply with all of these players. We\u2019ve had continued progress with several of them and continued favorable discussions. But, these are -- as I\u2019ve said repeatedly, some of these are multi-year architectural decisions and they take a while. But again, I\u2019m optimistic and pleased with where we are right now. And I think the other thing I\u2019d point out is that this environment that our enterprise customers are facing right now where literally four or five years ago they thought they were going to move to the public cloud and have a much simpler IT world, they now find themselves with three or four public cloud providers that they\u2019re consuming services from. They have 50, 60, a 100 SaaS providers. We\u2019re beginning to see this real explosion of IoT devices at the edge. They still have their private data centers, those have not gone away. You\u2019ve got all of the mobility and customers and suppliers. And so, the network is so fundamental to making all that work. And the web scale providers know that as well, which has really enabled us to build these broad relationships that extend well beyond just the data center. So, we\u2019re still pleased with where we are and we have a long way to go.","Operator","Thank you. George Notter from Jefferies, you may go ahead.","George Notter"," Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I wanted to circle back to a conversation from prior earnings call. You guys had talked about the revenue headwind associated with the move to more subscription oriented models. And Kelly, I\u2019m wondering, if you can give us an update there. Is that still a headwind this quarter and how do you see that progressing going forward? Thanks.","Kelly Kramer","Yes, sure. Thanks. Yes, the headwind is still there because we are very much increasing the number of offers that we have as well as the revenue dollars that we\u2019re putting on the balance sheet. So, the headwind is increasing. And just as we had talked in the past, now that the enterprise portfolio with Cat9K is starting to hit revenue, the headwind is increasing. So, we said in the past, it was 1.5 to 2 points. It definitely now is approaching 2 to 2.5. And as we ramp more and more of the portfolio, we\u2019ll continue to see that.","Operator","Srini Pajjuri from Macquarie Capital, you may go ahead. ","Srini Pajjuri","I guess, my question is on the recurring revenue dipped a little bit to 32%. If you could give some color on that. And also, I think your target long-term is exceeding 37% in fiscal \u201820. Is that primarily a function of Cat9K ramping in volume or the any other products that could contribute to that? And also, I\u2019m wondering if you need to expand the subscription model to other products to achieve that goal?","Kelly Kramer","Yes. So, thanks for the question. So, yes, on the recurring revenue, it\u2019s basically in the rounds. If I look at our product recurring revenue, again, it continues to grow over 30% to over 13% of our total product revenue. And overall, total recurring revenue is again growing in the double digits. So, it\u2019s really the math and a little bit of the mix now that we have product revenue growing so much faster than services, that\u2019s driving kind of just the pure math of around from 33 to 32. But we feel great about how it\u2019s progressing. Yes. If you go to our financial analyst conference, we feel we\u2019re right on track of what we projected as that goes out of fiscal year \u201820. The only caveat I\u2019ll give you on that is when we go into our fiscal year \u201819, we have to adopt the new revenue standard, which will have some implications, some of the products that are included in this. So, we plan to have a call that where we can go through the anticipated area that will be impacted to give you guys more clarity and then we\u2019ll adapt that day one of our fiscal year \u201819. But overall, we feel great about the traction, we\u2019re executing very well and we\u2019re on track if not slightly ahead of what we expected when we talked at financial analyst conference.","Chuck Robbins","Just one last comment on the part of your question what you asked, if we would need to extent this two parts of our portfolio. I mean, we will. If you look at the new enterprise routing, some of the comments I made in my opening was that we\u2019re extending our software and subscription business in the routing space, many of those are software solution. So, we\u2019ll continue to evolve. And frankly, it\u2019s driven by how our customers want to consume the technology, which is great. And as Kelly said, it will create the short-term headwind but we think long-term for the business, it\u2019s absolutely right thing to do.","Operator","James Suva from Citigroup Global Markets, you may go ahead, sir.","James Suva","Thanks. I have a brief question for Chuck, and then Kelly more of a clarification one. But Chuck, there wasn\u2019t any mention yet at least on the Q&A about competitors going into the campus side of things with Arista making an announcement. How do you look at that? I know competition isn\u2019t anything new. But do you need to step-up your sales efforts or how should we think about that. And then, Kelly, for the CFO question. How should we think about -- you\u2019ve got time now to think about the tax law, sort through all the changes. Is your outlook kind of 21% outlook long-term and stock cadence, you did a lot more stock buyback this quarter than normal with your new announcement. How should we think about those financial metrics? Thank you so much.","Chuck Robbins","So, let me hit the first one. Relative to the competition of the campus, what I would say is that look, we launched this architecture last June. And I think our customers have been incredibly excited about it. One of the very important things that we did is we made the architecture and DNA Center backwards compatible with at least one generation of our wireless products, our switching products, our routing products et cetera. And I think that taking a look at all of those products is incredibly important, because our customers don\u2019t want to have an automation platform that handles switching. They want an automation platform that handles the enterprise at a minimum enterprise network, and then overtime as we integrate our automation platform in the datacenter and the campus, you\u2019ll be looking at the ability to automate from the data center to the campus to the wireless network to the routing, and frankly, the security architecture. And we think that is a unique architecture that we can deliver. We are leading right now. We see incredible acceleration of the Cat9K and adoption by our customers. And we\u2019re very comfortable with where we are in this transition.","Kelly Kramer","And on the tax question, so again, we feel really good about where we stand in terms of that. We -- as we said in the call, we brought back $67 billion from overseas. And we -- like we said, in last quarter\u2019s earnings, we announced a big increase to our share buyback authorization. So, we have $25 billion remaining in our share buyback. And we anticipate using that in the next basically 18 to 21 months. So, we\u2019re being very aggressive there, like we had stated we would be once we got our cash back. So, that\u2019s going well. As far as the tax rate, we also stated in Q2 that we expect our tax rate to be in the 21% for fiscal year \u201818 and we expect it to go down to 20% in fiscal year \u201819 when we get the full benefit of the U.S. -- the new U.S. federal rate. So overall we feel great about the tax law and implication for us.","Operator","Mitchell Steves from RBC Capital Markets. You may go ahead sir. ","Mitch Steves","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I actually wanted to circle back a little bit and poke at the recurring revenue piece. I know, it\u2019s 32% and you\u2019re noting that you\u2019ve got a 120 basis points from acquisitions. Can you help me understand what really drove the decline at Q-over-Q from 33 to 32 given that the acquisitions you guys have done have been software in nature.","Kelly Kramer","Yes. I mean, again, I think, basically, the AppDynamics has been in the numbers as we go along. I would say BroadSoft has a mix of both perpetual and recurring. So, it is not all recurring. I would say the bigger impact on the numbers and again, it\u2019s really just the mix of the products. When we have product revenue growing 5%, services growing 3% and within that product we had very, very strong server revenue growth, which has a very low software recurring component of it. That\u2019s what\u2019s really driving it. As I said, overall, the growth of product recurring revenue is over 30%, like it has been for the last five quarters. So that just continues to grow. It\u2019s really more the denominator of total revenue that\u2019s driving just the slight right down to 32.","Operator","Thank you. Tal Liani from Bank of America, you may go ahead. ","Tal Liani","Hi, guys. Security was up 11%, which is an acceleration from previous quarters -- the previous two quarters. Can you talk about what went right and what went wrong with security this quarter? And what are the things that are driving this acceleration? Thanks.","Chuck Robbins","Yes, thanks Tal. So, look, we remain confident in the security architecture that we\u2019ve built even when we had some deviation in the revenue run rate over the last year. And I think that as you look at the architecture that we have, which extends from email to endpoints to the network to the cloud and then has this massive state machine where we can correlate threats and then dynamically defend, it\u2019s a unique proposition and we say that we have this integrated architecture, but also best of bread products. So, where we are convincing customers that the architecture is right, then we\u2019re winning. And I think that our teams are doing a really good job, I think that the engineering teams have continued to add new features and new capabilities that our customers are adopting. And I think it\u2019s as simple as that. It\u2019s just -- we have reasonably good traction in the field right now.","Tal Liani","Can you share with us maybe the areas where you think you need to strengthen your portfolio?","Chuck Robbins","Well, I mean, we have -- the great thing about this architecture when we build it is that you can continue to add virtually any source of threat intelligence to this, because it\u2019s built to digest massive amounts, I mean, we see 20 billion threats every day. So, you can assume that we can add any sort of capability that we like that includes threat sources and frankly the same thing from a defense perspective. So, within the portfolio, I think, there\u2019s always an opportunity for our teams to continue to improve and continue to add features and there\u2019s a lot of good competition in the space, it\u2019s very fragmented, so we just continue to execute against delivering that architecture.","Operator","Thank you. Mark Moskowitz from Barclays Capital, you may go ahead.","Mark Moskowitz","Thank you. Good afternoon. Just one more revenue question for me. Kelly and Chuck, how should we think about the second half of calendar \u201818 relative to your fourth quarter revenue guidance in terms of the 4% to 6% goal post year-over-year? Is there any inflection point with respect to the selling cycle? We\u2019ve heard [indiscernible] some of our checks that it is a slightly longer selling cycle as customers try to understand more, the subscription element, they do become more receptive, could you actually see accelerated revenue growth in the course of just 6% or better as you go into the October, January quarters? Thank you.","Kelly Kramer","Hey, Mark. So, as you guys know, we really do just give guidance one quarter in advance and we feel very good about the guidance we gave of 4% to 6% growth. As we look forward, and just to give you some color context, in the Cat9K, the demand is great. We have fantastic demand, we are taking orders like crazy, and there is great adoption out there by our customers that we don\u2019t see slowing down, so we feel great about that. But again, there\u2019s a lot of moving parts and we\u2019ll take it one quarter at a time. The only other thing I just want to remind you is, we do have when our fiscal year starts in August for \u201819, we do have the tweak on the new revenue standards that will take you through any implications of. So, we feel really good about the Q4 guide and we\u2019re just take it one quarter at a time.","Marilyn Mora","All right. Good.","Chuck Robbins","So I want to just thank everybody for joining us today. We appreciate you spending time with us, appreciate the opportunity to answer your questions. And, Marilyn, I\u2019ll kick it back to you for the details on the next call.","Marilyn Mora","Great. Thanks, Chuck. Cisco\u2019s next quarterly earnings call which will reflect our full year 2018, fourth quarter and annual results will be on Wednesday, August 15th at 1:30 pm Pacific Time, 4:30 pm Eastern Time.

At the request of Cisco Systems today\u2019s call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections you may disconnect.","Now, I\u2019d like to introduce Melissa Selcher, Senior Director, Analyst and Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, you may begin.","Melissa Selcher","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to our 95th quarterly conference call. This is Melissa Selcher, and I\u2019m joined by John Chambers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Frank Calderoni, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Rob Lloyd, President of Development and Sales; and Gary Moore, President and Chief Operating Officer. I would like to remind you that we have corresponding webcast with slides on our website in the Investor Relations section.","Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the Investor Relations website.","As it\u2019s customary in Q1, we have made certain reclassification to prior period amounts to conform to the current periods presentation, the reclassified amount have been posted on our website. Click on the Financial Reporting section of the website to access these documents. Throughout this call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results.","The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements and as such are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on the Form 10-K and any applicable amendments, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise stated.","I will now turn it over to John for his commentary on the quarter.","John Chambers","Thanks, Mel. In Q1 FY \u201814 Cisco delivered record non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.53 per share and revenue growth of 2% year-over-year. This level of revenue growth in Q1, while not inconsistent with some of our large peers was below our expectations for the quarter.","Over the last few quarters, I\u2019ve shared with you what I\u2019ve been seeing, a microenvironment that is inconsistent and very hard to read, with business leaders confidence slowing purchase decisions.","The last month of our quarter was during the U.S. government shutdown. The impact on our federal business was approximately $50 million. Our team there did an exceptional good job managing through this challenging period.","However the shutdown, debt feeling negotiations and delayed key decisions exasperated the lack of confidence among business leaders we had highlighted over the past few quarters. As we walk through our business in detail, you would hear many positives. Our strategy to solve our customers\u2019 biggest technology and biggest business challenges is working. We delivered strong non-GAAP profitability. We are leading most of the major transitions in the market and our innovation engine is faring extremely well.","That said, we are managing through several cycles in our business. First, emerging market weakness; second, the introduction of several new generation platforms in high end switching and routing; and third, our service provider of business evolution. ","Our intermediate long-term strategic view has not changed and we are continuing to lean forward and make investments that would drive our future growth. We are disrupting markets. Look at our Application Centric Infrastructure launch and Internet of Things and our NPS launch in just the last month to drive value to our customers and to our shareholders. ","From where I see it, I believe we are well-positioned at the center as the long-term transitions shift into communications and IT market. We feel the momentum of our thought leadership in this market and we are experiencing our customers\u2019 confidence in Cisco expand as we move to become their trusted business partner and hopefully the number one IT partner.","I know many of you speak with our customers and partners. And I'd be very surprised if you're not seeing and hearing the same thing. For Q1, I want to highlight five key takeaways. First, once again our financials are very strong. In Q1, we delivered record non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.53, non-GAAP operating margins of 29.3% and strong non-GAAP gross margins of 63%. We generated operating cash flow of $2.6 billion and returned approximately $3 billion to our shareholders, through the buyback and dividend. The one obvious exception is our revenue growth. ","Second, our strategy is solid and we\u2019re leading on the critical transitions in the market. I look at cloud as one example. We are the leading cloud infrastructure provider as measured by Synergy Research and our cloud services business, including Webex hosted collaboration, elements of our own security and wireless portfolio are showing good momentum. And last week, we demonstrated how we expect to lead the SCM market, delivering an integrated system that drives to the core of solving our customers\u2019 top challenges. Speed of application delivery, virtualization, OpEx and CapEx reductions, complicity, security and scale in a single architecture. In every case, our ability to pull together the breadth of our portfolio to deliver architectures and solutions to meet customer outcomes that is apart. ","Third, our innovation engine is executing extremely well. We continue to innovate through a build, buy partner strategy and are seeing the benefit. In the last quarter, we introduced game-changing core routing and core switching platform and took a significant step forward in our security business with the acquisition of Sourcefire. With these and other moves, we are uniquely positioned to help our customers navigate the demand of the cloud, mobility, the application economy and the internet of everything. ","These platforms are expected to ramp over several quarters. But perhaps one of the things that I'm most pleased at and this is different than we\u2019ve ever done before on the new product development, high end switching and high end routing. Each of this new product, for example, Nexus 9000 with ACR, CRS-X and NPS are in line with our current margins from day one. Just a really nice job by engineering. ","Fourth, we are managing through some economic, technology and product cycles. From a macroeconomic perspective, in the last two quarters, our order growth rate in emerging countries, which is over 20% of our product business, has gone from a positive 13% in total in Q3 to a negative 12% in Q1 of this year. You can do the math but that\u2019s a drag of between four to five percentage points on our growth for this quarter. ","In service provider, we are managing through product cycles across our portfolio, including high end Core, Edge, and SP video. What you know about Cisco is that when we have focus on something we address it in IT and this is no different. ","Fifth, we have a unique opportunity to be our customers\u2019 number one IT company. Our customers are asking us to step up in new ways to take a broader role in helping them achieve their business outcomes. At our recent CIO meeting with 95 of top global CIOs, they confirmed our leadership position and increased opportunity for Cisco over the next years in their own individual companies. And this was at a much higher level than the other top IP players that we talked about with the CIOs. This is a tremendous validation and is pushing us to move faster to offer our portfolio of technology and architectures, add solutions to address the business outcomes our customers need.","Fortunately for Cisco, no one comes close and been able to meet their requirements and we are moving with speed to evolve, to capitalize on this opportunity. To provide additional detail on our Q1 FY \u201814 results, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Frank. After Frank, I\u2019ll then walk through some additional details and what we\u2019re seeing in the business, Frank will then detail our guidance and will wrap the call up with Q&A. Frank, to you.","Frank Calderoni","Thank you, John. In Q1 FY \u201814, we drove solid profitability despite our lower than expected revenue growth. Our business continues to operate in an inconsistent and mixed macroeconomic environment and we had specific challenges in the emerging markets and service provider.","At the same time, we had relative strength in data center, wireless, security and our switching business. From a top line perspective, total revenue was $12.1 billion growing 2% year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS was $0.53 growing 10% year-to-year.","In this quarter, we continue to execute consistently without portfolio approach to acquisition aligned to driving long-term returns. We announced the WHIPTAIL acquisition to celebrate our UCS strategy. WHIPTAIL is the market leader in high performance, scalable, solid state memory system and we also closed two acquisitions this quarter, Composite Software and Sourcefire.","Sourcefire, a leader in intelligent cybersecurity solutions and brings industry-leading products, talent and an open-source approach to our security portfolio. Composite Software offers data virtualization software and services and will extend our next generation services offering. We also announced our intent to acquire the remaining interest in Insieme Networks as part of our application centric infrastructure-based data center and cloud solution.","Total product from a geographic perspective grew 4% for the Americas, 3% for EMEA and decreased 9% for APJC. The overall product revenue increased 1% and total services revenue increased 4%.","We delivered solid non-GAAP operating margins of 29.3% with consistent results in both gross margins and operating expenses with continued strong discipline in these areas. In Q1, our total non-GAAP gross margin was 63.0%, that compares to 62.7% a year ago and 62.1% last quarter.","We continue to see good stability over multiple quarters and product gross margins, with non-GAAP gross -- product gross margins at 62.0% compared with the 61.5% year ago and 60.8% last quarter. Our non-GAAP services gross margin was 66.6% compared to 67.1% last quarter and 66.9% in Q1 FY \u201813.","Total gross margins by geography where Americas were 63.6%, in EMEA it was 64.4% and APJC was at 58.8%. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.1 billion or 33.7% as a percentage of revenue and this compares to 34.8% in Q1 of FY \u201813.","Our headcount grew less than 100 from the end of the fiscal year to 75,136. This reflects the addition of over 850 employees from the Sourcefire and Composite Software acquisition, offset by our workforce rebalancing that we announced in our Q4 FY \u201813 earnings call.","As I mentioned on that call, the workforce reduction plan provides us the ability to invest in key growth areas such as cloud, data center, mobility, services, software and security to effectively manage our business for the long-term. Other income and expenses with $85 million reflecting a benefit of higher investment gains during the quarter.","Now moving on to our non-GAAP tax provision rate. It was 21% and it was consistent with our expectations. Our non-GAAP net income was $2.9 billion representing an increase of 12%. As a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP net income was 23.7%.","As I mentioned earlier, our non-GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis was $0.53 versus $0.48 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 and again this represents a 10% increase. ","Our GAAP net income was $2.0 billion and GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis was $0.37. GAAP net income included $257 million of pretax charge related to our intended acquisition of Insieme Networks as I previously mentioned. ","As we indicated in our Q4 FY\u201913 call, as part of our workforce reduction plan, we stated that we expected to take pretax charges to our GAAP financial results in an amount not to exceed $550 million. During Q1, we recognized pretax charges to our GAAP financial statements of $237 million related to that announcement.","Our cash returns to shareholders, balance sheet and cash flows were once again areas of strength. During the quarter, we returned $2.9 billion to our shareholders, including $2 billion through the share repurchase and $914 million through our quarterly dividend. ","Our diluted share count decreased slightly as a result of the timing of our share repurchases. The remaining impact of the Q1 repurchase will be reflected in the reduced share count next quarter. As disclosed in our press release today, our board has approved an increase to the repurchase program of $15 billion, demonstrating our commitment to our capital allocation strategy. The remaining approved amount for share repurchases under this program, including the additional authorization, is $16.1 billion. ","Total cash, cash equivalents and the investments were $48.2 billion, including $6.2 billion, which was available in the U.S. at the end of the quarter. We generated solid operating cash flows of $2.6 billion, increasing 7%. ","In terms of our key balance sheet metrics, DSO or days sales outstanding were 39 days and finally, our non-GAAP inventory turns were a strong 12.1. ","In conclusion, we are focused on the near-term challenges. At the same time we are investing in our portfolio of growth initiatives and driving profitability through operational efficiency. We are committed to our capital allocation strategy through the support of the dividend as well as the buyback and our overall objective is to deliver long-term profitable growth and return for our shareholders. ","John, I will now turn the call back over to you.","John Chambers","Thanks, Frank. I will now provide some additional detail on the performance in Q1 and trends we are seeing in our business and in the market. I\u2019ll first walk through our product portfolio in terms of year-over-year revenue growth, followed by discussing geographic and customer segments in terms of year-over-year orders. ","First, our switching business performed well with growth of 3%. Switching gross margins, including new products, continue to be very stable. We have introduced next-generation products across most of the entire portfolio, including the highly anticipated data center switching line in the Nexus family, the Nexus 9000. Developed by our recently acquired spin-in Insieme Networks. The Nexus 9000 began shipping in November and we will ramp over the coming quarters. ","Wireless delivered another solid quarter with gross [ph] revenues of 8% and stronger gross margin. The comparison to 802.11ac is in the beginning stages with support now across our product line. Cisco\u2019s networking platform or Rocky continue to perform very, very well. ","NGN routing revenue was down 1% for the quarter. We saw declines in the quarter as we managed the product transitions in that business. We shipped a new NPS platform to our first customer this quarter and continue to manage the transition of our CRS platform to the CRS-X. ","On the AS -- ASR 9000 had another record revenue quarter with growth constantly about 20%. But our Edge performance was impacted by declines in our traditional products, in both the Core and Edge we are focused on migrating programs that will drive upgrades to the new platforms over the coming quarters. ","We saw decline in our ASR 5000 mobility revenues due primarily to timing of large orders. SP video revenues of $987 million declined 14% year-over-year. As we continue to focus on profitable growth, our set-top box business, which had an annual order rate of over $2.6 billion, declined over 20% as we evolved our business to the cloud and hold to our strategy to walk away from low profit deals. This obviously has a positive impact on margins that comes with some revenue pain.","Let me be very clear, we know that video is one of the top priorities of all of our service provider customers and we are committed to the business. We are evolving our portfolio and have made leadership changes, which will strengthen our ability to meet strategic requirement of our customers and maintain the right business program for Cisco.","Our data center business grew 44%, as customers continue to adopt our unified computing systems. We continue to see success with solutions such as SAP HANA that incorporates our UCS servers. Converged solutions from NetApp, FlexPod and EMC, VMware, Vblock are now each running at over a $1 billion run rate for their total business.","These solutions are fueling our industry-leading strong data center growth across all segments and regions. UCS is one of the best examples of our portfolio of an architectural approach, delivering differentiated value to our customers and driving our market success.","While most of our competitors in this area sell servers, with UCS we saw an architectural approach and in just four years have become the number one in the Blade Server market. UCS sets the foundation for our leadership data center, bringing together compute, networking and storage.","And as you think about where this is going to go in terms of the next-generation driving IT growth, we believe it is around application centric infrastructure, which will build on this success and expand our leadership for the next decade as we simply converge applications, networks and security at scale.","Overall, security revenues grew 8%, with particular strength in network security, up 12%. We closed the Sourcefire acquisition on October 7th and are already seeing the benefits of a focus and the assets we fully acquired.","Security is our customers\u2019 top priority and according to them, we may be the only company capable of providing the full architecture they need to address their security challenges. We\u2019re off to good start and it\u2019s up to us to execute on this architecture.","Moving on to collaboration. Revenue was up 1%, as our strategy and execution continues to evolve. Unified communication revenue declined by 3% year-over-year, as we move to a different revenue model in the business, increasing the amount of business which is reoccurring.","Conferencing revenue grew 12% and Telepresence revenue grew 1%. Finally services revenue grew 4%. The technical services were up 4% and advanced services up 5%. Non-GAAP gross margins and services were very solid at 66.6%, down slightly from 66.9% a year ago.","As we discussed last quarter, service revenues are tied closely to product growth. We were very pleased with gross margin and the technical services growth given the challenging services market. We do believe there is further opportunity to improve our advanced services performance, as we move from transaction to driving our customers top business opportunity and the results they want to get in terms of outcomes.","I will now move on to provide some color on our geographic and customer segments. The following geographic and customer segment growth rates are in terms of year-over-year product orders for Q1, unless specifically stated otherwise.","In Q1, we saw growth, momentum and opportunity in global enterprise and commercial. U.S. enterprise and commercial were both very, very strong, growing in the high single digits in terms of year-over-year orders.","U.S. public sector actually grew 2%. However, the positive growth trends in orders were more than offset by the two factors mentioned earlier. Emerging Markets orders declined 12% and service provider orders declined 13%. As a result, total product orders declined 4% year-over-year with total product book-to-bill of less than one.","We did see the weakness increased conservatism and slower decision-making on a global basis accelerate beyond our expectations, due to back end of the quarter. In our leadership reviews in mid-September, we believe our orders in the quarter would translate to revenue in our guidance range.","To provide a geographic view of orders this quarter, the Americas declined 2%. In the U.S. in addition to the good enterprise and commercial momentum, we delivered U.S public sector growth of 2%, led by state, local and education up 13% and U.S. Federal down 3%. Service provider in the U.S. declined by 10%. The issues in the U.S. were similar to what we see globally in SP and I will expand on this in a discussion of SP segment.","Moving on to Asia-Pacific, Japan and China, similar to last quarter, we again experienced the same challenge as many our peers. Overall, Asia-Pacific, Japan and China was down 10%. China continued to decline as we and our peers worked through the challenging political dynamics in that country.","The Europe, Middle East, Africa and Russia region declined 4%, due primarily to the effect of the emerging markets public sector and SP. Central Europe continued to show positive growth. Southern Europe continues to be challenging. Europe, while there are positive trends remain challenging as seen in the recent ECB interest rate reduction announced last week. This action should help [indiscernible] economic recovery over time. ","Across every geography, the impact of emerging market weakness was pronounced and accelerated to the backend of the quarter. Our top five emerging markets declined 21% with Brazil down 25%, Mexico down 18%, India down 18%, China down 18% and Russia down 30%. As we always had, we will continue to focus on emerging markets, investing through the challenges and expect to see return to growth in few quarters with all the appropriate caveats. ","Moving on to the segment review. As mentioned earlier, enterprise grew 2% and commercial grew 1%. Public sector declined 1%. Service providers declined 13%. As a reminder, the service provider business continues to be lumpy and go in cycles, and our service provider growth rate is negatively impacted by the deliberate actions we are taking to manage the profitability of our set top boxes. ","As we discussed before, the set top box orders which are approximately 20% of our total service provider business -- product service provider business was also down 20%. That means the service provider segment started the quarter down minus 4% to 5%, due to net decrease in set-top boxes. ","Several factors negatively impacted the growth in addition to set-top box impact. First, we operate globally, the emerging markets challenge have some impact on the SP bookings. Second, we introduced two new platforms, NCS and CRS-X and the Core and are seeing slower growth than anticipated, customers to continue invest in the existing platforms and adopt these new platforms. As a reminder, NCS, like ACI on the switching side is an entirely new architecture requiring an additional time and test and evaluation. ","And third, we lost some share on the low-end Edge which we need to win back. As you would expect, we have focused our leadership on what we can control to reaccelerate service provider growth despite the challenging macro over the next several quarters. We are focused on pulling together the breadth of our portfolio and innovation to solve our customers\u2019 top business opportunities, just as we've done very effectively in enterprise over the last 12 to 15 months and we clearly saw the results in enterprise in doing that. ","We are managing the evolution of our portfolio and aggressively moving to meet service provider requirements for greater virtualization of services across our mobile and wireline platforms. We are planning our resources to the opportunities for greatest growth. We are seeing very good customer traction in our new Core platforms, with active trials in many SP customers and moving from trial to production. I believe our global service provider stage is solid [ph] and we are unique in our ability to add service provider customer challenges with architectural solutions that deliver their business outcomes. We will continue to focus on the innovation and execution to drive the acceleration of the business. Managing through product and market cycles is part of being a leader in the technology industry. We feel very confident in our ability to work through these cycles over the coming quarters. ","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Frank for guidance. Frank to you?","Frank Calderoni","Thank, John. Let me now provide a few comments on our outlook for the second quarter. Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements and you should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statement. And that actual results could be above or below our guidance. ","The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with a reconciliation to GAAP. As we look to Q2 FY\u201914, we do not anticipate material improvement in our order growth. This is impacting our revenue guidance for Q2. Given our orders performance in Q1, our backlog is significantly lower than we anticipated. As a point reference, approximately 70% of our product revenue is dependent on new orders each quarter. ","With that in mind, we expect total revenue to decline in the range of 8% to 10% on a year-over-year basis. For the second quarter we anticipate non-GAAP product gross margin \u2013 non-GAAP margin to be in the range of 61% to 62%. Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q2 is expected to be in the range of 27.5% to 28.5%. Our non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be approximately 21% in the second quarter.","Our Q2 FY \u201814, non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.45 to $0.47 per share. Given the guidance for Q2 \u201814 and the shift in momentum in our business, we thought it would be helpful to provide investors and share more detail on the full year of the fiscal year.","We expect our FY \u201814 non-GAAP earnings per share to range from a $1.95 to $2.05. Within this, we suggest you model revenue conservatively. We have a strong handle on our gross margins, operating expenses and cash flow and we believe we can deliver this level of profitability even in an uncertain growth environment.","We are not changing our long-term financial model. We continually revaluate our long-term model as you would expect as the market changes. We will update you at our Financial Analyst Conference in December, if we see the need for any adjustments. We remain focused on driving profits faster than revenue.","We anticipate our GAAP earnings to be lower than our non-GAAP EPS by $0.10 to $0.14 per share in Q2 and $0.45 to $0.60 for the full year. This range includes an impact of approximately $100 million in Q2 \u201814 and $550 million for the full year, as a result of our anticipated restructuring charges related to our workforce reduction plan that we announced last quarter. Please see the slides that accompany this webcast for more detail.","Other than those quantified items noted previously, there are no other significant differences between our GAAP and our non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructurings and tax or other events which may or may not be significant. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.","I thank you and turn it back over to John.","John Chambers","Frank, thank you very much. There is no doubt that the pace have changed that we all feel and see is only accelerating. As I have been saying throughout this calendar year, things that used to occur in five years are happening in three. Things that used to happen in two to four quarters are occurring in one quarter. This is a new market reality.","Let me be very clear, change has always been good for Cisco. We used these times to get closer to our customers, transform our business and drive new opportunities. I speak with many of you, our shareholders during the year and appreciate the investment you are making and understanding our business, including attending our launches and events, as many of you did in New York last week.","I note from those meetings that you understand our strategy and where we can take this company. I also know that while we see these transitions as opportunities, these transitions can create unwelcome quarter-to-quarter volatility and can be frustrating for long-term shareholders.","As we have always done, we\u2019ll commit to you to be transparent, letting you, our shareholders see the challenges and the opportunities as we see them. We remain very confident in our long-term strategy and are committed to managing the business to ensure we drive the greatest long-term value for our customers, employees, partners and shareholders.","What can you expect as we address the opportunities, cycles and challenges in our business and the market over the next several quarters? First, I realized many of you spend a lot of time speaking with our customers and channel partners. As you know, our relationship with the customers has never being stronger. We are winning and they know it. They have asked us to play a bigger role in partnering with them to drive their business outcomes. We will continue to move quickly to capitalize on the opportunities they have presented to us.","Second, we will continue to manage the business with focus on discipline, where we have challenges and cycles we will move swiftly and decisively to drive growth and continue leadership.","Third, we will maintain our momentum on Cisco\u2019s innovation model of build, buy and partner. We planned to leverage our acquisition of Sourcefire to achieve our goal to become the number one security company and drive new product platforms and architectures like CRS-X, NCS and ACI to build multi-billion dollar business at Cisco.","Let\u2019s discuss a bit deeper the application centric infrastructure launched last week. When we look back five years from now, I believe we will see ACI as a pivotal point in redefining IT. We were very pleased with the response to the launch but we were not surprised. We designed the system in ACI that would address the most pressing needs of our best global customer base, companies, government and service providers of all size. ","A ecosystem as the major technology companies, our peers and competitors have publicly stated how strategic they believe the platform will be in their future priority and major cloud enterprise and commercial customers has chosen the ACI architecture to run their business. This is Cisco at is best. We delivered innovation on an entirely different scale than our competitors. A system that would drive revenue and productivity, reduce costs and mitigate risk, protecting their existing investment and future proof, and this is the first time I have ever used that word, future proof their solutions going forward. ","To quote some of you, ACI is a game changer and a significant step in the realization of the Internet of Everything. The two will move closer together, both the Internet of Everything and Application Centric Infrastructure and move faster than many people anticipate. And Cisco will be there to lead.","First, we will continue to increase our commitment to you, our shareholders. As you can see from the announcement today, our board has granted a new share repurchase authorization of $15 billion, which we intend to put to work. You should expect that over the next several quarters, we will exceed commitment to returning at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders, just as we did this past quarter. ","In summary, I want to thank our shareholders, customers and partners for their support, especially those customers and partners that were integral to our success for the launch of ACI. In particular, I want to thank the Cisco family for working together as a team to ensure that our company is in a solid position to capture the opportunities we see in front of us. Let me turn it back to you, Mel.","Melissa Selcher","Thanks, John. I wanted to clarify one comment John made during his product statement. We are not quite yet number one in blade server market. We are number two in that blade server market. ","All right. We'll now open the floor to Q&A. We still request that sell side analysts please ask only one question. Operator please open the floor to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","Thank you. And our first question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi guys. Your guidance is very low if I got the numbers right, it\u2019s about 11% sequentially \u2013 11% down sequentially for revenue. Then I went back to 2000 -- October 2000 and I've never seen such a low number outside of 2008 or 2009, I am looking at it January 2009, and at that time the world was about to collapse, January 2009. That\u2019s when all the problems hit the financial system. And I am wondering why are you guiding so low for next quarter? It looks like the environment may continue to be weak but it's not as bad as it was in \u201809 and certainly not as bad as it was in October 2000 etc. So what are the components of the weakness for the next quarter?","John Chambers","Okay. Let me do both. Let me talk about the component of the weakness and the areas we feel the strongest, so on. There are no comparisons in a measured way to 2009 or 2001. You basically look at our business and let me answer that very crisply [ph], because I know it\u2019s a thought on many people's minds given what we\u2019ve just guided to. The U.S. enterprise and commercial, which are the areas that I watch for a long term U.S. economic growth, both are in high single digits. And we feel pretty good about their pipeline going forward. ","Our federal team executed well in a tough environment, so our state and local government and federal government is solid. Service provider, we need to make improvement on and we have a multiple step approach to how we are going to do that in terms of direction. You look around the world, the emerging markets, I have never seen that fast a move in emerging markets and that is something that when I talk with our industry peers, while there are exceptions, most of my CEO counterparts can almost finish my sentence in terms of what's occurring. It's also occurring with many of our customers where if you were to talk about Brazil as an example, they can finish each other's comments to CIOs about their business whether it\u2019s the consumer business or whether it's the manufacturing segment in terms of the direction. ","We're very comfortable with our leadership and our share of spin gains in the marketplace. We do have to work in three areas. In terms of the focus on the emerging marketplaces, we are modeling for a challenging next couple of quarters. We believe that more than half the world\u2019s GDP occurs there. But we\u2019ve put in place a plan over a year ago that we will learn to continue to drive through the slowdown. Part of the reason, Gary, when we laid off people was to free up resources to move to emerging markets and you will see us increase our sales headcount in the appropriate emerging markets as we go forward to capitalize on that.","We will literally expand focus on a countrywide prioritization and if you watch what we did in Israel, which is clearly a developed country, we will do that across other emerging markets.","We will expand the executive contact and there will always be some unique situations where Cisco needs to execute well in one of our top 15 countries or there is unique issue like exist in China, that\u2019s just part of what emerging markets go.","The service provider focus, we\u2019re in the middle of product transition, when product transitions occur at the CRS-X and NCS level, you begin to see a hesitation on how much the customers buy the current products.","Rob, your sales team and Chuck\u2019s sales team have gone through and walked through where we are in that, but there\u2019s a natural kind of hesitation given uncertainty in the market and uncertainty business leaders about how fast they will move through these new platforms and how much they will continue to expand, which overtime they absolutely will the existing platforms in terms of the direction.","Set-top box, we\u2019re going to take a 4% to 5% hit for a number of quarters in the future. What we\u2019re going to do on that, however, is continue to accelerate the movement to the cloud which has much higher gross margins.","We made some leadership changes, as I said there earlier and we\u2019re also going to work on really value-add engineering, Gary, which I think your supply team has done an amazing job, so that we can look on more deals that would have better profits as we move forward.","We are not going to change the organization structures that we have. We are organized in business entities to expand but we are going to change in terms of having a couple key leaders go across the whole company just like we did in enterprise where Chuck Robbins and Rob Soderberry with myself and [indiscernible] helped them to prioritize resources throughout that segment of the market and we will apply the resources to where areas that we had not moved as much resources, especially since now, we have done a good job at the high end core to other segments.","That\u2019s kind of a summary of the position, Tal. What happened was we were $600 million to $700 million short of what we expected orders to be in this last quarter. It was almost all backend loaded and literally down to the last two weeks, we were disappointed by multiple hundreds of millions in terms of what we normally closed in the last couple of weeks.","You have that shortfall not being in backlog going into next quarter and when you look at your sequentials, Tal, you have to go off of this new number as you look going for it. You add the two together that\u2019s a $1.2 billion challenge. Frank, would you add to that?","Frank Calderoni","No. I think you covered it, John. I mean, it includes the key things what you said, material shortfall and orders in the back half of Q1 and specifically as we saw in October. This immediately hits not only affected our Q1 performance with the revenue being shorter than what we had provided in our guidance. So you are looking at the mid range of our guidance but it also ended up with a significant shortfall in the backlog at the end of Q1 and that affects the business opportunity that we have going into Q2.","And then overall if you look at the business momentum now in Q2, specifically in emerging markets and service provider as you articulated earlier, those businesses as well the most challenged in Q2, when you look at that offset by the related impact that we have with the services business that ties to that as well that results in the guidance that we provided.","Melissa Selcher","Yeah. Thanks, Tal. Next question, operator.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays.","Ben Reitzes - Barclays","Hey. Good afternoon.","John Chambers","Hi, Ben.","Ben Reitzes - Barclays","Thank you. Hi. Couple of things that you didn\u2019t mention but I was wondering in emerging markets especially there\u2019s been a lot of concern out there about the NSA snooping and the impact that\u2019s had on global IT and global IT brands like yourself? And you maybe alluded to this with regard to your comments on China and the political situation? But I noticed Russia was perhaps down even more than China and what not?","Do you feel that there\u2019s something more going on, this -- we\u2019re all floored by your guidance here? But is there something a little more to this that with customers outside of the U.S. thinking a little bit more about U.S. IT brands and is that impacting your business and if so or if not, then what do you do in the future? Thanks a lot, John.","John Chambers","Sure. Ben, I think, if you look at it, it is an impact in China. I think we\u2019re all aware of that. I think it\u2019s totally impact on the total emerging country business, however, is fairly nominal.","I do think we are seeing a slowdown in these emerging markets both in the decision making and their economies. And so I do not think it is a major factor across all of emerging. I do think it is a factor however in China. Rob, would you add anything to that?","Rob Lloyd","I would just add, John, that this issue has caused increasingly customers to pause and another issue for them to evaluate, in all of those complexities that you've already discussed. So it's not having material impact but it's certainly causing people to stop and then rethink decisions and that is I think reflected in our results.","Frank Calderoni","I think then what you articulate and we're trying to do too, the amount of inconsistent data is just causing customers to hesitate including at the country level.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs & Co.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, thanks very much. So it sounds like one of the issues you're dealing with is the transition on the routing side of the business and obviously you just introduced some fairly large platforms on the switching side, which is even larger than your routing business. Would you expect to see a similar top haul [ph] basically in the switching business in the next couple of quarters as you work through that?","John Chambers ","That's what we have modeled into it. It won't be a haul, but the growth will not be what we would normally experience. Once again, the sales teams have set up our products by individual areas, but you combine with just a very slow spending environment. Simona, let me back for a second. When I talked to CIOs on the issues of Business Council, as an example. Half the CEOs that they surveyed, Chief Executive Officer they surveyed believed the economy is going to grow between 0% and 2%. They are modeling their budgets conservatively and as they think through this the CIOs will hesitate as they have product choices, doesn't mean they won't continue to buy our Core 7000s and other products, they will but they are going to strike a balance of what do they want to do in terms of the mix and as they commit through. So, yes, we had modeled this in Q2 and Q3. ","And yes, to the indirect part of your question, as you come into Q4 and come up to Q1 of next year with all the appropriate caveats because of where we are on product cycles, where we are in terms of what we're going to double down on in some of the things that we need to address, my goal for our company is to get back to positive revenue growth in Q1 and ideally in Q4. But that's a stretch goal with all the appropriate caveats associated with it. So, you will have product cycles working towards that. You will have our momentum in the market working to it and I think that is kind of what our expectations are. You saw Frank's bookends on the earnings. We did it deliberately so that you could understand the areas that we are operating in, Simona.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS Securities.","Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS","I was just trying to understand your guidance again in the context of your deferred revenue growth. I mean, it seems like you got pretty strong growth both sequentially and year-over-year in product revenue growth \u2013 product deferred revenue growth. So just want to understand again, I'm really perplexed by the guidance here. I understand some of the pain points you identified, but maybe if you could just shed some light there.","Frank Calderoni ","So, if you look at the deferred revenue, Amitabh, the deferred revenue was up around 11%. If you look at underneath what that is, that shows a lot of the business that we have on collaboration side, which is moving to more of the recurring. So we have more deferral associated with some of the offerings that we have there. That's a majority of where that is. So that\u2019s the good news from the perspective, it starts to show some of the momentum that we have in the collaboration businesses, is one of the businesses John mentioned earlier that we have been really investing in on the product portfolio over the past year and we're looking at this product set over longer period of time and also looking at some of the model that our customers are looking to purchase. And some of that is going to be more of a recurring revenue model which is kind of improving the deferred revenue.","John Chambers ","An example on that, Amitabh, would be security and with the movements on Sourcefire. It was an area that really began to take hold this quarter. I think our customers realize we are very serious about moving to be the number one security player. You will see us expanding consultancy in this area, and as we did that, even our network security grew 12% which had not grown as you all know for a very long time. But in the security, if you look at this next year's reported, we'll report \u2013 Mel, I want to make sure we deliver on the commitments. We will report a booking growth and revenue growth. And it would not surprise me in these areas to see booking growth in the low 20s and revenue growth in the low \u2013 in 10%, 11%, 12% because of the conversion to future deferred revenues and licensing. ","So we are moving as fast as we can because Gary is kind of hunting this model for us, it is a juggling act in terms of how do we move to recurring revenues to more applications, so that more and more of our business is a given each quarter and we can be more where most of our peers are, where they get the majority of their business already done before they enter a quarter. But it takes you a while to get there and that is also built into our factors, Amitabh.","Frank Calderoni ","And the number I gave, that's 11% year-on-year for product and then the services was up about 2%, total deferred revenue up about 5%.","Melissa Selcher","Thanks, Amitabh. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.","Kulbinder Garcha - Credit Suisse","The question, I just want to clarify on the guidance again and this is for John and Frank, I think. It sounds like, I understand the set-top box issues and how that\u2019s impacting revenue growth. I understand the emerging market and macro issue in China is more than just a macros issue it sounds like. So I\u2019m curious John how you fix that, it seems that\u2019s a very complicated, highly political subject then?","And on the service provider side, did the actual product transition impact on your revenues or did it actually surprise you, I would have thought you would have known about that going into this period of time? Thanks.","John Chambers","Okay. So in reverse order, a series of questions but I think all very fair. I understand the way that we do our revenue and booking forecast is, we have a very good sales team and they roll up the forecast and we do it by regions and by countries and by products. We then based upon that forecast determine what our revenue guidance is for a quarter.","Now, they take into consideration what they see in the product pipeline, what percentage of the pipeline they expect to fill out very, very detailed approach to it. The field, of course, however, almost never get sale burst, up or down.","And the pace of change that you\u2019re really seeing in this, Kulbinder is that, it\u2019s almost what occurs in a quarter just a year ago will now be two or three quarters worth and it was almost, if you were to a pick a quarter, you didn\u2019t want to end up here, it was in early October this year doing the uncertainties in terms of the balance on that.","But no, in terms of the product transitions just 120 days ago when we reported the last quarter, none of us anticipated the change in Washington, the uncertainties, the business confidence that would occur from this and I\u2019m not making excuses, this is what the customers are telling us.","And in terms of their going into next year, their expectations are down for the year, their budgets are down for the year, they are not taking as much risk. Now the good news is this can turnaround just as quickly as it slows.","But in terms of the overall approach there were positives and there were negatives in the groups and it was a quarter of very inconsistent data, much like we articulated that our customers see in terms of the economics and other issues.","Melissa Selcher","Okay. Thanks Kulbinder. Operator, next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank","Hi. Hi, John.","John Chambers","Hey, Brian.","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank","Couple of questions for you, first, can you just run down on switching in terms of how you see that capital versus data center switching how you see both of those doing over the next couple of quarters?","And then with regard to your guidance you do talk about gross margin still being kind of in the 60%, 62% range even with revenues down like this just mix, lower set-top box sales or is it something else with regard to what you are doing to manage the margins in that range? Thanks.","John Chambers","Sure. So a number of questions and I want the first one and I\u2019m going to ask the gross margin question. Gary, we have done very good job on gross margins. We are focusing on that across the Board. Our guidance has been very consistent 61%, 62% gross margins for a long time, Frank. And we don\u2019t see things material in the market that that cause us uncomfortable with that.","We have done a very good job of value engineering, a very good job of modeling this path, a very good job of designing our new products and it might have slipped by some people, when we say we design then for the current gross margin level, we\u2019ve never been able to do that before and we did that following some of our experiences back in 2011 and 2009.","So, we learn, we do it different in terms of the direction. We are continuing to anticipate set-top boxes falling and that is built into our next several quarter phenomena. Now I missed the first part of the question, I apologize.","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank","It was switching mix?","John Chambers","Oh! Switching, Mel, won\u2019t let me talk about a specific quarter in terms of the guidance. So let me fast forward to summer this next year. Summer this next year we will have the best switching architectures in the industry by ourselves. We basically would take all of the advantages, merchant silicon and custom silicon and put them together.","We will bring the promises of SDN to life literally in an open and simplistic way. It won\u2019t be slideware. This will be complete production and it will literally accomplish the separation of applications from the infrastructure with a common policy.","So if you looked across all of our switching lines for the Nexus in 5000, 7000, you begin to look in terms of what we\u2019re doing with the 9000 within semi and you begin to look at Rob Soderbery\u2019s product group, which I think he\u2019s completely refreshed Rob Lloyd, if I remember right.","Our switching portfolio is the strongest it\u2019s ever been in the marketplace and looks really solid. To the indirect part of your question, on the routing side we feel equally as good. I like where we are with the high-end products. And remember, NCS is an architecture. It's kind of the nervous system of making all this work. And with the CRS-X, it has the new capabilities that the same chip designs, et cetera we put on NCS. So high-end, we're never going to let that get taken away from us again. It happened 10 years ago, never going to let it happen. But now we need to move the resources to be able to address the access level, where it\u2019s an area at the low end we have to do better than couple of our competitors are doing well. ","At the high-end VPN capability, ASR 9000 actually is growing comfortably over 20%. But as other legacy products we have to do better. So in terms of product portfolio, it really looks good. Our ability to bring them together looks good. We got to I think pick up our game in a couple of areas in service provider to think of solution selling as opposed to box-type of selling and that we are going to have Pankaj Patel, who is our Head of Engineering and Nick Adamo, who is the Head of the Americas two together with myself and Pankaj flying cover for them to be able to address this. ","And when we started on this on enterprise, Gary, a year ago, enterprise at this time did not really have the pieces together, because the business entities are great on products but not combining them and you combine that with, Gary and as to our services you can certainly provide a solution service provider the same way. I have run this strategy off of several of the top CEOs in the country and in the world on the service provider side, they will buy into it if we can execute.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein, Cowen.","Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co.","John, I apologize, I know this question has been asked ten ways till Sunday. But I am trying to parse -- ","John Chambers ","Okay. We knew it would be asked again.","Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co.","In trying to parse out your commentary about emerging market, service provider is a general proposition in terms of as being the bulk of the weakness. In your commentary from a timing standpoint regarding the last two weeks of the quarter, two questions here. One, I know \u2013 assuming what you saw in the last two weeks of the quarter has extended into the first two weeks of November; and secondly, can you give some additional color on top of what you have already said in terms of those two different issues that collapsed in the last two weeks, the very recent Vantage collapse and the more generic commentary about emerging markets and service provider?","John Chambers ","So the first two weeks of the new quarter are not really indicative of where you go. But the last two weeks of last quarter was really tough. So, no it did not carry over in that type of format. I think you deserve a fair answer to that. Not deserve. We want to be very transparent on it and I think it's the right way to answer your question in terms of the direction. The second part of the question was --","Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co.","Mainly around the last two weeks of the collapse and I don't think you characterized it as a collapse. It was more around the last month being slower and normally we pick it up and we didn't.","John Chambers ","Yes, Paul, if you look at it, just using Q4 as an example, we went into the last month a little bit off the numbers we expected. The forecast came down and the last two weeks of the quarter, they actually came up $300 million over their forecast. That did not happen. This sales team is really good and so, the fact that we missed it that much in the last month and that much during the last two weeks, we clearly factored in assuming that we're going to continue to see challenges in this quarter and the next quarter. So we did build that in. Hopefully, it'll be conservative, but we always believe when you see trends on this broader basis, especially in the emerging, you have to adjust to it and say it'll last for a couple of quarters.","What we saw in emerging was very consistent across the board. Every one of our top 10 emerging countries missed their forecast and was off by a fair amount. So it wasn't just that it was down, the last couple of weeks, they kept dropping and dropping. I think, Rob, if I remember right, it was over half of our shortfall, the last couple of weeks versus forecast.","Rob Lloyd","Yes, it was John, and our top five emerging countries all had negative performance in the quarter between \u2013 I think it was a low of 18% to a high of 30% down. So it was -- those are the big ones that really contribute to the numbers and it was consistent across all of those major countries.","John Chambers ","I would rather there have been a couple of countries, Paul, because then you can say let's go fix them, and there are always a couple of countries that we'll either have issues on, some we create ourselves, some of them are done to us, some of them are way beyond our control. But the consistency of that number is what concerned me. And we usually unfortunately see things couple of quarters ahead of our peers. This time we were little bit surprised. We saw the softening in Q4 and we were very upfront with it to every one about what happened in our top five emerging countries in Q4 where we said they went from 13% growth the quarter before to flat in Q4. The other 15 countries continue to grow in low teens. This time all of them came down and so out of our top 10, it was pretty brutal on that.","The fact that a player like IBM saw -- too has probably 60% of their business given in the quarter and saw that this extreme indicates what we think is going to be more of an industry phenomenon, not affecting everyone but currently affecting lot of people.","Melissa Selcher","Thank you, Operator. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you. Frank, just a quick one, does the guidance include Sourcefire and -- a question for you, John. If I think about Cisco as a company has a lot of product, a lot of regional breadth and your portfolio approach typically gets you balanced, so if one region or segment underperforms, that\u2019s usually offset by some -- another region or segment that is outperforming.","So we\u2019re not getting that historic offset and instead we\u2019re getting this deterioration. So just wondering if you feel that this is maybe a structural change to the switching and routing in data networking market. And it does sound as if it will take several quarters at least to refill the drained backlog, was there some consideration to reset your 5 to 7 long-term top line growth rate and should we also plan for some more OpEx cuts as you protect your earnings?","John Chambers","I\u2019m going to have Frank comment about overall view on OpEx. I\u2019m going to address first the structural change. It\u2019s actually reverse. If you watch what we\u2019re doing, the architectures take time to sell, our customers buy into it. Mark, if you had been at the CIO conference and I encourage you to go watch it, now it\u2019s up on the website. In that, we had 95 of the top CIOs around the world in the session. We asked them about every major high-tech player. Now, we delivered into their hands because that would\u2019ve been fair. But we asked them where they were out of the whole room and it shocked me because I knew it was a couple critics.","When I asked them how many of you are going to be more committed to Cisco and we\u2019re going to be your key partner, more of a key partner, year from now than you were a year ago. The whole room raised their hand and I walked out to the audience and a couple of people asked and they said, John, we\u2019re a believer and when we asked about other IT players on that, no one more than 10 raise their hand on any of the other top six IT players in terms of that type of commitment.","Mark, what that says is we got our vision and strategy right. We mailed it, they know we mailed it and they said now let\u2019s see you execute and then they said by the way, security would be one you ought to go after much more aggressively because we can\u2019t solve on it and it\u2019s our top issue in terms of the direction. So the structural change, the answer is no.","We got it right in terms of the products. Our customers know they actually saw from the ACI launch. Look at the ecosystem that was up there with us. I mean it was commanding. It was powerful. Look at the customers out there with us. When you have the top cloud players from Europe, they are already on the stage with you and talking about why they are committed to this architecture, when you have players such as EMC and NetApp there in terms of -- here they see the opportunity.","You have a Microsoft nearly sit on stage and if you watch that for 5 minutes, it was probably the most articulate view of where they see the industry going and why they are going to align with this on ACI from Satya who is one of the top players there and he gets it.","So no, it\u2019s not a structural issue. We do however any structure that you have in the engineering has strength and limitations. And so when you\u2019re focused on product and we have done amazing job, Gary, on the product verticals that\u2019s a very effective structure you have. We now need to leverage across it to combine these and be able to move resources around to where either our opportunities are or our exposures.","And so when you finish in high-end routing and you\u2019ve done extremely well and you\u2019ve got your leadership, how do you align resources quickly, they say, let\u2019s go to very low end access. And this is very unique and this is why we\u2019re putting two of our best on it. By the way, those are the same two who did this 3.5 years ago. They got our leadership and service provider to be able to save work across the group, combine it with services and combine it in terms of go-to market. In terms of 5% to 7%, you would be disappointed and shocked in us. If after just a quarter and a cycle here with emerging markets and something that service provided that we can and will crack if we suddenly say, we\u2019re going to change things.","We will listen very carefully. We will provide more guidance in December but in terms of winning, we\u2019re winning big and you all know this. You talked to customers, you all go to channels. We had some issues that we can do better. We\u2019re going to address that but you have issues in terms of the emerging markets which are largely in our opinion macro driven and we will power through that. We're going to do exactly what we did before during slowdown, other people will pull back. We will put more resources in, we'll come out of it stronger and larger market shares. You never say, no pressure, because I know Frank would get me, but we have no abnormal pressure on gross margins. Gary, what the team is doing across the board on that, the execution is world class. Even our low-margin stuff, we continue to do value engineering on it and the direction. ","The reason I'm going on a little bit longer is we have all the pieces here. Barring a huge surprise we're going to be the number one IT player and none of our customers say, you haven't got a shot at it. They say you got to execute, but if you watch none of our players are aligned with that, and none of the other players are able to look you all in the eye and say on gross margins we aren\u2019t facing major pressures. We have done extremely well there. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a structural issue on it, I think it's really the three issues we talked. New product transitions which by the way we are not going to ever get behind again at the high end. I have done that once, that is painful and it took us four or five years to get it back. We are now at the high end switching, nobody matches what Insieme does on this. ","High end routing, nobody can touch what we did in terms of the routing, the throughput, the download, the whole NetFlix library in one second across your technology. So I feel very comfortable with where we are and very comfortable on it. We will always be transparent. We promised you all when we see something we'll tell out exactly like it is even if it is painful and I'll ask you again today you want to be sure you want to but this is what we are seeing. Hopefully we're being conservative and Frank to the question I think it was on expenses.","Frank Calderoni ","There were two questions. One, Mark asked if Sourcefire is included in the guidance and the answer is yes. And secondly, as far as looking at, you were asking about op expense and restructuring. We talked last quarter about the portfolio that we were carrying into FY\u201914 making the adjustments to ensure that we're making the investments and being able to afford the acquisitions that we did like Sourcefire, like Composite Software to make sure that we are emphasizing areas in the portfolio [indiscernible] growth opportunities like security, like mobility, like cloud, like services. And we put plans in place to be able to do that. ","We feel right now we've got to continue to execute to that. We do have more just continuing on what we announced on the restructuring, we did some this past quarter, with some another quarter, outside the United States which was part of the plan. And then the other important thing is to make sure that as we go through the fiscal year, that we continue to make sure that we follow through on those investments both the acquisitions as well as the internal investments. So that we can see the ability for a long term growth.","John Chambers ","Mel, I know we ran a little bit over versus our goal being through about 2.30, but thank you for that [ph]. Let me turn it back to you.","Melissa Selcher","Yes, absolutely. Thanks John. Cisco's next quarterly call, which will reflect our FY\u201914 second quarter results will be on Wednesday, February 12, 2014 at 1.30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4.30 p.m. Eastern Time. Again, I would like to remind you that in light of Regulation FD, Cisco plans to retain its longstanding policy to not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it's done through an explicit public disclosure.

At the request of Cisco Systems, today's call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections you may disconnect. Now I'd like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Kim. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's second quarter fiscal 2018 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO and Kelly Kramer, our CFO.","By now you should have seen our earnings press release, a corresponding webcast with slides including supplemental information will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the financial information section of our Investor Relations website.","Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic, and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise.","All comparisons throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter of fiscal 2018. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.","With that I'll now turn it over to Chuck.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thank you, Marilyn, and good afternoon everyone. We had a great quarter. In Q2, we returned to revenue growth. We continued to drive momentum in our intent-based networking portfolio and saw strength across the business. We made continued progress in shifting more of our business towards software and subscriptions. This performance led to strong margins, solid cash flow, and double digit non-GAAP EPS growth. We are clearly seeing the results of the strategy we've articulated to you over the last ten quarters. We also increased the dividend and share repurchase authorization, reinforcing the confidence we have in our future.","As we shared with you previously, customers are facing ever increasing complexity in their IT environments with the proliferation of devices in IoT, the adoption of multiple clouds, and the exponential growth of security threats. The network has never been more critical to business success because of its ability to simplify this complexity while enabling real-time informed business decisions. This is why Cisco is well position for the future as we help our customers move to highly secure and intelligent platforms for their digital businesses.","Now let me take you through what I'm seeing across the business and how Cisco's innovation is driving momentum across the portfolio. First let's start with infrastructure platforms. We continue to be intensely focused on delivering differentiated innovation in our core which has resulted in our return to revenue growth this quarter. Last June, we launched The Network. Intuitive., a fundamental reinvention of networking and the industry's leading intent-based networking portfolio. Two weeks ago we announced the next phase of this intent-based network innovation with powerful assurance capability spanning across our data center, campus, and wireless portfolios. These will help our customers unlock the power of network data that will bring greater insights and visibility with rich predictive analytics.","We saw strong adoption of our subscription-based Catalyst 9000 switching platform as we more than doubled our customer base from last quarter to over 3,100 customers. This is the fastest ramping new product introductions we have had in our history and a fantastic example of the innovation we've delivered over the past two years. When I became CEO, I challenged our team to increase the pace of innovation in this space and I could not be more proud of what they've accomplished.","The network is also a key enabler for our customers as they increasingly adopt a multi-cloud strategy. They need a unified, automated and scalable environment across their data centers, private clouds, and public clouds. Cisco's cloud management analytics, automation and security combined with strategic partnerships such as Microsoft and Google position us very well to meet customer needs.","Further extending our cloud-focused software offers, we recently introduced a Cisco Container Platform to simplify the deployment of cloud native applications and containers with Kubernetes. This marks an important milestone in our partnership with Google to deliver the future hybrid cloud architecture. In general, we are encouraged with the overall progress we are making with the web-scale community.","Now turning to security. Cybersecurity continues to be a top concern for customers as they evolve their enterprise architectures to address the challenges of a pervasive threat environment. We are leading the security industry with an integrated architecture and a comprehensive best-of-breed portfolio across the network, endpoint, and cloud. This approach enables us to share context, intelligence, visibility and policy to reduce the time to detect and respond to threats.","We expanded our endpoint protection capabilities with Cisco Security Connector, a unique security application designed to give enterprises the deepest visibility and control over network activity on iOS devices. Together with Apple, we are helping our joint customers become the most connected, collaborative and secure organizations in the world.","Additionally, Cisco, Apple, Allianz and Aon are collaborating on an industry-first cyber risk management solution which integrates technology, services and enhanced cyber insurance to make businesses more resilient.","Now moving to Applications. The future of applications will unlock the power of trillions of terabytes of data across connected users, things and devices. In today's digital world, we are executing on our strategy to transition more of our business to cloud-based subscriptions and driving increased relevance at the application layer of the stack to enable a better experience for our customers. We continue to see progress in scaling AppDynamics' analytics capabilities. Over 20% of our top 500 global enterprise accounts have already adopted this technology. This is another example of our ability to scale acquisitions through our unparalleled go-to-market model.","We also closed the BroadSoft acquisition earlier this month, which provides us with access to its strong user base of 20 million and greatly strengthens our cloud-based collaboration subscription portfolio.","To summarize, I'm very pleased with the traction we're seeing in our business, the progress we're making against our strategy, and I'm very optimistic about our future. I'd also just like to say how incredibly proud I am of Cisco's leadership in environmental, social and governance issues, including the work we're doing to help solve the global skills gap. Our recent recognition by Barron's as the number one most sustainable company in the United States underscores our deep commitment to enable a better world in which everyone has the opportunity to thrive.","Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more details on our financials.","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by a discussion of the impact of tax reform and then end with Q3 guidance. Q2 was a strong quarter with results exceeding our expectations. We executed well in a number of areas, including good orders momentum, solid revenue growth and strong margins and cash flow.","Total revenue was $11.9 billion, up 3%. Non-GAAP net income was $3.1 billion, up 10% and non-GAAP EPS was $0.63, up 11%. Operating cash flow grew 8% to $4.1 billion with free cash flow up 10%. We continued to focus on driving margins and profitability, increasing our non-GAAP operating margin rate to 31.7%, up 0.7 points.","Let me provide some more detail on our Q2 revenue. Total products revenue was up 3%. Infrastructure Platforms returned to growth, up 2% with broad strength across the businesses. Within switching, we had strong growth in data center switching and we're seeing great momentum with our new campus switch, the Cat 9000. We also had strong wireless growth driven by our Wave 2 offerings and Meraki. Data center was up double digits driven by server products as well as our HyperFlex offerings. These increases were partially offset by a modest decline in our routing products driven by continued weakness in service provider.","Let's move on to Applications. Applications is made up of our collaboration portfolio of unified communications, conferencing and TelePresence as well as our IoT and application software businesses, Jasper and AppDynamics. Applications was up 6% in total with strength in TelePresence and conferencing as well as AppDynamics offset by some weakness in UC endpoints. There was also a strong increase in deferred revenue, up 18%.","Security was up 6% with strong performance in unified threat and web security. Deferred revenue grew 38% as we continue to drive more subscription-based software offers.","Service revenue was up 3% driven by growth in software and solutions support.","We continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions and recurring revenues. In Q2, we generated 33% of our total revenue from recurring offers, an increase of 2 points from a year ago. Revenue from subscriptions was 52% of our software revenue. We drove good growth in deferred revenue, which was up 10% in total, with product up 19% and services up 4%. Deferred revenue, product revenue from our recurring software and subscription offers was $5.5 billion, up 36%.","We saw strong momentum in Q2 product orders, growing 5% in total. Looking at our geographies, Americas grew 6%, EMEA was up 6% and APJC was flat. Total emerging markets was up 1% with the BRICs plus Mexico down 1%. In our customer segments, enterprise was up 3%, commercial grew 14%, public sector was up 8% and service provider declined 5%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q2 gross margin was 64.7%, up 0.6 points. Product gross margin was 63.3%, up 0.9 points and service gross margin was 68.5%, down 0.3 points. We continue to be negatively impacted by the higher memory pricing we have discussed over the past several calls which we expect to continue in the near term. Our operating margin was 31.7%, up 0.7 points.","When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our results year-over-year, there's been an 80 basis point positive impact on revenue and a negative $0.01 year-over-year impact on our non-GAAP EPS. In terms of the bottom line, our Q2 non-GAAP EPS was $0.63, up 11%. GAAP EPS was a loss of $1.78 driven by the one-time charges related to U.S. tax reform.","We're very pleased with the tax rate reduction related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Since our fiscal year ends in July, we won't realize the full benefit this year but we will start to realize that full years' worth in fiscal year 2019. For Q2, our non-GAAP tax rate was 20% to adjust to our full-year estimated non-GAAP tax rate of 21%. We are currently forecasting our estimated non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal year 2019 to be 20%.","This quarter we incurred an $11.1 billion charge to our income tax provision that is comprised of $9 billion related to the U.S. transition tax, $1.2 billion of foreign withholding tax and $0.9 billion for the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets related with the lower tax rate. Our Q2 GAAP tax rate includes the impact of this charge while our non-GAAP rate excludes it.","We ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $73.7 billion with $2.4 billion available in the U.S. We plan on repatriating $67 billion of our offshore funds to the U.S. in Q3 of fiscal year 2018. Q2 operating cash flow of $4.1 billion reflects strong growth of 8%. Free cash flow was also very strong with growth of 10% to $3.9 billion.","From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $5.4 billion to shareholders during the quarter that included $4 billion of share repurchases and $1.4 billion for our quarterly dividend. Today we announced a $0.04 increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.33 per share, up 14% year-over-year. This represents a yield of approximately 3.1% based on today's closing price.","We also announced a $25 billion increase to the authorization of the share repurchase program. This raises the remaining share repurchase authorization to approximately $31 billion. We expect to utilize this over the next 18 to 24 months. This significant dividend increase and additional share repurchase authorization reinforces our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows.","To summarize, Q2 was a strong quarter with solid top-line growth, strong profitability, cash flows and order growth. We continue to make solid progress on our strategic priorities, making key investments to drive our long-term growth.","Let me reiterate our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We closed the acquisition of BroadSoft in early Q3, and the impact of the acquisition is factored into our guidance. We expect revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29.5% to 30.5%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 21%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.64 to $0.66 cents.","I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Kelly. Kim, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. And while Kim is doing that, I'd like to go ahead and remind the audience that we ask that you ask one question so that we have plenty of time for others in the audience to address a question to both Chuck and Kelly.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank Securities.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Good afternoon. Yes. Hi, Chuck, Kelly.","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Hi, Vijay.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Hey, Vijay.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, hi. So my question is around intent-based. Chuck and Kelly, please join in. It just seems like it's resonating with your customers. Is this mostly a U.S. phenomenon, Chuck? Or are your overseas customers also looking into intent-based? And then how do you see intent-based kind of catching across the portfolio? Why not extend intent-based across the broader portfolio? Thank you.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yes, it's a great question, Vijay. First of all, we're incredibly pleased with the early acceptance of this intent-based portfolio. I called out in my opening comments that this Catalyst 9000 is the fastest ramping product in our history, which is pretty impressive. I'd say it's fairly balanced across the geographic regions, probably pretty much in line with what percentage of the business they represent. But Kelly can validate that in just a moment.","What I would tell you is that we have 3,100 customers who have adopted this platform. We obviously have the opportunity and we will extend the capabilities across the rest of our portfolio so that our customers who are driving automation can drive it across not only campus switching, but also routing, bringing the Viptela SD-WAN capabilities to play. We are integrating it backwards with ACI in the data center as well as within our security portfolio. So our strategy is to continue to enhance our customers' ability to drive intent across all of their technology areas as well as to gain context through analytics out of all of their technologies.","So 3,100 customers so far. I think our total customer population is well over 800,000, so we obviously have room to run. And we also have seen it, I'd say, from a segment perspective, the commercial marketplace has been a great adopter of the technology. And what I would tell you is that the enterprises have been evaluating it because it represents a different architectural approach with automation and analytics and security built into the network. So, Kelly, comments on those.","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","No, just to add to that, you're correct. I mean the geography is split kind of in proportion, as you would expect. And across commercial, enterprise and public sector, it's fairly balanced as well. So it's just very broad-based adoption across the board. And again, we're very happy about the adoption of the more advanced software package on the Advantage. It's very heavily weighted towards that. So we're excited about that.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Kelly. We'll go ahead and take the next question.","Operator","The next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. I wanted to follow up on Vijay's question, particularly as it relates to the 9000. Some of the people that we've talked to have indicated that availability of the 9000 may be a little bit limited. I'm just wondering how and over what timeframe you may be able to address that. And I guess as part of that, what are you seeing in terms of attach rates of additional services to the 9000? And are those changing at all as the product rolls out globally? Thank you.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yeah, let me just make a comment on the overall sort of strategy with the attach, and then Kelly can talk a bit about the supply. James, our original plan was to deliver a subscription model on the switch, and we've been very pleased with the attach rate and the percentage of customers and dollars in that subscription category that are actually being attached to the advanced subscription, which really contains the automation and it contains the encrypted traffic analytics, and we'll continue to add more and more of the Assurance stuff that we just launched two weeks ago. So we wanted to create real value in that subscription so that our customers would believe that it was worthwhile, and I think we're seeing exactly that. So, Kelly, comments on demand and (19:18).","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yeah, no. I mean, I think I saw a couple of reports on that. I can tell you from a demand perspective, we're very excited about how quickly this demand has been. And with any new product launch, we're going to get orders in faster than we recognize them in revenue. That's normal. And I'd say this ramp is normal as well. We did not have any significant supply chain issues of any sort or any shortages on this product line as well. So it's really more just we have tons of demand and we're very happy to see how quickly the take-up is going.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","And we'll go ahead and take the next question.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs.","Rod Hall - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to start off by asking about the OpEx line. That line held relatively stable even though your revenues beat our expectations. And so I just wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about how you expect that to move in the future. Do you think it just should remain roughly flat on last year? Or where should we be going with OpEx?","And then secondly, I want to come back to this Cat 9000 supply\/demand question and just see if \u2013 is this kind of a situation \u2013 I feel like we usually ask this about smartphone launches, but has the take-up been so fast that you couldn't keep up with demand and now you're able to meet demand? Is that kind of what you're telling us with those comments? I just want to clarify that a little bit. Thanks.","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Sure. So just to follow up quickly on the supply and demand, yeah, as I said, it's not a supply constraint issue at all from our supply chain or parts shortages in any way. I mean, it literally is \u2013 we operate to lead times on our products and if we get a lot of orders in the last week or two of a quarter, when again, as this thing is just ramping every week, we fulfill to our lead times. So there's nothing anything more than that than just we have a lot of demand for the product. So I wouldn't expect any issues as you look forward.","In terms of OpEx, Rod, as you know, we are very focused on driving efficiencies. The only thing that will change in our OpEx is we are adding BroadSoft, so in our guidance we will have obviously the revenue and the margin and the OpEx that comes with BroadSoft. But other than that, we are basically being very disciplined about where we're investing our R&D and making sure we're investing our R&D dollars in the best return projects. So you're going to see it move around if we do acquisitions, but otherwise we're going to be disciplined around that and invest when we can. And when we see margins go up, we're going to be investing as well. But otherwise, we're going to be managing that tightly like we have been.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Kim, we'll go ahead and take the next question.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen and Company.","Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, appreciate it. Kelly, I know we're going to see it when you publish the Q, but I was hoping you would tell us the rate of price erosion. And I'm assuming from the margin structure there wasn't a change, at least not for the worst, but let me ask the question. And I'm hoping you'll speak about \u2013 I know you haven't gotten there yet \u2013 Chuck, you've been very candid about saying that you were late with making progress with respect to the cloud. Can you give us any quantification of the growth, as well as as a percentage of revenue? Thank you.","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Hi. Okay. So, Paul, yes, let me address the gross margin rate question first. So, yes, we're very happy with our product gross margin rate. And as you and I talk about every quarter, we look at it in terms of what we're getting from price, what headwinds we're getting from price offset by what productivity. I would say this quarter we had a very, very effective price. We still had a price headwind, but it's at the lowest that it's been in many quarters. So it is less than \u2013 it's 1.3 points the way that you'll see it in the Q, Paul, so we're very pleased with that. We haven't been in that level for quite some time. I think maybe Q1 of 2017 we were close to that. But again, it shows the discipline between both our product management teams, as well as the sales force is being very disciplined about discounting. So we're happy there.","We also made some improvements on our productivity, where our productivity this quarter is offsetting the price erosion. So that helped a lot. And then, when we get our infrastructure platforms of business going like we did, seeing that return to growth, that helps from a mix perspective. So basically, all three of those were very helpful to our gross margin rate this quarter.","In terms of the web-scale question, Paul, I mean, we don't disclose that. It's not a huge number as we break out the broader company, but I will say that we are making some traction. I don't know, Chuck, if you want to add some comments to that.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yeah, Paul, I appreciate the recognition we've been trying to be transparent about this. And we continue to make progress, and I put the comment in the opening comments for a reason, that we do continue to make progress. You see the announcements we've made with Google. I said a few quarters back that we were focused on 360 degree relationships with these, and we have more to bring and certainly we feel good about where we are. But we still have a lot of work to do. But I would say that every quarter, we're making progress.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Chuck. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes Tal Liani with Bank of America.","Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Can you hear me?","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yes.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yes, Tal.","Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hello. I have a question. When Juniper discussed network trends, they discussed two things. migration from edge routers to what they call PTX or MPLS boxes in the core, which brings down prices. And second is the introduction of routing into switching and what Arista calls the 7500R. Could you please discuss the implications of these two trends on your switching and routing portfolios? Thanks.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yeah, thanks, Tal. So we talked about this before, and this is happening in some of the big web-scale providers. And the great news for us is that we have several different product platforms that meet whatever need the customer is looking for. Because we have so many customers that will be looking at this transition at different paces, so for those customers that want to go now, we have platforms that address those. The NCS 5500, as an example, has been very well received. We've had routing capabilities in our switching platforms. And we have our Nexus portfolio that continues to perform very well for customers who are building the data center architectures that we've been focused on for the last two or three years.","So I think that what I would say in summary on this one is that we're probably best positioned to meet the customer's need regardless of which architecture they're choosing and where they are in that transition. And that would be what we would plan on doing going forward as well.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Tal, for the question. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jayson Noland with Baird.","Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. Congrats on the quarter. And I wanted to ask on the 9000 subscription model. Chuck, interested in customer and partner feedback and what the puts and takes are there from your customer base and partners.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","On the subscription model itself?","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Or the Cat 9000 overall, both.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Okay.","Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Both and how extendible that would be across the portfolio. Most of the time, we hear positive feedback from large partners, but sometimes there's a cash flow dynamic. And just wondering how that nets out.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yes, okay. So, Kelly, keep me honest when we talk about how we price it. But, so from a technological perspective, this thing, it's one product in a portfolio of switches that we've gotten out the door. So you can assume there's an architectural play we're running longer term. And when you look at the overarching automation platform, the DNA Center, which is also where the analytics come back to for our customers to drive some of these services like Assurance, we're actually quite pleased.","And I think that for our customers, what we wanted to do was we wanted the base subscription plus the product to be somewhere at or slightly below what they would have paid for a previous switch with a perpetual license on it. And then our plan was to create so much new innovation, not take stuff that they would have bought before, because the customers would have felt like that we were just changing our financial model at their expense.","So what we wanted to put into the advanced subscription was fundamentally new technology that they have never gotten from us before so that they could warrant the incremental spend because they're getting incremental capabilities. So it's not us taking $1 they've been spending in the past and telling them now you got to spend $1.20 a different way. It was us saying, you spent $1.00 in the past. If you spend it the same way, you may only spend $0.95, but we think we're going to give you so much value that it's going to be $1.20 to $1.25. And that's been our plan.","And I think that the switch itself and the upfront cost is still enough of the acquisition cost that I have not heard partners on this particular portion of our portfolio, I haven't heard a tremendous amount of pushback. In fact, I think our partners are thrilled that we've reignited innovation in our core portfolio and given them an opportunity to work these refreshes with our customers. Kelly?","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yes, I mean the only anecdote I will add to this is I was at a customer, and I was actually at an investor meeting, and their CIO was talking about the new platform. And they were talking about DNA Center, which allows them to manage not just your switches but your newer versions of the enterprise routing and wireless. And the CIO had said I wish I had known that. I wouldn't have bought a competitor's wireless product. So again, I'm encouraged from the whole ecosystem, we're getting very positive feedback from our customers that way.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Kelly. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks and congrats and great execution. Great results. All right, just a couple things for me. Kelly, can you tell us how much of the product revenue was recurring and number of Cisco ONE customers? And then for you, Chuck, the commercial order is up 14%. I mean to me, that was the most interesting number. I mean, it's been a while since we've seen such strong strength in such an important big part of your business. Can you talk about the economic backdrop, what's driving this, what is changing, ability to maintain that momentum going forward? It's really quite an impressive number.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Kelly, you want to hit the stats?","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","I'll take mine first.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","I know them, but I'll let you go.","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yeah, yeah. So on the recurring revenue, we talked about again, we're up to 33% recurring revenue in total. Of that, again of the products, of the product side, of my product revenue, we are up to 13% is recurring. So again, that just continues to grow. That 13% is up over 3 points from what it was a year ago, so we continue to make progress. But 13% of our total product revenue is now recurring of which all of our revenue, 33% is.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Just a couple of \u2013 and Cisco ONE customers?","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Oh sorry. Cisco ONE customers, we're over 24,000 now.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yes. And just on the percentage of product revenue that is coming from recurring, that was 6% just 10 quarters ago. So, and I think the raw number was up 34% year-over-year. So we're pleased with that. And then I completely forgot the second part of the question.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","The commercial strength.","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yes. Commercial strength.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Commercial strength. Thank you. Yes, so we saw that was very consistent around the world. And you've heard us talk about, Ittai, in the past that our commercial customers tend to be the early adopters and the customers that actually adopt the technology sooner and actually roll it out into production sooner, because our large enterprise customers and large service providers, they spend a fair amount of time putting in the labs, evaluating it.","As I said earlier, with the intent-based networking portfolio, they're looking at delivering the automation platforms and all those which are just a fundamental different way of running their infrastructure. So it takes them a little longer. So largely that was the big driver, but I think it was pretty consistent across the board in the portfolio. Kelly?","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yeah, it was double digit in every region, and we were up in every single product category, sub product category.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","So it was pretty comprehensive, which I think, look, if we're honest, we've got some good new innovation in our portfolio. Obviously the economy is providing a little bit of a tailwind as well. But I think our teams are executing really well.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Let's go ahead and take the next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Fish with Piper Jaffray & Company.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Hey, Jim.","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Jim, are you there?","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Are you muted, Jim?","Operator","One moment, please. I do apologize, be just one moment, sir.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks.","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Should we go to the next?","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Hey, Kim, let's go ahead and move to the next question.","Operator","Okay. I do apologize. One second here. It looks like I've been kicked out of the location for the call. I do apologize. Just one moment, please. I do apologize. Give me just one moment, please. Jim Fish, your line is now open.","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Okay.","James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Can you guys hear me now?","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yes.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","We can, Jim. Sorry about that.","James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. First call and already breaking the conference call.","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yes, wow.","James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Anyway, thanks for the question, and congrats on the great quarter again. My question is actually more on the capital return. And so if my math is correct on sort of the repatriation amount of $67 billion, it looks like after tax-wise, it'll be about $57 billion and spending, it sounds as if you're going to spend $25 billion on the repo and then another $13 billion over the next two years on the dividend. That still leaves you by my math roughly about $20 billion. How should we think about sort of M&A versus either debt paydown over the next few years or other items?","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yes, I mean, I think there is a couple pieces in there. Don't forget, I still have a very good dividend that I'm paying. I'm paying a $6 billion a year on the...","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","He included $13 billion over the next two years.","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Did you have the $13 billion?","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","He said that.","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","If I look at it, I'm at a $34 billion net cash position right now. We've got the $66 billion we're bringing back. We've got the share buyback and the $31 billion we plan to try to utilize over the next 18 to 24 months. I'll still be in a net cash positive position of $10 billion to $12 billion without assuming anything else for acquisitions. And as you guys know, acquisitions are a critical part of our, and always has been of our overall strategy.","So I'd say the way to think about it longer term is we're going to be consistent with what we've said, right, from a capital allocation perspective. We're going to continue to be looking for the acquisitions that we can drive value and drive growth with.","We are going to continue to support the dividend and drive that up with earnings, like you saw us do today. And we're going to, again, give back cash now that we have \u2013 all of our cash basically is repatriated all the time now. We're going to be giving back to the shareholders through a healthy buyback, and I think we've got $30 billion to work through to do that. But we'll keep you updated as we go through this every quarter.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Jim, for the question. Kim, we'll go ahead and take the next one.","Operator","And your next one comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James & Associates.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you for taking my question. First, just a quick clarification. In the prepared remarks, you talked about campus getting better. Did you indicate that it's up year-over-year? Or could you confirm if campus switching is up year-over-year?","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yeah, no, so yeah, basically campus has been up. It's up in orders but from revenue, we're still slightly down, modestly down, from a revenue this quarter. And we saw strong growth on the data center side. But yes, the order side was very, very strong on campus. You'll see that flush through going forward.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Simon, for the question. Next, please. Kim?","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Are you there?","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Did we lose them?","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Kim? Kim, are you there?","Operator","Okay. One moment. Aaron Rakers, your line is open. Please go ahead, sir.","Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes, thanks. Can you hear me?","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yes.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","We can now, Aaron. Thank you.","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Apologies to everybody with our technical difficulties here.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yeah, sorry about that.","Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","No problem. I wanted to ask a question about just your data center segment. You talked about double-digit growth. It sounds like UCS was strong, sounds like you're continuing to get some traction with your HyperFlex product. So kind of updates there on how many customers you have for HyperFlex and do you think we're at a point in time where you could see some sustainable growth in that data center segment going forward?","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yes, I'll give you a little color on it, and then I think the number you \u2013 I think that's correct, Kelly. Yes, we had a good couple of quarters where the team has really focused on next generation innovation, lots of partnerships, integrated solutions with analytics, and then working on some of the new capabilities around some of the Kubernetes stuff that was announced and then HyperFlex is obviously still \u2013 it's not a significant portion of that business, but it's growing. And I think, Kelly, 2,400 customers now we're up to?","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yes.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","And so we're pleased with the progress that the teams have been driving. I think that we continue to see new customer adoption. We actually see a lot of the HyperFlex customers that don't overlap with UCS, so we have that opportunity to pull those together. So pleased with how the team is executing there for sure.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Next question please, Kim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Kvaal with Nomura Securities. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet\/Nomura","Yes, a clarification and a question first, I guess. And the clarification is, Kelly, would you mind helping us understand how much BroadSoft is adding to the upcoming quarter and maybe to the most recent one too depending on the specific close date?","And then a bigger picture question is the macro outlook has in the past been a big focus for Cisco and something that has led to more confidence or less confidence in the business outlook. I'm wondering if you could share a little bit about what you are thinking through with the global picture, and how that may be helpful or may be overheated a little bit in certain places. Thank you.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","You want to go through them?","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yes. I'll do the BroadSoft. So yes, so in Q2, like I mentioned, we had about 80 basis points of impact from acquisitions, which did not have BroadSoft. When I gave my Q3 guidance, overall inorganic impact bumps up another 0.5 point to about 130 basis points. So 1 full point is from inorganic. And for BroadSoft, just to remind everybody, when we do an acquisition and we bring it onto our balance sheet, obviously what deferred revenue they had ends up going through purchase accounting and gets a bit of a haircut. So the first quarter is going to be slightly less than what they were when they were a public company. But overall, it adds, we're at 130 basis points overall at the company level.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","So, Jeff, maybe I could just give you sort of a general view on what we saw around the world, and then we'll talk a little bit about sort of the overall economy. We referenced it earlier, the global strength in commercial was something that we were very happy to see. In U.S., we actually saw strength in our federal business. We haven't talked about that today.","Across Europe, Middle East, Africa, everything was positive except the SP business there. APJC was flat, but that was primarily driven by SP routing deals largely in China and Japan. So the rest of business, we were pleased with, particularly enterprise and commercial in APJC. And then the emerging markets continue to be somewhat volatile, but I think we saw slight growth this quarter as well.","But from an overall economy perspective, look, we came out of The World Economic Forum. We read and see and talk to the same customers and everyone that you do. There's a great deal of confidence right now on a global basis, probably more consistent than we've seen in a very long time. So that's good, but we believe that we also have driven innovation in our core technologies in the enterprise that we have needed for a long time. And so I think that both of those are contributing to how we feel about it in addition to the strength across the rest of the portfolio. So we appreciate the strength in the economy, but we're also very pleased with the new innovation as well.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Chuck. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Your line is open.","Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes, thank you. Good afternoon, a question on the revenue growth profile. Could we actually see accelerating revenue growth going into the back half of the year because the 9000 intent-based networking and product portfolio is providing for a longer evaluation and lab work by some of your bigger customers? And then once they overcome that, you see more of a land and grab expand dynamic?","And then, Chuck, I had a question for you in terms of the cash that's going to be burning a hole in your pocket here even after all the different nice shareholder return initiatives you're undertaking here. Do you need to put a stamp on the company in terms of making a big transformative acquisition, or can you do it other ways?","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yes. Let me address the second one first, and then I'll let Kelly talk about some of the growth, the first question relative to growth. I think what we have said all along, even before tax reform, is that when it did occur that we would leverage our ability to continue our capital strategies, which you saw today relative to buybacks as well as dividend. But we also have kept plenty of powder dry. We also have obviously the ability to take on debt, if necessary. And we've also said that in the past, by virtue of our cash being outside the United States with access to the debt markets, we really had no impact on our ability to do M&A.","And the bottom line is that we'll continue to look for any M&A targets that actually line up in an integrated way with what we're trying to do strategically, and that's just what we're looking for. I wouldn't put any parameters around the size. I think it's really around strategic fit, both from a technological perspective from what our customers are looking for, and then obviously the financial implications. So Kelly, any comments on the revenue?","Kelly A. Kramer - Cisco Systems, Inc.","On the revenue growth, we really do only guide one quarter at a time. But again, we are very, very encouraged with what we're seeing with the current portfolio of innovation, certainly in the switching portfolio. Both the data center side and the campus side are pacing well, and again we are going to keep executing through and we'll see how that goes. But we feel good about what we see next quarter of the 3% to 5% growth, and we're just going to keep working it from there.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Kelly. I believe we have time for one more question.","Operator","Okay. One moment please, while we confirm. Okay, Jason Ader with William Blair & Company, your line is open.","Jason N. Ader - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you. Chuck, I was wondering what your thoughts are on the service provider business going forward and when do you think that might turn around. And what would be the puts and takes or the drivers that could turn it around?","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Yeah, I think it's a great question, Jason, and the rest of the businesses were generally pretty strong. So when we think about SP, obviously one of the key variables for us is continuing to make the progress that we've been making in the web-scale community. And that's a key focus area for us, as they're included in this business. So that's certainly number one.","Number two, the consistency of CapEx coming from everyone in this space around the world will certainly be a contributor to the future performance. So, I think that's the other thing that we look for. And then, third, as we mentioned at the financial analyst conference, we're also working on some next-generation platforms that we think can help us here as well. So if I had to just pick three things, those are the ones that we're focused on, and we're going to take it quarter by quarter and keep executing in all of those areas to try to get that business moving in the right direction.","Charles H. Robbins - Cisco Systems, Inc.","So with that, I just want to close by just thanking all of you for joining us today. We really appreciate you spending time with us. Appreciate the questions. And, Marilyn, I'll just turn it back to you to talk about our next call.","Marilyn Mora - Cisco Systems, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Chuck. Cisco's next quarterly call, which will reflect our fiscal 2018 third quarter results, will be on Wednesday, May 16, 2018, at 1:30 PM Pacific Time, 4:30 PM Eastern Time.

Ma'am, you may begin.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks, Michelle. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2019 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I\u2019m joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO.","By now, you should have seen our earnings press release, a corresponding webcast with slides including supplemental information will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found in the financial information section of our Investor Relations website.","Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise.","The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter of fiscal 2019. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q which identifies important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.","As a reminder, in Q2, on October 28, we completed the sale of our SPVSS business and accordingly had no revenue or expense from that business in Q2 fiscal 2019. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP, and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SPVSS business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SPVSS business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help understand these impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q1 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way.","I will now turn the call over to Chuck.","Chuck Robbins","Thank you, Marilyn and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter we again demonstrated that we have built a resilient growth engine that is firing on multiple cylinders. Our strategy of expanding our portfolio, while investing in our core markets is delivering unprecedented innovation for our customers and sustainable value for our shareholders. We delivered revenue growth across all geographies and businesses, strong margins, double-digit non-GAAP earnings per share growth, and continued solid cash generation. We're building the technologies that enhance our customers\u2019 new digital capabilities and experiences like never before.","With a continued expansion to the cloud, the increasing connectivity of users and devices and the need to secure their enterprises, our customers are facing the most complex and dynamic IT environment we've ever seen. Cisco's intent-based networking architecture helps them navigate this complexity by enabling them to simplify, automate, and securely transform their infrastructure. We are redefining every networking domain for our customers from the campus to the wide area network to the data center to the cloud, delivering the agility, operational efficiency, and most importantly, the security our customers require to accelerate their digital transformations.","Only Cisco can build and deliver a multi domain intent-based architecture that sits at the intersection of users, devices, applications, and data that can securely connect any user on any device on any network to any application. Simply put, the Cisco of today is at the center of our customer strategies and no longer view just as an enabler of those strategies.","Now, let's review some of the highlights in our key strategic growth areas. Starting with infrastructure platforms. Over the last 18 months, we've been reinventing networking from the ground up to connect every domain of the extended enterprise and it's clear that the investments we've made in our core business are paying off. We are executing well, with continued growth in our infrastructure portfolio and strong customer uptake of our Catalyst 9000 family of switches and our SD-WAN offerings.","We are now extending our industry-leading security and intent-based networking capabilities to new IoT edge platforms, connecting devices throughout the enterprise with unprecedented scale, unparalleled flexibility, and control. Going forward, you will see us continue to extend our intent-based networking innovations across the portfolio with subscription-based offers that will enable our customers to adopt a consistent architecture across every domain.","In the data center, we're enabling digital enterprises to securely access their applications and their data everywhere from private to public cloud environments, as well as the edge. Two weeks ago, we announced a new architecture that extends a data center to wherever the data exists and across all applications running anywhere. We introduced several new innovations to extend our multi-cloud leadership with ACI Anywhere, HyperFlex Anywhere, and cloud center capabilities. We are also well positioned to take advantage of 100 gig and 400 gig upgrade cycles across enterprise data centers, service provider, and web scale networks.","With global Internet traffic expected to increase three fold over the next five years, our customers are facing an exponential demand for capacity. To address their need for speed and performance, we continue to innovate to drive the industry's transition to next generation high-speed networks of 400 gig and beyond. Our acquisition of Luxtera will further augment our existing capability around silicon and optics, enabling our customers to build the fastest and most efficient networks.","Now moving to our security business, we generated strong double-digit growth reflecting the increasing demand for our market leading solutions and the trust our customers place in us. The attack surface is only increasing. And our comprehensive approach of integrating security into the intent-based architecture from the network to the cloud to the endpoint has been successful, as our installed base continues to grow. With our industry leading threat intelligence, we are redefining how security is delivered with our multi-domain architecture. For example, as a leader in both SD-WAN and security, Cisco provides the most robust SD-WAN platform integrated with cloud security. This helps to simplify and secure our customers\u2019 deployment, operation, and management of their environments.","Increasingly, we're helping to secure our customers\u2019 distributed enterprises with remote access and cloud based security solutions. A great example of this is Duo Security\u2019s cloud delivered zero trust platform, which significantly expands our footprint in the Identity and Access market bringing together user, device and application visibility and trust. We are seeing strong traction with Duo and good progress in scaling their capabilities while strengthening our cloud-based subscription portfolio.","Turning to applications, and collaboration, enterprise communications continue to evolve as we move to a digital cloud-based world. We are defining the future of work with next generation collaboration platforms that have flexible, intuitive, and intelligent on-premise and cloud-based solutions. This comprehensive approach to collaboration is a key reason why customers are adopting our market leading portfolio resulting in another quarter of exceptional growth.","Cisco provides a full suite of collaboration solutions for calling, meeting, team collaboration and care, with flexible subscription offerings designed to easily integrate into customer workflows. With a deep integration of BroadSoft with our core capabilities, we are now the market leader for cloud-based calling and care solutions with compelling solutions for SMBs as well as enterprises globally. AppDynamics is the largest APM vendor providing real-time analytics and insights across applications, infrastructure, and the network, driving solid momentum with our customers. We have been investing in several new capabilities delivering the broadest application visibility and monitoring platform in the world.","Our real-time analytics and monitoring offerings are mission critical for our customers as they face a growing complex application environment. To simplify and automate their IT operations, we recently launched AIOps, leveraging AI machine learning and automation to enable improved customer experiences and greater business performance.","In summary, we are very pleased with our strong quarter and first half performance. Our teams are executing incredibly well, aggressively transitioning to a software model and accelerating our pace of innovation, and I'm proud of the work they're doing. Our multi-domain intent-based architecture is helping to simplify, automate, and secure the complex IT environments our customers are facing. And I believe we are well positioned to play an even more strategic role with them as they embrace multi-cloud, edge computing, and digital transformation. The innovation our teams have been driving has now given us the strongest portfolio that we've had a very long time and I couldn't be more confident about our future.","Kelly, I'll now turn it over to you.","Kelly Kramer","Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by the guidance for Q3. Q2 was a solid quarter across the business. We executed well with strong orders, revenue, gross margin, EPS, and operating cash flow. We had continued momentum and product orders which grew 8%. Total revenue was 12.4 billion, up 7%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 32.1%, non-GAAP net income was 3.3 billion, up 6%, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.73, up 16%.","Let me provide some more detail on our Q2 revenue. Total product revenue was up 9% to 9.3 billion. Infrastructure platform grew 6%. Switching had another great quarter with double-digit growth in the campus driven by the continued ramp of the Cat 9000. Wireless also had double-digit growth, with strength of our Wave 2 offerings and Meraki. Routing declined due to weakness in service provider. We also saw decline in data center servers partially offset by strength in hyperconverged. Applications is up 24%, with growth across all the businesses. We saw strong growth in unified communications, telepresence, and AppDynamics. Security was up 18% with strong performance in identity and access, advanced threat, and unified threat. Service revenue was up 1% driven by software solution support. We continue to transform the business delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 65% of total software revenue, up 10 points year over year.","When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our future results year over year, there was 140 basis point positive impact on revenue. We saw strong momentum in Q2 with total product orders growing 8%. Looking at the geographies, America grew 7%, EMEA was up 11%, and APJC was up 6%. Total emerging markets was up 6% with BRICS plus Mexico up 2%. In our customer segment, enterprise was up 11%, commercial grew 7%, public sector was up 18%, and service provider was down 1%.","From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q2 gross margin was 64.1%. In terms of the bottom line from a GAAP perspective, Q2 net income was 2.8 billion and EPS was $0.63. We ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of 40.4 billion. Q2 operating cash flow was 3.8 billion, down 7%. We paid 750 million for the first transition tax payment related to the tax cuts and jobs act. Normalized for that tax payment, operating cash flow was up 12%."," From a capital allocation perspective, we returned 6.5 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of 5 billion of share repurchases and 1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend. Today, we also announced a $0.02 increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.35 per share, up 6% year over year. This represents a yield of approximately 3% based on today's closing price. We also announced a $15 billion increase to the authorization of the share repurchase program. This raises the remaining share repurchase authorization to approximately 24 billion. This dividend increase and additional share repurchase authorization reinforces our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline.","During the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Luxtera, a company focused on silicon photonics, which closed on February 6. To summarize, we had a great Q2, we executed well with strong top-line growth and profitability. We're seeing the returns on the investments we\u2019re making in innovation and driving the shift to more software and subscriptions driving long-term growth and shareholder value. Let me reiterate our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal \u201819. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. Note again, that we have normalized our third quarter guidance to exclude the SPVSS business for Q3 of fiscal \u201818, which we divested on October 28 of 2018. ","We have provided historical financial information for the SPVSS business in the slides that accompany this call. We expect revenue growth in the range of 4% to 6% year over year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64% to 65%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 31% to 32% and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 19%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.76 to $0.78.","I'll now turn it back to Marilyn, so we can move to Q&A.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks, Kelly. Michelle let's go ahead and open the line for question. As a reminder, I ask that all of you limit yourself to one question only, so that we have enough time to get to all of you. I'll now turn it over to you, Michelle to start the queuing process.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Jim Suva from Citi Global Markets, you may go ahead.","Jim Suva","Thank you very much. And congratulations on the results and the outlook. When we look at a couple of dynamics, whether it be tariffs, government shutdown, or maybe even weather for installation and shipping your product around the whole US, any thoughts around how we should think about those items, how they played out and your forecast of what's built in?","Chuck Robbins","Jim, this is Chuck. Look, first of all, I would tell you that we -- it certainly is one of the more complex macro geopolitical environment that I think we've seen in quite a while with all the different moving parts. But to be honest, from the first day of the quarter to the last day of the quarter, we saw zero difference. We saw very steady demand throughout the quarter and just saw great execution by our teams. And, when we look out ahead at the guide, there's -- we're looking at the conditions as they exist today. And, so far, we've been able to navigate all the different dynamics I think pretty well. We're pretty proud of what the teams have accomplished.","Marilyn Mora","Next question please.","Operator","Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank, you may go ahead, sir.","Vijay Bhagavath","Good afternoon, Chuck and Kelly. Congratulations, these are solid results. My question Chuck and Kelly, I would like to get your thoughts into, you know, the secular growth portfolio you have around AppDynamics, Meraki, Viptela, Duo, et cetera, are these assets starting to drive new sales opportunities, perhaps new product refresh for the core business, or are these mostly like standalone like they're growing in their respective areas? Thank you.","Chuck Robbins","Thanks, Vijay and thanks for the nice comment. If I look at the different acquisitions, if you look at -- let me just pick a few like BroadSoft and the integration has been done with the collaboration portfolio, that clearly enhances the overall architecture, and I would say has a positive impact on the total business. As you look at things like Meraki and as we continue to do tighter integration between the Meraki portfolio and the classic Cisco portfolio and we bring together the automation strategies on each side, it gives customers the ability to deploy a hybrid model with both of those technology areas, which I think is a benefit that many of our customers have. They might want the traditional Cisco portfolio in their core headquarters buildings and they might like Meraki out in their retail outlets or in small branches, so that's very positive.","When you think about an acquisition like Duo, that's clearly part of an overarching security architecture that clearly our customers are buying into as you can see from the 18% growth which is like the fastest growth rate we've seen in security in many years. So, I think it depends on the acquisition, but most of them are pulling forward an architecture that they are associated with.","Kelly Kramer","And just to add I think, we're also embedding it in our products right and you can look at like when we acquired Stealthwatch, it's now part of what we're doing at the Cat 9000 or what we announced with Umbrella being in part of other products. So, I think it's a combination of both.","Chuck Robbins","Yeah, bringing together like some of the traditional technologies, I mean thinking about bringing together ISR with Viptela with Umbrella to create this new secure SD-WAN offering, I mean that's a unique capability that only we have and look at taking some of the security technologies like advanced malware and moving them into the Meraki portfolio. Those are obviously key differentiators for us.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks Vijay, next question please.","Operator","Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs, you may go ahead, sir.","Rod Hall","Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess I wanted to start off with the public sector side of things and the order trajectory there improved a lot to 18%. And yet, you know, we're all sitting here expecting US Fed to be week. So, I wonder if you could sort of comment on the US Fed impact on the current quarter, and then why we're seeing such a big order acceleration there and then I have a follow up.","Chuck Robbins","Yeah, I would say -- I think first of all, it's important to understand the dynamics of the shutdown that we experienced, it was really, you know, only about 25% of the government agencies were impacted. And some of the groups that we do business with when they had a sense of shut down might be coming, some of them pulled some orders ahead and actually got them in the system. So, I will tell you that we saw minimal impact, our US Federal business even with the shutdown grew double digits, which is I think a testament to our team and the relationships in the execution. And so -- and around the world when you look at our business in Europe, I mean, you look at the -- I mean, think about the 11% growth in the EMEA. When we talked to our team there, a lot of that is public sector oriented, same across the world. We just saw, obviously, at 18% growth in our public sector business around the world. It's obviously, the technologies resonating in that vertical, that's for sure.","Rod Hall","And then I wanted to -- on the follow up just on the enterprise order rate. I mean, that was I think, 15% of last quarter. It's decelerated a little bit to 11%. Just comment on what you're seeing there. I mean, you've talked before about last year being such a strong year and just curious if you know that's just kind of a one quarter thing or is that a trajectory we would expect to continue?","Chuck Robbins","You know, Rod, I think that -- as I think about the enterprise and you look at our portfolio right now, we really line up with -- whether our customers are looking at strategies to drive revenue and looking at how our collaboration architecture or our location analytics in retail outlets can help them or they're looking at how do they reduce their operating expenses and simplify and the automation we're driving in the networking space, the SD-WAN solutions, they're just -- these are all really core to what our enterprise customers are looking for. ","And we've talked about over the last several calls that you know, this Cat 9000, the early phases of that we're still in the very early innings and now we've deployed you know, a wireless portfolio that fits within that architecture. The SD-WAN solutions are going to be integrated into that architecture and the customers are still on the very front end of deploying all this technology. So, we feel good about where we are and we think that assuming we continue to execute well on that technology and that portfolio, the benefits to the customer are such that, you know, I think that we should have a pretty successful run ahead of us in our enterprise accounts assuming we continue to execute.","Marilyn Mora","Next question please.","Operator","Paul Silverstein from Cowen & Co., you may go ahead sir.","Paul Silverstein","I've got two related questions; one my customary what's your rate of price erosion in connection with that. If you could talk about gross margins drivers looking forward. And related to that, if I did the math right, you all did 4.5 billion of operating cash flow if you exclude the 800 million in connection that one-time tax item. That's a record by over $400 million or 10% of what historically is not your strongest cash flow quarter. The question is, is that a new normal? Or were there other extraordinary items in that number?","Kelly Kramer","So just on the cash, there's nothing extraordinary in that. And again, that 750 that we paid out that's, you know, we\u2019ll be paying that -- those charges and it escalates in the later years or the next eight years, right. That was just part of the transition tax. But besides that, no, there's no extraordinary. Remember, in Q1, we had the extraordinary $400 million payout from a risk, but there's nothing in Q2 besides that.","Paul to your question on price this quarter. It was a one point impact on gross margin. Teams did a good job on that. And so that's in that range. And then if I go back to the gross margin drivers, like we talked about last earnings call, it has been the same drivers, right, we still had a definitely negative headwinds for the last quarter here in Q2 from DRAM and component costs. But, as you look in our guide forward, you'll notice that the guide went up another half point because like I expected last quarter and what we're seeing the DRAM turns into a tailwind in Q3 and Q4. So, that's why you see that tick up in the guide on the gross margin. So the drivers we had are really just, again, the headwinds being the component costs in Q2 that turns around and then we still have a little bit of a drag on our rate for the you know, as we continue to ramp the Cat 9000 portfolio for that deferral impact, but otherwise, we're executing well.","Paul Silverstein","Kelly, I trust you. I\u2019ll go and shift software will have a benefit over time?","Kelly Kramer","Oh, yeah, I mean, we're seeing them, and that\u2019s what\u2019s offsetting a lot of these headwinds on the component stuff, right. So, yeah, that will continue, which is, again, why you continue to see them in [indiscernible]. So, when the DRAM which has been a significant headwind for us, the last bunch of quarters, you know, we'll continue to see that benefit of.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks, Paul. Michelle, next question.","Operator.","Thank you. Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer & Co., you may go ahead sir.","Ittai Kidron ","Thanks and congrats, let me add my congrats, a fantastic execution in what seems to be a very crazy world. Maybe I have a two part question. I guess, Chuck, trying to kind of dig into what Rod was asking before. You're running multiple product cycles and in multiple product areas, but if you have to kind of put it all together across your entire customer base, in what phase of the adoption are we embrace of the customers of this new portfolio, are we early cycle, mid cycle, help me think about that?","Chuck Robbins","Ittai, thank you. Look, here's the thing I think it's important understand. We have been working over the years on building best of breed technology for what we're calling -- what we talk about relative to domains with our customers. So, we've been building the best data center switching portfolio, the best campus switching portfolio, the best campus wireless portfolio. Over the last three years, what we've done is we built an automation architecture within a domain. Okay, so we built ACI in the data center, we built DNA in the campus, we've got SD-WAN platform in the branch, we've got a security control center that actually automates a security architecture. And now what we're doing is we're beginning to bring those together.","So, when you hear us talk about multi domain, it means that we're giving our customers the ability to drive automation across all of those domains. And you're going to see even more announcements over the next few months relative to extending that. We extended it into the IoT architecture. So, think about an application that's either running in the cloud or running in the data center that requires a certain policy that gets deployed across all those domains. And I think that's the thing that our customers are really excited about. So, now, where are we? We're still early. I mean, I would still say we're in the early innings. I mean, this transition -- if you look back at the number of years that customers were buying and sweating a lot of this infrastructure, then that's sort of the base that we have ahead of us to actually move into this new architecture. So, I would say it's still very early across all those areas that I just described.","Ittai Kidron","That's great. And then just as a follow up, I didn't catch the data center switch comment. Was there one or that's a -- can you give us some color on where you stand there and how do you envision 400 making its impact there, timeline wise?","Chuck Robbins","Yeah, I think what we gave -- Kelly you gave a broader switching number, I think. We said, our overall switching business was up double digits. So, I mean, it's a pretty big business. So, we were pleased with that.","Kelly Kramer","And on the 400-gig [indiscernible].","Chuck Robbins","And the 400 gig, yeah, I'll tell you, we have a -- we've got a lot of work going on in both our data center switching portfolio where you know, we're in some early field trials as well as in our networking portfolio with some of the work that's going on there. And we believe that sometime middle of this year will begin to see broad-based deployments. We're happy with that. I think there's a couple of key differentiators for us, Ittai. We build our own silicon, the Luxtera acquisition is going to bring the optics into that for us as well, instead of us having to go out and procure the optics, we will be able to more tightly integrate them. The whole intent-based architecture we have and the ability for us with our silicon to do real-time packet examinations for the customers and let them look at packet flows dynamically. There's a lot of differentiators, including a lot of power consumption advantages we think we're going to have. So, sort of middle of this year we\u2019ll begin to see if all that comes to fruition, but I think the teams are in good spot.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks Chuck, next question.","Operator","Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan, you may go ahead, sir.","Samik Chatterjee","Chuck, I just wanted to check with you how -- what are you seeing in terms of momentum in the emerging countries? I believe last quarter, you had a very solid momentum in countries like India, are you seeing those stronger dollar at all catch up to them in terms of what their appetite is, in terms of IT spent if you can help us with that?","Chuck Robbins","We gave that number, right, the emerging markets? Up 6% on orders.","Kelly Kramer","And BRIC was up 2%.","Chuck Robbins","And BRIC was up 2%. So, I think 6% in light of what we've heard from others around that space. And, you know, historically, what we've seen is when interest rates in the US start rising, it creates challenges in emerging countries. And I think if you press Kelly, she\u2019d probably tell you the currency was a slight headwind for us as well. So, I think the teams are doing well and it speaks to the relevance of what we built. We\u2019ve had some big build outs in India. So, India slowed a little bit for us but still quite positive. I think Russia was slightly negative. Mexico was positive. It is a same story, it is a portfolio of emerging countries and right now we have more that are performing well from a volume perspective. China was roughly flat for the last quarter. But overall, again, I\u2019m pleased given the complexities that our teams are facing both geopolitically and from a currency perspective, I think they executed really well. And I think it speaks to the teams themselves on the ground and the portfolio that our engineering organizations built ","Operator","Thank you. Tal Liani from Bank of America, you may go ahead.","Tal Liani","I have two questions or one question and one follow up. The first one is just about cloud spending. We hear a lot about weakness in spending. On one hand, you're not very, very exposed, you're exposed in certain areas and other areas not. On the other hand, it's a big growth opportunity for you. Can you discuss your participation in cloud and your comments on any weakness in cloud spending and then I have a follow up on the Chinese vendors?","Chuck Robbins","I guess, this is a quarter where it helps not to have as much exposure. But, I think, we're still very happy with our progress we're making there. Some of these big transitions that we're talking about, the 100-gig, the 400-gig, those are going to be opportunities for us to try to insert and we're working hard to actually position ourselves well for that. But I don't think that I could give any more color than what you've already heard from those who are -- who have a pretty significant exposure in that space. We're still plugging along and doing all the same things that we've told you we're doing. I would say that we still haven't gotten to a substantial different position than what we described to you probably 12 or 18 months ago. But we continue to make progress and we've said it's going to be a long -- it's going to be a long journey to get there.","Tal Liani","So maybe again, I have a follow up just on that. But maybe you can discuss your exposure at the cloud and the difference between hyper scale, hyperscalers versus smaller cloud vendors and if you see similar trends with smaller companies where you do have exposure versus larger companies. But I wanted to ask you this morning, I hosted a call with Huawei. And one of the things they were saying is they think they're actually going to gain market share, despite all the issues. And I want to -- I know you don't have, you don't compete with them in China on certain things, but \u2013 and you don't compete with them in the US. But you do compete with Huawei and ZTE globally. And the question is being asked repeatedly about share gains versus Huawei and ZTE. What is your position -- what is your view, what kind of experiences you have had in the last few weeks and few months on the competition with Huawei, when you talk with or when you discuss this with big carriers and how do you see your portfolio versus Huawei\u2019s portfolio in light of these issues?","Chuck Robbins","Yeah, it's a good question. So first of all, the magnitude of the market opportunity in China skews the overall global market share numbers. So when -- if you're not participating in a material way in China, then it's very difficult to gain share, if you're just looking at it broadly across the world. So we\u2019ve begun to look at it without China and with China, just to see how we're doing. ","What I would tell you is that, look, I think our innovation, I said this in my prepared comments at the beginning, I think our portfolio right now from an innovation perspective, and particularly with the work the teams are doing in the SP space and the work that we're doing around the 5G packet core and some of these next generation platforms that are going to hit the market this year, I would put our innovation up against there as anybody else's in the world right now.","I think if you look at our performance in EMEA and an APJC over the last few quarters, that would suggest that we're not only holding our own, but we're competing and winning and I will tell you last quarter, we saw positive growth in SP in both of those regions. And so I feel very confident that not only can we compete, but that we are and we're winning right now. And so the share comment from them could be related to the size of the Chinese market and they're confident that the math works, but in other parts of the world, I'll tell you we're doing really well right now.","Operator","Tejas Venkatesh from UBS, you may go ahead, sir.","Tejas Venkatesh","I\u2019m on for john. You talked about double digit growth in Campus, are the new Catalyst 9K products that you introduced about a quarter ago starting to contribute to revenue. I\u2019m really just trying to get at how much more there is to go in Campus and whether it's unreasonable to think Campus could be up double digits for the full year as a newer Cat 9K products start to layer on?","Chuck Robbins","Well, I think, when you just look at the 9K sales versus the install base of the products that the 9K replaces, we are very early in that cycle. And we just launched a 9200. When did that start?","Kelly Kramer","A quarter ago. Just started shipping this quarter.","Chuck Robbins","A quarter ago. Just started shipping this quarter. So the products that we announced in the middle of 2017 clearly are flowing through revenue. The 9200 just started contributing to that. But again, if you look at where we are versus the install base that these products replace, it's very early.","Tejas Venkatesh","And then a quick follow up on M&A, I wonder if you could comment on capital allocation, now that the core business is growing very healthy, is it time for accelerated M&A perhaps?","Chuck Robbins","Well, I'll make a comment and Kelly can add on to it. I don't think that the growth of the core fundamentally changes our overarching acquisition strategy. I think that we've had an acquisition strategy that's continued to add to our portfolio and expanding our portfolio. What I alluded to early on is that our strategy of not only creating adjacent expansions to our portfolio, but really driving innovation back into our core, so that we can get growth from both, given the size of our core markets, that's working. So I don't think that our overall M&A strategy changes because of the success of the core, but Kelly?","Kelly Kramer","Yeah. It never has changed, right? I mean, I think our strategy has always been clear, we're going to invest in the business first. And we're always looking for M&A, no matter what the environment is, and we're going to do smart M&A, and then we're committed to our dividend growth like we have been. And then of course the share buyback, and again, I think you saw the latter two there, we just announced again another increase to the dividend, just showing the commitment we have and the faith we have in the cash flows of the business as well as just another increases of share buyback authorization. So I'd say it's independent to how the core business is doing. It\u2019s just a critical part of our overall strategy.","Operator","Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research, you may go ahead.","Pierre Ferragu","Hey, thank you for taking my question. I'd like to come back to the comments you\u2019ve made Chuck on emerging market, on China, so what I heard is clearly that you\u2019re very happy with your performance there relative and now it's true that having like a flat sale in China is great and overall, your emerging market is holding well, in, especially when you take into account currencies, but really the question I would like to ask you is about how conversations with clients are going there. What's your outlook, like you guys at Cisco used to be a bellwether, you have very, very good insight into how enterprises are feeling about macro developments. So from all the conversations you've had with clients this -- in the last three minutes, what's your take? What's your 2019 macro perspective?","Chuck Robbins","Pierre, thanks for the question. What I've said several times in a lot of interviews is that I've been amazed at the resilience that we've seen around the world in light of all of the macro environment and the geopolitical dynamics, whether it's a shutdown or it\u2019s US China trade or it\u2019s Brexit or it's stress in Italy, or it's political unrest in certain emerging countries. I mean, it's amazing the resilience that we've seen. What I will tell you is that our enterprise customers, given the focus, they really -- they don't view this technology anymore as an optional enabler of a strategy that they've come up with. They now view the technology as a core part of their strategy. ","So I mean, many of the strategies they're driving around revenue growth don't work, if they don't continue to invest in technology. Many of the things they're trying to do around simplification and cost reduction and productivity in their IT infrastructure as well as being able to efficiently deal with this new multi cloud world, which is super complicated. I mean, they can't just stop. I mean, it's -- they have to keep executing. And I'd say that most of them have a paranoia that if they do stop investing, their competitors will not and they'll fall behind. ","So all that being said, I will just tell you, our customers, I haven't seen any general difference over the last 90 days in the discussions we've had with the exception of talking to a customer who has very high exposure to the Chinese market. But even then they talk about the impact of the geopolitical situation. But they never connected to any sort of spending shift that they, some of them may do that. But I'm not having those conversations, everybody seems to be moving in the same place they were three, six months ago.","Operator","Sami Badri from Credit Suisse, you may go ahead.","Sami Badri","Hi, thank you. I just wanted to get a quick one regarding the number of ELAs you signed in the quarter and what percentage of revenues that actually reflected?","Kelly Kramer","Are you talking just Cisco One, what we have provided before?","Sami Badri","Yes, exactly. That's right.","Kelly Kramer","Yeah. I'd say for Cisco One, we are now basically over 31,000, 31,500 in that range. And I'd say that the thing to think about, as you think about that going forward, as we move more and more of the portfolio, so this DNA architecture and the architecture we're rolling out more and more, you're going to see -- you're going to see more and more of our customers going to that that kind of framework where the software is included in that as well. So, we continue to grow the Cisco One bundles, but again as we progress through the early innings of the enterprise networking Cat 9K and so on portfolio transitioning, you're going to see more and more going to the DNA architecture and software bundle with that.","Sami Badri","And then are you comfortable giving a percentage of revenues, something like that that we could get a little bit of an indicator from?","Kelly Kramer","No, we don't disclose that.","Operator","Steve Milunovich from Wolfe Research, you may go ahead.","Steve Milunovich","As a follow on, at the last Analyst Day, Kelly, you talked about software as a percentage of total revenue I think going from 22% to 30% over three years. Can you indicate where you are in that range, if 30 is still the goal, if there's now a higher goal and then how is 606 affecting that? And specifically in this quarter did 606 give you a revenue boost?","Kelly Kramer","Yeah. Yeah. So I would say to the first part of that question, we are continuing to progress along those lines. And with the new rev rec, because it's accelerating some of these things that, when you pull a snapshot for this year, it's accelerating some of it, but overall for the longer term strategies, it\u2019s absolutely progressing like we said it would at SAC. And yes, this quarter, we were around 2% for the acceleration when you compare the 606 versus 605 accounting change difference.","Operator","James Faucette from Morgan Stanley, you may go ahead.","James Faucette","Chuck, I wanted to ask you, it\u2019s interesting to me that the focus on hybrid and hybrid cloud is starting to evolve, especially given where people thought we might end up just a couple of years ago, can you talk about how well formed you think your customers are. And I guess are they seeing or can they understand the real value that Cisco can deliver in hybrid implementations yet and how much missionary work you will still have to do?","Chuck Robbins","Yeah. Thanks, James. Look, here's a situation our customers find themselves in. If you contrast where they thought they were going to be four or five years ago, they thought that they were going to move to the cloud. And we've joked about it being a euphoric neighborhood, you know, where they just move and everything is simple and somewhere along the way, they find themselves with four or five cloud providers, multiple collaboration cloud providers, 100 SaaS providers, an explosion of IoT at the edge, and so what's happening is, and by the way, still, they still have private data centers with applications that can't be migrated to the cloud. ","They've now gotten to a place where certain applications they're repatriating from the cloud. And the reality is that, they've now find themselves with a more complicated environment than they had five years ago when they began this journey to simplification. So that's the irony. If you think about what I just described, there's only one piece of technology that is consistent across all of those things that I just talked about and that is the network. And so what's happening is a lot of the things that have to occur to help them navigate this need to happen in the network. ","And so that's where this whole policy automation strategy that we have is really important because for them to be able to deal with applications running anywhere, deal with users operating anywhere, the date it flows and the traffic flows are nothing that look like what led them to architect their networks the way they did a decade ago. And then couple that with security and the fact that security, you're not protecting a perimeter anymore, so it's not about a big fat honking firewall, it's about an architecture that really does have Integrated Security from the network to the cloud to the edge to email where you're built -- you're building a comprehensive integrated strategy where you're seeing threats in one area and you're protecting across all those domains ","So to answer your question, I think that two years ago, we had to convince customers that this is what we felt and today, I'd say most enterprise customers, they could present the whole set of slides to you before we even start talking about the challenges they face and the importance of the network going forward.","Chuck Robbins","Thanks for the last question. Thank you. I want to thank all of you for joining us today. I'll make a few closing comments. First of all, I think, our teams have executed incredibly well in light of a very complicated macro and geopolitical environment that we find ourselves in. Our engineering teams over last few years have delivered on innovation to a point where I will tell you that our portfolio is in the best shape it's been in years.","And I think we are in a very good position with our customers based on the strategies that they're deploying going forward. And I have a high degree of confidence in our ability to execute. When you look to the future, there's two elements we have to consider, there's geopolitical macro issues and will continue to navigate them to the best of our ability and then there's our own execution, which I think is probably near the peak of what our teams have done in quite a while. ","So we feel good about where we are. There's obviously a lot of variables, a lot of complexities, but we're pleased with what we accomplished last quarter. We feel good about next quarter, and we're going to continue to execute. Thanks for joining us.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks, Chuck. And I'm just going to wrap up here.

At the request of Cisco Systems, today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect.","Now I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Marilyn Mora - Director-Global Investor Relations, Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Kim. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's second quarter fiscal 2016 quarterly conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. And I am joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO, and Kelly Kramer, our CFO.","By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found on the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website.","Throughout this call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise.","The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we will discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details.","As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.","Please note that during Q2, on November 20 we completed the sale of the Customer Premises Equipment [CPE] portion of our SP Video Connected Devices [VCD] business to Technicolor. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP, and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from both the Q2, fiscal 2016, and historical results. We are providing Q2, fiscal 2016, and historical financial information for the SP Video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help to understand these impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q1 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way.","With that, I'd like to go ahead and turn it over to Chuck.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Marilyn. We delivered a strong Q2 in a challenging macro environment. Recently, we've experienced one of the most volatile times in the global markets. This volatility led to a slowdown in spending impacting our business, especially during the last few weeks of January as we closed our quarter.","Despite this slowdown, we executed very well, with total revenue growth of 2% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 8%, strong margins, and operating cash flow up 36%. Our ability to deliver strong profitability in a challenging environment reflects the operating leverage we've created in our business over the last several years.","Our portfolio is more strategic than ever to companies and countries that are digitizing everything. As billions of things become connected, creating massive amounts of data, Cisco is playing an increasingly critical role, enabling our customers to drive their priorities with industry-leading security. Cisco is unique in our ability to connect everything for our customers, from the sensor to the data center, with security and analytics. As a result, our conversations are no longer just in IT. They have become prevalent in the C-suite and the boardroom.","When I took this role two quarters ago, I discussed my focus on accelerating our innovation engine and portfolio transformation to execute on the opportunity ahead of us. I believe we are executing well, and I would like to highlight our momentum in four key areas.","First, we are defining the next generation of networking, beginning with the data center with our ACI platform providing the automation and programmability for our customers' most critical business applications, with the scale, speed, and security they require. In just two years, we have built ACI to a $2 billion run rate business that grew once again last quarter over 100%. We are aggressively focused on winning in the 10-gig, 40-gig, and 100-gig transition, and firmly establishing our leadership in the next-generation data center.","Second, security remains the most critical priority for our customers. And as everything connects, it makes the network even more relevant. As the largest security provider, we have been focused on driving the growth of this business, while at the same time migrating our model from a primarily hardware business to a software and services business. In Q2, not only did our security business grow 11%, but our security deferred revenue grew 26%.","Third, we saw double-digit growth in our cloud-based SaaS businesses, specifically WebEx, Meraki Cloud Networking, and security. You are seeing us move more of our portfolio to be delivered in both on-premise and cloud-based models, and we are aggressively driving this transition.","And fourth, we are using M&A to augment our internal innovation in key growth areas. In the last 12 months, we have added critical capabilities and talent in the growth areas of cloud, security, SaaS, IoT, and analytics. Our recently announced acquisition of Jasper combined with our other capabilities is a strong example of how we will play unique and strategic role in unlocking the value of IoT. We will enable our customers to monetize the data from the billions of sensors and connections with the security, speed, and reliability they have come to expect from Cisco. Our momentum reflects the uniqueness of our business model and our ability to weather volatility while accelerating innovation in key markets to drive our long-term growth.","Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more detail on our financials.","Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Chuck. I am pleased with our continued execution on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments, and delivering shareholder value.","Starting with delivering profitable growth, total revenue was $11.8 billion, up 2%, with product revenue growth of 2%, led by growth in security, routing, and collaboration. In switching, as Chuck mentioned, we are driving the next-generation data center architectures and are very pleased with our ACI momentum. The 4% decline in switching was largely driven by macro weakness in our campus business, something that we've observed in the past during volatile times as customers pause spending decisions. We saw our routing business grow 5%, driven by double-digit growth in our CRS platforms, with particular strength in mobility and web-scale service provider.","Collaboration grew 3%, driven by 17% growth in WebEx, partially offset by some slowdown in our Unified Communications business. Deferred revenues showed continued strength, growing 15%. Our data center decline of 3% was also driven by a slowdown in spend. In addition, we had tough comparisons from Q2 2015 when revenue grew 40%. UCS continues to be a strong franchise for us and is a foundational piece of our next-generation data center stack.","Wireless was flat as a result of declines in our access point controller business, offset by strong growth in our cloud-based Meraki platform. SP Video grew 37%, largely driven by strength in China. Security grew 11%, with deferred revenue growth of 26%. We had strong growth in our advanced threat security and Web security solutions, which grew over 180% and 40% respectively. We added over 2,000 customers on our AMP advanced malware solution, bringing the total customer base to over 10,000.","Services revenue grew 3%, and we continued to show very good progress against our goal of driving more recurring revenue. Deferred revenue had solid growth of 8% in total, with product up 11% and service up 7%. The portion of our product deferred revenue which is related to our recurring software and subscription businesses grew 34%. In total, product orders grew 2%. Our book-to-bill was approximately one.","Looking at our geographies, which is the primary way we run our business, Americas was flat, EMEA declined 1%, and APJC grew 17%. Total emerging markets grew 7%, with the BRICs plus Mexico [BRICM] showing strength at up 17%, with China up 64% and India up 23%. Total emerging minus the BRICM countries was down 3%.","In terms of customer segments, enterprise declined 2% and commercial grew 4%, both of which were impacted by macro uncertainty. Public sector was flat and service provider grew 5%.","We drove strong profitability, with discipline and rigor on gross margins and operating expense. Non-GAAP gross margin was 64.2%, with non-GAAP product gross margin of 63.3% and non-GAAP service gross margin of 66.7%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 33% of revenue, and non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 31.2%. We will remain disciplined with our operating expenses and portfolio management.","From a profitability perspective, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.57, up 8%, with $0.015 attributable to a lower non-GAAP tax rate resulting from the permanent reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit.","From a GAAP perspective, EPS was $0.62.","In addition to the typical reconciling items between GAAP and non-GAAP EPS, there were three material items to call out which we excluded from our non-GAAP results: the gain on the sale of the SP Video CPE business; the impact of the settlement of federal tax audit; and prior-year fiscal year impact of the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit. The total impact of these and other immaterial items was a benefit to GAAP EPS of $0.13.","Q2 non-GAAP net income was $2.9 billion, up 8%. GAAP net income was $3.1 billion.","So moving on to shareholder value, in Q2 we delivered operating cash flow of $3.9 billion, up 36%. Total cash, cash equivalents, and investments at the end of Q2 were $60.4 billion, with $3.9 billion available in the U.S.","In the first half of fiscal year 2016, we returned $4.6 billion or 75% of our free cash flow to our shareholders, comprised of $2.5 billion of share repurchases and $2.1 billion of dividends. Today we announced a 24% or a $0.05 increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.26 per share. This represents a yield of approximately 4.6% based on today's closing price. We also announced a $15 billion increase to the authorization of the share repurchase program, raising the remaining share repurchase authorization to approximately $16.9 billion. This significant dividend increase and additional share repurchase authorization reinforces our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows.","Overall, Q2 was a solid quarter in a volatile macro environment. We saw good top line growth, strong profitability, and operating leverage. We continue to shift our business model to more software and subscription recurring revenue.","Let me now reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. Q3 does include an extra week, which occurs every five to six years for us. We have factored this extra week into our guidance for both revenue and expenses. Although it is difficult to forecast the impact of the extra week, we have assumed roughly a 2% year-over-year impact on total revenue growth along with approximately $40 million of incremental cost of sales and $110 million of operating expenses.","The guidance for Q3 is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 1% to 4% year over year, normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from Q3 fiscal year 2015. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 62.5% to 63.5%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 28.5% to 29.5%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.54 to $0.56. We anticipate our GAAP EPS to be lower than the non-GAAP EPS by $0.08 to $0.12. Further details to this range are included in the slides and press release that accompany this call.","I'll now turn it back over to Chuck to summarize the call.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Kelly. Let me quickly summarize. While macro growth has clearly slowed, the speed with which technology is changing every industry and every country has not slowed, and we are moving full speed ahead. This speed coupled with our innovation, strategic partnerships, and our M&A capabilities will allow us to meet the expectations of our customers and lead into the future.","On this front, I feel very confident, and that conviction about our future business is what led us to increase our dividend by 24%. My confidence in our future is confirmed every day by CEOs, boards, and country leaders as we preview our strategy and roadmaps. They see the next-generation data center and cloud architectures we're building on UCS and ACI. They see our extensive security portfolio that protects them before, during, and after an attack. They see the IoT and analytics platforms that will enable them to act on and monetize data and connections, and they want us to be their strategic partner as they drive their digital agendas. They trust us. They value our innovation, and they believe our portfolio is critical to their ability to execute on their vision.","Our customers and countries around the world know this move to digital is real, and it's happening now. As we help them through this transition, you will see us operate on two fronts. In the near term, you will continue to see us to be a well-run company that executes even in challenging markets. Longer term, we will continue to make the right investments that will accelerate our growth as our customers embrace and adopt this next wave of technology.","Marilyn, I'll turn it back to you for questions.","Marilyn Mora - Director-Global Investor Relations, Cisco Systems, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Chuck. Kim, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. And while Kim is doing that, I'd like to remind the audience that, all analysts, we ask you to please ask one question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Pierre Ferragu with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.","Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, thank you for taking my question. Chuck, really what I'd like to understand is your perspective on the macro environment. So first of all, so you of course see Bloomberg TV and read the Financial Times, as we all do. But what do you see \u2013 what can you see through Cisco as you get feedback from your channels, from your salesforce, or country managers? What do they really tell you about and what color can you bring us that we don't necessarily see from where we are?","And also on the same front, on the macro environment, your guide for next quarter, what kind of macro scenario have you baked in? Would you qualify that as prudent, very prudent? And if you can take us through the thought process of how you came up with that guidance, that would be very helpful.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, Pierre. Hey, thanks for the question, good to hear from you. So on the macro front, I think the thing that I can tell you is that as we began last quarter, we certainly have a set of expectations as we have run our business for a long time and really know what to expect. And our expectations were obviously based on the discussions we had with all of you at the end of our first quarter.","And I would tell you that through the first 10 weeks of the quarter, that was very much in line with what we expected. We were executing very much in line with how we would have expected the quarter to go. And our week 10, just so you have the data point, was the end of the calendar year. So while a number of companies have reported earlier this year, not many have actually had their quarter end in January, so we ended at the end of the third week of January, which we all know those first three weeks were reflective of the uncertainty that occurred in a lot of the financial markets.","And so what I will tell you is that after week 10 through those three weeks, we saw customers as they were trying to just digest what was going on, they just paused a bit. And you see customers say I want to just wait and see what's going on. Let me take a look at this, we want to understand this a little better. And I think to Kelly's point when she talked about the switching business, the campus refresh opportunities that have been actually pretty consistent for us over the last few quarters, we saw customers say hey, our infrastructure is working, so we're going to just hold on that for some period of time and let's see where things go. So that's probably the extent that I can add to what we all know from what we're seeing every day.","What I would tell you, and I'll ask Kelly to comment on our guidance, is I would say that we took that sort of feeling of those first three weeks into consideration as we built our guidance, and that's what we based it on is what the last three weeks of last quarter led us to relative to this level of uncertainty. Kelly, any comments?","Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I think to your question, Pierre, I think Chuck summarized it well. When we do our guidance, we look at everything we know at the time, which is our funnel, the momentum we see and everything else. So I'd say to put it in the words you used, I'd say that our guidance is prudent. I think you see that we expanded our range to three points of range versus our normal two points just because I think it is more volatile than normal. And so I'd go with prudent based on what we see right now.","Marilyn Mora - Director-Global Investor Relations, Cisco Systems, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Pierre. Operator, we'll go ahead and take our next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank.","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, Kelly. Hi, Chuck.","Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Vijay.","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","My question is around Cisco is a tale of two cities here. We're seeing enterprise products trending light versus consensus, while your service provider products, routing, video, et cetera, are beating expectations. I'd like to get your view on this enterprise versus service provider dichotomy, if any.","And then you have a bigger picture strategy around software and you're cutting services, fully believing that strategy and model. So my question is really around, do you see IT spending skewing quickly towards OpEx versus the traditional CapEx model of spending? And how would Cisco be levered to this higher than usual OpEx IT spending moving forward? Thanks.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks, Vijay. I would say the initial question you asked relative to the difference between the enterprise and service provider space, I think what we saw was that our customers were spending in areas that are incredibly mission-critical for them even in these times where there's uncertainty. So you see them continuing to spend in security. You see them continuing to spend in the next-generation data center evolution, which was indicative of the 100% growth we saw in that portion of our portfolio. And I think we saw customers where they had the option to wait, they chose to wait a bit. So I don't view it as any \u2013 I don't see any fundamental issues relative to the enterprise portfolio or things like that. I think that it was largely just a prioritization effort that we saw within our customer base on the enterprise side.","On the service provider side, I think if you go back a couple of quarters, what I said was that our teams have been working hard to really get to alignment with our customers around the future of the industry, the future of their architectures, how they were going to evolve to position them for the opportunities ahead, and I think that we did that. And then I would say that our teams have really executed well over the last couple of quarters as they align with our service providers on those priorities across the portfolio. And so we're pleased with where we are. I don't think that if you really unpack those numbers over two or three quarters that you're going to see you'd be able to delineate a whole lot between what went on with the exception of the enterprise customers just prioritizing where they spent their money.","As it relates to the OpEx versus CapEx move, I'll ask Kelly, and maybe she can comment on the software part of the question. But I didn't see any fundamental change this quarter in how our customers look at that versus what they've been doing for the last three, four, five, six quarters. So it's something that we deal with as it relates to, as an example, our collaboration portfolio. We made announcements last quarter that all of that portfolio, the entire portfolio is now available, or we announced that it will be available to our customers from both an on-premise and a cloud-based perspective, and in many cases it will be a hybrid model. So to the extent that our customers would like to procure our solutions in that way, then we'll make that available to them. Kelly?","Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I think you summarized it well. On the software shift, Vijay, we are making great progress. Whether it's \u2013 internally we talk about how we're driving that in our software and SaaS businesses within collaboration and security. But also in other parts of our portfolio, we are really developing new offers, that there are ways to monetize our services and software along that way. So we'll continue to disclose more, especially as we look as our business and it becomes a bigger part of that. So I'd say it's progressing well. And we're adding to our models with acquisitions like OpenDNS and Jasper, which are both SaaS models. We'll continue to build that out as it becomes a bigger part of our portfolio.","On the IT to OpEx, just to add to what Chuck said, I'd say one thing that we have tremendous flexibility on is leveraging our great balance sheet to help provide solutions for whatever it is. So whether it's our Cisco capital offers or the ability of us to build managed service-as-a-service, those kind of offers, we're very active working with our customers that want different ways to consume our products and services differently; that we're coming up with all kinds of new solutions for different ways of consumption. And we have that flexibility because of our strong balance sheet. So I'd say we're making a lot of progress on both of those accounts.","Marilyn Mora - Director-Global Investor Relations, Cisco Systems, Inc.","All right, thanks, Vijay. Operator, our next question, please.","Operator","Okay, your next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, thank you very much. I just wanted to clarify first, Kelly, in terms of the two percentage point bump that you've embedded in the guidance for the extra week, that compares to four to five points that you guys saw last time you had this kind of pattern back in 2010. So I just wanted to understand if there's anything different this time, or if that's just an extra measure of conservatism.","and just more for the substantive question, Chuck, I heard your comments on the pause on the campus switching side of the business. I just wanted to also ask. What is happening on the data center side of your switching business? Is that returning to growth in the first half of this calendar year as you had expected it to? Any update there would be helpful. Thanks.","Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","All right. So, Simona, on the 2%, yes, great question. Let me give a little context there. So the last time we had this was in Q3 of fiscal year 2010, and it was about a 4% to 5% increase. I'd say what I baked into my 2%, so it's roughly about $250 million \u2013 $275 million. What I baked in the guidance is the incremental revenue I know that we will get from things like our services subscription businesses, our SaaS businesses, as well as some products around the distribution that we are seeing. So that's what I baked in the guidance. I am not assuming there's going to be a lot more because of the current macro environment. The sales guys are out there, the teams driving to a monthly number and a quarterly number.","And given the spending constraints that we're seeing right now, I'm not being over-bullish in my guidance on that. So that's how I'd build that up. Just to remind you, back in Q3 of 2010, our growth that quarter was 27%, so it was a much different macro environment.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, Simona, just the second part of your question, I think the word that we would use relative to how Kelly modeled in that would be the same that we talked about with Vijay, which would be prudent.","On the switching front, from a revenue perspective, it was negative this quarter. We're trying not to give you lots of random pieces of information every quarter so that we can build some consistency in how you guys look at how we're performing. But I will tell you that on the new order side on the data center switching business this quarter, we did see slightly positive growth on orders. And I would say in the context of that last three weeks that we felt in enterprise that we're cautiously optimistic.","Marilyn Mora - Director-Global Investor Relations, Cisco Systems, Inc.","Okay. Next question, please, operator?","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi.","James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great, thank you and congratulations to you and your team at Cisco. My question is now that it's been a few months with the new partnership and Ericsson, can you let us know if you have actually had any concrete wins or anything (27:22) showing up in the NGN segment of reporting, or is it too early to see or any anecdotes about that new partnership? Thank you and congratulations.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Jim. First of all, thanks for your favorable comments. I appreciate that. On the Ericsson front, we've seen \u2013 I will tell you that we've never seen \u2013 outside of Apple, we've never seen a partnership that has gotten so much energy and excitement inside the company. And as you know, on the Apple front, we are actually doing the development. I think Tim [Cook] alluded to it on his conference call that both companies are doing the development that we need to do to actually deliver that joint innovation to our customers.","But the Ericsson partnership has immediate opportunity with it, and we have begun to close transactions together. I would not translate that to a significant impact to any of the numbers that we put out there today because we're literally in the handful stage right now, but we do see that accelerating. We have a lot of focus on it with our teams. Hans [Vestberg], their CEO, and I are going to be together quite a bit in Mobile World Congress in a couple weeks, and we're also going to have a lot of the next-generation joint solutions that we are putting together for our customers that will be on display in both of our booths there. And Hans and I actually are on a panel together at Mobile World. So that partnership is going probably as well as we thought it would be at this point, and I think you'll really see the acceleration over the next 12 months.","Marilyn Mora - Director-Global Investor Relations, Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Jim, for the question. Operator, next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Moskowitz with Barclays.","Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. Just want to see if you can give us a little more context about how we should think about the routing glide path going forward the next few quarters given the nice growth you generated this past quarter. How much of it is related to the CRS-X cycle continuing? Does it have to do with more vertical penetration or service provider penetration? Just any color you can give us because what I'm trying to understand, can you still be in the 3% to 4% or 5% bogey for that business for the next couple quarters from a growth perspective?","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll speak to some of the areas of strength, and I'll let Kelly talk about the numbers and how we think about it going forward. But we did see strength in our core routing and we saw strength in enterprise access routing this past quarter. And we have some new products in our portfolio that are very early. And one of them was the co-development effort that I had talked about over the last couple of calls that we would expect to see some positive momentum out of over the next few quarters. And we've got some virtualized routing capabilities that our teams are working on. So I think the portfolio looks good. The pipeline looks good from an innovation perspective. And then, Kelly, any comments on how we think about the numbers going forward?","Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I think you summarized it well, Chuck. Really, I think we feel fantastic about the portfolio and we feel good about what it looks like. But I don't really give guidance by business unit just because there's a lot of volatility. But I would say we feel really good about how the portfolio is sitting and the new products that we've launched on that platform.","Marilyn Mora - Director-Global Investor Relations, Cisco Systems, Inc.","Okay. Operator, next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Bracelin with the Pacific Crest Securities.","Brent Bracelin - Pacific Crest Securities","Thank you, one clarification and one question, if I could. Chuck, just could you clarify? Was the pause you saw with customers the last couple weeks, was that global or was that concentrated in the Americas?","And then my question is really around APJC, the recovery you're seeing there, the recovery you're seeing in China. What's driving that? Is that sustainable? Is that easy compares? Walk us through what you're seeing in APJC that drove the rebound this quarter. I guess, A, is it sustainable?","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, thanks, Brent. On the pause that we saw, this is typical. When there's uncertainty in the market, we see enterprise customers, and they just basically say hey, look, let's just \u2013 let's wait. Let's see what's going to happen. They may say let's wait a week. They may say let's wait a couple weeks. And when you're in the last three weeks of your quarter, those kinds of decisions have an impact. So I just want to clarify.","And your specific question, we saw it pretty holistically I'd say around the globe. And then the other thing that we haven't really talked about is obviously outside the United States, we saw currency. We talked about it on the last call in Europe and Asia. That clearly continued and maybe even got a little worse in some places.","On the APJC recovery, the team there has done a great job. We've talked a lot about what we've seen happening in India. We've seen tremendous success there. We have \u2013 that's one of the key countries that we have a country digitization effort that John [Chambers] has been leading for us, and our business there continues to grow very well.","In China, which is the crux of your question, I would tell you that as we've navigated our way through the last three years, and I think, Brent, you and I have talked about the amount of time that I spent over there during that window, the team did a great job. And what they really did is they diversified our business strategy across customer segments, so not only being aligned to state-owned enterprises, but moving out and creating a commercial market strategy, moving out into second and third tier cities, so geographic diversification. And they really focused on their teams being able to sell our entire portfolio. So the good news is what I'll tell you is that the growth that we saw in China was very well balanced across our portfolio. We saw routing up. Kelly, keep me honest, but routing in double digits, switching in double digits.","Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Wireless.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Wireless in double digits, as well as SP Video in double digits. So it was a very balanced performance for the second quarter in a row. So there's clearly a lot of uncertainty out there, so we're going to take things a quarter at a time, but we're pleased with where they are.","Marilyn Mora - Director-Global Investor Relations, Cisco Systems, Inc.","Kim, we'll go ahead and take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much, just a couple of quick questions. First on acquisitions, you guys have been fairly active in the last few quarters. Should we expect this type of pace to persist both in terms of tuck-in acquisitions and maybe more detailed acquisitions?","And then the second question I had was security, it seemed like there was some acceleration in that business this quarter. Is that just the result of the SaaS model starting to accrue to the P&L, or was there underlying improvement in the billings and activity in that business? Thank you very much.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, James. So let me comment on the M&A activity that you've seen. We have built a strategic framework that is guiding us for what we believe we need to have in our portfolio and the architectures that we need to be able to build relative to cloud, security, analytics, SaaS, IoT. We have built that framework with our team in the first two or three months that I was in the role. We then stepped back and looked at where do we have R&D activities that are going to build some of these opportunities, and where are there opportunities like what we saw with Jasper where we can move and actually fill a substantive portion of our portfolio. And so that's what's driving us.","It's very much connected to our broader strategy and connected to what I believe that our customers care about in the future. And I would say that you should expect us to continue the pace. And obviously valuations in today's market, that's one piece of good news, is that they're more attractive. As it relates to \u2013 I'm blanking on the second part of your question.","Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Security.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sorry, security, thank you. On the security front, I would say that it is primarily, and Kelly can just again keep me honest on the deferred piece of this if it's flowing through. But what we talked about was the integration of the Sourcefire assets as well as the Cisco assets as well as other acquisitions we made along the way, plus the other innovation that our teams internally have done. And that has \u2013 we put all that together about two quarters ago, and we told you that we thought that this would continue to improve, and our teams have driven that. And when you look at that advanced malware portfolio, and we added yet another 2,000 customers this quarter, so we're up to 10,000, which is they've really done a great job of executing on that strategy.","And then during the quarter, we also launched our next-generation firewall product that we need to get out in the marketplace for obvious reasons, and so we're hoping for similar success. But I think primarily it's because of continued improvement in the portfolio and the work our team has done. I wouldn't suggest that there's a significant revenue impact coming back in from the deferred yet, although we are seeing...","Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","That's what we expected, what we said a couple quarters ago. So that ramp that we talked about a few quarters ago is happening in addition to the growth that you're highlighting in just the core businesses.","Marilyn Mora - Director-Global Investor Relations, Cisco Systems, Inc.","Kim, let's go ahead and take our next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities.","Jess I. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, guys. I also have two quick ones. First for Chuck, I was hoping you could provide some additional details regarding the weakness in the data center business, what changed there, how you expect that to progress moving forward.","And then for Kelly with respect to capital allocation, it seems like you have a little bit less than $4 billion in U.S. cash, yet you materially raised the dividend and the buyback. So I was hoping to understand if we should be expecting a debt raise, and to what degree this means any acquisitions we may see are likely to be on the smaller side. Thanks.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Jess. So I'm surprised we got this far in the questions before someone asked about data center, so I was beginning to worry. We track that business very closely obviously. And largely what we believe is that it is connected to the broader macro issue. That data center business has a strong buying season that actually runs into the end of December. And while it is a fantastic franchise for us that has contributed and will contribute to not only our success in the data center in the past, but also our success in the next-gen data center as we build next-generation data center stacks going forward, but we also believe that in the December quarter that we actually still gained share with that performance.","We had a tough comp from a year ago, 40%. But I'll tell you the other thing we looked at is that even with the lower performance, it still remained the same percentage of our business this quarter that it was last quarter, that it was a quarter a year ago, which says that just in my mind, it says it suffered at the same rate that the rest of the business did from the macro. Kelly, the second part of the question?","Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So on capital allocation, so overall, our strategy around capital allocation hasn't changed. We want to give a minimum of 50% back to our shareholders. We've been listening to our shareholders, and the bottom line is we feel very, very good about our business model and our ongoing cash flows. You saw our operating cash up 36% this quarter that we thought we'd increase the amount of our dividend sustainably going forward. So it's a blend. We also increased our authorization just as we would normally would increase our authorization, the $15 billion.","In terms of flexibility, yes, we will be accessing debt in the near future. Again, that's one of the benefits of our balance sheet, and our access to capital is very, very good. So we will continue to do that until anything changes with our overseas cash. But it does not change our flexibility in any way in terms of acquisitions. When we think through these capital allocation decisions, we're playing out what we're thinking about acquisition-wise, how we're building that out, as well as our future cash flow. So I think no change to our acquisition strategy. It does not hamper us in any way. We have easy access to capital. And again, we wanted to share some of that cash back with our shareholders.","Marilyn Mora - Director-Global Investor Relations, Cisco Systems, Inc.","Okay, let's move on to the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Kvaal with Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Yes, thanks very much. I have a few margin questions, Kelly, for you, perhaps.","Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Okay.","Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Can you talk a little bit about the drivers inside of the gross margin structure? It was a little bit ahead of plan this quarter. It seems to be going back to normal next quarter. And what are the moving parts there? The second part of that is on the operating margins. I know 30% is the target. When should we be thinking about that, and how much progress are you making in that regard?","Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So on gross margins, we continue to be very focused on margins, and we look at it as all the different levers in there. So as you know, we continually have some price erosion, and we use price as a lever to drive selling. Our price erosion has remained very, very disciplined. You'll see that it's been in the normal ranges that we have been in the last quarter and actually slightly better than a year ago, so that continues. We're getting real traction, continued traction from our engineers and supply chain on the productivity side. So for the price erosion we have, we're more than offsetting it with productivity, and we're continuing to drive those projects to continue to do that so we can have that flexibility to make sure we're taking advantage of all opportunities for growth out there. So that's continuing.","On the operating margin side, again, we're going to be smart about managing the overall equation. We want to make sure we're taking advantage and investing in the right areas to be able to take advantage of future growth and balancing that equation. There is a bit of goodness coming through at the OM line because of FX favorability that you guys are aware of that falls to the bottom line. But in general, I'd say that we're being very disciplined in terms of how we make these trade-offs and balance the bottom line with the investments we're trying to make to accelerate growth.","Marilyn Mora - Director-Global Investor Relations, Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Kelly. Let's go ahead and take our next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks and congrats, guys, on strong execution. I wanted think a little bit ahead, Kelly, just given this extra week that you had in the guidance. Historically, as you move into your fourth quarter, you typically post a solid sequential increase quarter over quarter. As we lose this week, should we assume a little bit more of a flattish performance then into July versus April?","And then regarding the software and SaaS, clearly you're making very good progress over there. Is there a way to quantify, from your standpoint, how much of growth are you giving up right now as you transition businesses, more and more of your products, into those type of purchasing model, how much of a growth headwind this transition is impacting you near term?","Kelly A. Kramer - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So on the extra week, this is, I think, how you can think about it. So I tried to be pretty transparent of what we're assuming in there. So literally, the $250 million or so, the $275 million that we're assuming literally is just the businesses where it's just going to \u2013 because we have weekly billing is going to amortize off our balance sheet. That is basically a guarantee, and just marginally a little bit more for some of the distribution and flow business. So I would say as you are modeling for Q4, I think you should assume the normal ranges. Take that out, that $250 million to $275 million, and assume the normal ranges of growth in Q4.","On software and SaaS, I know you and others ask me this question a lot. It's tough to quantify. Certainly it's a point or two easy to say off the top. Some of the businesses we're growing are businesses that we've had that are great, like collab and security. We are adding more to this profile with some of these different offers, like these big enterprise ELAs we have. It's just hard to quantify it for any one quarter of when it's going to fall in. But there's certainly something on the top line, but we'll see that come back through as we continue to build that out and amortize it.","Marilyn Mora - Director-Global Investor Relations, Cisco Systems, Inc.","Okay, Kim. Let's go ahead and take our next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great, thank you very much. A quick clarification. Strength in Service Provider Video, I think you highlighted China. If you could, just talk to what you think the duration is.","And then in terms of market verticals, I was interested if you could talk a little bit more about your exposure to what we've often called Web 2.0 or Web-scale operators. Certainly there's the idea that they buy white box, but we know you sell to them. So I'd like to get a sense of your exposure and the trends from that group of customers, if we might.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Simon. Thanks. This is Chuck. So on the SP Video front, I think that the team has done a great job of evolving that portfolio and really building some great solutions. They're engaged with lots of customers. Our strategy when we divested of the Video CPE business was to really focus on a cloud-based delivery model, and that is occurring. And we're having obviously good success with that platform in China. And that tends to be an ongoing \u2013 a longer-term solution that the customers deploy, so we'll see. Again, we're taking things quarter by quarter, but we feel good about where they are there.","On the second part of your question relative to the Web-scale guys, we've talked the last couple of quarters about how we had been having success with them. And I talked about us really changing our strategy about 18 months ago and moving more into a collaborative co-development mode with them thinking about what their very unique needs are. And I'll tell you that our business with them last quarter grew 17%, so we continue to see relatively good strength with those customers.","Marilyn Mora - Director-Global Investor Relations, Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Chuck. We'll go ahead and take our next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. Hey, Chuck, maybe just to go back to the data center, if we could, I get the macro and the tough compares there. Just looking more broadly at that market, I think the share gains are starting to normalize a little bit, at least in the server market. So when you think about the continued growth on the hardware side of the data center, do you think we need to broaden the server offering, maybe get more involved in storage or ADC or some other products that are important to the data center that Cisco might not fully be participating in? Thank you.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Tim. It's good to hear from you, and that is a very good question. And what I would tell you is that we are currently \u2013 we have a lot of work going on around the future next-generation data center and what the future stacks look like in that data center, which will be a combination of infrastructure hardware with a heavy dose of software and orchestration. And you can assume that we're looking at our role up and down that stack going forward.","I would tell you that there was a recent article I think late last week, last week in InfoWorld where Biri Singh actually outlined how we're thinking about this market. So you're spot-on, and we are spending a lot of time thinking through what role we play there and what the opportunity is, but we believe it's going to be significant. So I appreciate the question. Tim, thanks.","Charles H. Robbins - Chief Executive Officer & Director","That was apparently the last question we have, so I'm going to close with just some short comments. I am incredibly pleased with how we executed this quarter. And as I said, in a very uncertain macro environment, our teams did a great job.","And as we look forward, I think about how we're operating the company on these two fronts. The first front is that we will continue to execute and run this company in a well-managed way, even in challenging environments. But at the same time, we're going to move full speed ahead. And the second front is we are going to make the long-term investments and build our strategy and the architectures and the solutions that our customers need. And I believe that our growth will accelerate as our customers embrace and move towards this next wave of technology that's going to fundamentally change every company and every country around the world.","I believe we can do both, and I think that will allow us to take advantage of the incredible opportunity ahead of us, and I have a great deal of confidence in our ability to execute against that.","So thank you for spending time with us today, and we look forward to talking to you soon.","Marilyn Mora - Director-Global Investor Relations, Cisco Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Chuck. Cisco's next quarterly call, which will reflect our fiscal 2016 third quarter results, will be on Wednesday, May 18, 2016, at 1:30 PM Pacific Time, 4:30 PM Eastern Time.

At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded [Operator Instructions].","Now, I would like to introduce, Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks, Michelle. Welcome everyone to Cisco's First Quarter Fiscal 2020 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. And I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our Web site in the Investor Relations section following the call.","As discussed in early in Q1, we have made certain reclassifications to prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information, can also be found in the financial information section of our Investor Relations Web site. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise.","All comparisons made throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for second first quarter of fiscal 2020. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.","In Q2 of fiscal 2019, we completed the sale of our SPVSS business and accordingly, had no revenue or expense from that business in Q1 fiscal 2020. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP and product orders information we will be discussing today is normalized to exclude the SPVSS business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SPVSS business in the slides that accompany this call and on our Web site to help to understand these impacts. The guidance we provided during our Q4 earnings call has been normalized in the same way.","I will now turn it over to Chuck.","Chuck Robbins","Thanks Marilyn. We delivered a solid quarter against a challenging macro environment. While we're pleased with this performance, we're most focused on the environment as we move forward. We'll discuss this more in a moment. What's happening inside Cisco regardless of the macro is an unrelenting focus on driving innovation, transforming our business and exceeding our customers' expectations. ","In Q1, as you've seen, we have revenue growth of 2% and double digit non-GAAP earnings per share growth. We also delivered strong non-GAAP gross margins and non-GAAP operating margins along with solid operating cash flow. We continued to invest in innovation and expand our market opportunities, while maintaining our commitment to maximizing shareholder return.","Over the last year, many of you have heard me talk about the resilience of the global macro environment. However, on our last earnings call, we indicated that we had begun to see some weakness and that weakness continued throughout Q1 and was more broad-based. While the main challenges continue to be service provider in emerging markets, this quarter we also saw relative weakness in enterprise and commercial. Despite these headwinds and because of key decisions we made four years ago to change our business model, we remain well positioned to capitalize on the tremendous opportunities across cloud, automation, 5G, security and collaboration.","Our transition to software continues to progress and we are on track with where we said we would be at the end of fiscal year 2020. This transition to software not only aligns to how our customers want to consume our technology, but we also believe it will lessen the impact of macroeconomic shifts in the future. Despite the current uncertainty, our innovation pipeline remains strong. At our annual partner summit last week, we announced several exciting additions to our portfolio, including network automation and analytics, cloud based networking, collaboration, as well as new security capabilities. Over the next couple of months, you will see us deliver even more innovation to help our customers achieve their business objectives.","Now, I'd like to share some recent highlights across the business. Our enterprise networking portfolio continued to grow as customers increasingly adopt our intent-based networking portfolio, spanning our Catalyst 9000 family of switches, Meraki cloud based platforms and next generation data center solutions. Our customers today are running applications across multiple cloud environments and this shift requires a fundamental change in how they build their networks and their security architectures. To help them achieve this, we are automating connectivity across any cloud. A good example of this is our recently announced partnership with Microsoft to help our customers improve network connectivity with the highest level of security from branch offices to cloud based applications by integrating Cisco's SD-WAN solution with Azure\u2019s virtual WAN.","To further extend our enterprise networking leadership, we continue to expand our cloud managed network and security offerings. Last week, we also announced an expansion of our Meraki portfolio, including continued integration between Meraki's dashboard and Cisco's switching portfolio, as well as innovative new LTE based WAN connectivity solutions. We believe our planned acquisition of Acacia will also play a critical role in building upon the strength of our switching, routing and optical networking portfolio. By utilizing our innovations across silicon, software and optics, we are enabling our customers to transform their networks.","Now let's turn to security, which is always at the heart of everything we do. It's deeply integrated into the fabric of our entire portfolio to help secure our customers' data and address their modern application and multi cloud environments. Cyber security continues to be a top concern for our customers as they evolve their enterprise architectures to address the challenges of an ever changing threat environment.","We have the most comprehensive integrated cyber security platform in the market designed to enable our customers to securely connect any application running on any cloud and deliver to any device. We've been building an expansive zero trust framework for securing access across the workforce, the workplace and the workload. As the leader in zero trust, our customers are increasingly turning to us to help them extend simple and trusted access to their users in hybrid and multi cloud environments.","This is leading to strong uptake of Duo, our identity access management solution, which provides continuous authentication, ensuring the right people are able to access the right applications. To further reduce complexity in our customers' environments, we recently announced new enhanced capabilities in our firewall, breach defense, endpoint protection and Talos incident response solutions. These innovations are designed to provide greater threat protection and enhance the benefits of our platform. We also continue to leverage AI and ML capabilities through our industry leading threat intelligence platform Talos, along with Stealthwatch and Umbrella to bring our customers simplicity, visibility and insight that no other company can deliver.","Moving to applications. We are rapidly becoming the center of our customer strategy for empowering teams and increasing productivity, as 95% of the Fortune 500 use our collaboration portfolio. This is leading to the solid performance in our businesses as growing number of customers adopt our unique solutions.","During the quarter, we expanded our offerings to empower our customers for the modern workplace protecting data from ever increasing cyber threats and delivering highly secure productivity and collaboration solutions. A good example of this is our next generation WebEx, our cloud based team collaboration platform, enabling better teamwork while helping users stay secure with integrated end-to-end encryption.","We also launched Single Platform Advantage, delivering all collaboration workloads, including calling, messaging, meeting and contact center from a single platform. In addition, we announced our new Cisco WebEx Edge for devices, as well as hardware-as-a-service options for phones, desks and room-based video systems.","We're raising the bar for the industry by continuing to drive innovation in our expanding family of cognitive collaboration offers with AI and ML integrated capabilities. During the quarter, we acquired CloudCherry, a market leading customer experience management solution to augment our contact center portfolio with cloud analytics and AI to increase productivity and enhance user experiences. We also achieved a strong quarter in our App Dynamics business with yet another quarter of double digit growth,","Our investments in App Dynamics have made Cisco the leader in application monitoring and analytics. We're helping our customers transform their digital businesses through our comprehensive portfolio of solutions that turns data into actionable real time insights by linking application performance to business outcomes.","To summarize, while we remain in a challenging macroeconomic environment, I'm proud of our progress, both in our own continued transformation and in how we are empowering customers to drive their own transformation and shift to the cloud. We have a clear vision and strategy and are executing well against it to capture the many opportunities ahead. I feel great about our portfolio and I believe fully in our customers' commitment to our technology solutions. We will also continue to invest in organic and inorganic innovation to position Cisco for the long term. We also remain committed to managing our business to ensure we drive the greatest long term value for our customers, employees, partners and shareholders.","Now, let me turn it over to Kelly.","Kelly Kramer","Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by the guidance for Q2. Our overall Q1 results were solid. We executed well with revenue growth and strong margins, net income and EPS. Total Revenue was $13.2 billion, up 2%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 33.6%, up 1.3 points; non-GAAP net income was $3.6 billion, up 5%; and non-GAAP EPS was $0.84, up 12%.","Let me provide some more detail on our Q1 revenue. Total product revenue was up 1% to $9.9 billion. Infrastructure platform was down 1%. All of the businesses were up except for routing. Switching had growth in both campus and data center with the continued ramp of the Cat9K and strength of the Nexus 9K.","Wireless grew driven by Meraki. Data center had solid growth, led by HyperFlex. Routing declined due to weakness in service provider. Applications was up 6% with growth across all the businesses, including double digit growth in app dynamics. Security was at 22% with strong performance in Identity and Access, advanced threat, unified threat and web security. Service revenue was up 4%, driven by software and solution support. And we continue to transform our business delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 71% of total software revenue, up 12 points year-over-year. When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our Q1 results year-over-year, there was a 50 basis point positive impact on revenue. In terms of orders in Q1, total product orders were down 4%.","Looking at the geographies, Americas and EMEA were each down 3% and APJC was down 5%. Total emerging markets were down 13% with the BRICS plus Mexico down 26%. In our customer segments, public sector was up 6%, enterprise and commercial were each down 5% and service provider was down 13%.","Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, at the end of Q1 were $24.9 billion, up 11%. RPO is our total deferred revenue plus unbilled differed and represents total committed non-cancelable future revenue. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q1 gross margin was 65.9%, up 1.7 points. Product gross margin was 66.1%, up 2.5 points and service gross margin was 65.4%, down 0.4 points. In terms of the bottom line from a GAAP perspective, Q1 net income was $2.9 billion and EPS was $0.68.","We ended Q1 the total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $28 billion. Operating cash flow was $3.6 billion, down 5%. Normalized for the $400 million legal settlement we received from a risk debt in Q1 of fiscal '19, operating cash flow was up 7%. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $0.8 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline.","During Q1, we closed four acquisitions all in the applications area. These moves are consistent with our strategy of increasing investment in innovation and R&D for our growth areas. To summarize, we had a solid Q1. We executed well with top line growth and strong profitability. We're seeing the returns on the investments we're making in innovation, and driving the shift to more software and subscription, delivering long term growth and shareholder value.","Let me reiterate our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal '20. This guidance includes the type of forward looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier; we expect revenues to decline in the range of minus 3% to minus 5% year-over-year; we anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64.5% to 65.5%; the non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 32.5% to 33.5%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 20%; non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.75 to $0.77.","I'll now turn it back to Marilyn. So we can move into the Q&A.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks, Kelly. Michelle, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. And while Michelle is doing that, I'd like to ask the audience to address one question only, so that we have plenty of time for the others. Michelle, I'll turn it over to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer, you may go ahead.","Ittai Kidron","Chuck, maybe you can kind of walk us through a little bit kind of how the quarter evolved as far as the demand pattern. You're talked about weakness became, first of all, more broad based but also started into the enterprise and commercial. Any more color you can give us there, either from a product or regional standpoint. And with regards to your working assumptions into the next quarter, into the January quarter, is it your assumption that the intensity of the softness you're seeing right now will just stay as is, or getting worse? Help us think about the framework you have in mind when you give the guidance.","Chuck Robbins","If you recall in the last earnings call, I did say that we began to see some early signs of some macro impact towards the end of Q4. And then we just basically saw that continue throughout the quarter and as obviously the entire quarter was worse than we had expected when we began. And it was fairly broad based. It was -- I mean Kelly just read the regional numbers off from an orders perspective. So you saw negative 3, negative 3, negative 5, from Americas, EMEA and Asia.","I'd say across the technology areas, it was pretty broad based. The segments that we saw, public sector continue to be strong but the rest were -- enterprise commercial did weaken. Service provider and emerging markets, which were stressed last quarter, were about the same. We had shown the ability to offset that with strength in commercial, and enterprise and public sector. And when those weakened, obviously this quarter that impacted our ability to offset them.","And while all that might seem like this excuse, it also had to happen in a quarter where we did have incredibly tough compare. So this is the worst quarter that could have occurred for us. But that's really what we saw. As far as what we've modeled going forward, we've effectively assumed that it will stay as is. I don't think -- we haven't modeled any material further deterioration or improvement, I think than what we what we put forward today.","Operator","Thank you. Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan, you may go ahead.","Samik Chatterjee","Chuck, thanks for the detail on the last question. I just wanted to get a sense of what you're hearing from your customers in terms of are you hearing that if some of the trade aspects of that are depressing the macro get resolved. Do you expect some of them to come back in terms of spending, what are you hearing from your customers? And if you can give us an update on the order trends in China as well that would be helpful?","Chuck Robbins","So from the customers, it feels like there's not a broad base loud noise out there. It feels like there's a bit of a pause. We saw things like conversion rates on our pipeline were lower than normal, which says that things didn't closed the way we've historically seen it. We didn't see any incremental loss ratios. It was really just stuff slipping. We saw some large deals get done but got done smaller. Kelly and I were involved in a couple personally that we saw that when we began talking to the customers about the transactions and by the time they got done, they were smaller than when we have begun. So that happened. And then we just saw deals that slipped, and so we saw little bit of all that.","But it's not -- I'd say we also had our teams telling us that the approval process in several customers across different number of industries were changing, which is usually indicative of, hey, let's add another signature requirement, because we want to just put another set of eyes on every expenditure right now. So those are the things we've seen. And unfortunately, I've done this long enough that I've seen it before. So you recognize it when you see it, and that's really effectively what we saw during the quarter. In China, Kelly was\u2026","Kelly Kramer","China continued its decline. It was down 31% versus last quarter we -- it was down 26%. So that momentum continuing to just accelerate the decline in China.","Operator","Thank you. Paul Silverstein from Cowen, you may go ahead.","Paul Silverstein","Kelly, if you could tell us pricing, I know we're going to see in the Q. But if you could tell us the rate of price erosion, if there has been a change. And then if I did the math correctly on OpEx, it looks like your guidance would suggest around $3.8 billion for the January quarter, that'd be down $400 million sequentially and $150 million year-over-year. Do I have that right? Is that the way you're thinking about it? And related to that, how should we think about OpEx going forward throughout the year? How do you plan on managing expenses given the less than expected revenue outlook?","Kelly Kramer","So let me take those. So on price, we had a really very, very good quarter on price. It is the lowest in some time in terms of the least amount of price erosion. So from impact on our product gross margin rate, Paul, which is I know the metric you're looking at, it was only 40 basis points. Now I will say, that's great, and I think we've done a lot of great things on our pricing. For example, we've been selectively -- where we have price elasticity, we will raise prices, and we've been effective on driving some product transitions and we've been realizing that benefit.","I will say we are starting to see, we didn't feel the impact of it this quarter, but we are starting to see pricing pressure in the server market that we expect to accelerate next quarter, but that's, of course, including the guide. But for Q1, it was a very, very strong pricing quarter, which has been fantastic. From an OpEx perspective, if you play down the ranges I just gave you, it does show that OpEx will be down and how you're thinking about it. And yes, we are managing it like we always do, which is balancing the investments we're making plus driving trade off and cost out. So you're looking at it correctly and that's what we're driving it to.","Paul Silverstein","Kelly, the real question is, can operating margin go up with revenue being slightly down, could you drive higher operating margin\u2026","Kelly Kramer","So let me break down the margins overall, because I think that is the key question. I would say our margins are -- there's positive certainly driving the margin increase that you're seeing and you're seeing that in the guide. On the positive side, we are definitely feeling the positive impact of the software mix on our margins. So that is driving benefit to us just purely on the increased software content that we have and what we're selling, so that's helping tremendously.","I do think we're going to see some more pricing erosion as we go forward for some of the things that are specific, like of course, the server market is going to get tougher now that the DRAM prices are going down. So that will be a little bit of a negative next quarter, but that's okay. And then of course, we are still benefiting from the DRAM price decrease related to the server market, that we started to feel the benefit of a couple quarters ago. It's a very large impact this quarter favorable to us that will I expect to continue next quarter. But after that, as you recall, we started seeing the benefit on the Q3 of '19. So that'll become less of a year-over-year favor ability for us. And then, we'll see what happens to the pricing there.","So net-net to your question, I don't think it will stay at this rate that we delivered in Q1, which is the highest than it's been, because of those key things. But the underlying trends are all going in the right direction with software that's benefiting and driving the favorable mix. And then the real strong product management we're doing around managing pricing elasticity.","Operator","Thank you. James Faucette from Morgan Stanley Investment Research, you may go ahead.","James Faucette","I'm wondering, Chuck, or Kelly or maybe both of you. Can you talk a little bit about the order of growth versus your current expectations for economic development? Clearly, Chuck, as you pointed out and Kelly, we saw weakness kind of across the board in orders. But if we think about kind of a relatively flat environment from here going forward, as you said you're forecasting on. How long does it take us to start to get to more of a flattish and then even recovering order book in that kind of scenario and environment? Thanks a lot.","Chuck Robbins","Kelly, I'll let you handle that.","Kelly Kramer","James, that's a tough question, right? I mean, I'd say, certainly, the headwinds we have right now are going to be with us I think in the short term. Again, whether it's just the -- I don't see any catalyst to changed momentum right now with uncertainty and business confidence in the macro like Chuck talked about. I do think from a portfolio perspective, obviously, we feel good about portfolio and you're seeing still, regardless of macro the improvement we're making on the software metric that continues regardless.","Going forward, we do have easier compares as the second half comes around, it's not that that's a big victory but that is the reality. And I think we're just going to keep executing through whatever the macro is. I don't know if you want to add, Chuck.","Chuck Robbins","James, I would say that, if you just go around the world right now and you look at what's happening in Hong Kong, you look at the China-U.S. trade situation, you look at what's going on in DC. You've got Brexit. And you've got uncertainty in Latin America. I mean, I think it's -- in any of those that are big issues if they get resolved then you could see some of the uncertainty removed, and I think that's what -- business confidence just suffers when there's lack of clarity. And there's been lack of clarity for so long that I think it's finally just came into play.","So I think, you're probably able to guess that, as well as we are, based on some of these bigger issues sort of coming to some level of conclusion. And then obviously, we have the elections coming in next year that we have to see how they work. But I will reiterate what Kelly said. Despite the order growth rate, this software transition that we've been embarking on is going exactly as we planned. It continued this quarter. We had solid results in our software portfolio again this quarter. And we put up some numbers at our analyst conference that we said we would hit by the end of 2020, we're on track to get there. So we feel good about that. And we're going to keep on executing.","I think the teams have done a phenomenal job of getting our portfolio in the position that it's at. And that's why I said I have full confidence that our customers are committed to these technologies, just because they pause and we see a slowdown in one quarter. I think for the long term, we're in good shape, and I feel good about where we are.","Operator","Thank you. Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs, you may go ahead, sir.","Rod Hall","I wanted to ask about the commercial order rate deterioration. I think last quarter you guys hadn't really seen much deterioration at that at the end of the quarter. And then I'm assuming through this quarter, it's been getting worse. But wondering if you could just comment on what you're seeing there in that particular market. And regionally, are you seeing -- is it mainly in U.S. where you see that weakness, do you see the weakness all over the place. Just any further color you could give there would be helpful.","Chuck Robbins","Rod, that was one of the big -- that's a good question. That was one of the big signals to us that this thing is -- that there's definitely something going on to, because the commercial business is usually fairly resilient. And it was broad based across the globe in each of the regions. I think all three were negative. So it was it was broad based. But I think that also be one of the first to bounce back when we start seeing that come back, that's a good sign.","Operator","Thank you. Tejas Venkatesh from UBS, you may go ahead.","Tejas Venkatesh","I wonder if you could provide more color on what you're seeing in the U.S. service provider business and also more broadly, how you're thinking about the service provider vertical going forward. Obviously, it's been weak for a while, but assuming that that environment stays that way. Are there product refreshes and so forth coming down the pipe that can better the year-over-year trends? Thank you.","Chuck Robbins","So in the U.S., I think it's pretty clear if you just follow what's going on with the major players here, and we talked about this on the last call that they're currently focused on building out their trials and then their broader consumer based 5G services. And that's an area that frankly they'll run most of that traffic across their existing networks. We've said that when they begin to build out the broad based enterprise service delivery 5G networks that that's where we would really come into play on helping re-engineer backbones for higher throughput and more traffic. And I would suspect that we'll see them start to do some of that maybe in the second half of 2021, we'll have to see how fast they get moving.","And we have some announcements coming over the next couple of months that I think line up with what they're trying to accomplish. And so we'll see how it moves. But that's the transition that we would be looking for that could help get this business to a little better position. It was -- and on a global basis, I'll tell you, it was -- it got much weaker in Europe. It was about the same in the U.S., I think. And we've had some pockets of strength in Asia. Outside of China, we had some strength in, particularly in Japan. So as we've always said about this business, it's so big deal driven. But for right now, I think that's the story of what we see.","Operator","Thank you. Tal Liani with Bank of America, you may go ahead, sir.","Tal Liani","So if I take a five quarter view, six quarter view, on your results, not just this quarter on the guidance, I see constant deterioration in the growth rate, organically from about 4.5% now we're getting to minus 5%, or I have to look exactly at the guidance where we are. And the question I have is, not about the environment but rather about the portfolio. If you ignore the environment as much as we can, what can you do with the portfolio in order to change the trend line and reaccelerate the growth? Maybe even start with, can you identify what are the weak areas versus what are the strong areas and then what's in your power to change versus something that may take longer? Thanks.","Chuck Robbins","Tal, it's a good question and that's actually what we spend every day doing. I will tell you that we saw strength, continued strength in the campus refresh in the portfolio that we brought forward there, which obviously, if you think about what we've been doing over the last couple of years, and I made a comment in my opening remarks about this is, we have now transitioned our entire enterprise networking portfolio to a mandatory subscription model and those products and that those area, those new products are still, they're growing very strongly right now as customers continue to deploy.","So one of the big things we want to do is continue to transition towards the software model. We had 30 years of a net 30 CapEx model. So it's, we're in the midst of that transition. We're making progress on the timeline that we expected. That's the biggest strategic thing I think we can do. From a portfolio perspective, I think you have -- if you go across the portfolio, we made a lot of new announcements last week, we've got new announcements coming up. And I think that, clearly, we have a lot of customers that are still buying a lot of stuff.","So while there's a slowdown, I think there's still meaningful value that our customers are seeing with our technology, and we'll continue to do everything we can to try to find those areas that resonate the most right now. I think you saw you see it with security given the importance of that technology to them. And we're working on some other things that we haven't announced yet. So we're going to continue to do all the things that you described.","Operator","Thank you. Jim Suva from Citigroup Global Markets, you may go ahead, sir.","Jim Suva","Obviously, you laid out a lot of the details about the challenges. When we look back historically over Cisco, their history, the last time we kind of saw such negative trends, were kind of July 2017. There was kind of about a fourth quarter pause before recovery. Is there anything different about it this time? And some people will say, well, white boxes starting to hurt you a lot. Is it white boxes? Is it generally macro? Or why wouldn't it be, like four quarters, like what we saw last year in 2017? Thank you.","Chuck Robbins","First of all, I think that given the broad based and the rapid change that we saw, I don't believe it's anything like white box or anything like that. It's broad across the portfolio. It's broad across geographies. And we're, as Kelly said, obviously, in the second half. We don't like to talk about comps. But the math is different in the second half of the year. But we also have all the things that I just talked about with Tal. We also have this Wi-Fi 6 transition.","At some point, we will have some spinning going on around the 5G backbone transitions. We got 400 gig coming next year. So there are a lot of things. And I also believe that our customers, they will pause for a while. But technology is so absolutely core to their fundamental strategies that it just seems to me that the time that they're going to be able to pause is going to be shorter than what you would have seen in the past. I mean, they worry about their competitors' investments, they worry about falling behind.","So I think they'll hit the pause button because of all the uncertainty. I think we have to just see how long it lasts in today's world, given the strategic value of all the technology. And frankly, everything that we're building is incredibly important to them as they deal with this new cloud world and re-architecting their traffic flows and their security architecture. And there's only so long they're going to build a pause on doing that. But we'll see how it turns out.","Operator","Thank you. Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo, you may go ahead.","Aaron Rakers","I want to go back to kind of the comments earlier made around kind of the software expansion, and kind of progressing to what you laid out at past analyst days. If I recall, it seemed to kind of map out that you would have about 20% of your total kind of revenue being -- product revenue being contributed from software. As we think about the product portfolio and the push to subscription, is that the right trajectory to think about? And as we look even beyond that, could you see even higher mix of kind of just recurring nature of your business? I'm just trying to understand what more is left to kind of build out the product portfolio around this kind of subscription motion for the company.","Kelly Kramer","I'd say what we laid out is we said by the end of '20, we should have 30% of our revenue be software, and software and services be 50%. So that's the metric we are pacing towards. And your 20% number, we are already passed. So we are driving to be at that that 30% by the end of this year. So like Jeff mentioned, we are pacing well with that. This transition that we're driving has greatly increased the amount of software we are selling with our system. So that is all going well.","Chuck Robbins","Yes, I think if you just -- I think Kelly said, by the end of 2020, our target was to be at 30% of our revenue coming from software. And if you also correlate the metric we shared today, which is in Q1 71% of our software was coming from subscription and SaaS, which four years ago that number was probably a third or less. So that's the nature of the success of the transition that we've been driving so far.","Kelly Kramer","Yes, it\u2019s a good point. Actually, the target for the end of '20 for that was to be 66%, so we've passed that metric already.","Operator","Thank you. James Fish from Piper Jaffray, you may go ahead, sir.","James Fish","I just hoping to get more color on sort of the campus switching cycles with the Cat9K, and just kind of where you think we are, especially with large enterprises as that really drives, it seems like more of the growth of the business anyways and just trying to understand that. And then just make sure that we're thinking about it correct. When you're talking subscription within this business line, you're talking more of a term license than kind of recurring monthly, correct?","Kelly Kramer","Yes, on that one, subscription meaning. Yes. So if I sell a Catalyst 9K switch now, it's sold with a subscription that gets renewed three or five years since putting on the term from now. So that's what we're talking about. So of all the software we're selling is it based on a term based value that gets renewed.","Chuck Robbins","And Jim, just to give you a little sense of where we are. I mean, we're still -- we're seeing very strong growth year-over-year on those platforms, the transitions happening from the old to the new, just like we would have expected. And we were actually talking about yesterday how we would answer the question relative to where we are in this, because I think I said last time we were in the second inning, and we joked that maybe we're in the bottom of the second inning now. But we're still very early in this transition and it's going very well.","And we now have the entire enterprise networking portfolio in refresh mode with Wi-Fi 6 access points, with the new Catalyst 9000. And then one of the things we announced last week was the ability to manage the Cat 9K, one of the products in the Cat 9K under the Meraki platform, so customers could take advantage of it and we'll continue to extend that across the other portfolio of products. So it's going very well and it's still early.","James Fish","Thanks for that color, Chuck.","Chuck Robbins","Thank you, Jim. So let me just wrap up and say that, obviously, it's a complicated world right now. And we certainly felt the continuing impact that we talked about at the end of our last quarter. That being said, I have great confidence in where we are with the portfolio. We shared some metrics today on the software transition that I think is going incredibly well. And notwithstanding, you know, the short term challenges, we feel really good about the future. And so thank you all for being with us today. And I'll kick it back to Marilyn.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks, Chuck.

At the request of Cisco Systems, today\u2019s call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect.","Now, I would like to introduce Melissa Selcher, Vice President of Corporate Communication and Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, you may begin.","Melissa Selcher","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to our 100th quarterly conference call. This is Melissa Selcher, and I am joined by John Chambers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Kelly Kramer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Rob Lloyd, President of Development and Sales; and Gary Moore, President and Chief Operating Officer.","I would like to remind you that we have a corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information that will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the Investor Relations website. Click on the Financial Reporting section of the website to access these documents. Throughout this conference call, we will be making references to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results.","The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements and as such are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and any applicable amendments which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted. All comparisons through this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise. As we have said in the past, we will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer segment results in terms of product orders unless specifically stated otherwise.","I will now turn it over to John for his commentary on the quarter.","John Chambers","Mel, thank you very much. Our Q2 results reflect continued progress as we transformed Cisco to become the number one IT company. In the quarter, we grew revenue to $11.9 billion, up 7% and grew non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.53, up 13% year-over-year. We generated $2.9 billion in operating cash flow this quarter and returned $2.2 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We delivered the strong performance despite a volatile economic environment. Our strong momentum is the direct result of how well we have managed our company transformation over the last 3 plus years and our leadership position in the key technology transitions, such as cloud, mobility, big data, security, collaboration and the Internet of Everything.","The four takeaways I have from this quarter are the following. First, we are executing well and growing at a healthy pace in a tough environment. Second, we saw very good balanced growth, the best balance in 12 quarters across the majority of our key geographies, product categories and customer segments. Third, our financials are very strong and we continue to deliver value for our shareholders with strong earnings, cash generation and capital return, including another $0.02 dividend increase to $0.21 per quarter. And fourth, every country, every city, every business, every home and every car is becoming digital. In our view, Cisco is better positioned than any other company to help our customers reinvent their business and technology strategies as they become digital organizations.","Today, every company and every industry is a technology digital company, something people would not have said a year ago. Over the last month, I have met individually with over 100 business and government leaders. Without exception, these leaders recognized the role technology plays in their future, not just how it creates opportunity, but also with customers around the world both business and governments are aligning with strategic partners in order to be more successful in the digital transition. They are increasingly choosing Cisco as their strategic partner and you are seeing the evidence in our financial performance.","Let\u2019s start with a basic question, like why Cisco? With the network at the center, Cisco has the portfolio and ability to bring our customer solutions to drive down cost, help secure their businesses and increase the speed and agility, so they can innovate across their own organizations. In our view, our track record of disrupting markets by leveraging the power of the Internet is unmatched. Our strategy has always been based on understanding the direction of major market transitions, transforming ourselves to meet the needs of our customers and demonstrating the courage to disrupt not just the markets but even our self.","The market is moving fast and change is exponential. We are in the strong position today we are today because we made dramatic moves in how we are innovating, how we are interfacing with our most important customers and how we are organized to ensure Cisco is leading where the market is going. Most companies resist changing until it\u2019s too late and their market credibility is eroded, the classic innovators dilemma. It was our choice to move early and boldly with incredible speed to realign 40% of our employees to priority areas. To be organized from product groups and to integrated solution teams, to replace more than 30% of our leaders. We are seeing the results and our relevancy with our customers and our operational excellence and that is driving our financial performance.","Since fiscal year \u201811 we have added $4.9 billion in revenue with about $300 million in incremental non-GAAP OpEx. Said another way, for every dollar of revenue we have added over this transitional period, we have only added about $0.06 of non-GAAP OpEx, I think you will find this as best in class by a factor of 5 to 10 fold. In the 90s we were the best example of a company capitalized on the Internet. And that gave us tremendous credibility with customers and fueled our growth. Today, as every company becomes to digital, every CEO knows he or she needs to evolve their organization to move with speed, agility and efficiency. The Internet of Everything will demand of them.","Our strategy is to be the model in how we have reorganized and the customers we are driving as a result. And we have done the heavy lifting with our peers and customers are just starting. As a result I am now spending a significant amount of time with our customers\u2019 executive teams and in their board rooms discussing how they organize for digitization, innovation, security and the Internet of Everything. We could not be better positioned in the market. We have worked very hard to get here your and the opportunity feels very much like it did in the 90s when the Internet became mission-critical to our customers. We have said for were several years that we believe the impact of the Internet of Everything will be 5 to 10 times greater than that of the Internet today. At CES and the World Economic Forum almost every leader we saw agreed. We have been building this opportunity. We have the innovation, operational excellence, speed, agility and efficiencies in our business to drive the greatest possible benefit for our customers, our partners and our shareholders.","On to guidance, as we said for the last 2 quarters, we are pleased that in spite of the headwinds, we are growing well again. We are well positioned for a positive turn in either service provider or emerging markets. But we are not modeling those turns for several quarters despite the better results we saw in this last quarter for reasons you all are very much aware of. For Q3, we expect to see revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5% and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.51 to $0.53.","Let me now provide some additional detail on the business momentum we see in our geographies, customer segments, products and services business within portfolio. In terms of business momentum as a reminder the geographies are primarily the way we run our business. For geographies and customer segments, I will speak in terms of product orders year-over-year unless otherwise noted. We finished the quarter with product orders up 5% and product book to bill greater than one.","Let\u2019s move first to the Americas, the U.S. continue to accelerate growing 7% compared with Q1 3% growth. Latin America returned to double-digit growth at 12% versus Q1 of 5% and negative growth in fiscal year \u201914. Strength in the U.S. public sector continued growing 17% with U.S. federal growing 23% and U.S. state and local growing at 8%.","Moving on to our Europe, Middle East and Africa operations, as we said on last quarter\u2019s conference call, we were more optimistic about Europe than most of our peers. And we saw that business play out as we called with growth in EMEA up 7% year-over-year. We saw phenomenal execution in the UK, up 17%, Germany up 12%, and something no one else in the industry is coming even close to Southern Europe actually grew 20% year-over-year speaking to the relevancy that we provide to companies and governments. Over the last 6 quarters, our growth year-over-year in EMEA has gone from minus 4% to minus 2% to minus 1% to 2% to 6% in Q1 and now 7% in Q2. And we remain cautiously optimistic.","In Asia-Pacific, Japan and China, and China in particular we continue to see challenges that all of you are aware of. And we saw our China business decline by 19%. However, we saw India grow by 11%. The rest of APJC not including China was down 1% this quarter. And finally emerging markets, emerging markets total grew 1% with emerging markets excluding BRICS plus Mexico, up 8%, a major change from last quarter. We continue to see the BRICS plus Mexico challenged, down 6% in total with Russia down 16%, Brazil down 8%, China as I said earlier, down 19%. We did see growth in Mexico up 21%, India up 11%. While we are pleased with these results, we believe it is still way too early to call a turn in emerging markets and are modeling for them to be challenging for several more quarters.","Customer segments, total global commercial grew a healthy 8%. Our success in the U.S. commercial continues to be very strong, up 12% in Q2. We have built a model based on success in the U.S. commercial and best practices from around the world and have implemented the model outside the U.S. DNR orders go from down 5% in fiscal year \u201814, to up 4% year-to-date. In total Cisco business terms that improved performance added a full point to our company\u2019s growth rates. Our new operating remodel and global service provider is also showing some traction. This quarter our service provider business was down 1% after having been down on average 10% or more for the last 5 quarters. Like many in the industry we are modeling total global service provider CapEx down in the mid-single digits for calendar year 2015. We are focused on growing share of wallet. We believe we are very well-positioned in terms of our portfolio and how we have aligned with our service provider customers, but we expect the next several quarters to continue to be challenging and service provider along with emerging markets remain our two challenged areas.","Total global enterprise grew 10% versus 2% in Q1. We did see U.S. enterprise grow a bit slower than expected at 3% growth due in part to the timings in very large deals. The enterprise pipeline continues to see rapid growth in very large multiyear deals, which would benefit Cisco over several years. Our global enterprise U.S. customers which are the largest 28 enterprise accounts not included in regular U.S. enterprise discussion grew about 30% year-over-year. Global public sector continue to be solid at 7% growth year-over-year.","I will now move on to discussion of our products and services business, which I will discuss in terms of revenue year-over-year unless otherwise stated. Starting with switching, we saw very strong switching growth of 11% with strong performance in both the data center switching and our campus switching business. We were especially pleased with the continued momentum of our Nexus ACI portfolio including the Nexus 3K and nexus 9K, and the APIC controller. As an example the nexus 3K plus 9K grew 350% year-over-year.","We have seen the nexus 9K and ACI customers grow each quarter from 580 customers two quarters ago to 970 customers last quarter to1,700 this quarter. APIC customers grew to over 300 and the Nexus 9K passed 1 million installed port mark this quarter, less than one year after the first shipments. We are pulling away from our competitors and leading in both the SDN thought leadership and customer implementations. The market has recognized the benefit of ACI as compared to PowerPoint concepts of aspirational competitors. ACI and APIC will become the cornerstone of the next generation of networking architectures for many years, much like the UCS has become in the data center. I am particularly pleased that we have kept gross margins extremely stable in switching and have actually grown gross margins in many of our product switching areas, which were already very strong in new areas, such as the ACI portfolio.","Moving on to data center, which grew an impressive 40%. UCS has now reached over $3 billion revenue run-rate with over 41,000 customers. More than 85% of the Fortune 500 have chosen UCS, because of the innovative architecture with particular traction in cloud, big data and enterprise application solutions. The innovation underlying UCS, the convergence of compute network and storage is continuing to fuel our growth in the data center and differentiates Cisco. Now, we are converging networking, applications, security, with scale for our ACI platform. And we are doing it with the speed and the scale that no one else is coming close to it.","Next to NGN routing, which grew 2% year-over-year in terms of revenue. We saw strong performance in high-end routing, up 5% with continued strong performance in our new product introductions such as the CRS-X and NCS. With the global macro changes and headwinds like net neutrality and industry consolidation, we expect this business to be challenged going forward, but we believe we are taking market share and will continue to take market share.","Wireless had another strong quarter, up 18% year-over-year compared with Q1, which was up 11%. We saw strong growth in our traditional business, but in Meraki, cloud networking business continues its stellar growth, up another 100% with an annualized run-rate of approximately $400 million. Security grew 6% with orders growing even faster. We saw very strong adoption of our Cisco ASA with firepower services, which integrates our Sourcefire software products together.","Our acquisition strategy in our security business has been very successful as we integrate the various elements into our overall security architecture. We fight point players in some areas, but no other vendor can play at the level across the enterprise that our customers need. In this volatile environment with change happening faster than ever before, the importance of security has never been more significant. The level of danger has been raised from a firewall breach to the potential for enterprise destruction and having robust security solutions before, during and after attack is table stakes. In this environment, customers are migrating to partners they can trust who will lead with innovation and who will be around tomorrow. This trusted partnership is core to our success and drives everything we do. Cisco is the number one security player in terms of revenue and we are progressing nicely toward our goal becoming the number one security company in terms of mind share, which literally we announced a 1.5 year ago, an intention to do so.","Moving on to collaboration, last quarter, we boldly stated our intention is to lead in the next generation of collaboration and become the number one collaboration player. After a complete portfolio of refresh and four quarters of decline, we made very good progress this quarter with growth of 10%. Kelly, I think it was flat or negative last quarter if I remember. Within collaboration, the strongest growth came from our telepresence business, where we saw on the back of our new telepresence portfolio, a 60% growth in units and revenue growth at 35%. We continue to grow our recurring business in collaboration. Our deferred collaboration revenue was up 26% in the quarter to $1.1 billion,","SP video declined 19%. We have announced key partnership wins to develop the next-generation end-to-end video solutions from the set-top box to the cloud. Service revenues grew 5%. We saw our portfolio in cloud, security, consultant, and analytics all grew in double-digits. This quarter we launched Cisco Connected Analytics Strategy to manage the exclusive growth of data at the edge of the networks. As the Internet of Everything evolves we forecast as much as 50% of the data will be handled and decisions will be made at the edge of the network. Given Cisco\u2019s position in the network, Cisco is the only company positioned to manage and capture the insight from distributive data. This has the potential to be an important growth area for Cisco and even more importantly to drive the value of the Internet of Everything.","Let me now provide an update on Cisco\u2019s momentum in the cloud. Cisco\u2019s cloud strategy is pervasive throughout our portfolio. We continue to lead in the hybrid cloud market and our InterCloud momentum continues. As you look at our cloud business, I would look at the following metrics to track our success. First, Cisco\u2019s leadership in cloud infrastructure was once more reaffirmed with the release of the latest Synergy Group\u2019s research report showing we have retained and strengthened our number one position for sales of hardware and software used to build cloud infrastructure. Second, we are growing our cloud services, including managed security, project squared and collaboration, EnergyWise and Meraki for enterprise. Cisco and Telstra are now both in production with open stack-based public cloud services.","And third, our InterCloud ecosystem continues to grow and now exceeds over 50 partners more than 400 data centers across more than 50 countries, Rob just a great job by your team and your leadership. Customers are using InterCloud fabric and ACI to implement highly secure and on-premise hybrid cloud capabilities across heterogeneous environment. To summarize my comments, our customer conversations today are not about standalone products, they are about new revenue streams, growth and outcomes, about securing and about managing their businesses, about how they have to reorganize to drive the innovation their survival requires. We are executing across our business because we are bringing together our product leadership in every category into architectures and solutions that deliver real outcomes.","I will now turn the call over the Kelly for her comments on the quarter and guidance for the next quarter. Kelly, welcome and great to have you leading the conference call.","Kelly Kramer","Thanks John. Overall, we had a strong quarter and executed well. From a top line perspective, total revenue was $11.9 billion, growing 7%. We grew profits faster than revenue with non-GAAP net income of $2.7 billion, up 9% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.53, up 13%. Our GAAP net income was $2.4 billion and GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis of $0.46. Product revenue increased 8% and service revenue increased 5% with product book to bill greater than one. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 28.4%.","In our guidance last quarter we told you that we expected total non-GAAP gross margins to be in the range of 61% to 62%. For Q2, our total non-GAAP gross margins and non-GAAP product gross margins came in at 61.7% and 60.8% reflecting the mix of our business and especially the strength of UCS. Non-GAAP service gross margin was 64.8%. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.0 billion or 33.3% as a percentage of revenue compared to 34.1% in Q1 of fiscal year \u201815.","Non-GAAP operating expenses were down 5% quarter-over-quarter and up 6% year-over-year, reflecting investments in key growth areas such as security, cloud and software. Our GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share for Q2 fiscal year \u201815 included a pretax gain of the $126 million or approximately $0.02 per share related to the reorganization of our investment VCE. This gain is excluded from our non-GAAP results.","Now, moving on to our non-GAAP tax provision rate, which was 22% consistent with our expectations. In connection with the recently reinstated U.S. Federal R&D tax credit, we had a tax benefit of $91 million related to fiscal 2014 that we excluded from our non-GAAP net income. The extension of the R&D tax credit did not have a material impact on our non-GAAP tax rate during Q2 and is not expected to have a material impact on our non-GAAP tax rate for the remainder of fiscal \u201915 since the benefit only extended through December 31, 2014. We ended the quarter with our headcount at 70,112, a decrease of 2,135 from Q1. As a reminder, we took restructuring actions to invest in growth, innovation and talent, while managing costs and driving efficiencies. We announced and completed one acquisition during the quarter, Neohapsis, a provider of network and security consulting services to enhance our offerings to our customers.","Looking at our geographic segment results, in terms of total revenue on a year-over-year basis, our Americas segment was up 10%, EMEA was up 7%, and APJC was down 3%. Total gross margin for the Americas was 62.0%, EMEA was 61.8%, and APJC was 60.3%.","From a balance sheet and cash flow perspective, total cash, cash equivalents and investments were $53.0 billion, including a $3.2 billion available in the U.S. at the end of the quarter. We generated operating cash flow of $2.9 billion during the quarter. Deferred revenue was $14 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Product deferred revenue grew 14%, largely driven by subscription-based offerings, while services deferred revenue grew 2%. We continue to build the greater mix of recurring revenue as reflected in our deferred revenue balance.","Our DSO was strong at 35 days as compared to 36 days in Q2 fiscal year \u201814. In Q2, we returned $2.2 billion to shareholders that included $1.2 billion through share repurchases and $974 million through our quarterly dividends. In the first half of fiscal year \u201815, we have returned approximately $4.2 billion or 86% of our free cash flow to our shareholders comprised of $2.2 billion of share repurchases and nearly $2 billion of dividends. In addition, today, our Board approved an increase of $0.02 to the quarterly dividend to $0.21 per share, an approximate 11% increase representing a yield of approximately 3.1%. We remain firmly committed to our capital allocation strategy.","Let me now provide a few comments on our guidance for the third quarter. Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements and actual results could be above or below guidance. The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with a reconciliation to GAAP.","As John mentioned, we expect total revenue to be in the range of 3% to 5% on a year-over-year basis. For the third quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 62%. And as we have said in the past, forecasting non-GAAP gross margin has always been challenging due to various factors such as volume, product mix, cost savings and pricing. As a reminder, non-GAAP gross margin may vary quarter-to-quarter by a point in either direction of our guidance range.","Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 is expected to be in the range of 27.5% to 28.5%. Our non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be approximately 22% in the third quarter. Our Q3 \u201815 non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.51 to $0.53. We anticipate our GAAP earnings to be lower than our non-GAAP EPS by $0.09 to $0.12 per share in Q3 \u201815. The range includes a pre-tax charge of up to $100 million in Q3 \u201815 as a result of the restructuring actions that we announced in the first quarter. During Q2, we recognized a pre-tax charge in our GAAP financial statements of $69 million related to that announcement and we expect total charges not to exceed $600 million during fiscal year \u201815. Please see the slides that accompany this webcast for more detail.","Other than those quantified items noted previously, there are no other significant differences between GAAP and our non-GAAP. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructurings and tax or other events, which may or may not be significant. Our guidance does not assume a significant improvement in the emerging markets or the service provider segment in the near future. Although we believe we are executing well in a rapidly transforming market, with these types of uncertainties in mind, we will continue to provide our guidance with all the appropriate caveats one quarter at a time. We encourage our shareholders to have similar considerations. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.","I will now hand it back to John for his summary comments.","John Chambers","Thank you, Kelly. Our results this quarter which were the best results in three years in terms of balanced growth across all of our geographies, products, and segments reflects the increased relevancy of Cisco around the world. The Cisco brand is as strong as it\u2019s ever been. Our vision has always been to change the way the people work, live, play and learn. And you have heard us say this for nearly 20 years digitization is the next and perhaps the most significant evolution of our vision. At CES, 15 years ago, we showed a network car Wi-Fi enabled and connected to a coffee shop, so you could order your own drinks and make changes to that. Fast forward to several years ago, we introduced the market to the Internet of Everything. While the concepts were thought leadership for many years, this year companies and countries are seeing the Internet of Everything as a business imperative and top priority.","To take advantage of the Internet of Everything, every country, company, city, home and car has to be digital. The single most important investments are at the center of their digital business and technology strategy for our customers and at the center of that will be the intelligent network from the data center to the edge through the cloud, all brought together with an end to end security and Cisco is never ever been better positioned. In the 90s when companies need to get online on the Internet Cisco was the thought leader, the company with the product leadership and the best example of a company capitalizing on the all the transitions.","Our customers wanted our help and to follow our example. Fast forward to today, the next generation of the Internet, the Internet of Everything should generate at least 5 to 10 times the value of the first generation of the Internet to-date. Again no one is better positioned than Cisco in terms of strategy, market position, product leadership, architectures and organization structure. I am not sure those outside Cisco appreciate the magnitude of the changes we have implemented over the last year largely because of our ability to continue to deliver to long-term value to our customers and to out shareholders despite the challenges in the market. Most companies wait to change until they have to. When it\u2019s obvious and it\u2019s often game over and those companies get left behind. In the last year, we were willing to disrupt our leadership position for example in switching and routing by introducing entirely new platforms. We knew, we'd see a short-term impact but told the market how we would grow.","Once again, we did what we said we would do. This is just one of many examples and these are exactly the hard decisions our customers, employees, partners and shareholders have trusted us to make so we can lead in this market transitions. I want to congratulate and thank the Cisco team for believing in the vision and executing one of the most successful company transformations the industry has witnessed.","Very few companies could do what we have done with the speed and the results we have driven and the opportunity we created for ourselves is truly exciting and in many ways just getting started. Our transformational work will continue as we help our customers digitize everything, secure everything and organize their companies, their governments, their businesses for the Internet of Everything because of the agility we built into our organization and our ability to align directly with our customer\u2019s goals, we are helping our customers with their business outcomes and let me very direct here. We're winning very large service provider, enterprise and public sector deals that we would not have won just as recently as one year ago. We do see our competitors struggling and no we are not immune from economic or other challenges in the market. While we believe we have positioned the company better than any of our peers, we do still see the same challenges we had discussed in the past few quarters specifically emerging markets and service providers as continuing to provide a negative drag for the next few quarters.","What I believe the market now understands is that Cisco is managing effectively through a challenging macro leading through transitions, disrupting markets, increasing our relevancy with our customers and delivering value to our shareholders.","Looking forward, we\u2019ve laid an incredibly exciting foundation for future growth, innovation and leadership. Reinventing the network with application centric infrastructure, a platform at the very early stages of its future potential. Our leadership and security, the most important topic in IT today in many ways. Our emerging role in data and analytics at the edge and how we will bring all this together to enable the Internet of Everything. We have our stakes in the ground to capture tremendous opportunities in front of us and are well on our way to becoming the number one IT company.","The momentum in the business feels extremely good and we are excited about the opportunities ahead. We will now move, Mel, to what I enjoy the most which is the Q&A section and it\u2019s over to you Mel and I will try to keep my answers tight and I will do better this time.","Melissa Selcher","Okay. Operator, can we please open for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS.","Amitabh Passi","Hi, guys. I had maybe sort of two half questions. John, I guess the first one for you, services gross margin probably came in at the lowest level that we have seen in a few quarters. I was hoping you could maybe elaborate on what\u2019s happening there? And then just secondarily, on your security business, I know you have sounded very bullish on security and the momentum. 6% seemed a little disappointing, would love to get some clarity there?","John Chambers","Got it. So, Amitabh, I like the way that you went. We probably had eight or nine areas that we are very close to the highest growth rate we have had in two areas and you are focusing me on the two challenges more than fair. So, let\u2019s go to the issue of services gross margins. If you watch, we start with a big picture. Our revenue growth areas, what is our gross margins, our OpEx, Kelly and I have a lot of leverage we can pull within that. Within the gross margins, we have never been more comfortable. And actually I said that\u2019s almost three or four quarters ago, Mel. I have never been more comfortable with any aspect of our business than our ability to maintain gross margins. It\u2019s a mixed issue as you go through it.","To the services question, we have had great services gross margins unequalled in the industry. Gary, our technical services, what you and Joe Pinto have done is amazing there. Our advanced services is an area that we are moving very aggressively in and that\u2019s where you see all little bit of the pull down on the services model. And as you become outcome-based, as you refocus on these new growth areas being able to literally digitize a country, digitize a city, digitize a manufacturing company a healthcare company etcetera, you saw us invest an awful lot in vertical consultancy, you saw us invest in security in a big way with major expectations in terms of expertise centers, etcetera and in cloud. So, we are going to continue to make investments in these areas and I am very comfortable with our gross margin portfolio. I actually think our gross margins, has been the most predictable part of our total business, although we have a lot of various variables in that.","On security, security will occasionally be bumpy. We reorganized our realization and realigned security across the whole globe with a separate sales force. As you make those changes, you occasionally lose a little bit of momentum before you pick it up. The order growth was actually at 9% for security. I expect security to grow very healthily as we move forward and you will continue to see us make a number of both resource investments in areas like services, sales investments to really lead in that and consultancy in a way that really brings this picture to light, but I think you are going to see good growth out of our security business. I think we are positioned extremely well and I kind of in a fun way challenge you. When an enterprise customer has 45 to 60 security players in the environment, how many they really have? And you look at a CEO in the eye and I get it done. We have got to consolidate this in the networks where it\u2019s going to get consolidated. So, very comfortable in terms of our security growth over time, do not see any issues in terms of strategy, vision or margins here.","Melissa Selcher","Great, thanks Amitabh. Operator, next question?","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian Modoff from Deutsche Bank.","Brian Modoff","Hi, John, I would like to talk about Meraki. You had obviously good numbers $400 million annual run-rate. At Cisco Live, you announced that you were expanding it out to a broader range of customers. Can you talk a little bit about that and what that might do to the growth there and how this might affect your overall margin mix as you continue to say you are comfortable with where that\u2019s headed?","John Chambers","Sure. So, Meraki overall, Kelly keep me honest here, very good margins. We are very comfortable with that. When you begin to look at a company that is now at $400 million run-rate and grow to the 100%, I mean, that\u2019s harder than almost any startups in the industry with great gross margins. And what Rob is doing in leadership on cloud and what Nick is doing with our service providers and what we are seeing is a continued leverage of the Meraki type of vision for how we grow our resources and how we grow our relevance to our customers. Rob, would like to add some to that?","Rob Lloyd","I would just add that we are expanding globally with recent additions of Meraki presence in EMEA as well as building out in Europe. They are not \u2013 there is no margin impact. It\u2019s a very profitable business model and we did expand and announced the expansion of the Meraki portfolio at Cisco Live in Milan in January, which will see an expansion of the enterprise offer, including a really neat mobile device manager. So, profitable platform John growing very, very quickly to 100% and geographic expansion is part of that model.","John Chambers","Got it. It\u2019s a nice way of saying. This is really hot, it\u2019s going to Kelly, be one of our better acquisitions, but then you turn to Sourcefire which was the other big one we did in the last year and a half. It\u2019s literally on fire too. Thanks, Mil.","Melissa Selcher","Very good.","John Chambers","Yes, she is not so sure. Thanks, Brian.","Melissa Selcher","Thanks, Brian. Operator, next question.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski","Hi, thanks very much. So, you had obviously a good quarter and good guidance, but John, your tone seems even more bullish than kind of the numbers would suggest? And I mean, I couldn\u2019t count how many times you said that you have never been better positioned. And I just wanted to see if you can just provide another layer of detail behind that. So, just let us understand better what\u2019s behind that tone? I think you kind of referenced some large deals in the U.S. with enterprises, service providers, public sector and I noticed your deferred was up 6%, but the long-term deferred, even though short-term looks flat. So, are there large multi-year deals in there that are giving you that kind of a bullish outlook?","John Chambers","Simona, it literally is across the board. And we see this in every country, every segment of our business, even those that are challenged like emerging markets and service provider, we make huge inroads because of the momentum we have gained. Mel told me not to be too enthusiastic on the call. I went out and ran 4 miles this morning. I had my best time. And as the last year lifted weight successor and I am sorry, Mel, just full of energy, it is exciting what\u2019s in front of us. And when you sit across from the customers, you could have been at with and I could take this to our shareholders. Anybody who walked out of with 21 of the sessions were about Cisco related areas from what you are going to do with infrastructure to digitizing countries, to cities, to how you bring this to bear and how does it affect the environment, we are right in the middle.","And in so many different ways, we are not just in thought leadership no one can compete individual pinpoint products are going to get killed in this marketplace. And the different competitive models that you see evolving or different models we saw coming for 4 to 5 years, so yes, I feel really good and the only area that I would be critical was we got to do better in service provider video and we do have a portfolio like we have in customer segments and products, it feels good. But to your point, our relevance in major government bids and major enterprise bids, we are winning bids that we would not have come close to in a year ago. And it isn\u2019t just we are running from the beginning, we have got an ability to adjust in engineering and sales and services to meet their needs as we are not \u2013 we are taking to competitors. It really feels good and it\u2019s really fine. See you tomorrow by the way, Simona. Looking forward to be on stage with you. Go easy on your questions, tomorrow.","Melissa Selcher","Alright. Thanks, Simona. Operator, next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.","James Faucette","Thanks very much. Hey, good afternoon. Just quick question, you said that you are expecting a turn in service provider and emerging markets not for at least several more quarters. Others have indicated that they thought we could see a rebound in service provider spending maybe in the next couple of quarters. Just wondering what\u2019s making you a bit more cautious than that? And I guess trying to gauge your level of confidence that you can really see your service provider and emerging market businesses rebound, I guess exiting this year and going into 2016? Thanks.","John Chambers","So, let\u2019s start with the overall premise. My premise on service providers is you are going to see negative growth in terms of CapEx for this year, with a lot of the experts saying it\u2019s actually going to be uglier in the next six months than it will at the back half of the year. So, our assumption is any gain in service providers will be share wallet gain and market share gains. What makes me very, very bullish on this is on the things we can control if you watch what Nick Adamo, heads up sales, Kelly Ahuja that Nike have done services Kelly is engineering. We are now winning big service provider deals that we would not even have been in the game in a year or two ago. And our ability to do this at a different margin level, our agility on this and we are taking it to our competitors and you are seeing this across the board. I would have vastly preferred it.","You can never do it exactly how you want, but having had five quarters of 10% or more negative service provider growth, I would rather go on from negative 10% to negative 5% or 6% to negative 1% then positive went up from there. We have got a couple of deals writing this quarter, which caused us to go from minus 10% to minus 1%. That\u2019s more than I think anybody else anticipated in the marketplace, especially when you have areas like SP video, which drives you down by 2 to 3 points off of that. I just didn\u2019t want the market getting ahead of us. My comfort level with seeing growth this by the end of the year and probably that is extremely good in this market, but I am modeling all wallet share gains and market share gains. I do not think service provider CapEx will be up this year. I hope I am wrong, in which case we will get more of our share there. So, I feel very, very good into positioning. Was there second question on this? Okay, thanks James.","Melissa Selcher","Alright. Thanks, Simona. Operator, next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rod Hall with JPMorgan.","Rod Hall","Yes, hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess the first one I wanted to start with was switching the quarter-on-quarter\u2026.","John Chambers","Go ahead.","Rod Hall","Sorry, can you guys hear me?","John Chambers","Yes.","Rod Hall","Yes. So, the quarter-on-quarter trajectory is switching seasonally a little bit more than normal about down 6% quarter-on-quarter, if our math is right, in the average a little bit below 3% over the last 5 years. So, the last year there was some Osborne Effect ahead of 9K, just wondering if you guys could comment on color there I mean what might have driven that seasonality, did we some FX impact, just normal seasonality from your point of view, etcetera. And then also John I know you are lifting weights and running doing all the stuff, could you just give us an update on your tenure at Cisco, I mean it doesn\u2019t\u2019 sound like you are in the mood to retire, but could you just give us kind of an update on what your plan there is? Thanks.","John Chambers","The next time you hear Rod about any talk about the change will be when we announce that, that hasn\u2019t changed overall. We have got an amazing team with several of the players around this table being examples now that and we will make this a non-issue as we make the transition. To the first part of the question, no I disagree with your basic premise. We don\u2019t give booking by category, by seasonality. But if you watch our normal booking trends and if you watch where we have gone and let\u2019s use total bookings as an example. From Q1 to Q2, it was up at the very high end of our seasonality bookings sequentially and the year-over-year numbers. So either way you want to measure it, we are in good shape on that. I do agree with several of you premises in terms of the 9K growth, it feels very, very good. Rod you got to know I completely disagree dramatically with your comment about our switching products commoditizing. They are going in the opposite way. This is one that I think you are going to see us get our competitors very aggressively. And even in merchant silicon like Nexus 3000, we are doing extremely well in terms of growth in gross margins. It\u2019s an architectural play now. We saw this coming 4.5 years ago with switching you got to have security, you got to have collaboration, it\u2019s got to integrate to processor capability, it\u2019s got to tie the Internet of Everything. There has to be a architecture that brings us together, business results and I think are relevant in our value to the customers are exact opposite way. We have shown remarkable consistency in switching gross margins. And I feel very, very good about our future in that regard.","Kelly Kramer","Thanks Rod. Operator, next question.","Operator","And your next question comes from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.","John Chambers","Hi Mark.","Mark Sue","How are you? The gross margin improvements and the cash returns was a major driver and your stocks outperformance last year, so I am trying to understand the opportunities ahead on top of the ongoing improvements you have made to-date. For example, I know that it\u2019s a multi-year progress, but the progress in terms of becoming a software company maybe if can give us an update there and your go to market. And as it relates to your financials maybe thoughts on future cash flow, returns to investors considering free cash flow is now on parity with net income?","John Chambers","Got it. So I am going to let Kelly take the other part on thoughts about cash and where we are going Kelly and our overall and I don\u2019t mind you even comment a little bit about the programs we have on gross margins through that. And on the first part giving out that question the first question Mr. Mark was.","Kelly Kramer","Just what the strength in gross margins last year was\u2026","John Chambers","Okay. So we have leverage in every single category. If you watch what we are doing whether it\u2019s operating expenses, whether it\u2019s the gross margins by products, products and switching, funding areas that don\u2019t have as good a gross margin picture to gain momentum, etcetera. And there is leverage really everywhere. We are seeing no unusual competition in the market, no unusual competition with white label or white box, nor will we in the future. We saw that coming as I said a long time ago, wins on architectures and this whole call literally is about that. So I feel very good about our total gross margin mix. We will absolutely be aggressive when we want to move consulting, as an example to play a much larger role in business outcomes. And our ability to have multiple leverage that we can catch on I think feels very, very good. We are going to invest in some of the areas and we are going to do a large part of it literally what we said earlier. Moving 40% of our resources around in a year is almost unheard of and then literally unfortunately taking down 6,000 people in backup, 6,000 people with the different skill sets speaks to the agility we have in the market. Kelly your thoughts?","Kelly Kramer","Yes, I mean to answer your question Mark on our cash as you can to tell our commitment to the capital allocation hasn\u2019t changed as evidenced by giving back 86% of our free cash flow back as a dividend and the buyback and as well as increasing our dividend going forward. So that\u2019s not changing. We are extremely focused on increasing our cash flow. And to John\u2019s point focused on driving that through improvements in our margin both in gross margin and operating margin. So that focus will continue and we still have lots of flexibility with our balance sheet to continue the balance of giving back to our shareholders as well as having that flexibility strategically for M&A and other investments.","John Chambers","Gary, you and Kelly are working jointly on gross margins any additional thoughts?","Gary Moore","Yes. I mean so Mark I think we have demonstrated our ability to manage the gross margins and pull the levers and the different things that we have those haven\u2019t gone away. The investments we are making in value \u2013 design value engineering that gets \u2013 keep on giving. And we have double down our efforts so we will keep going. We are going through functional transformation. John pointed out $0.06 for every $1 of revenue over the last 3.5 years, 4 years. And I think we can continue to do that. So it\u2019s about freeing up the assets to reinvest in the growth areas for the future and we are doing that spot on. And we are looking at this for the long-term.","John Chambers","And Mark and I was probably going to assume laps around here before I answer the question. But if you watch what changes architectures save our customers huge amount of operating expense. It allows them to get their business outcomes much quicker. And when you combine an architecture like data center with an architecture like InterCloud, with an architecture like collaboration, with an architecture like security, with architectures about big data edge of the network with mobility we can do that in a way that no one else can to get business outcomes. Customers will pay probably 3% to 5% - excuse me 3 to 5 times more per business outcome than they will for a standalone switch or standalone router. So as we make that transition this is where you re-see our relevance change. And this why when you talk about digitizing countries or digitizing cities we are all by ourselves and our ability to do it, it\u2019s about how we bring all those together in the Internet of Everything and that has great gross margins. That\u2019s where I think the market need to do a better job mill of explaining to the market why our gross margins and why we are so optimistic about our future if we do it right.","Kelly Kramer","Great. Thanks Mark. Operator, next question.","Operator","And your next question comes from Itai Kidron from Oppenheimer.","Itai Kidron","Thanks and congrats guys on great execution on the quarter. Following up on this last point of gross margin John looking at the regional gross margin it seems like Europe was certainly standout we haven\u2019t seen that gross margin that poor since I have to go all the way back 2011, was that just a function of FX meaning with the move and that is depressing in dollars you had to do a little bit more active discounting in order to get the volume that you need, how do we think about that?","John Chambers","Yes. A fair question, I think Europe is a great example. First of all, Europe was 7% growth which I don\u2019t think anybody else is getting. You take Russia absence it would have been 9% growth. But you did see remarkable growth across many big countries where they are really being impacted by foreign exchange, etcetera. The way we look at foreign exchange we do business in dollars as most of you know on that. So we perhaps can\u2019t draw the correlation as quickly as now this. But it does mean the deal size may not be as large where it does mean that there might be pressure on discounts to provide a total solution. And when you us grow at 20% across Southern Europe I mean I am not aware of anybody else that is growing in Southern Europe period much less of those type of numbers. It speaks to our strategy working. Foreign exchange does have some impact on it. And Kelly maybe if you would like to add some addition to that.","Kelly Kramer","Yes. Just to add to the Itai from a pricing perspective actually our pricing is in line, our normal quarter-on-quarter pricing as well as the year-over-year if I look over the last 6 quarters. So we haven\u2019t really seen that increase on discounting. But we did see drive in the margins in Europe is definitely the mix of our strength in our UCS is a big, big driver of it.","Melissa Selcher","Operator next question.","Operator","And your next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Tal Liani","I have a question on switching, great growth, the question is can you distinguish between plain, vanilla upgrades just because you have new platforms. And between really changes to the architecture of data centers one has a short cycle, one has a longer cycle, longer impact on the company. Is there anyway we can look at it, think about our side, is there anyway we can have evidence that the cycle is longer rather than shorter when it comes to switching? Thanks.","John Chambers","I think the data center switching cycle is a very, very long one I think we would all agree with in scale. And even though we will face new competitors white label etcetera in this market we saw that as I said coming a long time ago and this is where it is and about switching the data center it\u2019s about convergence about switching with storage with servers, with security even within the data center. And then the ability with application centric infrastructure to run that and the data center or a cloud in the wane all the way to the edge and that\u2019s about applications again with the network with security, with scale. You combine those two and we are almost unbeatable in the approach. You do have a natural upgrade cycle with new products coming in. And there was probably a little bit of a stall when we stalled ourselves a year ago deliberately and we knew what we are doing, but we need it to transition to the new ion switching and needed to signal people where we are going. There are additional drivers we are starting to win network refresh and some competitors refresh purely because of security. In this environment they are going to risk and this where we are just going to I can\u2019t say crush, I think there is white label. This is where we are going to really crush the white people. I mean, it\u2019s got to be a security architecture type of approach. If you just say, I am going to get merchant silicon and throw software on top of it and run data centers and run WANs and everything, all it takes is one breach and you have done more damage to your brand is it company or is it government, then you could in 100 years of saving on a little bit of switching difference and that\u2019s before you get to the outcomes in terms of the direction. Now, is switching going to grow double-digits? Of course, not, but I think more down to the mid single-digits and we will go up and down depending on the quarter. There will be a different mix in the data center versus campus.","Melissa Selcher","Great. Thanks, Tal. Operator, next question.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Benjamin Reitzes with Barclays Capital.","Benjamin Reitzes","Hey, thanks a lot guys. Can you talk about the new relationship you have with the VCE? Is there any change? The data center numbers were very good, but I was wondering if there is any impact on switching in the quarter and do you see yourself partner strategy changing and getting more robust perhaps with some other partners with what\u2019s going on with that, that could be material to revenue going forward? Thanks a lot.","John Chambers","Yes, Ben. Let me ask you direct question in the second one that you didn\u2019t ask me which I know is on people\u2019s minds as well. In terms of BCE, we have a very good relationship with EMC. I look for that to be continued very strong. Gary, you are our key interface there. You and Howard and Joe and I all the time go back and forth. VMware is a competitor. We view them as a competitor. We are going to beat them as a competitor and we will beat them and have fun doing it. I wish I was a better person, but I am not. And we are going to take it to a bunch of our competitors and I think you like the projects that you are going to continue to see there. We are however going to continue to partner with NetApp, which is a great relationship almost no competitive overlap and we announced what we are doing with IBM.","And I think to the second part of your question, when we talk about pace of change, it means that your strategic partnerships and the Wall Street Journal had an article, I think before December that talked about the role of strategic partnerships will dramatically change and this will be customer partnerships as well. We will be dramatically different looking out over the next several years and determine a company\u2019s success or not in ways they haven\u2019t in the past. And part of that pace of change is you are going to have at times even very good customers, very good partners go into our area, we are at the center of every transition, so, anytime anybody makes a networking announcement they are going to say either with Cisco or doesn\u2019t and you are going to see our evolution of our partners go on that. Having said that, you will see us do more strategic partnering, much deeper with many, many partners such as players like Rockville that you might have not thought it before or GE or players that we are literally closer to in terms of the direction here. Relationship with EMC is very, very good. We like them. They like us and we two have lot of business together. I think Gary the run-rate was 50% year-over-year growth together plus some.","Gary Moore","Plus some and it\u2019s a strong relationship and the partnership has all the elements it does before. We have just restructured with them.","John Chambers","Okay, thank you Ben.","Melissa Selcher","Thanks, Ben. Operator next question.","Operator","Thank you. We have our next question from Simon Leopold with Raymond James.","John Chambers","Hey, Simon.","Simon Leopold","Hey, John, thank you for all the detail as usual. I wanted to follow-up on the VCE relationship in terms of how it affects your business from a modeling perspective. As I understand it, you do sell a significant amount of the UCS products and maybe some switching products through that channel. If you could help us put that into perspective as to how significant that is as a source of revenue for the UCS? And then in terms of below the sales levels, I understand that you have some benefits exiting the VCE that you are not incurring the expenses you had been in the partnership? Can you help us understand the implications of this from a both revenue as well as operating expense perspective?","John Chambers","Yes. If I were to summarize the revenue perspective, it\u2019s a very good one for us, just like NetApp is. The growth rates are unbelievable. Our field sales teams, the EMC\u2019s sales team and the Cisco sales team you often get some of the difference between them out in the field in terms of how they come together. It\u2019s very, very good for us and we feel very good growth from that relationship. And by the way the same is true with the other partners we have alluded to in terms of the direction. So, I think what you are seeing is just an evolution of a partnership model and some competition versus VMware, which is I think the world we live in today. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen & Company.","John Chambers","Hey, Paul.","Paul Silverstein","Hi, good evening. One clarification, I think it\u2019s obvious from your previous comments, but I just want to make sure I understood. The traditional breakout you gave us between pricing and productivity improvement volume, etcetera, it appears and again I just want to confirm that the rate of price erosion did not change from the trend we have seen recently and same thing with your rate of productivity improvement. Can you give us the numbers if you have them?","John Chambers","Kelly?","Kelly Kramer","Yes, hi, Paul. So we don\u2019t see that in our Q filing but I can tell you, the range, the ranges that we typically see on a quarter-on-quarter basis has been in the range over the last six quarters from half a percentage point impact on gross margin up to over a point and a half and we are well on the\u2014we are basically in the middle of that range and year-over-year in the middle of the range as well when I look over six quarter. So you will see that when we have our 10-Q filing.","John Chambers","You know if I look and Mel has given me that I am out of time, so I wish we could do a couple more questions. I want to just summarize with, I have never felt better about our business and our future. We are as many of you have already said, we are back and this movie I have seen before and I wish I could just bottle with and I wish I could bottle the conversations that we have with government leaders and business leaders and how different than before it\u2019s just not one product area, it\u2019s how we can bring architectures together with services in a different sales motion. We had the courage to disrupt our sales starting three years ago and we did a huge amount of organizational evolution over the last year that allowed us to do fast innovation and agility and speed with which others cannot meet. There is no surprises to us in the market, and I mean none at the present time.","It\u2019s playing out very much like we expected. It\u2019s a world that pace of change will go exponentially but as you walk away just kind of think about it. You are executing extremely well at healthy growth. Digitization would be ten times I think, we will say five to ten, to keeping solid. The impact of Internet of Everything really affects every country, every citizen in the world and every company. Our product portfolio across the board you saw all but one area increases nice when I get beat up on just 6% growth, I mean that is a pleasant position to be in Kelly probably one we won\u2019t always experience as nicely as that. The balance geographically and even our headwind areas while we\u2019ve signaled there will be a couple of more quarters to work through, showed a lot of progress and that means we are positioned as they eventually turn an emerging markets which they will and there will always be challenges in a group like China and Russia and Brazil but the rest of them feel heading the right direction pretty well and if you watch where we are doing in terms of our product leadership in each category and then integrating them together with architectures feels good, so I get bumped up. It hasn\u2019t changed and I hope that came across the pace of change and the new competitors and new challenges is something that will change will drop exponentially, I believe we are going to become the number one IT company and our goal was to show you that and get the reward our shareholders, our customers, employees deserve. Mel, back to you.","Melissa Selcher","Great, thanks.

At the request of Cisco Systems, today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect.","Now I'll like to introduce Melissa Selcher, Senior Director, Analyst and Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Melissa Selcher","Thanks you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our 92nd quarterly conference call. This is Melissa Selcher and I am joined by John Chambers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Frank Calderoni, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Rob Lloyd, President of Development and Sales; and Gary Moore, President and Chief Operating Officer.","I would like to remind you that we have a corresponding webcast with slides on our website in the Investor Relations section. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found on the Investor Relations website. Click on the Financial Reporting section of the website to access these documents.","Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements and as such are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Form 10-Q and 10-K and any applicable amendments, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise.","I will now turn it over to John for his commentary on the quarter.","John T. Chambers","Mel, thank you very much. As we exit Q2 FY13, we continued to be pleased with the traction of our strategy, our value proposition to our customers and the execution of our company and our partners.","We delivered another quarter of solid profitable growth with record revenue of 5% and record non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.51, up 9% year-over-year. In my recent conversations with global business and government leaders, the tone is cautious, optimism. I am not suggesting that optimism would translate and lead into immediate GDP growth. But there is a bleak, weaken move to a world driven by opportunity, not scarcity, and that technology will play a very large role in that opportunity.","Cisco\u2019s strategy delivering integrated architectures that address the top business opportunities and the biggest market transitions is differentiating us from our peers, and will help enable us to achieve our goal of becoming the number one IT Company in the world.","As I translate these observations to this quarter, I have five key takeaways. First, our execution on our financial model is very solid, with record revenues, earnings per share, net income and non-GAAP operating income. Gross margins continue to be very stable, expenses are growing inline with revenue growth and operating margins are strong.","Second, we continue to drive strong results in most of the key technology transitions. The transition such as datacenter, cloud, virtualization, mobility and video had very solid results in the quarter in what remains a challenging economic environment.","We continue to invest in a market transitions that we believe will drive our next phase of growth. Notably, the Internet of Everything of everything and programmable networks where we continue to lead the market with our execution on our Cisco ONE portfolio.","Third, our services business continued the solid growth in Q3 of 10%. Our services lead engagements and innovation together with our partners are driving our wallet and man share with customers. Fourth, we continue to see a soft global recovery with Europe and especially Southern Europe still on distress.","On the positive side, we continue to see improvements in the U.S. Enterprise, and U.S. commercial orders, which we believe is likely an early indicator of future GDP growth.","Finally, we generated operating cash of over $3 billion by returning almost $1.25 billion to shareholders this quarter with the dividend and the buyback. Over the last year and a half, we closed 14 acquisitions, totaling to approximately $7 billion with 13 of the 14 adding important software, cloud and recurring revenue assets across our portfolio. We remain very committed to our capital return strategy to drive the value to our shareholders.","In summary, we believe that our Q2 results once again demonstrate that our vision and strategy are working. In simple terms, we did what we said we will do and what I think we will all agree as a challenging market.","As we continue to deliver on the innovation, quality and leadership, our customers expect we are pleased with our execution. We are managing our portfolio and operations investing for the future and delivering the integrated architecture solutions to become our customers more strategic IT partner.","To provide additional details on our Q2 FY \u201813 results, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Frank. I will then walk through what we\u2019re seeing in the business and where we\u2019re focusing going forward. Frank will detail our guidance and we\u2019ll wrap up the call then with Q&A at the end. Frank, over to you.","Frank A. Calderoni","Thank you, John. In Q2, we continue to execute on our strategy of driving profitable growth, which contributes to increasing shareholder value over the long-term. At our financial analyst conference, we discussed our focus on innovation, portfolio management and operational discipline and we believe you are seeing the results in that focus. While we continue to operate in the challenging macroeconomic environment, we\u2019re pleased with the discipline and execution of the company with total revenue, a record $12.1 billion, up 5% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.51, up 9%, delivering our fifth straight quarter of growing earnings faster than revenues. Our non-GAAP EPS include a $0.01 benefit related to a tax item I will discuss in more detail later.","In terms of our business momentum, we saw product revenue growth of 3% with total product book-to-bill of slightly less than 1%. With total revenue globally, we had 9% growth in the Americas and 8% in APJC while Europe\u2019s macroeconomic challenges continued resulting in a decrease of 5% for EMEA.","Our services business continues to be a competitive differentiator for Cisco and in this quarter, we grew services revenue 10% with consistently strong and industry leading gross margin.","We continue to manage our overall business as a portfolio both in terms of top line growth as well as profitability. With any portfolio, there are areas of strengths both in the technology area as well as across the region and also areas for improvement.","The growth drivers that we laid out at our Financial Analyst Conference continue to drive our business. Specifically, we are seeing our datacenter, wireless, video and services business driving growth. For datacenter specifically, where we entered a different margin profile business for Cisco, I am pleased with the ability of our team to manage the levers of the business to drive profitable growth for Cisco and for our shareholders.","I am also pleased with the performance of our core business, given the economic challenges globally, and John will share some additional perspective on this portfolio in his section.","This quarter, we both grew and divested our portfolio to improve our innovation and provide for future growth and returns. We announced a series of strategic acquisitions including Meraki, a leading provider of cloud managed networks. Cloupia, management software for automating data center infrastructure; Cariden, network planning and design; BroadHop, network policy management software; and Intucell self optimizing network software.","We also announced the sale of our Linksys product line, which we expect to be accretive to our overall returns and we continued the successful integration of NDS. Each of these actions fits within our strategy to accelerate the growth and profitability of our business, and with each acquisitions we acquire talent and expertise in addition to intellectual property. We will continue to position Cisco for the future and drive the greatest return for our shareholders.","In terms of our growth margin, we have made substantial progress with our operational excellence initiative, where our investments are driving positive returns each quarter. We continue to focus on specific activities such as value engineering and portfolio management which have lead to reasonably stable growth margins over the last two years. Our focus on profitability areas within the company is helping Cisco to deliver our bottom line results.","As a result in Q2 FY \u201913 our total non-GAAP gross margin was 62.3% compared to 62.7% last quarter, and 62.4% a year ago. Our non-GAAP product gross margin was 60.9% compared to 61.5% last quarter and 60.9% a year ago. Our non-GAAP service gross margin was 67.6% compared to 66.9% last quarter and 68.0% in Q2 FY \u201912.","We also saw reasonable stability and consistency in our total gross margins by geography, with the Americas 61.8%, EMEA at 64.9% and APJC at 60.0%, as well as from a product area perspective.","We are driving continuous improvement throughout the entire company. We have remained disciplined with our non-GAAP operating expenses, which were $4.1 billion or 34.1% as a percentage of revenue compared to 34.8% in Q1 FY \u201813. We have better alignment and improved efficiencies to enable us to invest to grow our market leadership over the long-term. For example, we continue to invest in the industry's best talents. Our headcount was up approximately 1,100 from last quarter with approximately 500 of the additions being from Meraki, Cloupia, Cariden, and BroadHop and the remainder being strategic hires in engineering as well as services.","We have been very targeted with our headcount investment focusing on areas that we expect will drive profitable returns over time. We demonstrated leverage in our profitability model this quarter with our strong non-GAAP operating margins at 28.2%, which was at the high end of our long-term financial model. We continue to drive cost efficiencies and productivity gains while we strengthened our innovation portfolio.","As I mentioned earlier, we did have a tax benefit this quarter that resulted in a lower than expected non-GAAP tax provision rate of 20%. The tax benefit related to the signing of the American Taxpayer Relief Act which resulted in a tax law change retroactively reinstating the federal R&D tax credit. This had a $132 million positive impact. $72 million related to FY \u201912 and $60 million related to Q1 and Q2 of FY \u201813. Only the FY \u201813portion of the benefit of $60 million is included in our non-GAAP earnings this quarter.","The full $132 million benefit is included in our GAAP earnings. Also this quarter, we settled IRS tax audits covering six years going back to fiscal year two. The settlement resulted in a $794 million benefit that is only included in our GAAP earnings this quarter and is excluded from our non-GAAP earnings.","In terms of profits, we had solid results, both from a non-GAAP as well as from a GAAP perspective. Our non-GAAP net income was $2.7 billion representing an increase of 6% and as a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP net income was 22.5%. As I mentioned earlier, our non-GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis was $0.51 versus $0.47 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012, a 9% increase.","Again, our non-GAAP EPS included approximately $0.01 tax benefit. GAAP net income was $3.1 billion as compared to $2.2 billion in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012. GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis were $0.59 versus $0.40 in the same quarter of fiscal year 2012.","Our commitment to our shareholders to successfully execute against our stated capital allocation strategy remains one of our top priorities. Cash flow from operations was a very strong $3.3 billion, which was up 8%. We returned $1.2 billion to our shareholders including $500 million through our share repurchases and $743 million through our quarterly dividend.","Total cash, cash equivalents and investments were $46.4 billion, including $7.0 billion available in the U.S. at the end of the quarter.","Our balance sheet performance continues to be very strong and is a competitive differentiator. The metrics was solid with DSO of 34 days, non-GAAP inventory returns of 11.1 and total deferred revenue growth of 7%. Our results continue to demonstrate that we are executing as we said we would. We are pursuing the opportunities that we believe are strategic to our growth and delivering the innovation to accelerate our customer\u2019s priority. Achieving profitable growth where profits grow faster than revenue long-term has been our management focus. We are confident with our financial model and we believe we are in a position of strength and we remain focused on our execution.","I'll now hand the call back over to John for further details on our business momentum as well as our trend. John?","John T. Chambers","Thank you very much Frank. I'll now provide some additional detail on the performance and trends we are seeing in our business and in the market. I'll first walk through our portfolio in terms of year-over-year revenue growth, followed by discussing geographic and customer segments in terms of orders. First, our core business, switching revenues increased 3% this quarter with increases in both fixed and modular. We continue to see strength in our Nexus data center switching, growing more than 20%.","In the Campus we demonstrated our continued innovation with availability of the Catalyst 3850. The industry's first solely converged wired and wireless platform. We do see the overall switching market as relatively flat and expect continued macro and government spending challenges to remain headwinds for this segment overall.","The stability of our switching gross margin continues; Gary real nice job, by you and Frank on that. Our next generation routing strategy remains solid, with our architectural approach and strength in mobility and video providing differentiated long-term value.","In this quarter, total revenue for next generation networking, the routing segment declined 6%, driven by the timing of some large deals and challenging environment in a few key geographies such as Europe and China.","We saw continued momentum in the edge with the ASR 9000 growing comfortably about 30% year-over-year. And SP mobility strengthened by the strong ASR 5500 adoption going again in the upper teens.","Wireless continues to be one of our fastest growing business; with revenue growth of 27%; the fifth consecutive quarter of record revenue for our wireless group.","With the portfolio completely refreshed, we experience strong growth across the board. SP Wi-Fi growth continued to be extremely strong with this segment more than doubling year-over-year, where a few years ago, we were tamely behind in wireless. We have innovated and executed very well and are today in a strong market leadership position. We have driven this leadership with a combination of internal innovation and strategic investment, and we will continue to be aggressive with moves like the acquisition of Meraki.","Security grew 1%, driven by high-end farewell growth in data centers. We continue to win in security with an architectural play and as such are fundamentally shifting our strategy from a collection of products to a platform. The growth of our identity services engine managing the use of mobile devices and our acquisition of Cognitive Security providing an advanced threat defense, demonstrates how we are moving our strategy forward.","Moving on to the data center; data center grew 65%, fueled by the industry leadership we are delivering with our unified data center strategy","We continue to see strong growth across all geographic regions with more than 20,000 UCS customers, up 87% year-over-year and more than 3000 channel partners to actively growing UCS worldwide. To put this momentum in perspective, our UCS plus Nexus 2k to 5K business is at an overall $3.5 billion annual run rate. Our recent Nexus 6000 introduction is a sign of our continued innovation in this market.","Our VCE joint venture continues to lead the converged infrastructure market with demand surpassing the $1 billion run rate. As we hit these large numbers, we continue to be very optimistic about our absolute growth, but by definition the percentage of growth as these numbers increase were slow.","We will also likely see some increases in seasonality as our peers see with much stronger calendar year Q2 and calendar year Q4 performance. These are good challenges and speak to the leadership role we have established in this market.","CIO continue to tell us that UCS and Nexus are their primary strategy in the datacenter and they are increasingly evolving Cisco from a primarily a communications partner to a strategic IT partner.","From the onset, we took an architectural approach to this market and that has driven unique and differentiated value. I could not be more pleased with the continued innovation, execution, momentum and value we are driving.","Now moving on to collaboration; collaboration declined 11% year-over-year. We did see good growth in conferencing, which grew 11% year-over-year with WebEx billable users growing 40% to 8.5 million valuable users.","UCS Fab excluding the underlying server revenue, UCS which is now reported in data center.","Our largest challenge continues to be our TelePresence business with the US Federal business continuing to be the most challenging in terms of market. Where we sell an integrated video architecture from the iPhone, to the iPad, to the x60, to the x90, that are mostly TelePresence we win. Cloud mobility, BYOD and pervasive video continue to drive the transitions in this market. And I believe we have the opportunity to be the market leader.","Moving onto video, total SP Video revenue was up 20% year-over-year. The integration of NDS continues to go very well driving results on both the top and bottom line. The recent announcements of our next generation Videoscape platform integrating the assets acquired with NDS and market traction including major new alliances with AT&T and Cox have been very well received. We continue to drive a transition in our service provider video business driven by the integration of NDS evolving from low-margin set-top box business to more of a profitable and strategic Videoscape architecture in the cloud.","Finally our service business delivered 10% growth as we continue to transition to solutions led selling to expand our opportunity to sell integrated architectures. A key element of our strategy is this growth of smart services where the customers uses our software and analytics to drive greater efficiency, better performance, and simplification of the networks in IT infrastructure. We saw our Smart Services new customer growth of 81% in this quarter. We continue to deliver our services intellectual property to our customers to arm them to grow their opportunity and scale ours. At the financial analyst conference, we discussed our aspirations to grow services to 24% to 26% of our revenue.","We already are approaching that level with our global enterprise accounts, and seeing that traction translate into increased share of wallet, man share and total opportunity with these customers. We are focused on scaling that model throughout the entire customer base. Going hand in hand as we do this with our partners.","In summary, we continue to drive innovation across our entire portfolio focusing on architectural solutions, bringing together ASICs hardware, software and services to deliver differentiated customer value.","I\u2019ll now move on to provide some color on our geographic and customer segments. The following geographic and customer segment growth rates are in terms of year-over-year product orders unless specifically stated otherwise.","In Q2, Cisco\u2019s total product orders were flat year-over-year. I would remind you that the order growth for Q1 and Q2 of last fiscal year were strong at 13% and 17%, therefore challenging comparisons.","Looking at the numbers from a geographic perspective, specifically the American region grew 2%, U.S. Enterprise and U.S. Commercial continued a very positive growth trends both up 9% year-over-year. Within the public sector we continue to state, local and education accelerating growing across the U.S. at 7% and U.S. federal which maybe starting to stabilize, still too early to say for sure, we\u2019re still negative at minus 5%.","U.S. Service Router was relatively flat as you know the service provider is large scale driven. We continue to believe our integrated architectures to address mobility, video and cloud are a huge competitive advantage. The Asia Pacific, Japan and China region grew at 3%. India had another quarter with growth of over 50%, and Japan grew in the mid-single digits. China was down approximately 4%. While we believe that China decline may last for several quarters, we\u2019re committed to the China market, our customers, partners, employees, and the Chinese people. We are confident that our growth will return to the double digit growth if we execute properly.","Our Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Russia region declined by 6%, a slight improvement from last quarters, decline of 10%. We are seeing some stabilization, but still too early to call a recovery across Europe.","Now moving on to the customer market view. Again, from an orders prospective, enterprise grew 1%, US strength was offset by weakness in EMEA which was down approximately 10% in enterprise and China, commercial grew 1% with US strength offset by slight weakness in other regions. Our servicer provider business declined 1%, slight declines in the Americas and EMEA were offset by double-digit growth in Asia-Pacific, Japan and China.","As we discussed we are driving the transition to more software video solutions and have been more selective in the business we are taking in terms of set-top boxes and the lowest margin set-top box business in particular. Global public sector was flat.","Frank, let me now turn it over to you for guidance.","Frank A. Calderoni","","Thank you John. Let me now provide a few comments on our guidance for the third quarter fiscal year '13. Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements and you should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements, and that actual results could be above or below our guidance.","The guidance we are providing is on a Non-GAAP basis with reconciliation to GAAP. For Q3 FY '13 we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 6% on a year-over-year basis. This assumes that our divestiture of Linksys product line which has been approximately 1% of our product revenue process made quarter and will no longer be contributing to our top line.","For the third quarter we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately in the range of 61% to 62%. Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 is expected to be in the range of 26.5% to 27.5% and our non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be approximately 21% in the third quarter. Our Q3 FY 13 non-GAAP earnings-per-share is expected to range from $0.48 to $0.50 per share and we anticipate our GAAP earnings in Q3 will be $0.08-$0.11 per share lower than our non-GAAP EPS.","We have modeled into our guidance cautious optimism assuming continued strength in US commercial and US enterprise, early signs of stability in parts of Europe, reacceleration in many of our top emerging countries continued execution in our growth markets and continued leadership with our service providers. We do see some risk with the political and economic landscape in the US, Europe and Asia, but we believe our momentum supports this tradition. We do encourage you to be conservative in your models this quarter and next.","Other than those quantified items noted previously there were no other significant differences between our GAAP and our non- GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisition, asset impairments, restructuring and tax to other events which may or may not be significant. As a reminder Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done to an explicit public disclosure.","Thank you. And John back to you.","John T. Chambers","Thank you Frank. Well done. As a reflect on Q2 FY \u201813, I am pleased with our execution as a company. We continue to deliver on our commitments to you, our shareholders, to our partners, and to our customers. Each of us as Cisco employees take pride in our record revenue with growth of 5%, non-GAAP gross margins of 62.3%, non-GAAP expense growth of 5%, $3.3 billion in cash from operations and 9% growth in non-GAAP earnings per share.","Looking forward, most of the market trends are playing to our strengths and made our most important strategic investments. First in the data center, we are seeing our momentum translate into significantly increasing deal sizes and opportunities. Just as an example a major enterprise customer after they put in their pilot systems and are now moved into production, with $3 million with us in the data center in one year, and just 1.5 years later, $35 million was their run rate.","UCS is becoming a preferred platform for business critical applications. One quick point is, what we have done with our partner, SAP and their using on the UCS platform, where scenarios that took days or run in seconds with 30% to 35% less cost.","Second in mobility, we are seeing CapEx spend move rapidly from wireline to wireless or mobility. And Cisco has the only portfolio in the industry that brings together wireless LAN, mobile edge, mobile backhaul, small sale, and SP Wi-Fi to address the cloud and BYOD proliferations.","Third on video; NDS is helping driving our business in the cloud, moving from set-top boxes to more valuable and profitable software and service offerings.","And fourth, we are very well positioned to capitalize when accelerated growth returns in our top five emerging countries. We have built a strong foundation in these markets as we understand that in the long run the majority of the world's GDP and growth in our industry will come from these emerging countries.","We manage our business as a portfolio and believe we are positioned very well to invest, innovate and balance risk with performance during any economic environment. This balance gives us a competitive advantage especially during times when markets are in transition or seeing slower growth. During these times some businesses were outperformed, this will move with the trend of the market, but we had the flexibility to invest for the long-term growth and help provide a competitive return to our shareholders. This is also an important differentiator in the manage of our customers and our partners.","In our top global accounts, we are seeing the future play out as we expected. We are leading with services and integrated architectures to directly address the customer\u2019s opportunities and as a result gaining mind share and new revenue opportunities. Our ability to deliver value to the integration of hardware, software, ASICs and services will continue to be a competitive advantage as the scaling complexity of traffic on the Internet grows.","Looking out at the future transitions, three of the biggest opportunities for Cisco lie on first, our transition as a number one communication company to the number one IT company. We define again the number one IT company in terms of relevance and value to our customers, and therefore profitability for our shareholders.","Second, our ability to drive the future programable networks really thinking about it in terms of application centric networks, enabling the network to power a new breed of these applications, dramatically increasing the value of the network claims.","And third, what we are calling the Internet of Everything markets opportunity. Our ability to connect the 99% of the people process data and things not yet connected to drive new capabilities, richer experiences, and unprecedented our economic opportunities.","Our focus is and will remain driving returns to our shareholders and value to our customers and employees, while we cannot control the broader political, and economic environments, we will continue to leverage our innovation engine, our disciplined focus and our customer centricity to drive our success.","Now Mel, it\u2019s all right. Let\u2019s move on to question and answers.","Melissa Selcher","","Absolutely, thanks John. We\u2019ll now open the floor to Q&A. We still request the analysts please ask only one question. Operator please open the floor to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS.","Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","Hi, thank you, can you hear me.","John T. Chambers","Yes we can Amitabh, you sound very smart.","Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","John, I just want to ask you about a few of your segments or end markets in particular security collaboration, routing and even service provider video excluding India, I mean all these segments seem to be flatted on year-over-year. Just trying to understand better, is it simply function of demand, pricing you could just maybe shed some more color there.","John T. Chambers","Amitabh, you probably about six or seven questions, is there one specific area, that you would like to deal with whether it\u2019s service providers or security or video.","","Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","May be security if you can just tough on that.","John T. Chambers","Sure it\u2019s a great one. If you watch our security business was just up 1%, in the areas where we still an architecture and let\u2019 use the U.S. get accounts or the enterprise accounts or even commercial our security business grows well. But when we go through our partners on a global basis, it\u2019s a much more complex film, so I think what you\u2019re going to see is do over the next period of one to two years, as with our new leadership under Chris Young is doing a super job, we're going to move more and more to time this security pieces together in architectural approach, and as we moved away space list an area where there is security or video or collaboration, our general sales force Rob had to pick that up, and candidly we lost a little bit of momentum in the process. So in terms of security, I think it is a complex architecture of sales, we wanted to be, and I think you will see us improve on that over the next 1 to 2 years.","Let me give you one more since you were so nice. On the service provider segment as a whole, our relationship with service providers are just excellent, it is just lumpy. And just to give you a war story, we had one order Rob, that you and I both call the local county come in on a Saturday at the end of Q1. If that said that had been booked on Monday, this quarter would have gone in single-digits instead the first quarter grew in mid-teens. Now think I might have misspoke on the call, Q1 a year ago actually through business by the way in terms of total bookings 13% in Q2 in fiscal year '12 business by about 7%. I might have said 17.","So putting that into perspective those comments however made on service provider are referring to Q1 this year and Q2. We are really in good shape here and if you watch service providers spend and as you would expect I have talked to many of the top CEOs in our service provider customers more and more the dollars are moving to mobile, so our ability to combine fixed and mobile uniquely together is extremely strong and portfolio architecture time together is unbeatable.","So I am comfortable with where we are, U.S. service provider I think will be very solid. I have a lot of confidence in Michael Glickman and the team there, and in terms of whether you are at AT&T or Verizon or Sprint, Comcast or Time Warner we never been stronger position than we are really tough our competitors loss accounts. Nice way of saying, we will get our fair share of skin plus.","Melissa Selcher","Thanks Amitabh, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Modoff, with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Modoff \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, John yeah kind of continuing on that service provider line, but the operators in the U.S. except for Verizon and all ranching up there spending this year, you\u2019ve got some of the cable operators as well, some improvements in China, Japan and even Europe perhaps not worsening, how do you see that overall evolving through the year. And then second you got strong, you just brought into sale, you only need IP access point, you\u2019ve got a full on mobile operating offering, what are you doing on that?","John T. Chambers","It sounds like you've been talking to a couple of few years that we have been calling on, if you watch the service providers as a whole, are more moving more and more their spending as I alluded in the first comments, more into wireless but they want an architectural play, their plans are \u2013 and their plans are like all of our customers plans, they are going to watch to see what happens, they're going to watch to see if there is a hesitation in the economic, was any government missteps which I think personally we'll probably manage through, and they will balance their spending throughout the year, and as you indicated most of the service providers are recently optimistic on increasing their CapEx spending this year, and even those that may not are often spending more in the areas where we're strongest, which is the mobility side of the house.","I'd be surprised, if you don't see us get our fair share of spending in this area and more, but just using the U.S. service provider as an example where we have a great team, it's just as lumpy, and no matter team motto like using those words, but we grow mid-teens, one quarter flat the next, 7% the next and so, I think we will achieve these service provider CapEx spend growth plus in terms of our growth rates, and I am hard pressed to say competitors that has more than a product or two, that comes out as architecturally, are you aware of any, Rob?","Robert Lloyd","","I think that\u2019s accurate John.","John T. Chambers","Thank you Brian.","Melissa Selcher","Thanks Brian. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley..","John T. Chambers","Ehud, how are you doing?","Ehud A. Gelblum \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Are you there?","John T. Chambers","Yes, we are.","Ehud A. Gelblum \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","So I appreciate it. Couple of quick ones. First of all, can you give us a sense as to how big NDS was in the quarter or service provider video may have done without it. Looks as if you do compensate for an estimate of NDS that service provider video may have been a little weak, but I don\u2019t know and I don\u2019t have exact math to do that. Also Meraki, can you give us a sense as to how much that contribution was or due to accounting, I am guessing that maybe it didn\u2019t have much contribution, they may have some deferred revenues, just to understand how that impacted, because your wireless is growing in good section, I just wanted to make sure we had a clean number on wireless looks like?","And then from the comment on the Americas, is that getting tougher, is that why the gross margin was down or is competition of America is actually doing fine overall and we shouldn\u2019t really worry about gross margin fluctuations in the Americas?","John T. Chambers","Hi Ehud. We are trying to hold the questions to one. So I am going to comprise and answer two, and chat all of our peers to one in terms of the direction. In terms of service provider video, yes, 20% of the business growth was in NDS. If you look at service provider video, the Americas, then Asia Pacific, Japan, and China actually had good growth. Europe, we are walking away from low volume, very poor margins set-top box business. So they were down dramatically. And I mean dramatically year-over-year in terms of the numbers.","In this quarter and candidly a little bit last quarter Rob, if I remember right. So you are going to see a transition where it make sense, set-top boxes where we can make good margins, and the customers buying an architecture and if it\u2019s purely a bid that is on very, very poor margins, we are not even going to bid and that\u2019s what you are seeing in terms of results.","So actually I am really comfortable with where we are in terms of our video strategy and service provider, and this is the type of thing Gary and Rob you are doing great with the teams and I want to give a lot of credit to Martin and Jasper, and the field teams as well, that we are focused on profitability as much as we are just roll of dollar growth. And I like the way this transition is playing out.","So again I think this substantiates the direction in which you\u2019re seeing us move more and more including our acquisitions into the cloud software recurring revenue streams et cetera and you know with Meraki. It will be a slow ramp up because it is deferred revenue, since off a small base. So it\u2019s very small for the next couple of quarters, but I really like the margin, I love the team there. Really good, love the concept, but it\u2019s impact this quarter and next quarter are very small, you\u2019re right on that.","Next question, please?","","Operator","","Our next question comes from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.","","John T. Chambers","Hey, Mark.","","Mark Sue \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thank you. Hi, John. Just I mean the clarification the 46 revenue guidance, if I look at the trends in Linksys, it\u2019s really \u2013 would that be really 5% to 7% revenue guidance or would you classify that in the environment, it\u2019s not really yet on the GAAP, but it\u2019s off the break. And then just on the question on the cash generation which is now greater than 2X your dividend and buy back, what\u2019s the inclination for Cisco to be not only a dividend payer but also a dividend grower?","John T. Chambers","Okay. Combination on it, let me get the second one, you get the first one Frank or you want to reverse them.","","Frank A. Calderoni","Any one.","John T. Chambers","Okay. I\u2019ll get the second one. In terms of our growth, we\u2019re completely committed to giving and back as our shoulders deserve over 50% of our cash generation. We want to see what happens in the tax regulations, and then candidly I don\u2019t have a really disposition this. We\u2019re going to turn to our shareholders and say what you want us to do? Do you want a share buyback or do you want it in terms of dividend. We clearly would not have started our dividend payments, if we didn\u2019t over time anticipate them going longer, but I think we all want to see what happens to tax policy here and then as that becomes clear they might turn to our shareholders and ask you what you want us to do. In terms of the first question, Frank.","Frank A. Calderoni","Mark as far as the guidance for Q3, I gave 46%, that 46% growth off of the base from Q3 of \u201912, the other comments that I made as it relates to Linksys; Linksys is approximately 1% of revenue, so it\u2019s kind of approximate slightly below $100 million. We are going to close that transaction most likely mid-quarter, and so we will not have mostly half more that revenue for the back half of the quarter. So we have to kind of take that into consideration in the guidance. So that guidance assumes that we are not including that additional revenue, so that will move out with the acquisition and the growth would be remaining at 46%.","John T. Chambers","Thank you Mark.","Melissa Selcher","Great, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Hi, thank you, hi John.","John T. Chambers","Hi, Simona, how are you doing?","Simona Jankowski \u2013 Goldman Sachs","I\u2019m well, thank you. Wanted to ask on the switching business I think you said it was up 3% year-on-year, which was a little bit better than expected, but you also made a comment about that being slightish, I just want to make sure understand that comment, what\u2019s that into next quarter or for the entirety of the year, and how would you put that in context with the 10 gig upgrade cycle that seems to be underway?","John T. Chambers","If you look at the overall market today and we are modeling for today, we obviously have our hash market share in government and space and U.S. Federal government. As you are aware and we do very well in Europe enterprise and if I\u2019m remembering off the top of my head, Mel, I think Europe Enterprise was down 10% in terms of total enterprise business there.","So Simona what we are saying is in this current market including the benefits when we get some really hot products, the Nexus plan with 10 gig and others was a good example which grew well over 20%, that does balance part of our traditional business. So we are modeling switching in the short term at flat, in terms of it. Now it doesn\u2019t mean that one will be a year out, but for this quarter and next quarter, it\u2019s going to be a little bit wavy and we\u2019re just building our model, and our guidance assuming that will be flat. We do believe that as the market comes back at hovering starts to increase, as you begin to get more balance on a global basis, enterprise becomes more confident. We get federal governments around the world spending more then that will be an entirely different scenario in terms of switching volume.","Simona Jankowski \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thanks Simona.","Melissa Selcher","Our next question comes from Tal Liani with Merrill Lynch.","John T. Chambers","Hello, Tal.","","Tal Liani \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hello, can you hear me?","John T. Chambers","Yes we can.","Tal Liani \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. My question is, I think it\u2019s the favorite topic for you. It\u2019s more about the environment, the last two conference calls there was a feeling that there is \u2013 we\u2019re coming out of a slow down than there is a hint of recovery and you mentioned few areas every quarters of things that might get better are getting better. This quarter, I look at numbers, the order numbers, and I look at their commentary, you seem to be a little bit more cautious with your commentary. How would you describe the environment? Are we seeing some hints of recovery, are we seeing the end of the kind of slowdown? Is this quarter was better than the previous quarter or was it \u2013 or did it turn down again this quarter. I am just trying to understand the environment across these subsectors? Thanks","John T. Chambers","So, Tal maybe answering it first and then company statement and then coming down very specific. Our business by month during the quarter was pretty much what we usually get each of the Q2. Rob we would like to see another point or two of order growth but that would have been a very, very good quarter, and it was inline with what we expected with that type of balance.","In terms of the areas, we know there is some tremendous barriers out there and some of the them I respect awful lot, the finance committee that really believe we are in for economically challenging times, especially in Europe and the U.S.; that\u2019s not what I am hearing from the majority of my customers and that\u2019s not what we saw in our business.","So starting with U.S., our U.S. enterprise and commercial growing at 9% and there both have been steady up turns in terms of their direction and candidly as Rob study expectations for next quarters will \u2013 it is almost always an indicator two to four quarters they opt GDP growth and it usually does proceed back to the quarters, numbers both on the upturn and downturn within that.","Even if Rob if we say half of their growth is due to selling architectures and taking share of total expense and selling better their business community and candidly growing collaboration security if I remember in double digits, because their architectural sales is supposed to pinpoint products, while the other half is being on steady increase as well.","The other area is Europe and I have realized I am in the vast minority on this queue. Don\u2019t look at Europe as one Europe, look at as four pieces I alluded to earlier. We are seeing some early signs of improvement in three of the four sections in Europe, too early to say it\u2019s a trend change, but if you watch our pipeline, you look what\u2019s been put into the pipeline in Germany, in Northern Europe in particular, it\u2019s beginning to give recent portion, cautious optimism, I would like to see it at least another quarter.","UK is getting the speed underneath pretty well. The South it is just tough and that one remodeling very tough with the foreseeable future. It doesn\u2019t mean there are uncertain markets where we get our fair share of market and then sound, but since we are pretty broader, you are going to see the Southern Europe remained tough.","In terms of the economy on China, I have always been more of bull on this. In my view is that with new leadership coming into China there is no way to let that market grow slower than 7and 9% and I would have said that a year ago as well, our issues in China are just things that we have to work through that many of you are aware of and that will take time and we will work through it in a healthy give and take win wind for the Chinese People's.","India, it did slow down at our business, but our business spent the other way and I think what you're beginning to see is some of the common projects free up and some of the businesses that we have to grow, now they obviously are not going to grow to 50% but you know I think a sustainable growth in double digits feels pretty good and we got a new leader there Jeff White.","So it's a nice way of saying on color commentary on the things we can control and influence, it\u2019s good. I do believe that governments have the potential trip as up here, I don't think that's going to be a trip up to last long time but each time there is an issue with the government and US currently going through \u2013 what they're going to do on the budget issues, that can cause a temporary pause in the market both in government and also in other accounts but the overall part there is that if you believe that there our numbers are an indicator, we're beginning to see a very slow, not as fast as any of this one but a slow steady up turn in terms of pipeline and the others. Rob would you add to that?","Robert Lloyd","I think John, those points are all very valid but I think the most important thing is let's watch US enterprise and commercial markets, let's see how we do in our top five emerging countries, those are all indicators as to how we see that, those economies begin to grow and those are pretty important parts of our growth engine.","John T. Chambers","I think the key takeaway tale is cautious optimistic.","Tal Liani \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","John T. Chambers","Thanks (inaudible), next question please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sanjiv Wadhwani, of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.","Sanjiv Wadhwani \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Co.","","Thanks, John actually just a follow up almost to that question, so a few quarters in a row now that your order growth has kind of decelerated, but given your guidance may be some stability, comps getting easier, I don\u2019t know if you care to comment on this, but would you talk about some order growth acceleration in terms of product orders for this current quarter?","John T. Chambers","I think mathematically you have to. And if you watch, the comps are easy as you said, but put it different way I think we\u2019re down to a new normal, now we\u2019re looking to growing off that level. So what Rob and I watched is particularly a sequential growth in terms of orders. As you would expect given this quarter in this conference call, Rob and I have gone not one level deep but probably about four levels deep with everyone of the key sales leaders in the road from India, to China to Latin America, to Middle East each of areas and our pipelines in all of them are slowly accelerating, not at the pace we want to see and clearly there will be some hits and some misses because sales teams by definition not only the order is lumpy but some will not hit their expectations, but I would say, overall the pipelines are looking good, we are clearly modeling order growth returning to positive growth on it. It doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ll always be right, but it feels pretty good and I think our inspection, Rob, was pretty good when we exercised the team and confidence is pretty good.","Sanjiv Wadhwani \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Co.","","That\u2019s right.","Melissa Selcher","","Great. Thanks Sanjiv. Next question please.","Operator","I think our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James.","Simon Leopold \u2013 Raymond James","Thank you. I wanted to first see John, if you could clarify two comments you made to see if they are actually the same comment. You talked about service provider being lumpy, in the prepared remarks you talked about the routing business being lumpier. I want to confirm that really what you\u2019re attributing this to is service provider is being lumpy when they purchase routing. And then in terms of what I wanted to see if you can dive into, with more specifically on the service provider wireless market, since it seems like that\u2019s the favorable area for CapEx and you don\u2019t provide radio base stations. If you could give us a little bit more color on your exposure to service provider wireless in terms of what products are in there, how big a contribution that is and what kind of growth rates you\u2019re experiencing for service provider wireless. Thank you.","John T. Chamber","","Got you, more than fair. The actual combination of all of the above, it\u2019s not uncommon for us to receive $100 million order from a service provider in given quarter and that might be half the orders Rob for the whole year, in terms of a build out. And that isn\u2019t just limited however to routing, obviously our UCS business and service providers and our data center cloud business is very good. Our hosted collaboration in communication business, good opportunity and so we are across the board on them, so well the majority of our router is basically high end routers are sold into service provider and it\u2019s 35% of our business. There is an awful lot of the service provider business. On the next call, I\u2019ll be having an answer on what percentage is routing versus otherwise. But I think you almost assume that routing isn\u2019t even the majority in the service providers.","In terms of the wireless side thank you giving me that slow pitch down the middle of the plate. It is the area, we made the furthest progress on. In the wireless LAN, the hot spots if you will on that capability good 27%, the mobile edge the 5500 which we are winning in vast majority of router jump balls and actually our competition is struggling in this pretty well grew in the high teens.","In terms of service provider, Wi-Fi what we saw was year-over-year growth of 100% and what we watch is more than number of accounts hence we have, because these start up small and grow larger. Small sales you\u2019re going to continue to see some invest in, our growth there is extremely good, and you began to tie these architectures together and turn back to back all in this environment, and our ability to help generate revenue in video across these mobile devices including from Videoscape and you begin to get an architecture together that no one comes close to and this is where our relationship and our services providers is not just strongest by a little bit, it\u2019s strongest by a long way and candidly we would put lot of pressure on our competitors and you might say missed out, but I think a large part is just, we are executing extremely well in our plays and the value we bring is to really coordinate service matters almost with that exception they no longer consider these products anywhere near commodity and our role in each one of them is going up towards a strategic partnership including programmability, architecture throughout the network has became more application centric type of networks.","So it\u2019s way more than routing, but you are right. Routing is a statement of service provider and it tends to be lumpy, my own view is that personally service provider growth often could be better than just routing growth, so in absolute terms, it\u2019s a stronger number too. Is that answers the question reasonably well?","Simon Leopold \u2013 Raymond James","Great, thanks Simon.","John T. Chambers","Okay. We will assume that is yes.","Melissa Selcher","","Next question please.","Operator","I think our next question comes from Rod Hall with JPMorgan.","Rod B. Hall \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, thanks for taking my question guys. Couple of quick ones. Hi John. Just on EMEA gross margin, it was up a little bit sequentially and I just wonder if you could talk a little bit about that and services gross margins were up and products down. So you think it was driven by services or if you can give us any color on what\u2019s going on there and I just wanted one of the big \u2013 I guess global currency trend now on Japanese yen deprecation and I just wonder if you could talk about what the impacts might be for you guys on business if that continues to incur and it seems like Japanese government is indicating. Thanks a lot.","John T. Chambers","","Okay, sure. Frank will give you the detail on the gross margin first and I will make some general comments, go ahead on Europe and gross margin.","Frank A. Calderoni","","So Rod, you said Europe, so we had last quarter 53.3 going at 64.9. Primarily that improvement was a much stronger mix of products, and also getting back to the other question that was asked earlier, Ehud had a question similar on Americas. The opposite occurred in America, so gross margins went from 63.6 to 61.8. So we had a bit more in favorable mix, which was high growth in data center in the U.S., whereas in Europe and we had much more favorable comparisons, it was less of a say, SP video from quarter to quarter, and there was more favorability looking at the switching portfolio.","So in both situations it would make but in different direction.","John T. Chambers","","And what is interesting and again this is I think the discipline that Gary and Rob and Frank are bringing to the company, and all of us are participating in, is there is as much focus on profitable growth, as there is top line growth. And just repeating the theme and I am going to get into trouble here, Mel, so you\u2019re going to have to look at the data. I answered this question, if I remember my data right our business in service provider, set-top boxes in Europe was off almost $100 million versus in a year earlier and it's because we passed on the deals that were non-profitable.","And that clearly is an indication of making decisions on what is right financially and the strategic for you and if we can't establish our value and integrate architecturally within that area then we are not going to bid. And so I think you are seeing our whole company Gary, really focus on profitable the gross margins all is getting measured by the active gross margins everything from discount to how we build our products to, how we felt value to our, to how we sell architectures on it.","So really it\u2019s a tough environment, my hats off to Chris Dedicoat, I think he\u2019s had done an amazingly good job in a tough environment really focused on profitable business and profitable growth and like I said, (inaudible) stay for sure, but some already signs in certain key geographies within Europe that\u2019s beginning to turn.","In terms of Japan, we got a world class team there and very good and our view is going to be the exact opposite. We are probably going to invest incrementally in Japan. Horizon there and to (inaudible) have done amazingly good job on this. We\u2019ve got great partners in NTT and Softbank coming out of Japan, and the stronger Yen allows them (inaudible) two of our products. And as we go globally with them on selling architecture and products together, it allows us to sell lower products. I don\u2019t think the strong yen will have much effect in our business. It all in Japan maybe the reverse, is that too simplicity.","Frank A. Calderoni","","No, John and I think we actually have done so well in winning market share across the service provider business, but we still have upside amongst those major Japanese enterprise accounts, that\u2019s where we are focusing is, we all now Japan is now turning global. So we have an opportunity to those Japanese companies around the world.","John T. Chambers","But it\u2019s probably one of the best examples of where we move from a capital provider to a product provider, to an architectural provider, to the most strategic business partner. We\u2019re not the large number of competitors completely don\u2019t have a single major franchise in Japan\u2019s service provider. And we intend to be aggressive and go after the same thing in enterprise, where I think it satisfies growth as long as we\u2019re getting the resources to go after.","Rod B. Hall \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","And John number there right, in EMEA set top box revenue.","John T. Chambers","Don\u2019t count us.","Rod B. Hall \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","I\u2019m not going to bet against you down 45% year-over-year.","John T. Chambers","","So you began to realize when service provider numbers are down, it isn\u2019t the question just down, we deliberately passed those type of numbers on to the service provider number making a material different and we are marking good business decisions on it, and I\u2019m real proud of our team there, however for the Cisco people listening on the team look in computers, we want top line growth and profitability growth. and profitability growth and so we\u2019re expecting each of the groups.","Melissa Selcher","","Great. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Long with Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Tim Long \u2013 BMO Capital Markets\t","","Thank you. Just another one on the gross margin front here, it sounds like in the quarter, I am assuming that in the January quarter the data center growth had a lot to do with the decline, but if you could look out into the sequential down for April and even beyond that, we are eliminating some low margin set-top business, we saw Linksys, we\u2019re adding a lot of software recurring revenues business. Are those other actions in the value engineering you\u2019re doing enough to offset the move to data center, can we start first of all, why not up next quarter and can we start to see those gross margin, maybe moving starting to move up in the out course. Thank you.","John T. Chambers","","Okay. So Frank kick me whenever you want to take over on this one. If you watch seeing with the common theme, I think many of you were concerned in fair question two years ago about should we maintain our gross margins with the vast majority of the markets not a player, and you\u2019re going to see rapid deterioration, it was the number one pressure on our stock margins. And if you watch what we have done is the reverse.","We have gotten very good stability across the gross margin base, you are seeing this in that 61% to 62% guidance, it will go up and down by quarter based on the mix, but you are right we are clearly modeling in continuing good growth dramatically faster in our data center business, and remember UCS is also combined with Nexus. And it is a process I want to be careful but you see it is a little bit lower half of the business Nexus, is a little bit over a third, and when you model those two together you begin to get good gross margins and that's different than our peers.","Secondly, and most of our peers when they install servers, they are selling commodity products. Have we re not selling commodity products. We get premiums, we get architectures, we get standardized on, we showed stronger margins there and yes your overall assumption is right, we are moving rapidly to software with A6 both of which get you better margins, 13 of the 14 acquisitions were software, cloud, recurring revenue streams and recurring revenue as one of your colleague said earlier, the good news about it is very predictable. The bad news is when you start from a low base, it takes you a while to get to size where it really becomes material for you, but it\u2019s a nice way of saying I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the margin stability and well, it\u2019s hard to look out very far in this industry, I like the stability we are seeing in and I see nothing that at the present time is making nervous on that.","Frank A. Calderoni","And trying to go back to what we cover back in December at the Financial Analyst Conference, we are talking about the long range model. Clearly, Tim I think you too laid out the opportunity from a gross margin standpoint clearly with a focus that we have in value engineering as well as to move to software services which will help margins and then on the other side, you have got the dynamics associated with datacenter as well as emerging market and then also at video when John kind of covers the SP video, so I think, yes I agree with John, we feel very comfortable with stability and that focus that we have in the company, but we are also kind of watching the balance as we look out the next several quarters, several years.","John T. Chambers\t","","Yeah, it\u2019s one of the things I am most of proud of namely one IT player who is in the market with low barriers to entry, who for two decades has consistently commanded the gross margins we had. And this is some, we will try to doing and I am very proud of the team doing it and it doesn\u2019t mean we are always capable of improving in certain areas and have to improve, but I think in a market with such low barriers to entry, our ability to maintain these gross margins, something we\u2019re very proud off and service Gary, one of the best examples that.","Next question please","Operator","I think our next question comes from Brian White with Topeka.\t","Brian J. White \u2013 Topeka Capital Markets\t","","Hi John, in China when we think about the second half of this year, it sounds like the 4G LTE built is going to kick in, I'm just curious if Cisco will be back in the game in the second half of the year. Also any thoughts on Oracle and Acme Packet and how that may change the competitive dynamic with Cisco?","","John T. Chambers","In terms of time in China, I've been doing business there for 26 years now, I am very patient, that\u2019s very hard on me because I'm not patient in anything else in my life and we always make decisions for the long-term decision process and make it from the position of strength and a win-win approach and we are great partners and we will earn the confidence of the people in China, the businesses there, et cetera as we move forward. I think by the second half of this year if we execute right as the leadership gets established here towards the end of March and as we work through some of the issues, I think you will see us in the game on many of the opportunities and you will see us also start to be aggressive across China, with Chinese partners in terms of how we go beyond just the top 10 cities more towards the top 100 or 200 in terms of the approach.","In terms of Oracle and their move, I think what it says is at the center of every major market transition going on that I'm aware of is the network. And so you are going by definition see both our peers, our partners and competitors say what can we do in this network and what role do we want to play. And well as it becomes more important in terms of programmability and intelligence and moving, processing power and storage throughout the networks, we clearly are going to do in security, you will see our peers by definition get into that. But overall we think we\u2019ve gamed up pretty well, what we think Oracle is doing here.","Oracle is a great customer, a great customer there and , I think you\u2019ll see us more work together, occasionally a little bit of overlap, but that really is a great question I think to maybe summarize on Mill. It will be nice time, one of this is certainly, cheap and give me and that\u2019s to do. If you watch what is occurring in the market and this quarter with just another proof point, our strategy envision is playing out extremely well versus what we expected and while there is to improve on, most of the concerns we have are more macro and more in the area of action than they are, specific competitors or technologies, it doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t be challenged as we do this total play in terms of literally a portfolio play tied together. They\u2019ll always pickup or else we have to improve on.","but if you watch where we are position wise, I feel very good. If you look at key takeaways, even in terms of we base our optimism on, I think you are articulated very well in the questions and Rob, you added too in clarifying one, U.S. enterprise commercial, arguably that is the key to what the U.S. economy is going to do over time. At the present time that feels good and our pipeline feels good. Emerging markets, there were okay this quarter, I think they are top five grew about 8% if I remember right, but India was way up and the others were mid single digits and China was down mid single digits. Our pipeline is starting to build there again and we\u2019ll be watching carefully to see if we can execute well on this the next one to two quarter on them.","Our strong relationship in service providers unless you are seeing something that I just don\u2019t. We\u2019ve never been a more effective leader or a partner and never made life more miserable on our competitors, which is a lot of fun to do and I apologize for that than we are right now in the service provider environment. So I think we\u2019ll get share spend although it will be in big deals and we\u2019ll continue to be lumpy up and down. If somebody seen something were missing, I think we know a couple of years, we need to do a little bit better and \u2013 but I feel very good there. We are seeing early signs of stabilization in government spending and also in probably a little bit over two thirds of Europe, I want to watch that for at least another quarter before I get real excited about it.","The major technology moves, datacenter cloud, the results speak for themselves, mobility. Thank you for the questions on that, it\u2019s an architectural play field good. Video, I like the transition, even though at times takes away from our total revenue, these are the right decisions from profitability and the future is going to be made on value added on top of services and software and I like our three big future opportunities, we\u2019re becoming potentially the number one IT player, the Internet of Everything and what the connectivity plays right into our heart, with intelligent networks, processes everywhere, A6 everywhere, using your install base. It really opens up for application centric networks and programmability on it in terms of direction.","We are realistic on potential challenges. We know that we are more optimistic on most of our peers in the global economy and we are basing that on what we have from our customers, where they say our business is good, but I am concerned about the economy, but purely also our ordered trends and we will see if that continues.","Government activity, well a lot of people get real concerned. I think it could cause a pause for a short-term, but that would be on, so we are assuming that you just navigate through that pause if it does here. And we realize also most of our industry peers and more conservative than we are in and they maybe right on it, but I like where we ended up for the quarter. Revenue guidance of 46% that clearly is aggressive and continues to be aggressive versus what our industry peers are in similar markets are saying, gross margin, 61% to 62% Frank, I agree and having a good shape on that. Earnings per share, we are continuing to focus on that been a key element, so that\u2019s kind of how it summarizes Mel, and it\u2019s was great question to end on.","So with that let me turn it back over you to Mel.","Melissa Selcher","Great, thanks John.

Thank you. You may begin.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks, Michelle. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco\u2019s fourth quarter fiscal 2018 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I\u2019m joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO.","By now, you should have seen our earnings press release, a corresponding webcast with slides including supplemental information will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the financial information section of our Investor Relations website.","Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic, and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise.","The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements including the guidance we will be providing for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Chuck.","Chuck Robbins","Thank you, Marilyn and good afternoon, everyone. We had a very strong finish to a great year. We generated our highest quarterly revenue of 12.8 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $0.70 as growth accelerated for another consecutive quarter. Our momentum was broad based across our portfolio, customer segments, and geographies. We also continued to generate solid margins, cash flow, and returns for our shareholders. Our results demonstrate a combination of strong customer adoption of our latest innovations, the ongoing value customers see in our software and subscription offerings, and excellent execution across our customer segments and geographies.","Our strategy is working and we believe that we're well positioned to capture growth across the portfolio with our pipeline of innovation. The broad adoption of multi-cloud environment is changing the very nature of how modern IT infrastructures are built and secured, and Cisco is at the center of this transition. The recently announced intent to acquire Duo Security is another example of how we are extending our intent-based networking portfolio for the multi-cloud world. Duo\u2019s SaaS delivered solution will expand our cloud security capabilities to help enable any user on any device to securely connect to any application on any network. Combining Cisco's network, end point, and cloud security platform with Duo\u2019s zero trust authentication and access solutions, we will be able to further enhance the industry\u2019s broadest and most effective security architecture in the market.","Now, I\u2019ll briefly highlight some of our innovation and the great momentum we're seeing across our key product areas. Starting with infrastructure platforms, we continue to rapidly innovate and transform our technology portfolio to drive even greater customer value. A year ago, we reinvented enterprise networking with the launch of our intent-based networking architecture. This quarter we saw continued strength in infrastructure platforms driven by the Catalyst 9000 as customers look to us to simplify and automate their networks.","Over the last year, we introduced additional innovations across our networking portfolio including new access, WAN, and data center offerings. In June, we announced new developer capabilities across our intent based networking portfolio, spanning all network domains, campus switching, wireless, WAN, data center and cloud. We're also excited that our developer program DevNet surpassed 500,000 registered members. As part of this program, we introduced new offerings to help developers and network engineers innovate throughout our intent-based architecture.","As we all know, the WAN is undergoing an architectural transition to a software defined WAN to enable IT to rapidly respond to changing business needs in a digital and cloud world. Our customers are driving this transition and looking to Cisco to help them make this shift. Our SD-WAN portfolio leverages our leading networking products, automation, and robust security architecture to enable greater flexibility, increased bandwidth, and lower costs.","This quarter we saw significant traction with Viptela as it has now been deployed at over 800 customers driven by our ability to provide higher capacity at a lower cost. We are pleased with the ongoing integration of Viptela with our core portfolio to drive even more value for our customers. As our customers move to a multi-cloud environment, we see tremendous opportunities to provide value to them by redesigning their IT architecture, delivering security, and building, orchestrating and managing applications.","In Q4, we saw the production launch of our hybrid cloud solution with Google, the introduction of a multi cloud solution with NetApp and numerous engagements with customers redesigning their IT architectures. We continue to believe Cisco is very well positioned to benefit from the increasing adoption of multi cloud.","Turning to security, security continues to be our customers number one concern and it is a top priority for us. Our strategy is to simplify and increase security efficacy through an architectural approach with products that work together and share analytics and actionable threat intelligence. This architecture is supported by Talos, one of the largest commercial threat intelligence teams in the world. We identify and protect against new and emerging threats like the recent VPN filter vulnerability through our sophisticated infrastructure and unrivaled telemetry of data.","Cisco is the largest network and enterprise security company and our approach of bringing security into the intent-based architecture and offering security across the network, end point, and cloud has proven to be very successful. This quarter we saw continuous strong momentum with revenue again accelerating and growing double digits year over year. We continue to invest in our product and technology innovation as we are committed to helping our customers on their multi cloud journey. Our focus is on delivering cloud security solutions that provide ease of use, scalability, and protect end users. As I mentioned earlier, with our acquisition of Duo Security, we will further enhance how we deliver simple, automated, trusted access anywhere for our customers environments.","Moving to applications, in May, we announced the launch of WebEx teams bringing together meetings, calling and teamwork into an integrated experience as part of the WebEx platform. In Q4, we introduced major new enhancements to the platform including a new user designed for WebEx meetings and a new solution with Google, combining their contact center AI service with a WebEx platform. With more than 3 million customer service agents globally using Cisco's contact center software, our integration with Google will help to automate responses in our call centers by leveraging data and intelligence from AI.","We also achieved another robust quarter of growth with AppDynamics underscoring the importance and value of our unique invisibility and analytics from the end user to the network to the application. To wrap up, 2018 was a great year. We returned to growth, investing in our core franchises, delivered new innovative platforms, and continued to shift our business to more software and subscriptions. Our record results demonstrate the strength of our business as well as the strategic focus and execution that we have delivered over the past twelve months. I want to thank our teams around the globe for delivering these results. We're looking forward to fiscal year 2019 with a clear focus on growth, execution, and innovation. We see incredible opportunities across our business and believe we're uniquely positioned to deliver on our vision to be one of the most strategic partners to our customers as they go through their digital transformation.","Kelly, I'll now turn it over to you.","Kelly Kramer","Thanks Chuck, I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter then cover the full fiscal year and the Q1 outlook. Q4 was a solid quarter across the business, we executed well with strong orders, revenue growth, margins, EPS and operating cash flow. It was great to see accelerated momentum in product orders which grew 7%. Total revenue was 12.8 billion, up 6%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 30.9%, non-GAAP net income was 3.3 billion, up 8% and non-GAAP EPS was $0.70, up 15%.","Let me provide some more detail on our Q4 revenue. Total product revenue was up 7% with broad strength across the portfolio. Infrastructure platforms grew 7% with growth in all businesses except for routing which was down slightly. Switching had another great quarter with strong growth in campus driven by the ramp of the Cat9K and growth in data center driven by the Nexus 9K. We saw good growth in wireless with strength in Meraki and our Wave 2 offerings. Data center had very strong double digit growth driven by servers and HyperFlex.","Routing declined slightly driven by weakness in SP routing. Applications was up 10% in total with growth across all the businesses. We saw a very solid growth in unified communications, telepresence, conferencing, and AppDynamics. Security was up 12% with strong performance in network security, unified threat, policy and access, and web security. Service revenue was up 3% driven by growth in advanced services as well as software and solutions support. We continue to transform our business delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions and recurring revenues.","In Q4, recurring revenue was 32% of total revenue, an increase of 1 point from a year ago. Revenue from subscriptions was 56% of our total software revenue, up five points year over year. We drove good growth in deferred revenue which was up 6% in total with product up 15% and services up 1%. Deferred product revenue from our recurring software and subscription offers was 6.1 billion, up 23%. There was also a strong increase in the unbilled deferred which is not on the balance sheet. The combined total deferred revenue plus unbilled deferred was up 28%.","When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our Q4 results year over year, there was a 90 basis point positive impact on revenue. We saw especially strong momentum in Q4 with total product orders growing 7%. Looking at our geographies, Americas grew 6%, EMEA was up 6% and APJC was up 12%. Total emerging market was up 12% with the BRICS plus Mexico up 22%.","In our customer segment, enterprise was up 11%, commercial was up 9%, public sector was up 1% and service provider return to grow, up 6%. Our product backlog at the end of Q4 was 6.6 billion, up 38% year over year. From a non-GAAP gross margin perspective, total Q4 gross margin was 62.9%, down 0.8 points. Product gross margin was 61.5%, down 0.4 points and service gross margin was 67.1%, down 1.7 points. Product gross margin was down 0.4 points driven by our APJC region related to some FP specific deals as well as negative product mix.","Product gross margin for the Americas and EMEA were both up year over year. Overall, pricing continued to have relatively modest erosion as you have seen over the past couple of quarters and we continued to be negatively impacted by higher component costs which we expect to continue in the near term. In terms of the bottom line from a debt perspective, Q4 net income was 3.8 billion and EPS was $0.81. The GAAP results include an $863 million benefit related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We've excluded the benefit from our non-GAAP results. ","We ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of 46.5 billion. Q4 operating cash flow was 4.1 billion, up 2% with free cash flow of 3.9 billion, also up 2%. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $7.5 billion to our shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of 6 billion of share repurchases and 1.5 billion for quarterly dividend.","I will now cover the full fiscal year. We delivered solid revenue, margins, net income, EPS, and operating cash flows. Revenue was 49.3 billion, up 3%, our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 31.1%, non-GAAP net income was 12.7 billion, up 5% and non-GAAP EPS was $2.60, up 9%. Our total non-GAAP gross margin was 63.8%, a decrease of 0.5 points, with product gross margin down 0.4 points and service gross margin down 0.9 points. GAAP net income was 110 million and GAAP EPS was $0.02 which includes the charges related to the Tax Cuts And Jobs Act of 10.4 billion.","For the full fiscal year, we delivered operating cash flow of 13.7 billion. We paid approximately 1.4 billion of one-time foreign taxes during the year related to the Tax Cuts And Job Acts. Operating cash flow increased 8% normalized for these tax payments. We returned 23.6 billion to shareholders over the fiscal year which represented 184% of our free cash flow. That was made up of 17.7 billion of share repurchases and 6 billion for our quarterly dividend.","To summarize, we had a strong Q4 and fiscal year. We executed well with strong top-line growth and profitability. We're seeing the returns on the investments we're making in innovation and driving the shift to more software and subscription, delivering long-term growth in shareholder value. As a reminder we are adopting the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606 as of Q1 fiscal year 2019 on the modified retrospective basis, its primary impact will be to accelerate our revenue recognition for certain software licenses and sales to future distributors as well as a recognition of a deferred commissions assets that will be amortized over the terms of our sales contract.","Let me reiterate our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We expect revenue growth in the range of 5% to 7% year over year. This range includes the impact of ASC 606 which we estimate to be a benefit of about 1%. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%, the non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 30% to 31%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 19%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.70 to $0.72. The guidance included our service provider video software solutions business that we recently agreed to sell and excludes a Duo acquisition since both transactions have not closed. We expect the SPVSS transaction to close in the first half of fiscal 2019 subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.","I\u2019ll now turn it back to Marilyn, so we can move into the Q&A.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks Kelly, Michelle let's go ahead and open the line for questions. And as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question only. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Michelle.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank Securities, you may ask your question.","Vijay Bhagavath","Good afternoon, Chuck, Kelly, hope you can hear me fine?","Kelly Kramer","Yeah.","Chuck Robbins","We can Vijay, thank you.","Vijay Bhagavath","My question to you Chuck and Kelly, please chime in, is it reasonable to assume you'd be extending the software subscriptions, idea and plan across the portfolio. Give us an early glimpse as to how is it going, what were some of the challenges, what were some of the positive surprises and would the makeup of this software subscription portfolio meaningfully change as you look to extend this model across the portfolio? Thanks.","Chuck Robbins","So, most of you know that we -- when we began the sale of the Catalyst 9000 that was the first attempt to sell a subscription software offering on top of a core networking product and that has gone as we\u2019ve said on prior calls reasonably well. I'm very pleased with how the adoption has been from our customers, they understand the value. As I said early on, we put - we knew when we started that process that we would need to deliver significant innovation that wasn't available in the traditional methodology of buying it in order for our customers to adopt it and some of those were the encrypted traffic analytics, the overarching analytics, I mean, the automation capability and then recently some assurance.","And you'll see us over the next coming quarters when we bring new products to market in the - particularly, in the enterprise networking space but across the portfolio, we will apply that same strategy. So, I think that we've been pleased and our job now is to ensure that the operational infrastructure of the company is prepared and we're working towards being able to ensure the customer is deriving the value from that software as well as obviously putting in the operational capabilities to ensure the renewals et cetera, so that's what we're focused on. Kelly any?","Kelly Kramer","No, I think you hit it.","Operator","Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs, you may go ahead, sir.","Rod Hall","Hi guys, thanks for the question. I\u2019m kind of beside myself, don't know where to start, these are so good. But let me - I guess, let me kick off with a question on the deferred revenue, Kelly. You said this off but including this off balance sheet deferred, it\u2019s up 28%, is that total deferred or a product deferred, can you just clarify what you meant by that and also maybe help us understand what ASC 606 impact on deferred was because that was I guess negative.","Kelly Kramer","Yeah, sure. So, on your question on the deferred revenue [plus][ph] unbilled deferred, so that was up 28%. The big driver we have for that, that is just purely product, okay. So, it is - what we mostly have in our unbilled deferred is from our collaboration, our applications business. They have a lot of periodic billing that they book month to month that is a very large number. So it is kind of apples to apples of business that we have booked that we\u2019ll recognize in the future. So that's why we look at both. When we do adopt ASC 606 for Q1 that will be one of our disclosures showing you the combination of deferred plus unbilled. So you have a remaining performance obligation. But it is just product that 28%. As far as the ASC 606, we adopt that in Q1. So in the results we just went through of the 6.1 billion of deferred from software and subscriptions that is related to how we've been accounting for it under the old ASC 605. So when you go into \u2013","Rod Hall","Can you just clarify though, would you write down some - you\u2019ll write some of the deferred down in Q1 as a result of the change or not much or --?","Kelly Kramer","Yes, so yeah I can give you some direction, you'll see that in our K. So we will be writing off a portion of that balance, so of the 6 billion, we will be writing off and restating because you basically restate your balance sheet for the new accounting rules. And like we said over the past year, where we will have that impact is things that were term-based software licenses things like our ELAs or Cisco One those will now be recognized up front where they used to be deferred. So the deferred revenue balance will be written down for that and will lower the balance of the deferred revenue and then as we go into Q1, we'll be recognizing any new business that we bill up front from that.","Operator","Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer, you may go ahead.","Ittai Kidron","Thanks and congrats, great quarter. I guess Chuck maybe you can help me figure out how you managed to navigate so well in what seems to be such treacherous waters out there between some deceleration in economic activity in Europe, the FX movement recently which is not favorable to you, although you price in dollars nonetheless makes your products a bit more expensive internationally, poor CapEx metrics, out of the large telcos; tariff wars. Globally, you seem to be moving along sidestepping all of those things; which of these things really bother you, concern you, you\u2019re watchful, you\u2019re preparing for. And then second question, maybe you can kind of dig a little bit on the networking, Cat9K clearly good progress, are there a customer metrics or anything you can give us there to help us solidify or get better visibility into the trend there?","Chuck Robbins","I was feeling pretty good until you asked the first part of your question. I have said publicly I think we're operating in a - we have been operating in what I would call it's been a very you know consistent global economic scenario, there's clearly even in the last few weeks been things that have risen you've got the strengthening of the dollar that you mentioned, you've got some uncertainty in a couple of emerging countries. So those are clearly things that we'll watching, we've seen these in the past and we know how to deal with them. We obviously have the impending tariff situation which we're watching closely and, on that front, we're in deep discussions in Washington with the administration on trying to get to a favorable outcome. We like to see that land in a good place, but overall all of those are things that we are very actively involved with and we watch on a daily basis.","As it relates to the networking business, the Catalyst 9000 as I said previously has been the fastest ramping product that we've ever built. So the customer count became less of an indicator pretty quickly and it flowed through to the infrastructure systems growth that you saw this quarter. So we didn't see it as a metric that was we usually use that metric on customer count when we're just trying to give you visibility to the ramp up of new product when it hasn't become real material to the revenue line and I think that we exceeded that point in time with a 9K pretty quickly. But I will tell you just so you know, I think Kelly keep me honest on this, I think we had roughly 9,650 plus customers on the 9K as of the end of the quarter, we had a great Q4, great adoption and we're very happy with where that product in architecture is.","Operator","Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research. You may go ahead.","Pierre Ferragu","I actually wanted to ask you about service provider, you returned to growth this quarter, which is fantastic. And I think you mentioned as well that your routing business was weak and most of that weakness was in the service provider vertical as well. I was curious to understand how you grew revenues even if routing was negative or maybe I got something wrong. And then, of course, I am very curious to hear whether this recovery in service provider spending might be driven by 5G already.","Chuck Robbins","Let me answer the macro question about the overall situation we see in service provider and then Kelly maybe you can cover the routing and the impact of the first part of the question. So, Pierre, in the service provider space, we were obviously pleased. I've said a number of times over the last couple of years that this is a business that is dominated by large customers. And so, as we've always said, when we have several of them that are slowing their spending and it looks bad and when we have several that are spending it looks pretty good and that's just the nature of this business.","Relative to 5G, I will tell you that I think I've said this on prior calls, starting at Mobile World Congress earlier this year, we really - we heard these customers in earnest begin and engage in discussions around what network requirements would look like for the infrastructure to support 5G assuming that they're going to add lots of high speed connections at the edge it will require high performance networks with quality of service and slicing and all those things.","So I would say that, I would not say that this is a material result of the implementation of 5G to be honest. We expect that is still a year out before many will start and probably see it in earnest into 2020 to be fair, but we're pleased with what our teams have done, it has been a tough market, our teams have continued to battle, our engineering team continues to work on next generation innovation and we're pleased with the results this quarter. Kelly?","Kelly Kramer","And to the point of, will I have better revenue, if you remember last quarter, the SP segment was down 4% and you're seeing that flow through the revenue this quarter when we talked about routing overall. So, when I look forward, we don't kind of talk about our guidance in the upfront by business, but some of this on the order side might play well as we go into Q1. What I will say adding on to Chuck's comments is I do think and as you know very well our service provider segment is made up of very, very large customers and in any one quarter, we can get big orders and that can fluctuate around. So, it adds to the sustainability. I would say we feel good about our position though I expect this could move around either way as we look forward. ","Operator","Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.","Sami Badri","Thank you for the question, my first question has a lot to do with Europe and the strength you saw in the region in this last quarter. and then is it safe to assume that going into next quarter and your very strong guidance, are you expecting to see the same kind of magnitude of strength in Europe again despite all the moving pieces politically. And then the second question I really have is about the Viptela product launch. Are you addressing customers that are already big users and customers of the campus product and the Meraki products to kind of up sell customers into your new Viptela product or maybe you can give us just an idea on the sales cycle and the customer base that you're addressing.","Chuck Robbins","If you don't mind, Sami, I'm going to answer the second one, and then I'll give you a little qualitative color on Europe and then Kelly will answer the specifics on the business expectations. So on the second part of the question relative to Viptela and software defined WAN. We have two offers, we have - we Meraki has an offer for those customers who have embraced the Meraki architecture, they have a very effective SD-WAN Solution that is actually being well received in their customer base and they are using it to extend their customer base. So that's being very successful. On the Viptela front, we have been working hard on the integration between the Viptela platform and Cisco's product.","And so we're going to have a variety of offerings for our customers, we\u2019ll have a version that will have software running on different types of hardware, a software-only solution will have our integrated ISR solution and so we're seeing a number of those. This was a quarter where I would say we really saw the engagement level increase significantly. We got the offers in the marketplace the first wave of those and I said on the Q3 call that our teams were signaling us that Q4 was where we're going to see some of this come to fruition and we, in fact, did. So we feel good about where we are right now, there's more work to go. We haven't gotten the SD-WAN integration into DNA center yet, so that will only be I think a positive boost when we get that done and teams are working on that, I think it's coming in one of the upcoming releases. ","So, in general, we're pleased with where we are at this moment in time with Viptela. Europe, our team is doing really well there, our teams are executing well, I think that they are competing very well because we have some very tough competition there. We have - the team in Europe is always one of the early teams leading with some of the new technology areas, so they've had a lot of success in this core enterprise networking space as we move to intent-based networking. So, we're pleased with what they're doing. We feel the entire global macroenvironment right now, there are so many dynamics that we're calling it like we see it based on what we know today.","And Kelly, you want to comment just on how we see the \u2013","Kelly Kramer","Yeah. I mean, I think just to add to your point, I think the environment is very strong in Europe despite the political things that are going on and just as a data point, the UK is up double digits for us on product orders this quarter. So again, it is, I think, like Chuck was saying, the overall environment is very favourable as of right now. So we\u2019re hoping we see this continued strength.","Chuck Robbins ","And a lot of the innovation that we\u2019re bringing right now is actually targeted at helping our customers lower the expenses of running this infrastructure. So, there is a significant play to be made, almost like as customers look at where they are economically, there is reduction of cost by going to this automation platform. There is reduction of cost by moving to SD-WANs. So, these are technologies that we are hopeful will continue to be important to our customers regardless.","Operator","Samik Chatterjee, you may go ahead, from JPMorgan.","Samik Chatterjee","I just had a question on the guide for the first quarter. You clearly have good momentum on the top line, although when I look at the operating margin guidance, it\u2019s kind of flat year-over-year. So I just wanted to check, is there something that\u2019s limiting kind of the flow through of the solid momentum on the top line to the operating margin. Is there something that\u2019s limiting the leverage of that to the bottom line? And is that something we should hope for in the future and provides kind of a second leg to the earnings growth?","Kelly Kramer","No. I don\u2019t think you need to read anything different of what\u2019s happening on the margin. I mean if I look at the puts and takes that we have to our margin, I spoke a little bit about, we can have \u2013 we have a little margin pressure this quarter and some specific deals in APJC, but otherwise, our margin is driven by the same things, right. Our pricing is very robust, we\u2019re being very disciplined. The price that you\u2019ve seen the last couple of quarters is in a range that\u2019s very, very strong. So that\u2019s good. We\u2019re still facing component headwinds and even though it\u2019s less of a headwind, it is still higher year over year. The prices are up, it\u2019s again, just as last, but that\u2019s part of what we see both in Q4 and the guide and then everything else, kind of balances out. So right now, this is kind of what we see. We obviously are going to be driving for it as much as we possibly can, but it\u2019s really the same dynamics.","Operator","Paul Silverstein from Cowen. You may go ahead.","Paul Silverstein","A clarification question. Kelly, just in response, your previous response, I trust you expect DRAM at a minimum to moderate come next year and I'm wondering what if you have any thoughts on the impact and the larger question, I've recognized this has been asked and answered in various forms, but Kelly, my takeaway from your comments is that there's an awful lot of things going right and my simple question is how much of this do you attribute to the macro and I recognize even in that portion, it\u2019s not simple in terms of different moving pieces globally, but how much of the strength is macro related, how much of it is better execution in various areas like campus switching et cetera?","Chuck Robbins","Do you want to take the first, clarification on?","Kelly Kramer","Yeah. Sure. So on the component stuff, yeah, DRAM is loosening though. Again, as I said, the prices still are up whether you look quarter-on-quarter or year-over-year, but we are optimistic that both on the demand side which is also driving some of that pricing mix, back that to get better through \u201919. And I don\u2019t know if you want to hit the other \u2013","Chuck Robbins","Paul, it's virtually impossible question to answer, although I\u2019m pragmatic enough to know that it's a combination of both. I will say that I think that, it's, clearly, the economy has been pretty consistent and the markets have been positive. So that has certainly helped and I think correspondingly, this new architecture and the new technology that we've brought out first, about four quarters back actually, right at the end of Q4 from a year earlier, has clearly been adopted at a record pace for us. So I could never possibly give you any sort of split on what that looks like. The best I can do is acknowledge that it's a bit of both and there are a lot of things going right, right now, but there's also, as we said earlier, Ittai asked the question, there's a lot of dynamics out there that we're watching very closely. So sorry I can't give you a better more specific answer, but I think that's as honest as I can be.","Operator","James Fish from Piper Jaffray. You may go ahead.","Jim Fish","It\u2019s been a while since we got a security metric update. Can you just kind of walk through some metrics you\u2019ve given or what you\u2019re willing to give today. I know in the past you\u2019ve given deferred revenue growth as well as penetration of certain parts like buyer ramp. And then secondly HyperFlex version 3.0 is released I believe recently. Can we get an update as to kind of how we should think about the sizing of that business or any metrics around it hyper converged infrastructure and how it\u2019s competing against the Nutanix?","Kelly Kramer","Sure. So, like I said in the prepared remarks, on the security side, they continue to have -- they're over -- 60% of their businesses is software and so obviously they have a lot of their business going through deferred revenue and it continues to grow in high double digits. So we feel good about that. They had a very strong Q4 and like I said, from a revenue perspective, it was broad based this quarter, driving that 12% up on revenue across all of their subsegments. So I'd say it's continuing to grow very quickly and with this addition of Duo, it really just round out the portfolio very well. ","In terms of HyperFlex, I mean that's growing very strongly for us. I think this new release has been well received and again we find ourselves in a lot of head-to-head deals and winning against Nutanix, which is obviously a really tough competitor out there, but we feel good about the offer we have. Now, it's really fairly small compared to the broader data center business that has all of our servers in there, but we're pleased with how it's ramping and how we're competing.","Operator","Simon Leopold of Raymond James.","Simon Leopold","I wanted to see if maybe we could talk a little bit longer term trending big picture around the concept of multi cloud, which you talked about at Cisco Live and on a number of other occasions. Within the answer, I think what I'm looking for is how does this help the evolution, transformation and importantly how does this help Cisco do more business with the Web scale customers?","Chuck Robbins","Simon, so it's a really good question and I think the key message for us that we're trying to get across is that this transition to this multi cloud world actually is changing the way our customers look at building their IT infrastructure and how they secure it. So if you just think very simply that, look back over the last five to seven to ten years, a great majority of the traffic in our enterprise customers\u2019 networks was terminating in their private data centers. So networks were architected and security architectures were built to deal with that reality.","Now, we're moving into a world where there is still some percentage depending on the customer of their traffic that is obviously terminating in the private data center. Then they have traffic terminating in SaaS applications in multiple public cloud providers. They have this whole IoT Edge data aggregation issue. So what's happened is the traffic flows in the way data is moving across their networks and across their infrastructure is much more complex than it was five to seven years ago where it was all very predictable, which leads us to when you think about ultimately our customers are going to just need to build a world where you look at the user, you look at the application, you look at their policy and you look at the destination and then you have technology in the network that actually provides policy routing quality, security in that world and that's the role that we're playing with our customers because they need to re-architect their networks to accommodate a massively diverse traffic flow scenario that they're going to deal with. ","So I'll stop with that right now, but that's why it's so important in US, what does that do to our partnerships with the Web scale providers. Well, they understand this dynamic that is going on and so many of the -- you're seeing some early -- some of the early work we're doing with some of the Web scale providers to ensure that we have integrated hybrid cloud solutions, so that we can provide security and policy, whether applications are in the private data center or in the public. They're interested in our ability to process data at the edge as customers are building out IoT applications, they're interested in us helping define security architectures that make it simple for our customers to take advantage of their services. So it's emerging as a really attractive partnership because of the reality that everybody sees in the marketplace today. ","And hopefully that was clear, if not we can have some folks talk to you afterwards.","Simon Leopold","Great. I appreciate it. Yeah. I understand it's obviously a complex topic, just trying to figure out how to bake it into a model.","Chuck Robbins","I\u2019ll let Kelly talk to you about that one.","Operator","James Suva from Citigroup Global Markets.","James Suva","A quick question, Chuck. Earlier in your remarks, you mentioned with service provider stream coming back that you don't believe it's 5G related. That\u2019s more of a 2020 phenomenon. Can you give us a little bit about a history lesson here of, back in 3G or 4G or 2G uptakes, was there a linear into the build that happened? Is there a pause before the positive happens or is it just more of a steady as she goes as we kind of look ahead more longer term strategically to 5G impact to Cisco?","Chuck Robbins","Jim, it's a good question. And I think if you go back and look at the earlier transitions in this space, they have largely been around delivering, I don't want to say incrementally better, but a better performance for mobile devices that are connected to the network already. So when you go from 3G to 4G, you get better data performance, you're happier with your apps on your phones, et cetera. This is a step level difference because we're talking about the latency dynamics of 5G and the belief that this will actually enable them to deliver real time business applications to small offices or remote branches over 5G networks, that's a completely different dynamic. ","And so I would tell you that we're, we don't know yet, but I think if you operate under the assumption that it lives up to its billing, then it is going to create a significant demand on the core networks of these service providers. And so I can't say that there's a huge historical example for us to learn from. But I think what you're going to see is just between now and when they start building these things out, they're going to be working on design and then we're just going to see them begin to gradually build out as they open up a certain market, they'll build out bandwidth and backbone capacity. And that's how we're -- that's how we're thinking about it and we'll be able to give you guys updates on upcoming quarters as to how we see this thing emerging. It's not going to happen overnight.","Operator","Tal Liani from Bank of America Securities Merrill Lynch.","Tal Liani","I wanted to ask about the routing, just again, it's repeatedly under pressure and you gave an answer before about, you were saying that it's going according to the plan. I'm wondering if there's a link between the two yet or that the pressure in routing has to do with other things and not to do with SD-WAN. That's the first question kind of to understand or maybe you can provide different explanation to understand the pressure on routing and what's the outlook for recovery or is it like Nokia and others are saying that maybe there is a long term pressure on this market?","The second question, just a follow-up on 606. What's the impact on operating margin, if you've provided this or you provide this information?","Chuck Robbins","Okay. Tal, let me make a comment on the first one and then Kelly can add to it and she can give the 606 answer as well. I think when you look at our routing business, first of all, Kelly, half of it is, 50%, 60% of it is SP, right. So it's significantly impacted by the SP. Some of the players you mentioned, they probably have a much higher percentage of their routing businesses coming from service providers would be my guess. So that's just sort of couched in the discussion on 5G and everything that we've said so far, but SP I would say is the answer on that piece of it.","From an enterprise perspective, Tal, I think over the last couple of years, we've just seen a classic architectural stall in the marketplace as we've talked about historically when there's a big architectural transition. And you said that was going according to plan. I think the way I would characterize it is, we've begun to see customers actually move forward with deployments, but it's early, but we like where we are and we like what we see. So I think that -- I think we'll see the Enterprise continue to improve relative to this architectural clarity and I\u2019ll let Kelly answer sort of how you think about the overall routing or the 606 question.","Kelly Kramer","Yeah. So on 606, Tal, so just to kind of again ground everybody on how we are impacted on 606. So one thing I will say is operationally nothing has changed. We've made no changes to our offers. We've made no changes to our contracts or any changes to our cash conversion cycle. So it is literally just an accounting change. Now, what the implications are to us is likely said it is going to accelerate some of our term base licenses. So we will have to write off some of our deferred revenue. We won't see that revenue, but we will offset that with acceleration of those offers when we book new orders and build new orders. ","Net-net, we think it will be a net positive for us of approximately 1%. And so that's the impact on the revenue, it will fall through down through margin. So it's on operating margin, half a point to 70 basis points roughly of goodness falling through there. And as we go into the new rev standard, as part of our disclosures, we will be laying out very clearly for everybody since we have a -- we're adopting the modified retrospective approach, we will lay out very clearly the implications of the new accounting versus what would have been under the old accounting.","So hopefully that answers your question.","Operator","George Notter, you may go ahead, from Jefferies LLC.","George Notter","I guess Kelly, I was curious about the revenue headwind that you're seeing from the subscription transition. You've talked about that in the past. I'm just curious about what that might have looked like in the July quarter and what do you think that would look like for the October quarter?","Kelly Kramer","Yeah. That's a great question, George. So, there's good news, there's good news there I would say. So like we anticipated, as we are so rapidly ramping the Cat9K, and as we're blowing out DNA across not only that, but also our tele offerings and across wireless, the revenue headwind was getting more closer to 2.5 to 3 points. Now, the good news on this is, with the new revenue standard going forward, because it's accelerating some of these offers that we did have previously deferred, that headwind will become less of a headwind. Okay. So as opposed to the 250 [ph] to 300 current accounting standards, that will be much less closer to like a point a half or so if I had to guess roughly. I mean, again, this will all flush out as we go through it, but it will become less of a headwind because we have such a big portion of things that we will now be recognizing upfront. ","George Notter","You said it was 1% increase on the other side.","Kelly Kramer","On the revenue. Exactly. I mean, the good thing about this accounting standard is it does normalize some of the natural headwinds that we\u2019ve had on revenue and margin because of it, it\u2019s not going to kind of come back and benefit us.","Chuck Robbins","All right. I want to \u2013 I think that was the last question, Marilyn. So if I could just thank everybody for spending time with us today. Thanks for the questions and the dialog and Marilyn, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks, Chuck and thanks everyone.

At the request of Cisco Systems, today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect.","Now, I would like to introduce Melissa Selcher, Vice President of Corporate Communication and Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Melissa Selcher","Thanks you. Good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to our 99th quarterly conference call. This is Melissa Selcher, and I\u2019m joined by John Chambers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Frank Calderoni, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Rob Lloyd, President of Development and Sales; Gary Moore, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Kelly Kramer, Senior Vice President of Finance.","I would like to remind you that we have a corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information that will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call.","Income statements full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the Investor Relations website.","As it\u2019s customary in Q1, we have made certain reclassification to prior period amounts to conform to the current periods presentation, the reclassified amount have been posted on our website. Click on the Financial Reporting section of the website to access these documents. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both non-GAAP and GAAP financial results.","The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements and as such are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on the Form 10-K and any applicable amendments which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted. All comparisons through this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless other -- stated otherwise. As we have in the past we will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer segment results in terms of product orders unless specifically stated otherwise.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to John for his commentary on the quarter.","John Chambers","Thank you very much, Mel. I\u2019m pleased to report another solid quarter, our strongest Q1 ever in terms of revenues, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP earnings per share. We grew revenues this quarter to $12.2 billion, up from $0.01 year-over-year, returning to growth as we said we would.","We generated $2.5 billion in operating cash flow and returned closed to $2 billion to our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. With strong total non-GAAP gross margins at 63.3% and non-GAAP operating margins of 29.2%, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.54.","When I think about the quarter, there are three key takeaways that you will see we will call out in our following discussion. First, I would say, we are managing the business very well in a very tough environment. Second, we are seeing the results of our three-year transformational work. In this work moving from selling boxes to selling solutions and leading with innovation, speed, efficiency, as we disrupt the market. Third, we are leading the technology and business transitions in the market.","Our strategy is playing out as we delivered innovative solution based on intelligent networks to enable the next-generation of IP and the Internet of Everything. We continue to focus on what made us successful many times in the past leading through market transitions.","I give us very high marks on our execution. For example, in the data center where we are winning the SDN battle with application centric infrastructure. This quarter, we now over -- have over 900 Nexus 9000 customers, up from 580 last quarter with strong continued momentum.","And it is first full quarter of shipments we more than double paying customer adoption of APIC and our ACI controller that enables automation and programmability of the network and the skill that\u2019s never been done before. The Nexus 9000 and ACI continue to see strong demand from customers, who are seeing the significant advantage of ACI in their application deployment and management.","As I said last quarter, we had two principal objectives, when we rolled out our transformational plan in 2011, Gary. So how are we doing against these objectives? The first one is about driving innovation, speed, agility and effectiveness in our business.","As you are all aware, we are navigating the same macro-environment as everyone else. At the same time, we are also executing on several transitions within our portfolio. Despite this, our results are at or near record levels and showing momentum on both top and bottomline. I'm optimistic as things play out this year and beyond, Cisco is very well-positioned.","The second objective, move our business from model that selling boxes and standalone services to selling architectures and solutions that drive business outcomes. As every company, every city, every country is becoming digitized and we are seeing this on the results of our customer visits around the world. We are engaging with entirely new business models, leading with software and services, and delivering integrated solution.","Recently we described an enterprise license agreement for our software portfolio we had signed with General Motors, a model we are replicating across our enterprise account at this time. In last month we discussed what success we've had together in Barcelona in Chicago as they digitized their city and evolved in the smart cities.","We are tying together the breadth of our product portfolio to deliver solutions that drive growth and economic opportunity, with security and scale. These large strategic deals are becoming a blueprint for how we will move forward.","In the last few quarters, we have talked about three headwinds, emerging markets, SP and product transitions at the hand of our switching and routing. The good news is that in the third quarter, the third area, high-end switching and routing has turn to a tailwind based on momentum in our new product introductions and we will share that with you shortly.","As we said last quarter, we are executing and progressing as expected, and I\u2019m very comfortable with our growth trajectory. We are pleased that in spite of the headwinds, we are growing again and are very nicely positioned once we get a positive turn in service provider or emerging markets, ideally in both.","For Q2, we expect to see mid single-digit revenue growth in the range of 4% to 7% and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.50 to $0.52 which would be an increase of 6% to 11% in terms of the earnings per share given the range that we covered. Our Q2 guidance reflects an added nature of conservativism primarily related to reduce spend at several large U.S. service providers.","I will now provide more detail on the business momentum in our geographies and customer segments within our portfolio. As a reminder, geographies are the primary way we run the business. In these areas, I will speak in terms of product orders year-over-year unless otherwise noted.","We finished the quarter with product orders up 1% and product book-to-bill below one in line with usual Q1s. EMEA was a highlight with growth of 6%. We saw very strong performance in the U.K., up 20% and strength in Germany, up 6%. Southern Europe grew approximately 20%.","We saw some stabilization in the emerging countries within an EMEA with growth of 2% in the emerging segment of Chris Dedicoat\u2019s business. Based on the role we play in the digitization of countries and companies including our ability to bring innovation in job creation, we\u2019re more positive on the future business in Europe than perhaps some of our peers are.","Our Americas business grew 2%. We saw growth in the U.S. of 3% and when you exclude U.S. service provider, growth in the U.S. was 12%. U.S. public sector had a very strong quarter with growth of 22%, U.S. federal grew an amazing 34% while state and local declined by 2%. U.S. commercial grew 7%. U.S. enterprise declined 1%.","Last quarter we shared the U.S. enterprise grew at a very strong 16% growth year-over-year. As I mentioned at the time that performance was higher than normal and expected it to balance out this quarter. Looking at the pipeline next quarter, we feel good that this business will again deliver double-digit growth. U.S. service provider however declined at 18%.","Within the Americas, Latin America grew 5%. Asia-Pacific, Japan and China declined 12% led by China down to 33% while India grew 6%. The remaining emerging countries in Asia declined 15%. Overall, emerging countries within the three geographies declined this quarter by 6%.","The BRICS plus Mexico were down 12% while the other emerging countries actually grew 1%. Our position in the emerging markets remain strong and we believe we are positioned well for the inevitable upturn. However, as we told you last quarter that is not factored into our plans.","Moving onto the view from a customer segments. In this quarter, global public sector grew 13%, global commercial grew 5%, global enterprise grew 2% and service provider declined on a global basis by 10%. Emerging markets remain challenged and we saw dramatically reduced spend at several large U.S. service providers. As you think about our service provider position, I would think about the following, all of which are in our control.","We recently reorganized the best-in-line with what our service providers customer would want from Cisco. That was true of engineering, sales, services and how we go to market. Second, we had the same power to part with customers as they transform during their own challenging time period in terms of their growth and their profitability. Third, our market share and share spend is strong. And fourth, our traditional box competitors have never been weaker.","At this point, I don't think many of them have the flexibility to reposition in a way to remain relevant to these service providers. So we are nicely positioned for rebound in NSP when it happens. I now will move on to the discussion of our momentum in terms of products and services.","I will discuss our momentum in terms of year-over-year product and services in terms of revenue but where appropriate we\u2019ll share order information where it adds important color. As we move on, I want to draw out the convergence that we are driving across almost all of our portfolios.","As a first example, one that you are very familiar with in the data center, we simply converged networking with compute and storage and moved into what I believe is the number 1 data center position. Now we're converting networking with applications, security and scale and that's our ACI implementation.","In routing, our NCS platform converges IP and optical networking with virtualization. We successfully converged where in wireless into most all our products and convergence will also be very key for us for us in collaboration work, which we\u2019ll talk about later. In the industry, we are the only player with the assets to drive to convergence for our customers. And this is a driver of both revenue and margins across our portfolio.","Now let me move onto routing. Routing declined 4%, reflecting both the lower CapEx spend by major service providers and challenges in the emerging markets. We did see growth in several of our high-end routing platforms this quarter. For example, the ASR 9K saw solid double-digit order growth and our new products the NCS 6000 and CRS-X continue to ramp well with new customer wins. Given the tough environment, we believe we are gaining market share in these routing areas.","Moving to switching. It was nice to see overall switching move back into positive territory, growing 3%. We returned to growth after three quarters of decline, driven by our strength in data center switching portfolio.","In addition to the 60% increase in the Nexus 9000 and ACI customers, we sold double-digit order growth from the Nexus 3K, 7K, 9K and ACI combined. We signed a record 600 new customers for the Nexus 3000 this quarter including several major Web 2.0 providers.","Looking at our performance relative to one of our merchant base competitors making a lot of noise in this market. In Q3 FY \u201814, from a comparison perspective, we saw orders of the Nexus 3K and 9K, our comparable portfolio to pass their total revenue for the first time.","In Q1, orders for the Nexus 3K and 9K were approximately 50% larger than their reported total revenues, growing in excess of four times faster than the reported growth rates. Yet again in just one year, we have grown back where they had gotten to in the whole history of their company.","A year ago we were fighting an SDN perception battle, with competitors using PowerPoint instead of products. Today with ACI, we are bringing programmability and automation to networking on a scale well beyond what competitors define as SDN.","Now we are in the market with products and solutions and don't see, either traditional box competitors or the PowerPoint newcomers able to keep up. And for those of you who were concerned about SDN\u2019s effect on our switching margins, our switching gross margins have been incredibly consistent over the last five to six quarters and as far forward, as were modeling we see no change. In this quarter's example, our switching gross margins were above the mean level of this consistency.","Data center and cloud where we first converge networking compute and storage and today it has continued to hold the number one position in revenue share for x86 blade in the U.S. according to IDC. Data center grew 15% year-over-year. Five years ago, we invested in the market for converged infrastructures and brought it to life with our ecosystem partners.","Today FlexPod, with NetApp and Vblock with EMC, are the leading converged infrastructure architectures and there's two common tale elements. Cisco\u2019s UCS and Cisco\u2019s networking.","Also in the quarter, we announced innovation across our UCS portfolio, broadening the product line to meet demands of large cloud environments and also scaled down to environments with just a handful of servers. We continue to demonstrate that innovation is very much alive in markets, with standalone products considered largely commoditized.","I will also touch on InterCloud, where we announced this quarter a 30 new InterCloud partners, really nice job, Rob, including Deutsche Telekom, British Telecom, NTT DATA and Equinix. This brings our world's largest interoperable network of clouds to 250 data centers worldwide across 50 countries. All of which are working with us to ACI plus InterCloud fabric, plus OpenStack roadmap. This is truly unique to Cisco and being able to pull this all together.","We are frequently asked what Cisco is doing differently in the crowded cloud markets. Simply put, we see the same problem in cloud that we saw 20 years ago in networking, where numerous networks operated on different technologies that didn't talk to one another. As we blow down the silos with Ethernet, we made the Internet pervasive. We are running the same play in cloud as only we can, unifying private, public and hybrid clouds.","Customers want to seamlessly move their workloads between cloud with a common goal of policy and security. They need scale, feed and reliability and they care about data sovereignty and openness. We will place this market as a solutions play, meeting the network requirements of enterprise class applications and providing the platform to deliver Cisco's growing portfolio of software-as-a-service offers. This would drive our strategic role with customers and over time our recurring revenue.","I said earlier, the security was the number one issue facing many of our customers. Security revenues grew this quarter 25%. In this quarter, we combined our security products even more closely with the Sourcefire products and delivered a highly anticipated Cisco ASA with firepower services, which combined Cisco\u2019s ASA firewall with Sourcefire into one platform.","Customer receptivity has been very positive. Our innovation and security is very strong. Security continues to be our customers\u2019 number one business priority at the CIO level, but perhaps even more important at the CEO level. And we are doing very well in this market. Nearly every initiative we have at Cisco has security as a key component and we are committed to becoming the number one security company.","Compared with even a year ago, we are getting good marks from our customers as now more than ever. Customers need strong and trusted company like Cisco to lead. They see Cisco alone in the ability to deliver an integrated security architecture and security services and solutions across their business. I am very pleased that our leadership transition is going very smoothly in this area, and we are moving aggressively to capture the opportunity ahead of us.","Last quarter, wireless grew only 1%. This quarter, wireless grew 11%, with strong momentum in our 802.11ac portfolio, which now represents over 50% of our access point revenue. Cisco Meraki [continued out there] [ph] with another outstanding quarter growing at 86%.","In the area of collaboration, we are going to continue to transform a collaboration portfolio and move to more enterprise license agreements in subscription. In Q1, our collaboration business was down 10% in the quarter. As our new video products ramp well but at a dramatically lower price points, we saw declines in telepresence and unified communications.","WebEx continued to grow well and remains one of our largest -- remains one of the largest FAS businesses in the industry. As I mentioned before, collaboration should be the greatest productivity driver for our organizations. In the next week, you will see some bold moves that will secure our leadership position in cloud-based, simple, secure and converged collaboration.","I think we have great potential to grow this business over time. I really like our position and our pipeline and I\u2019m very optimistic about returning back to positive growth levels relatively quickly in the collaboration arena. Service provider video declined 12%, with set-top box business down approximately 20%.","Revenue for service provider video software and solutions grew by 13%. The bet we are making is on the video transition to the cloud. And we are seeing our video software business continue to grow, as we help our customers\u2019 transition to cloud-based video solutions.","Now moving onto services, pulling everything together is our services strategy and our services in this quarter grew 5%. Services now represent over 23% of Cisco\u2019s revenue on a 12-month trailing basis. We\u2019ve added around $2.3 billion in revenue over the last three years with strong margins. Today, at a $11.1 billion in trailing 12-month revenue, it is our second largest business after switching and that doesn't count the literally billions of dollars being delivered by approximately 70,000 strong partner channels around the world, where partners deliver solutions on behalf of Cisco, not just boxes.","In many ways, it's a bit unfair to refer to our services business by that name. Since it draws the comparison to what investors typically see at other companies, while our large component is driven by maintenance and support. Unlike our peers at Cisco, nearly 90% of our issues we handle for our clients are solved with automation. We have many large customers around the world to depend on us and depend on Cisco to run their networks.","We have also readout a unique set of consulting, cloud analytics and security services. As the network continues to increase in importance, our services become increasingly more important to our customers. To summarize my commentary, we have undergone a successful reorganization across the company and are seeing the results. Our employee sentiment data shows that employees both understand the challenges we have made and also are optimistic about our future and the changes we've made to deal with these challenges.","Thanks to a lot of hard work which will continue. I believe that we have positioned Cisco to lead the market transitions in front of us, to the benefit of our shareholders, our customers, our partners and our employees.","Frank, let me now turn it over to you.","Frank Calderoni","Thank you, John. We executed Q1 with financial performance slightly above our guidance. From a top and bottom line perspective, total revenue was $12.2 billion, growing 1% on a year-on-year basis.","The non-GAAP net income was $2.8 billion and non-GAAP EPS was $0.54. Our GAAP net income was $1.8 billion and GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis was $0.35. Product revenue was flat and service revenue increased 5% on year-on-year basis, with product book-to-bill less than one. Overall, non-GAAP operating margin was 29.2%.","In Q1, our total non-GAAP gross margin was 63.3%, above our guidance of 61% to 62%. As we have said in the past, non-GAAP gross margin may vary quarter-to-quarter by a point in either direction of our guidance range. This quarter, we were above the range.","Non-GAAP product gross margin was 62.5%. As compared to Q4, product gross margin was positively impacted by productivity improvements and by product mix, partially offset by pricing. Non-GAAP service gross margin was 66%, consistent with historical levels.","Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.2 billion or 34.1% as a percentage of revenue, compared to 33.8% in Q4 of FY14. Non-GAAP operating expenses were flat quarter-over-quarter and up 3% year-over-year, reflecting investments in key growth areas.","Our GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 included a pre-tax charge of $188 million or $0.03 per share related to a patent litigation matter described in our most recently filed 10-K involving the Rockstar consortium.","A term sheet has been signed and we are hopeful to achieve a resolution of the associated litigation in a manner that is constructive for the whole industry.","Now moving on to the non-GAAP tax provision rate, it was 22% consistent with our expectations. We ended the quarter with our headcount at 72,247, a decrease of approximately 1,800 from Q4 of FY14. This reflects reductions from our restructuring activity, partially offset by key sales, service and engineering investments, as well as acquisitions.","As a reminder, as we outlined in our Q4 call, in Q1 we began taking restructuring actions focused on continuing to invest in growth, innovation, and talent, while managing costs and driving efficiencies, which would impact our global workforce during fiscal 2015.","We announced and completed two acquisitions during the quarter, Metacloud and Memoir Systems to enhance our innovation and long-term growth opportunities in key growth areas, such as the cloud and software-defined networking. Both were executed consistent with our portfolio approach to acquisitions to drive long-term returns.","Also we along with EMC and VCE announced during Q1 the next phase of VCE. Cisco will continue as a strategic partner and will have an approximately 10% equity interest in VCE. We expect the transition to close in Q2 of FY15.","Looking at our geographic segment results, in terms of total revenue on a year-over-year basis our Americas segment was up 3%, EMEA was up 2% and APJC was down 5%. Total gross margin for the Americas was 64.1%, EMEA was 63.8% while Asia Pacific, Japan and China was 58.8%.","From a balance sheet and cash flow perspective, total cash, cash equivalents and investments were $52.1 billion, including $3.8 billion, which is available in the U.S. at the end of the quarter. We generated operating cash flow of $2.5 billion during the quarter. And in Q1, we returned $2 billion to shareholders that included $1 billion to our share repurchases and approximately $973 million through our quarterly dividend.","Our balance sheet at the end of Q1 was strong with the DSO at 33 days and non-GAAP inventory turns at 11. Deferred revenue was $13.7 billion, up 4% year-over-year. Product deferred revenue grew 9%, driven largely by subscription-based offering while services deferred revenue grew 1%. Each quarter we are consistently driving a greater software mix and higher recurring revenue.","Let me now provide a few comments on our outlook or guidance for the second quarter. Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filing that identify important risk factors and understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements and actual results could also be above or below this guidance.","The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with a reconciliation to get. As John mentioned, we expect total revenue to be in the range of 4% to 7% growth on a year-over-year basis. For the second quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 62%. As we have said in the past, forecasting non-GAAP gross margin has always been very challenging due to various factors such as the volume, the product mix, cost savings as well as pricing.","And I said earlier, non-GAAP gross margins may vary quarter-to-quarter by a point in the direction of our guidance range. Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q2 is expected to be in the range of 27.5% to 28.5%. Our non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be approximately 22% in the second quarter. Our Q2 FY15 non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.50 to $0.52 per share.","We anticipate our GAAP earnings to be lower than our non-GAAP EPS by $0.10 to $0.13 per share in Q2 FY15. The range includes a pre-tax benefit of approximately $125 million from the reduced VCE equity investment to 10% and also is offset by a pre-tax charge of approximately $100 million in Q2 FY15 as a result of the restructuring actions that we announced in the first quarter.","During Q1, we recognized pre-tax charges to our GAAP financial statements of $318 million related to that announcement and we are now expected total charge to not exceed $600 million during the fiscal year of 2015. Please see the slides that accompany this webcast for more detail.","Other than those identified and quantified items noted previously, there were no other significant differences between GAAP and non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructuring and tax or other events which may or may not be significant.","Our guidance does not assume a significant improvement in the emerging markets was a service provider segment in the near future. And although we believe we are executing well in a rapidly transforming market with these types of uncertainties in mind, we will continue to provide our guidance with all the appropriate caveats one quarter at a time. We encourage our shareholders to have similar considerations.","As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done to an explicit public disclosure. John, I'll now turn it back to you for some summary comments.","John Chambers","Thank you, Frank. And well done. I'd like to talk now about the leadership transition at the CFO level and I would then summarize the call. When you look at the quality of the financial leadership team, it is something that all of us take a deal of pride in. As you know, Cisco has successfully transitions through multiple leaders often five to eight of them in every major functional group in the company over the years. And recently, Frank has been exploring the right time to step down as Cisco CFO. Frank joined Cisco over 10 years ago and has served as CFO for the last seven years.","Among his many accomplishments, frankly at our very successful capital allocation strategy, including implementing Cisco\u2019s first dividend, managed effectively some of our almost challenging macro and industry environments, and he has been recognized time and time again for his strong leadership. While I know that Frank has other ambitions, I'm also very glad that Frank has agreed to stay on as an advisor to the financial leadership team and for me over not just hopefully next several months but over longer than that Frank if you'll have us.","Effective January 1st, Frank will be stepping down as CFO. At which time, Kelly Kramer will assume the role as Cisco\u2019s CFO. One of Frank\u2019s best and most defining leadership characteristics is his focus on building incredible leadership teams. Almost three years ago, Frank hired Kelly. It is a credit to the work of Frank that the leadership team and the board have concurred in appointing Kelly to assume the role of CFO. Kelly brings a wealth of experience to this role, both from her three years at Cisco and 20 years at GE.","Frank Calderoni","Kelly, you look too young to have that many years.","Kelly Kramer","Thanks.","John Chambers","Unlike Frank, you haven\u2019t got any grey hair and like me, you\u2019re not losing hair but that\u2019s a separate topic. In your last role at GE, you were GE\u2019s healthcare systems business group and CFO of that group. She is known for a business judgment, no-nonsense approach and strong strategic leadership style. At Cisco, Kelly has led both Cisco's corporate finance and business finance groups, managing among other things, all the controllers of Cisco's business units, with a particular focus around pricing and margins.","She has learned Cisco's business inside and out and has proven herself to be a highly strategic, thoughtful and influential leader. Kelly is not afraid to challenge all of us to think differently. And it has been impressive to see her do this, while becoming a trusted partner to our entire leadership team. Kelly, I\u2019m going to give you the same advice that I once got when I became CEO and then I gave Frank seven years ago.","Do a great job, have fun and don\u2019t mess it up. We know you won\u2019t and I look forward to working with you even more closely. Frank, I mean this is really something I'm very proud of in your many accomplishments. Your integrity and ethics define you. And you have always kept our employees, customers, shareholders at the forefront of our long-term strategic business planning.","You have been a great finance leader but more importantly, you have been a great business leader. You have built a world-class financial organization that is driving Cisco\u2019s transformation and ensuring we are positioned to execute on the opportunities ahead. I know the future will hold very exciting opportunities for you. And I look forward to our continued relationship. Thank you once again, Frank.","Frank Calderoni","Thank you, John.","John Chambers","And Kelly, congratulation.","Kelly Kramer","Thank you.","John Chambers","Frank, I\u2019m just looking at you. You\u2019ve weather this last seven years better than I have. I\u2019ve lost lot of hair, you\u2019ve got little bit of grey into it.","Frank Calderoni","We have to see how it continues, right?","John Chambers","Yes. All right. Now to summarize our call today. I've talked a lot about accelerating pace of change in the industry. Recognizing that in many cases, Cisco and our technology are driving that change. I am now more convinced than ever that the pace of change is providing an advantage for Cisco for number of reasons.","First, the role of the network is at the center of every major technology and business transition and that is becoming very clear to our customers and to the industry as a whole. Most customers are no longer interested in piecing together disparate infrastructure from different vendors or buying standalone technology. They are digitizing their businesses, their cities and countries and want Cisco to be a strategic partner delivering solutions and business outcomes.","They recognize that to move with agility and security they need, their solutions have to be based on an integrated architectures, combined with intelligent network. You are seeing this showing up in increased enterprise license agreements, enterprise services agreements, subscriptions, consulting contracts and other advanced services including cloud analytics and security.","Second, we have proven our ability to move quickly and aggressively to transform Cisco into a leaner and more effective company. Remarkably since FY \u201811, we have added around $4.1 billion in revenue, with about $61 million in incremental non-GAAP OpEx. Said another way, for every dollar of revenue we\u2019ve added over this transitional period, we've only added about $0.01 of non-GAAP OpEx.","There is not a peer who can come anywhere near close to this by a factor of 10 to what that performance has represented for Cisco and for our shareholders. And what\u2019s exciting is we're just getting started and our transformational evolution at a time that our peers are just starting their transformational work that we started 3.5 years ago.","We have also successfully redeployed this operating leverage in many ways. We\u2019ve invested in innovation. We built entirely new skill sets within Cisco. We disrupted our largest businesses in order to move at the fast pace this market requires. And we built flexibility into our operating model, as we managed through these transitions. Throughout, we\u2019ve driven record annual non-GAAP earnings per share for our shareholders.","Third, we have and we\u2019ll continue to evolve the leadership team and the talent to drive us forward. As we focus on what our people can do with the support of Cisco, we are unleashing incredible innovation and energy.","And fourth, the power of our brand. Our global channels and our strategic relationships with our customers is only strengthening. We continue to earn the trust of our customers and that is translating into greater opportunity for Cisco. The day feels a lot like the mid-90s, when companies were coming to Cisco to learn about the Internet.","Today, they\u2019re asking Cisco to help make the transition and transition them to digitize their companies, their cities and even their countries, as they prepare to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the Internet of Everything. To repeat where we started, we believe, we are managing very well in a very tough environment.","We are seeing the results of a three-year plus transformational program and work, moving from selling boxes to selling solutions and leading with innovation, speed efficiency as we disrupt the market. And we are leading the technology and business transitions in the market. We have been very clear with you, when we have seen challenges in our business. We are in the environment and we will continue to do so.","We have also managed the business very well in light of those challenges. We have made hard decisions, where we have needed to and are seeing the resulting benefits. To sum it all up, I'm very optimistic about Cisco's future and excited about the fact that we are on.","Mel, let\u2019s move to my favorite part of the session, which is the Q&A and turn it over to you.","Melissa Selcher","Great. Thanks. Operator, let\u2019s move to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs","Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to ask you first about your product order growth. I think you said, up 1% year-over-year. That comes on the back of relatively easy comps relative to the year ago number. And our method implies that sequentially, bookings declined something like the mid-teens, which I think would be well below normal seasonality for this quarter.","So just curious, if you can give us a little more color on the puts and takes in there, if you can touch on FX, China seemed to decline at a little faster rate and how much of that with some of the weakness in the U.S. carrier space that you referenced?","John Chambers","Okay. So, Simona, I\u2019m going to go, as you would expect to the most positive and unlike last quarter where we had about fives up and fives down, this time most all the positives were in the right direction with the exception of service provider in emerging markets. So start with our high-end switching and high-end routing puts and takes. The high-end switching grew at 10%, as I alluded to earlier and that shows how good of a job we\u2019ve done on the transition and taking not just market share but I think, moving very rapidly to pull away from some of our key smaller competitors.","Routing is probably gaining share. We have our best routing portfolio. We have at the high-end and both, Nick Adamo and Kelly Ahuja will head that up. [Like we say with Cedrik] [ph], we\u2019d say we're very well positioned in routing as well. Securities saw 25% growth. Data center was at 15% growth, Simona. And that was probably a little bit lower than you might have expected. Q1 as Kelly, I think we were talking about it.","You see a slower quarter for us in terms of our server technologies and spins. I would expect that to come back up in Q2, more into the 20s. UCS at 16 % and I am saying the same type of number for that in terms of, and these again orders that I am referring to. I\u2019ve got revenue on the left and bookings on the right, okay. I am sorry.","So using UCS as an example, revenues are 16% and bookings are 18% in the quarter. And I\u2019d expect them to come back up in to comfortable growth well into the 20s as well. Services, Gary, it\u2019s been very nice return to mid-single digits. We had hopefully what will be a bottom at 3% and not feel pretty comfortable about our services revenues more in the mid-single digits.","Wireless, which is one of the things you all rightly pointed out last quarter said was a little bit challenging for us, which was fair, retuned back to double-digit growth to 11% on revenues and mid-teens on bookings. I expect a solid quarter next quarter out of it as well.","Collaboration was the one area that I talked about that we didn't go into as deeply. I like, where we wore on bookings. Bookings were down just about 2% negative. The collaboration portfolio was 10% on revenues. And so that's the solid part, better growth in Europe that people anticipated, better growth in southern Europe, better solid area in the U.S. managed service providers.","The two big issues Simona are around service provider and emerging markets. Emerging markets went down as much as they were last quarter, minus 9%, but they were down 6% and the BRICS were down 12%, with China being the heaviest in terms of the approach. The rest of the emerging markets were actually slightly positive I think averaging out to be 6% odd number.","Service provider is the big challenge, let me be very explicit, that\u2019s due to two to three U.S. service providers, who have dramatically slowed the order rates and I mean dramatically slowed the order rates with us. And that's an implication also I think of some of the -- what you're seeing in terms of net neutrality, Titled II discussions going on, where in my opinion it would be a very disappointing in result if we moved back to regulation, the Internet like we did voice many decades ago. It would dramatically slow the ability of service providers to be on our broadband and at time that our country is finally cut backup.","So my key takeaways, Simona, are the service provider business driven by primarily two or three large U.S. players. It\u2019s the one area that has its most focused. And we saw that in order rate in this last quarter to the tune of a pretty substantial amount. In fact, if you take out those three service providers, you would have probably seen positive growth in our service provider business in total, which you are beginning to see now.","So our strategy in business is taking hold. And emerging markets are still a little bit, if you will, balancing with some very good ones and some challenging ones. That's how I would answer your question on puts and takes.","Melissa Selcher","Great. Thanks, Simona.","John Chambers","And I know you are going to say keep my answers [tight] [ph]. I don\u2019t know how I will.","Melissa Selcher","Next question operator.","Operator","And your next question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS.","Amitabh Passi - UBS","Hey, Frank, first sorry to see you though, but wishing all the best. And John, I just wanted to clarify on the guidance, maybe just picking off from the previous question. Your guidance implies about a 4% decline in revenues. Again, should we assume that most of that, in fact all of that pressure is from service provider and emerging markets? Are you seeing maybe potential some slowing momentum in your switching side as well? Or should we expect that to continue to remain robust? I just want to clarify what's embedded in the guidance?","John Chambers","Yeah. My three years of law school if I say it was entirely to do with something my team would spare me on, but it is almost primarily due to those major factors on. If you look at just repeating the U.S. number without service provider, it was 12% growth, major strength. And that was in spite of our enterprise business having a slow Q1 in terms of Brian Marlier\u2019s team, got a lot of confidence in Brian. We went to the forecast pretty carefully with them, Rob. I think they are going to be back in double-digit growth this quarter and feel real good. The pipeline feels very, very solid on that.","Even within our service provider business, if you look out several quarters, our pipeline is increasing rapidly. And I think you are going to see us increase our share of wallet as well as our market share in many of our areas. The transformation that we've gone through over this last year with Nick Adamo, Cedrik and Kelly leading the group, you\u2019re beginning to see our relationship with these service providers even when their challenge change a fair amount.","So I would say it is emerging markets, and again it's not all of them anymore, it\u2019s a better standard deviation, but still we are not going to turn on that. And it\u2019s service providers, but it's a lot of just a couple service providers here in the U.S. So I like our pipeline. I think we're going to be challenged here for a couple quarters. I think we will power through it and I feel very good about the end result.","Melissa Selcher","Hey, thanks, Amitabh. Next question operator.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank.","John Chambers","Hey, Brian.","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank","Yeah, John. How are you doing? And Frank yes congratulations on your retirement and good luck dealing with us Kelly. So a question on the gross margin reached 63%. Your guidance is decent as well. How do you see your gross margin? Some of they call it with the net -- you would see pressure there. It doesn\u2019t look like you have. How do you -- and looking at your mix in your forecast, how do you see your gross margins panning out over the next quarter?","And then real quick if I could slip in, you mentioned General Motors again, can you talk about what that means in terms of your ability to sell into big U.S. and European telcos and software opportunities in terms of offering that type of product pipeline to them to sell to their customers? And how it might be as a recurring revenue stream over time? Thanks.","John Chambers","Got you. Frank, why don\u2019t you take first the one?","Frank Calderoni","So Brian, I am going to be a broken record at least one more time on this one. But from the gross margin standpoint, as we look at the gross margin, it\u2019s 61% to 62% give or take 1%. Going back on the first quarter, yes they were higher over 62%. We tend to see high gross margin in the first quarter. We did see a benefit from a mix perspective. I think the stronger switching helped. As well as if you look at the mix from a UCS perspective, it tends to be lower. Where I think Q2, A2 especially after the end of the calendar year, it tends to be a stronger UCS quarter. So we\u2019ll see a bit more of an impact from a negative mix standpoint in that quarter.","So when you take all those gives and takes, that\u2019s where we get to that 61 to 62, give or take. And we\u2019ll continue to keep managing that balance as we look out over several quarters.","John Chambers","Gary?","Gary Moore","Yeah. On the ELA that we did with General Motors that John did mention again this quarter, that\u2019s a solid deal for them and for us. It has a lot of interest from other companies. And we are actually working a number them. And I think there's a lot of positive things about the structure of that deal certainly for the customer, but certainly for Cisco. And with the customer like GM, where they\u2019ve gone all in on us, on our strategy, it\u2019s very easy for them now to continue to grow and do innovative things that give them business outcomes that they weren't able to justify to the business before.","And I think that\u2019s something that a visionary CIO will do with the company and the CEO and the CFO that really look for IT to be a competitive advantage and not an expense. And I think the team at GM has done that. And we have a number of other customers that we\u2019re working with along those same lines.","John Chambers","What\u2019s exciting is these enterprise licenses, think of it in enterprise software license where literally you can fill in the hardware and then meet that within integration. As you can move from security to collaboration, you can feed against white label, you can bring in your consultancy services, you knowledge of a network and ways that no one else can do.","You\u2019ve seen us doing the same thing with services, enterprise services agreement. And that has even more impact, where you go across the whole large enterprise and you do services tying all together their networks, their directions, get efficiencies from it, but then it really opens up your consultancy, your security, your collaboration offers, then you combine that with our architecture plays and you take it from cloud all the way through mobility, take it all the way down to the edge. That's why we win.","One thing Kelly you pointed out to me the other night, you are educating Frank and I as well good potential detail. When you look Brian at the numbers, Q2 is usually a quarter. If you watch historically that has had lower gross margins than Q1, because we do a bigger mix of our products on service during Q2 because of the year end. So that\u2019s been fairly typical in terms of our pattern. Did I learn that right?","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank","That\u2019s right.","John Chambers","Yeah. Okay.","Melissa Selcher","All right. Thanks, Brian. Operator, next question?","Operator","I think our next question comes from Ehud Gelblum with Citigroup.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup","","Hey guys. Appreciate. Thank you. Frank, likewise, great working with you and lots of luck. Just aside on that, if you can just give us some sense of your thought process as to -- a, what you plan on doing next and kind of, what you are thinking as you went through the situation to retire that would be awesome to have some rationale? But I was looking more for some a little bit more, good guide into the enterprise business, where enterprise orders were down from being up last quarter. And putting that together what\u2019s happening were VCE and with the data center number of 15% that John said, you thought was little disappointing and I think it was about 30% last quarter.","So putting it all together in one piece, can you give us a sense as to, a, is the question to a, how much UCS went through VCE and how much will that impact you as your piece of VCE goes to 10% from 35%. B, were all the issues related to low enterprise growth, the low UCS and data center growth? And you\u2019ve done your equity stake in VCE, was that all the same issue and what gives you confidence that all these issues, enterprise, UCS, data centers, et cetera, rebound next quarter and going forward? Thanks.","John Chambers","Got it. So let me take it. Frank, maybe you could handle that one question with him one-on-one. In terms of matter and now, I\u2019d like to sit on that discussion. So let me address the enterprise question very directly. First, let use our Global Enterprise Theater run by Woody Sessoms. We didn\u2019t talk about in the call. It\u2019s our top-29 global enterprise accounts. It grew 15% this last quarter. And it grew across all those architectures and it is one of the very best with VCE, with FlexPod and total architectures. And so if you watch and we\u2019re progressing and predicting they\u2019re going to grow very well again this quarter, their pipeline looks really good.","So, as you what you expect, testing to make sure the pipelines good where we\u2019re going, that would be an example and those are our global enterprise. In the U.S. enterprise, it was very simple. We finished up the quarter, they were in the running to become the top theater in the world and they won it. They pushed hard in the quarter and pushed financially to advantage and drive little bit out of the pipeline on that. They made organization changes to set up for this next year, got going on, even pushing harder on solutions, even harder on architectures and your CM.","You\u2019ll not give it, extremely at 90% plus, you are going to probable see it. You will seem then returning to double digits and we\u2019ve been through Brian\u2019s pipeline. He is world-class, knows how to do it. There is no effect of our agreement with what we do with VCE that slowed at all. In fact, I think the VCE numbers, Gary felt very good. And I think both VCE and FlexPod are growing and also the billion dollar plus space is over 50% a year.","Frank Calderoni","I mean, VCE surpassed the billion annualized in the run rate. We\u2019ve more than 2,000 people with thousands customers, 2,000 Vblocks up there and this did not slow them down at all.","John Chambers","And I guess, I will draw the parallel, government is nothing more than a public sector of enterprise and you saw 13% growth in government around the world. Digitization of countries has taken off and I cannot tell you what it means, when A. Merkel, the leader in Germany says about in Industry 4.0, she is going to digitize her country. And what we could do together with government and with Deutsche Telekom in her cities and rebuild all kinds of it high, in terms of direction. Same thing with commercial. Commercial was solid at seven. It doesn't quite go up and down as much. I\u2019m sorry, I missed some? I will come a little bit closer.","I\u2019m sorry. Frank was waving at me in a unique way and I wasn\u2019t sure in terms of the direction. So that\u2019s an answer that I feel really going on in enterprise. We are going to lead and breakaway from most every player in the enterprise and that applies across all products, including with our Applications Centric Infrastructure enterprise, which is going great guns. Nice way, I don\u2019t miss transitions like this. If I were concerned, I would tell you, we always want to watch the numbers stuff.","Melissa Selcher","Thanks Ehud. Operator, next question?","Operator","And your next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital.","Ben Reitzes - Barclays Capital","Yeah. Thanks a lot. John, could you talk a little bit more there about service provider? When do you -- what you need to see to have it turn? I thought that was interesting that you talked about neutrality, which is obviously a hot button issue right now and obviously the spending. But I think we\u2019re all trying to figure out, when it could possibly turn. It sounds like, there are several factors and your leadership on this issue, I think would be very helpful to us. Thanks.","John Chambers","Several questions and thank you for the nice comment. On our service provider business, first let's assume for now that it won't change in the couple quarters. We, however, with our new structure begin to build different relationships at every single major service provider. Rob, you\u2019ve probably been the 30 of them in the last two months, at the CEO level, the CTO level, CMO level operations et cetera. And our relationship is changing with them and our ability to really bring a portfolio that addresses their top priorities in terms of what they are doing to mobility, what they\u2019re doing on video, what they're doing with new services.","In a market that their traditional transport is commoditizing is pretty good. However, I don't want to ignore one issue, they are struggling big time in certain geographies with how to make money given the cost that are going flat to up, and their revenues that are coming back through. And so you are going to see certain service providers like AT&T said it very publicly. And obviously I\u2019m very close to Randall and John and Ralph there. We know that their CapEx is going to be down by fair amount this next year regardless.","However, it will be down dramatically more, if we don't get our act together on this title to issues. There's a way to accomplish the goals of both sides. I thought Chairman Wheelers\u2019 original approach to this was right on and right compromise in terms of direction. And I think, it's very important that we send a message because you are going to see these service providers flow if not pause completely on broadband buildout, because if they can\u2019t make money on broad brand buildout, they aren\u2019t going to build it out. It\u2019s just simple as that. And we included that was the wild card factors that, Simona, you asked me about indirectly.","We started seeing service providers spending slow a lot less quarter among the three big guys that might be most affected here. And so I think getting their act together there is key. We do plan to be very aggressive on this and trying to educate people on all sides about why this is not right for our country.","I find it just last comment being very interesting that Europe looks at the U.S. that we\u2019ve got our act together. We head the right amount of competition that allowed companies to make profits, and the right amount of government regulation that allowed them to build out broadband.","So they look at us like we\u2019ve got our act together and here we are thinking about changing it. So I think it\u2019s very important that the whole industry is active here. I think, it\u2019s going to have a negative impact for all of us that are connected to those large service providers in the U.S. here and the just last quarter and maybe one or two more quarters. And that\u2019s pretty much reflected in our approach, hope I'm wrong, but it feels like that\u2019s going to be very tight.","Melissa Selcher","","Thanks, John. Operator next question.","Operator","And your next question comes from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.","John Chambers","Hey Mark.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you. Good afternoon. At a high level, the patterns that we\u2019re seeing today is somewhat similarly. You have some regions positive, some regions negative and then we are seeing a subsequent reversion to the mean. Are their considerations to really think about -- can do things very differently, make big changes. So that all the effort that Cisco is making can lead to a corresponding outperformance, in terms of economic value added and also equity outperformance for Cisco. In terms, of looking at unlocking value, are there discussions going on or we had a point where Cisco will consider new inputs to change and formulate a better outcome.","John Chambers","Well, Mark, a couple of thoughts. You\u2019ve asked your question that we could probably talk about for a half an hour but let me here it very high. We are winning almost all of our major market transitions moves. We\u2019ve been on our architectures, we\u2019re winning on convergence in the data center of storage and network and processing capability. We\u2019re winning big-time on application-centric infrastructure, and pulling away from the start-up competitors that being very bold, I would say, we are not only pulling away from, I think, while they have news left on the table, I think, it\u2019s game over, I think we have got them.","There is no doubt about where we are leading with Internet of Everything. Our products are very uniquely tied together. That\u2019s why you have seen our gross margins be so strong. We moved to selling solutions and software and cloud.","We have redone and transformed our whole company to move resources and freeing up by keeping headcount flat into new areas. We have moved with InterCloud with tremendous efficiency. We realigned our organization.","So we transformed our company at a time that others have not transformed at all and are just beginning to get started, Mark, with some of the things that you are outlining, which I think is going to get into real trouble.","So I love our position in the market. Our position with customer, Gary, you and I were out there all the time. It has never been stronger. And Mark, we are winning with great gross margins and where there are growth opportunities, we are getting share of it plus a lot, gaining market share in many of the areas. So fair criticism perhaps three years ago probably not a fair criticism today.","Melissa Selcher","Okay. Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question.","Operator","And your next question comes from James Fawcett with Morgan Stanley.","James Fawcett - Morgan Stanley","Thank you very much. I wanted to go back to the question that was asked earlier on margins? Just wondering how we should think about opportunity to improve profitability. It seems like we are on the backside of a multiyear revamping of the internal organizational structure like you just said, John? And I am wondering if there is an opportunity to see some margin expansion as year-over-year growth persist or maybe to ask another way, what kind of topline growth do you think we would need achieve in order to show some margins expansion improved profitability as we get to the latter stages of the reorganization we have been under -- that\u2019s been underway for last three years?","John Chambers","Yeah. So you are repeating first, I have seen that, I commented on and then we are in agreement the way you are leaving us. You look at the last three plus years to grow revenues by $4 billion and to grow operating expenses by $61 million. Our peers when we look at them, they were at $0.30, $0.50, $0.70, $1 per dollar revenue gain. We did it at 1%. I have to give us very high marks on that over the last three years.","To the second part of your question, Gary\u2019s got the ball for me on that. Its about, how do we drive productivity and we are going to use, one, we can measure productivity per employee, which is just a easiest one to do, I know, its not anywhere near as sophisticated as, many of us would use different measurement that add up to that.","But how we drive productivity of our company on that and to your point, there times either within segments of our business or times when there are market segments where we will improve productivity dramatically, and routing and switching would be good example. But even though we are breaking away new products, we are moving resources into other areas at the same time. Gary, your thoughts on that?","Gary Moore","Yeah. I mean, there are several things that we have done. I mean, John spoke of the services revenue growth over the last three years and the fact that we are doing that with automation and analytics, and delivering higher value at a lower costs, I think, plays into that and there is a lot more that we can do there as we continue to buildout the things that we have been talking about, about cloud managed services, the security offering, the consulting, those kinds of things from services, as well as other things that, Rob, and the engineering team are doing with [broadcast] [ph] relative to the integrated portfolio.","So from a margin point of view, we still have, we maybe on the backside of this. But as we\u2019ve said, this is the game that it doesn\u2019t have nine innings to it. We are going to continually turn the dials that we need to turn and we have all of those levers available to us to coincide with the growth, we are well-positioned.","If things do uptick and we have moved a lot to Share Support, so we are at a really good position to expand margins, quite honestly in my opinion if the growth takes off, because of what we have build on the infrastructure that is global and scalable.","And you will see us, probably, I think, given the market growth numbers, fairly, small numbers, be more conservative about adding the headcount once we got the growth, as opposed to betting little bit on the company as you move forward especially in this market.","Melissa Selcher","Okay. Thanks, James. Operator, next question.","Operator","And your next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham.","John Chambers","Hi, Alex.","Alex Henderson - Needham","Hi, guys. How are doing?","John Chambers","Good. So, I was hoping you could give us a little bit more granularity on the service provider segment. The piece that is confounding the analysis to some extend is the set-top box business continuing to fall off and its falling off so many quarters in a row, it\u2019s kind of lost track of how big it is? Can you talk about what the service provider business would be doing ex the set-top box on an apples-to-apples basis, because that piece is obviously got a different trajectory?","John Chambers","Yeah. I have got it. My team will verify on the numbers. The business answer just the way you worded, global service providers were down 10%. If you take a set-top box out of that, it would have been down 6% in terms of the approach.","And it did vary globally, global service provider Europe group by 13% this last quarter and service provider in relationships with the companies like Deutsche Telekom, et cetera going extremely well in terms of where we go from that side. And you are seeing us build very strong relationship in new emerging markets with players like Reliance and Rob, you have got a list of 30 of our InterCloud type of partners in terms of the direction.","And again, understand, I am not aware the set-top box is, I am aware to winning the battle in the cloud. And so we clearly use set-top boxes, clearly it\u2019s a stepping stone to get into the cloud and direction. And right now we have a pretty good portfolio and how this ties together. But it\u2019s all about winning software in the cloud. And you will see us evolve our company that way in terms of products that don\u2019t add much margin overtime.","Melissa Selcher","Thanks, Alex. Operator, next question.","Operator","And your next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer","Thanks. And Frank, the best wishes to you and thanks for the many years of good -- very good service and good luck to Kelly. I wanted to go back to the point of gross margin, John, if possible?","John Chambers","Sure.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer","And I have heard all the explanations around it. But I have to go back literally two, three years to find a point in time where you had a product gross margin this high? And then, I looked at your guidance over the past few quarters and years, and you have beaten gross margin 10 out of the last 13, you never miss in the last 13 quarters? And I am kind of wondering, if we have gotten to a point in time where you feel that the, you have a much better handle on the product cycles, you have a much better handle on the competitive front, what is the possibility that you actually do start raising that gross margin range outlook going forward? Is that something completely unreasonable to assume?","John Chambers","Yeah. It\u2019s a good question. We debated that at the operating committee, Gary, just a couple of weeks ago. And so to answer your question on part, we are -- all over gross margins.","Gary leads the project with Frank and now Gary will lead with Kelly, every aspect of gross margins from, in the product cycle improvement to designing products to your point, let\u2019s not design a switch that comes in a 50% gross margins and we get at the 70% over three years.","That was very painful and we did that across our line the last time. And with our new switching product they came in at very high gross margins and I said earlier are actually improving as volume picks up in terms of direction.","I think the major issue quarter in and quarter out is more mix at the present time. We are going to go into next quarter, where UCS will be up and hopefully up dramatically and seasonally strong period for us in UCS, as well as otherwise. And I think there are certain transactions that we want to go after aggressively in an emerging markets are not which tend to swing it up and down.","But are we focused on this, yes, and are we focused in each category, even thought the real play is for architectures, about how to improve the category and gross margins, the answer would be, yes.","And then, final, the real issue on gross margins, if you can provide a solutions, it is three to five times the value to our customer providing products. And so when we tie together these architectures Mark at dramatically lower, dramatically lower operating expenses to get the solution to go to outcomes, that\u2019s what customers pay you huge premium for, that\u2019s where you are making a money, by Mark, I meant, Mark, referring back to his comment earlier.","Why you don\u2019t change the structure when everybody else has left this wide open for us and we are breaking away. The last thing you do would be change that now that would result in opposite.","So I think there are areas that we can improve on. And as we move more into cloud, as we move more into software, we should move into collaboration. We\u2019re looking at the margins and you\u2019ll see us where we can\u2019t get good margins, will walk them at the business. And we clearly are doing that with some service providers today.","If we can get a good margin deal, it\u2019s important to us, we will walk and that\u2019s advantage of, I think having the discipline this leadership team has. Mel, that\u2019s probably a good way to summarize. If I would have to look at it, I\u2019d say in the comments we started off the quarter review with, I\u2019d end with. I think in the tough environment, we are managing very well. On the Enterprise, Commercial and Public sector, we are lighting up the world and I think we\u2019re doing very well there.","The areas we make big bets on that some people challenges with its architectures or convergence or Application Centric Infrastructure or embracing SDN and bringing it to light with programmability and leading Internet of everything is finally taken off. You have an inflection point on that. We had the courage to change organization and make transitions that other companies struggle with and by the way, we're just now starting.","We have been up for 3.5 years. I love our position. And I think we\u2019re going to win. So I want to thank you all for your confidence in Cisco. And thank you for the time.","Mel, let me turn it back to you.","Melissa Selcher","Great. Thanks John.

At the request of Cisco Systems, today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect. Now I'd like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks, Mark. Welcome everyone to Cisco's fourth quarter fiscal 2017 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO, and Kelly Kramer, our CFO.","By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website.","Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise and the full year revenue and non-GAAP comparison has been normalized to exclude the divested SP video CPE business from our historical results.","The matters we will be discussing today includes forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on form 10-K and 10-Q which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.","With that, I'll now turn it over to Chuck.","Charles Robbins","Thank you, Marilyn, and good afternoon everyone. As you know it's only been seven weeks since we last spoke at our Financial Analyst Day and our overall outlook remains consistent with what we outlined at that time. In fiscal 2017, we continue to execute well against our vision of delivering customers a highly secure intelligent platform for their digital business. We managed our business through a dynamic environment and at the same time delivered significant innovation to further accelerate the next phase of our transformation.","In Q4, we generated revenue of $12.1 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.61. For the full fiscal year revenue was $48 billion and we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of$2.39. We drove strong margins and record operating cash flow for the year. Our results demonstrate solid execution against our strategic priorities. Accelerating our pace of innovation, increasing the value of the network and delivering technology in the way our customers want to consume it.","In June, we announced a new era of networking with the launch of the Network Intuitive. This is an example of the industry leading innovation Cisco is providing to its customers. The Network Intuitive is a new intent-based network that creates a fully integrated intuitive system that is designed to anticipate actions, stop security threats in their tracks and continue to evolve and learn over time. We're applying the latest technologies such as machine learning and advanced analytics to operate and define the network.","From a security standpoint, the new network enables our customers to detect threats in encrypted traffic with unprecedented accuracy using Cisco's encrypted traffic analytics and intelligence from Cisco's Talos cyber intelligence unit. We have created the only network that is designed for security while maintaining privacy solving a previously unsolvable problem. Our new Catalyst 9000 switches represent the foundation of our intent-based networking capabilities and provide highly differentiated advancements in security, programmability, performance, and lower operating cost by innovating at the hardware and software layer.","This offering is also a great example of how we're moving our core business to a recurring revenue model. Customer reception to this new innovation has been incredibly positive. As we've always said transitions of this nature are multi-year, but during the first four weeks in the market our pipeline and product orders are strong. With over 200 customers having ordered the new Catalyst 9000, the heart of the Network Intuitive platform. Our software value proposition in this portfolio is also compelling as the large majority of our customers are adopting the most advanced subscription offer available.","Building on this early success, we intend to further accelerate our leadership in intent-based networking through the combination of our expertise in network infrastructure AppDynamics visibility into applications and the Talos automation capabilities. I believe that over the next several years, we will see continued increasing relevance of technology as customers add billions of new connections to their enterprises. The network has never been more critical to business success and we're looking for helping our customers take advantage of the insights in intelligence that are only accessible through our highly differentiated platforms.","If Q4, we also announced an extension of our strategic partnerships with Apple, IBM, and Microsoft. We plan to deliver the first enterprise security application on Apple iOS and we're integrating our comprehensive security portfolio with IBM's Cognitive Security operations platform. Additionally, we're collaborating with Microsoft in two important ways. First, we're implementing a software layer on our datacenter switches that gives Microsoft the flexibility to run their own operating system on our industry leading hardware platforms in their Azure infrastructure. Second, we're collaborating together to enable businesses to build and host they're IoT applications in Microsoft Azure while extending the power of those applications to the edge via Cisco's leading Fog computing solutions.","Now let's review other key parts of our business starting with security. We believe we are well positioned as the number one enterprise security vendor. With growing cyber-attacks and the need for our customers to protect their business-critical data and applications, we are aggressively providing security everywhere. In the network, in the cloud, and at the end point. We don't believe any other company can match our capabilities given the criticality of the network in our customer's security architecture. Our best of breed products in Integrated Security architecture combining analytics and automation are winning in the market.","Our security business delivered a solid quarter with double-digit orders and 49% deferred revenue growth. This caps off a year in which we delivered 9% revenue growth with more than $2 billion in revenue making us the only company growing at this scale. Our leadership position in network security continues to expand driven by our next generation firewall portfolio with over 6,000 new customers added in the quarter which is three times our nearest competitor. Bringing our total customer base to nearly 80,000. Customers continue to rapidly adopt our advanced threat portfolio. We delivered revenue growth of 9% and we added over 7,600 new customers bringing the total number of AMP customers to over 42,000.","Building on our differentiated security innovations, we recently completed the acquisition of Observable Networks, which extends our Stealthwatch Solution into the cloud with highly scalable behavior analytics and comprehensive visibility. This platform expands our security, our cloud security capabilities by providing greater support and compliance for applications deployed in Amazon web services as well as Microsoft Azure environments. Additionally, to combat the 90% increase in cyber-attacks against IoT devices over the last year, we launched IoT threat defense solution an extensible, scalable, security architecture created to defend devices in connected healthcare, electric utilities, and manufacturing industries.","In the datacenter, we're helping our customers take full advantage of a multi-cloud world that has become the norm in managing their applications and hybrid cloud solutions. Our goal is to deliver the best multi-cloud platform built on an intelligent Intuitive Network enabling faster automated and highly secured delivery of applications in the cloud. We believe Cisco is best positioned to do this as everything we do in the datacenter is in support of modern and traditional applications both on premise and in the cloud. Cisco has led the industry over the past four years with ACI combined with UCS to traditional cloud center and our security solutions.","In Q4, we saw strong performance of our multi-cloud infrastructure portfolio combined with our cloud-based SaaS offerings including WebEx and Meraki cloud networking. For example, ACI, our fastest growing datacenter switching platform had a record quarter with growth of 38%. We continue to see strong customer adoption driven by our ability to accelerate datacenter application deployment across private to public clouds. HyperFlex our hyper converged offering combined with cloud center is gaining traction with customers benefiting from simplicity and scalability to support their hybrid cloud strategy.","You'll see us continue to strengthen our partnerships with public cloud providers as they look to Cisco to help our joint customers manage workloads across their private and public clouds. Lastly, we're delivering the right consumption models to enable continuous value and innovation for our customers. Our strong momentum continued in Q4 with 50% growth to $5 billion in deferred product revenue related to software and subscriptions which has doubled from two years ago.","For the first time, over $1 billion or 11% of our product revenue came from recurring offers which grew 40% year-over-year. Overall 31% of our total revenue was recurring and revenue from subscriptions now represents 51%of our software revenue. Going forward, you should expect to see our software business benefit from the transition of our campus networking portfolio to a subscription model. To summarize our Q4and full fiscal year results reflect a strong year of progress. We see tremendous opportunity in intent-based capabilities across our portfolio and we will continue to evolve our business to be the leading provider of highly secure software defined automated and intent-based infrastructure.","Our innovation is as strong as ever, as we focus on accelerating our core networking, security, software, and cloud based businesses. While it will take time. I firmly believe our core business is better positioned for the long term as we realize the benefits from our next generation intent-based networking portfolio.","Now, I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more detail on our financials.","Kelly Kramer","Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter and full fiscal year followed by the Q1 outlook. This quarter played out generally as we expected and as we indicated in our guidance in our last call. We executed well, drove solid profitability, strong cash flow and we continued to deliver on our strategic growth priorities. Total revenue was $12.1 billion down 4%. We continued to focus on driving margins and profitability with strong non-GAAP operating margin of 31.5%. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.61 down 3% and operating cash flow was strong growing 5% to $4 billion.","For the full fiscal year, we had revenue of $48 billion down 2% with product down 3%and services up 3%. Non-GAAP operating margin was a record $15.2 billion expanding to 31.6% of revenue up 0.6 points. Non-GAAP EPS also a record with $2.39 up 1% percent and we generated record operating cash flow of$13.9 billion up 2%.","Let me provide some more details on our Q4 revenue breakdown. Total product revenue was down 5%. Switching declined 9%driven by weakness in Campus partially offset by growth in the ATI portfolio which was up 38%. We saw good initial traction of our new intent-based networking portfolio of the Catalyst 9000 family of switches. Routing was down 9% driven by weakness in enterprise access, we did see a spending cause related to our acquisition of Viptela that we will integrate into SD-WAN portfolio.","Collaboration was down 3% due primarily to a decline in Unified Communications Endpoints partially offset by continued growth in conferencing. Deferred revenue grew 4%combined with the unbilled deferred the two were up 16%. Datacenter declined 4% with the continued market shift from Blade to Rack. However, we did he solid traction of our hyper converged offerings HyperFlex.","During the quarter, we launched our UCSM5 servers bringing greater simplicity and performance for next generation data intensive workloads and application. Wireless grew 5% with strong Meraki performance as well as the ramp of our 11AC Wave 2 portfolio. Security was up 3% with strong performance in Unified Threat, Web Security and Advanced Threat offset by declines in our legacy Firewall products. We did see very strong order growth during the quarter. Deferred revenue grew 49%as we continued to drive more subscription based software offers.","Service revenue was up 1% driven by growth in software and solutions services partially offset by decline in hardware maintenance. We drove good growth in deferred revenue which was up 12%in total with product up 23%and services up 6%. Deferred product revenue from our recurring software and subscription offers was up 50%to $5 billion. We continue to transform our business to delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions and recurring revenue.","In Q4, we generated 31% of our total revenue from recurring offers an increase of almost four points from a year ago. Revenue from subscriptions increased 18% and now represents over 50% of our software revenue. In terms of orders in Q4, total product orders were flat. Looking at our geographies, Americas was down 2%, EMEA was up 3% an APJC grew 2%. Total emerging markets declined2% with the BRICS plus Mexico also down 2%. In our customer segments, enterprise declined 1%,commercial grew 4%, public sector was up 2%and service provider declined 7%. Our product backlog as we ended Q4 with $4.8 billion up 3% compared to the end of fiscal year 2016.","From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q4 gross margin was 53.7% down 0.9 points. Product gross margin was 61.9% down two points and service gross margin was 68.8% growing 1.8 points. While our total gross margin was solid, our product gross margin is continuing to be negatively impacted by memory pricing which we expect to continue in the near term.","Our operating margin was strong at 31.5%. For the full fiscal year on a non-GAAP basis, our total gross margin was 64.3% a decrease of 0.4 points. But product gross margin down 0.9 points and service gross margin up 1.1 points. Our non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 31.6% up 0.6 points by our focus on driving cost improvement, operational efficiencies and productivity. In terms of the bottom line, our Q4 non-GAAP EPS was $0.61 down 3%, while GAAP EPS was $0.48.","For the full year, we had non-GAAP EPS of $2.39 up 1% while GAAP EPS was $1.90. We ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $70.5 billion with $3 billion available in the US. Q4 operating cash flow increased a solid 5% to $4 billion with free cash flow of $3.8 billion up 7%. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned 2.6 points to shareholders during the quarter that included $1.2 billion of share repurchases and $1.4 billion for our quarterly dividend.","For the full fiscal year operating cash flow grew 2% to a record $13.9 billion with free cash flow of $12.9 billion up 4%. We returned $9.2 billion to shareholders over the fiscal year through share buybacks and dividends which represented 71% of our free cash flow. We are firmly committed to continuing our capital allocation strategy of returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders annually.","To summarize in Q4 and for the full fiscal year, we executed well and we're focused on driving operational efficiencies and profitability to drive strong cash flow enabling us to make the strategic investments to build long term shareholder value. Let me reiterate our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, this guidance includes the type of forward looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier.","We expect revenue in the range of minus 1% to minus 3% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29.5% to 30.5%and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.59 to $0.61. Consistent with how we talk about our business at our financial analyst conference, in fiscal 2018 we will be redefining and simplifying our product reporting categories to better align with our evolving business model.","We will continue to primarily run operator business by the three geographic segments and so this change will only impact how we report on our products. Starting in Q1 fiscal year 2018, we will realign our reporting into five distinct categories infrastructure platform, applications, security, services, and other. I'll now turn it back to Chuck for some closing comments.","Charles Robbins","Thanks Kelly. And thanks again to all of you for joining us today. As we've discussed many times in the past, we're working on a multi-year transition and while I'm confident with our progress it's clear there's more for us to do. In Q4, we made ongoing progress generating 31% of our total revenue from recurring offers and growing 50% in deferred product revenue related to software and subscriptions to $5 billion.","I'm optimistic about our future, the direction we're headed, and how we're transforming Cisco for the future. We are well positioned to succeed in a cloud and digital ready world where the network is one of the most strategic assets for our customers. Looking forward to fiscal 2018, as I said earlier, you can expect us to do the following. Execute against our strategy and invest in priority areas to drive profitable growth and enhance shareholder value. Leverage to power the network to maximize our opportunities and differentiation in existing and new markets. Drive relentless focus on innovation, creating continuous customer value across every element of our portfolio and drive the right consumption models for our customers and accelerate our shift towards more software and subscription revenue.","Marilyn, now I'll turn it back to you for questions.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks Chuck. Mark, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. And while Mark is doing that, I'd like to go ahead and remind the audience that we ask you to ask one question, so that we have plenty of time for others in the audience to ask their questions today.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Ittai Kidron","Thanks, and appreciate the color around the software and the current metrics, very helpful. I guess just a couple from me. Just an easy clarification. Kelly, you haven't mentioned the number of Cisco ONE customers, we'd love to get that?","And -- the question itself Chuck, switching has had a little bit of a difficulty I think three out of the four quarters was down quite substantially actually on year-over-year basis. As we look into 18 how do you think about that business in the year, it that another year of transition to where the portfolio through for example your most recent announcements will go for a potential pause and update and learning curve where that business could still be prone to declines or we should finally see some better results in that category?","Charles Robbins","Ittai, I am shocked you asked a switching question.","Kelly Kramer","Let me answer the easy one first.","Ittai Kidron","I've given up on the data center business.","Kelly Kramer","Well, I have an easy answer. In Cisco ONE we have over 20,000 customers now at this moment.","Ittai Kidron","Perfect. That's great.","Charles Robbins","Okay. So Ittai, let me touch on the switching situation. First of all, the results we saw this quarter were not a surprise to us, if you think about our guide last quarter we anticipated this and we also knew at the time that we're going to be making the announcement in June about the new platform. And so, we anticipated these results.","Now anytime we do a major platform announcement particularly in switching there is a period of time where our customers pause because they want to understand what this means. So, we did see a pause and we actually anticipated it. But we saw great traction with the new platform. As I said earlier, just in the four weeks where we closed the quarter we had 200 customers that embraced this new architecture and purchase a new Catalyst 9000 platform.","And as I said in the opening comments, the great majority of them also opted for the advanced software subscription the goes on top of it and we've had a lot of conversations over the last two years as to whether we could really drive a subscription business on our core switching platforms. And what we see is that at least early indications are that we can do that.","So, we talked about our data center business, the ACI portfolio again record quarter growing 38%. And then if you look at what we lost in the Campus, typically what we see is these are three-year cycles to transition these platforms. But this is also not a typical platform transition, this is not speeds and feeds only. We brought forward some incredible innovation in this platform and if you think about not only the actual product itself but the solutions that we announced around automation which really gets at the operating expenses that our customers are incurring to manage their infrastructure.","You look at one of the key drivers of why customers move to the cloud, it was because of the complexity in the cost of their private infrastructure. So, the ability to go drive significant cost out for our customers while managing this stuff over the next few years we think is a huge difference from a normal transition. And the other is the fact that we launched encrypted traffic analytics which is our ability to determine when there's malware inside encrypted traffic without decrypting it.","And that's an innovation that only Cisco can actually deliver and both of those pieces of technology or what are included in that advanced subscription which is what tells us that the customer see tremendous value in that subscription. So normally, we see three years, it's very early and we would like to believe that we can accelerate that based on the incremental innovation that's being delivered as part of the platform, but let's see how it goes over the next quarter or two.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks Chuck. Mark next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from James Suva with Citigroup Global Markets.","James Suva","Hi, thanks so much on the opportunity to ask questions. It's Jim Suva here from Citi. Last quarter, I believe you gave a little bit of commentary or a bit of a pause in the federal government spending and also on Europe. It appears is that still continuing or has it taken a step up to improve or deteriorate a little bit and how should we think about that?","And does the Europe have any impact on Brexit? Thank you very much.","Charles Robbins","Hi Jim. Thanks for the questions. Since you outlined, I'll just quickly cover sort of all the headwinds that we talked about in Q3, I'll give you a quick update on all that's including and the two that you asked. First of all, we talked about Mexico last quarter which is generally in the same state it was last quarter. We didn't see any significant change and again that's largely driven by service provider weakness due to regulatory transitions as well as geopolitical dynamics and after renegotiation etcetera.","Emerging countries were slightly better but there is still just tremendous uncertainty and disparity between performance in those countries and service provider is generally the same as it was last quarter. The two that you asked about in particular, we did see some shifts in US federal. I would say in Q3, we had of real lack of clarity around budgets. In early May, we began to see obviously the clarity with the continuing resolution and the way the dollars get released in federal were in like the fourth phase based on how they prioritize release in those budget funds.","So, we saw some improvement not where we'd like there to be but we saw some improvement particularly late in the quarter and obviously in federal we're going to be facing the same issue again in 90 days at the end of September as we try to get another budget resolution passed. But you can see on a global public-sector perspective, you saw our orders last quarter were minus four, this quarter they were plus two and that was clearly a big part of that was the improvement we saw in the US federal business.","On the UK, if you go back to Q3, we talked about it being significantly down and one of the primary drivers was the headwind created by currency. In Q4, what I'll tell you is that headwind from currency remained, it did not ease up. However, our teams did a really amazing job and we saw significant improvement in our enterprise and commercial business in the UK. And if you look at the overall performance in EMEAR, you can see that the strengthening in the UK for us actually helped achieve the result at the EMEAR level.","I'll say one final thing and UK while enterprise and commercial we saw a good uptick. Service provider remained about the same.","Marilyn Mora","Okay Mark, let's go ahead and take the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with Sanford Bernstein & Co.","Pierre Ferragu","Hi, thank you for taking my question. I'd like to get a sense for how you see like your near-term trend in the business. If I look at your revenue guide for next quarter, so we have seen slightly down year-on-year, but sequentially the kind of revenue change you are guiding for is actually probably better than the average seasonality for Q1 of the last year.","So am I right, thinking the environment, you see the environment, the business environment slightly improving sequentially after this quarter, this weaker quarter you were anticipating. So that's on the revenue front. And then on the margin front, I think like from the top of my mind, you probably didn't beat in your gross margin guidance range for like eight or nine quarters in a row or something like that. And your gross margin came in slightly down sequentially, and you are guiding for slightly lower operating margin next quarter than what the consensus is anticipating so if you could give some perspective on what's happening at the gross margin level, relatively small movements that I am sure you can give us some visibility on where are the drivers there? Thank you.","Charles Robbins","Yes, Pierre. Let me give you a little color on the revenue question and sort of the business conditions and then I'll let Kelly talk about the Q1guide as well as the margins. In general, I think if you just look at our order rates that we released today, we went from negative four last quarter to flat in Q4. I'm sorry from Q3 negative four to flat in Q4. So clear that we saw improvement there. I will tell you that across the customers segments, just so you have some visibility, I think we showed the high-level numbers, I'll give you a little bit of a double click.","On the enterprise side, we didn't see a lot of variability around the world in the performance there. Commercial, every region around the world improved from Q3 to Q4, public sector every region improved from Q3 to Q4 and SP we had weakness everywhere. So that's just sort a little color on the orders that we saw in Q4.","Kelly, you want to talk a little bit about the revenue guide and margins?","Kelly Kramer","Yes, sure. On the revenue guide, as you know Pierre we call it like we see it and as Chuck mentioned the bookings being much better in Q4 than Q3 it certainly helped a lot. And I'll just mention that we are starting off with a strong backlog with our backlog being up 3%and we have good momentum as we go in the quarter. So, we feel good about the revenue call for Q1. As I talk about margins, yes, our margins for Q4 were in the range, but we definitely saw our product margins go down 2 points year-over-year and it really comes down quite simply that 3 points.","The one and the biggest impact by far has been the increase of memory pricing and DRAM specifically for the overall business that accounts for more than half of the 2 points decline. The second point that's really impacting that is an overall productivity. Whenever you have large part of the portfolio, our largest business unit down 9% like switching which is also a very profitable business. It impacts your ability to get cost savings in that quarter so that was the second biggest driver and then we just had a third driver but to a much lesser extent was a slight uptick in pricing erosion.","Marilyn Mora","All right. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Milunovich with UBS Securities.","Steven Milunovich","Great, thank you. On the security side, you said at the Analyst Day you expect low to mid-teens growth. You did talk about strong orders today, but the revenue growth was much less. I think you cited some legacy products, holding things back. Do you have confidence that the reported revenue is going to get back into the double digits consistently?","Charles Robbins","Yes, Steve. So first, I'll say on the security. I have zero concerns about the business, this is a revenue timing issues. Our orders were, they were some of the strongest, we saw some of the strongest order growth in the quarter as we've seen in the last two years. So, it's simply a revenue timing issue, it funny if you go back to Q4 2015, the first call I did there was concern about our security revenue at 4% and at the time our deferred software was going 26 and this time we had 3% revenue but our deferred software was gone 49.","So, the strength in the business, I'm still comfortable with. Kelly any comments on it?","Kelly Kramer","I think you said it well and it's literally just timing. We and uptick to come back there in the next quarter.","Marilyn Mora","Okay. Let's go ahead and jump to the next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank.","Vijay Bhagavath","Yes, good afternoon. Hi Chuck, Kelly.","Kelly Kramer","Hi Vijay.","Vijay Bhagavath","Yes, hi. My question is on what feedback and commentary you are hearing from your sales team, your customers, channel partners in this new model to purchase products like the Catalyst 9000 the subscription being is - hopefully you get this with security feature attached. And then the next part of the question is the demand for the subscription model primarily coming from the US market customers or are you -","Kelly Kramer","Hi Vijay. Can you speak up a little bit, it's a bit hard to hear you.","Vijay Bhagavath","Okay. So, I think the question is what commentary you are hearing from your customers and channel partners of your sales team on purchasing the new product which is the Catalyst 9000, the software has security features with subscription model and\u2026","Kelly Kramer","Vijay, speak up just a tad bit higher there. We still have.","Vijay Bhagavath","Can you guys hear me now?","Charles Robbins","That's much better.","Kelly Kramer","Yes, much better.","Vijay Bhagavath","Yes. So, I think the first part of the question is the commentary from your customers on purchasing new products with subscriptions model. The second part of the question is the demand for the subscriptions model primarily coming from US customers or are you seeing overseas demand as well for subscriptions based purchasing? Thanks.","Charles Robbins","Okay. So, I'll answer the first part. I think Kelly, I have an instinctive answer on the second part but she probably has a mathematical answer. So, what we are -- first or all I think that when you look back at what we announced probably I think back was seven weeks ago so must've been eight weeks ago or nine weeks ago we announced the actual Network Intuitive. It was probably one the most significant launches we've had in almost a decade. And what I would tell you is there's a lot of emotional momentum right now within the employee base with our customers with our partners with our sales organization about the innovation.","And specifically, your question, I think that what we always knew was that when we attempted to introduce a subscription model on a switching product we knew that we had to bring innovation that was -- that had such a high return for our customers that they would not have a problem buying it in that model and that's what we've seen. When you look at the automation platform that we're going to -- that we're delivering to our customers we're going to continue to enhance over the next several years and you look at the security capability that frankly only Cisco with our understanding has a network and with our threat intelligence that we get from Talos and with our ability to build silicon they can actually make that happen.","I think our customers are actually quite pleased with the innovation and so far, we've seen a high correlation with that to the advance subscription. So as far as the geographic issue, Kelly?","Kelly Kramer","Yes, I mean as far as the geographic it's following very closely with our natural split. We definitely have more in the Americas, but we have a very healthy pipeline in Europe as well as a APJC. So, it's getting traction everywhere.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks for the question Vijay. Mark, let's go ahead and take the next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Timothy Long with BMO Capital Markets.","Timothy Long","Thank you. Just wanted to check in on the web scale client base. How did that trend in the quarter and you can also address the kind of the switching and routing competitive environment there, it seems like white box really not taking off with some of your competitors having good traction? So, if you could just update us on progress with that large customer base? That's great, thank you.","Charles Robbins","Yes, thanks Tim. So, we were together seven weeks ago, the story here hasn't changed significantly as I've said in the past. We have reengaged in a very big way. I will tell you that we've had some wins, we actually had the press release that I talked about in my earlier comments with Microsoft about running their OS on our cloud silicon switches and we continue to make traction with these customers.","As I've said, we're looking at each of them very individually as to what it is they need and we're also looking at broad base partnerships with them not only for their own infrastructure but as they realize that the importance of having this multi-cloud capability and the ability to run not only applications in a central public cloud but be able to run portions of those applications out at the edge of the network is leading to a very complimentary partnership that we're talking about with all of them.","So, I would say that not a lot has changed in last seven weeks but we're still continuing to make solid progress and I'm optimistic.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks Chuck. Let's go ahead and take up the next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Tal Liani with Bank of America Securities Merrill Lynch.","Tal Liani","Hi guys, I have actually two questions but it's about margin and cash. You touched on this a little bit but you knew about memory pricing when you enter the quarter I think when you gave the guidance, still product gross margin was weak. What was the delta, what was weaker than expected during the question that drove gross margin down?","The second question is cash repatriation, if it doesn't happen. You already now have $70 billion in cash, but only $3 billion in US. So, do you consider plan B for bringing the cash to US or any other use for the cash?","Kelly Kramer","Alright. Hi, Tal. So, on the memory, we've talked about memory for the last three quarters and now we start to see this as a headwind initially in Q2 and it's just gotten progressively worse. I think it's very much public information that the prices continue to climb and in this scarce supply environment, our supply team has done a great job securing supply for us but those prices continue to be at market at that price that goes forward.","So, it's continuing to be a moving target and again, as I will say to the guide our gross margin ended up in the range of our guide. So those are just some of the variables as we go forward. As I look forward I think, we expect the memory pressure to continue on in the near term and we're taking that into account as we give you guidance going forward for Q1.","On the cash, yes. We have $3 billion of cash domestically. We've been able to - we've been accessing commercial paper, we increased that a little bit this past quarter and we've been able to access and get access to capital to take out debt if we need to as we go forward because again, we are continuing to ensure we have the flexibility we need, whether it's for strategic M&A or to continue with obviously our dividend and share repurchase. So, we don't see any issues with that going forward and we'll continue to be as efficient as possible as managing our cash and any debt we need to take out.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks for the question Tal. Mark, let's go and take the next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Silverstein with Cowen & Co. Your line is open.","Paul Silverstein","Thanks. Just two clarifications from Kelly and then a question. The clarifications being, Kelly you mentioned the tick up in price erosion. Does that mean below 3% and then the other on the switching commentary can you give us a datacenter switching growth all in beyond just the ACI portfolio and what the Campus switching was. And the real question is looking at the dragon growth from the shift to subscriptions what was\u2026","Marilyn Mora","Paul? Are you on mute. Yes, let's go ahead and take the next question.","Operator","Okay. Our next question is from Rod Hall with J.P. Morgan Securities.","Rod Hall","Yes. Hi, guys thanks for the question. I wanted Kelly maybe, get you to comment on the inventory movement. The inventory is up quite a bit this quarter. I am assuming that might be forward purchasing in memory and then I assume that might protect your margin looking forward. But I wonder could you confirm that and if it is the case, that it's memory how long are you protected, how long are you hedged?","And then also Chuck maybe going back to that carrier order volume. Could you just maybe dig into where you're seeing weakness in orders in the network can you help us pinpoint that or is it more broad and related to product slowdown that's kind of generally from a part of the network where is that sluggishness materializing? Thanks.","Kelly Kramer","Yes. So, Rod on the inventory, you're correct. A large majority of the inventory increase is driven by memory advanced purchases. So that protects us in for a large portion but we also have been as I mentioned in the lack -- we've also been securing and committing to our purchase commitments for even more access to supply that also will ensure that we have the supply albeit perhaps at higher prices if they continue to rise.","But the bulk of the inventory going up, the $400 million is memory and then there is also a little bit of just inventory built up as we continue just to execute our revenue in Q1.","Charles Robbins","Hi Rod on the second part. Thanks for asking about the service provider business. I think we have characterized it as, it's less about different portions of the network and it's really about the disparity across large customers. As I said in the last couple of calls, we literally had some very big customers that were growing double-digits and others that were on the opposite side of that.","So, it really is more of a customer variability issue then it is a single place in the network infrastructure that is causing a problem. And that's what we've seen for several quarters and again some of it is based on regulatory issues and geopolitical dynamics others are based on consolidation going on in a certain part of the industry. So that's kind of the color as to how I see it. Hopefully, that's helpful.","Marilyn Mora","Okay. Thanks Chuck. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Silverstein with Cowen & Co.","Paul Silverstein","Chuck, Kelly, Marilyn can you hear me?","Charles Robbins","Yes, we can hear you now.","Paul Silverstein","It is a good telephone, just in the interest of full disclosure.","Charles Robbins","We thought your question was going to be hard and you came back.","Kelly Kramer","No. Go ahead.","Charles Robbins","I'm just kidding.","Paul Silverstein","So, let me ask a question and two clarifications. The question being what was the drag on growth from the shift of subscriptions this quarter and can you talk about what your product segment growth will look like on a normalized basis i.e. adjusting for the shift in subscriptions. I am aware that wireless win and collaboration have been the two places where insecurity where it's been first implemented but can you talk to us about what the growth will look like on a product line basis correcting for that?","And the clarification, Kelly you mentioned that took up in price erosion; was it still below 3% and can you tell us what the decline in campus switching was? What it was the all-in growth rate of data centers, not just ACI but taking account the 7,000 or whatever are the products in that? Thanks a lot.","Kelly Kramer","Yes, sure. So on the shift, first, it's not much different than we told you, it's basically about 2% between the 1.5% and 2% and you hit the -- obviously, it's security impacts the most, collaboration has always been that way and that just could change robust if you retain the security be impacted, wireless would be impacted and now with fiscal one really ramping up and added hundreds of millions of dollars out of the balance sheet, that would have and impacted -- well, and that what is the piece that will accelerate even more as we get more attraction on the catalyst 9,000 switches platform. So it's kind of across the board, in terms of data center overall, so if I look at switching and switching being down 9%, the bulk of it was campus switching and that was over double-digit; so that was the biggest drag. Data center switching all in was basically flattish.","Paul Silverstein","And price decline?","Kelly Kramer","And price decline, yes, it is -- you're talking about a year-over-year rate impact?","Paul Silverstein","Yes.","Kelly Kramer","Yes, so it is below the 3% and you can see that in the K.","Paul Silverstein","Thank you.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks, Paul. Mark, let's go ahead and take the next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James & Associates.","Simon Leopold","Great, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to see if we could maybe double click down on the security business in light of the headlines we've heard in the security space over the last couple of months in terms of attack. I think of the case of nuance highlighted employing Cisco and I recall your discussions in the past about the need for security to be an architectural solution and not a point solution. So it sounds like the market is moving towards the pitch you've made and it's made sense for a long time, I'm just trying to see if you can help us quantify the outlook for your security business if you see an inflexion point of the business moving more towards the solution sales and point products versus what we've seen in the past. Thank you.","Charles Robbins","Thanks for the question, Simon. The short answer is yes. And what's happened is, if you -- if you think about how our customers are building their IT infrastructure or how their IT assets are being deployed, they are in a massively distributed mode and they are trying to navigate and manage technology assets spanning from the public cloud to connected vehicles, connected mining operations, all the way back to their private data center over to SaaS applications, so the architecture of sort of hair pinning all that stuff back to a central point in the enterprise is not going to be sustainable. Therefore, we see our customers transitioning to a fundamentally new architecture that's enabled by the network and that's why they are moving to the security architecture because as I said, our teams have built this strategy where you have to deploy security everywhere which is at the endpoint in the network in the cloud.","And I think as it relates to some of the attacks, I don't remember the number exactly last quarter or the quarter before relative to our threat -- new threat customers that we have, the Amp customers, but I believe the 7,600 discussed this quarter was a pretty significant increase over what we saw during a quarter over the last two quarters and I think that's probably related to not only the architectural buy-end that our customers have but also the fact that that solution was pretty resilient during the recent ransom ware attacks.","Marilyn Mora","Okay Mark, let's go ahead and take the next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeffery [ph] with Nomura Securities International.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, thank you very much. And I would like to dive into the service provider outlook a little bit if we could. It sounds as though we understand that things aren't perfect around the world for you. My question is how much of where we are in service rider, do you consider to be cyclical? And how much of this is structural? I mean do you think that we should see the service provider orders be in that 1% to 3% growth range that you've highlighted for the overall business? Thank you.","Charles Robbins","Let me see if I can break this down into three sort of qualitative areas that I think we are focused on that can actually improve the service provider performance over the next three to seven quarters, over the next two years. I think first is, we have increased our presence or relevance in the web scale cloud providers that we've talked about, that's first and foremost. Second is, there are -- there is innovation that we are working on, that we talked a little bit about at the financial analyst conference, it will be coming out probably a few quarters from now that will give us some transition opportunities in some of our platforms. And then finally, I think the other is, there is -- but I would characterize as a combination of some of the macro issues as well as technology transitions, I think you're going to see customers and we're beginning to have discussions with customers, we're thinking about 5G and while we're not in the macro radio space, one of the key things that they are working on or thinking about is, as I add a significant number of new devices at higher speeds and lower latency out at the edge of the network, what is that going to mean for the performance I'm going to need in the core of the network.","So I think as we see some of the geopolitical dynamics hopefully settle down but I wouldn't count on that right now but the overall, I think the 5G trend in that transition is the other one that could help us over the next couple of years.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks, Chuck. Let's go ahead and take the next question.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with Barclays Capital.","Mark Moskowitz","Thanks and good afternoon. I just want to follow-up on the gross margin question, a lot of focus today on the call, how should investors anticipate potential margin volatility over the next one to two years related to the transition to the highly attracted subscription model? And then Kelly, can you weigh in on Rev ASC 606 [ph], like when could we see Cisco introduce some guidance around that as well? Thank you.","Kelly Kramer","Sure. So on the gross margin, I think we need to -- we will have an impact on the memory for the next couple of quarters coming up here for sure. I think the public information out there on what's happening with the supply, there are people that think that maybe eased up but you know, it's too hard to call; so I think that's going to be a headwind for us. I think the other parts of gross margin are continuing to --we're executing and managing those well like we always have on the cost savings side and managing price as well. So I think it's really the big question mark and the big headwind is the memory. On the RevRac [ph] change of ASC 606, we will be giving more color on that in our 10-K and kind of give you a feel of what some of the implications will be, so you will get more color in that and we'll try to quantify for you the impact from revenue and bottom line perspective.","I will also just reference you back to -- I did have a page in the analyst conference deck laying out what of our offers would be impacted and what wouldn't be, the kind of to give you a feel along those lines as well to help you think throughout that but we'll give you progressively more details starting with RK [ph] coming up during a few weeks.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks, Kelly and thanks Mark, for the questions. Chuck why don't I turn it over to you to wrap it up.","Charles Robbins","All right, thanks Marilyn, and thanks everybody for participating with us today. I think there are four key messages that I would part leave you with; first is that, this launch that we announced back about 8 weeks ago was the first of what I believe you should expect from us and just an ongoing cycle of innovation, and very positively received by the press, analysts, customers, partners, employees and I said when I took this job we're going to increase the pace of innovation and this is the first wave which you're going to see coming from us. And when you look at the innovation that was introduced particularly around the automation, around the new platform and the innovation we drove in the security capabilities, that's what you're going to see from us going forward.","Secondly, I think with the -- our customers in the environments in which they are operating now, the network's never been more relevant. I talked about how they are building out their infrastructure in very distributive ways, they are managing hundreds of thousands of devices today and they have to be ready to manage a million or more by 2020 and I think that that is why this automation and analytics capability and the security built into the network is so important.","The third is, if we continue to have our customers looking for us to help them really build out this secured intelligent platform that spans across this multi-cloud environment for their digital business and I think that our security results on the number of new customers embracing the technology I think is indicative of other buying into this new architecture.","And then fourth, I would say that the strategy we've laid out, we're executing very well against. We're managing the business through this transition and when you look at the year that we just completed having record EPS, record cash flow, at the same time that we -- this past quarter increased the software and subscription deferred business, 50% to $5 billion, and so I'm very pleased with where our teams are, what our teams are doing, how we're executing and how we've increased the innovation and the response from our customers.","So we look forward to talking to you all again next quarter and thanks for joining us today.","Marilyn Mora","Thanks, Chuck. I'm going to go ahead and provide some last closing remarks here. Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call which will reflect our fiscal 2018 first quarter results will be on Wednesday, November 15, 2017, at 1:30 P.M. Pacific time, 4:30 P.M. Eastern time.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our 90th quarterly conference call. This is Melissa Selcher, Senior Director, Analyst and Investor Relations, and I'm joined by John Chambers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Frank A. Calderoni, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Rob Lloyd, Executive Vice President of Worldwide Operations; and Gary Moore, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.","The Q4 fiscal year 2012 press release is on the U.S. High Tech Marketwire and on the Cisco website along with the corresponding webcast with slides.

As we closed fiscal year \u201812, I am pleased to discuss our strong performance, continued execution of our plan to deliver profitable growth, and commitment to our shareholders. For the full fiscal year, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 14% year-over-year, and revenue growth of 7%, a record year in terms of earnings per share and revenue. For Q4, we delivered our non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 18% and revenue growth of 4%, also a record quarter in terms of revenue.","Our strategy delivering intelligent networks and technology architecture is built on integrated products, services and software platforms to fuel our customers\u2019 business is proving the right long term strategy for our success, and you\u2019re seeing it in our results.","The success of our service provider business, where we\u2019ve moved from an individual product provider in today\u2019s market where many of our customers use Cisco as their best strategic partner, and being their top business and technology objectives. It is a clear example of our strategy playing out to our advantage.","Our role as the official network infrastructure supporter for the London Olympics and Paralympics is another example of our ability to strategically partner. In this case with the British government, the London Organizing Committee of the games, NBC and NBT. And to do this, we drove incredible outcomes and experiences.","From a technology perspective, which obviously excites, especially our engineering team, but me as well, the 1,800 Wi-Fi hotspots in the 34 venues and over 80,000 data connections that we provided had a capacity four times larger than the network infrastructure of any previous games and help connect 10 million spectators, 76,000 volunteers; 22,000 athletes and coaches enable and experience in ways before never thought possible.","All of this was done reliably and in a highly secure manner in front of a worldwide TV audience of over 4.2 billion. NBC used Cisco\u2019s software capability and infrastructure to support all the web content, live streaming the equivalent of 7.5 months of 24X7 broadcast across six channels, letting viewers pause live TV while switching between TV, tablets and smartphones. It was a complex challenge, but it\u2019s exactly the type of challenge that Cisco is uniquely positioned to handle. And we executed remarkably well, not just again on the technology objective, but on the business objectives of our partners. Congratulations to the Cisco team and our partners for a job done very well.","There is no question our industry and our world is evolving at a lighting pace. The network is squarely at the center of the major market transitions; cloud, mobile, visual, virtual and social, and our innovation engine continues to fuel our growth, our customers\u2019 success and our industry leadership.","Our disciplined focus on our operating model and our company\u2019s ongoing evolution enable us to continue to deliver record customer and partner satisfaction levels, and drive leverage in our financial model.","As we move into FY \u201813, our focus on profitable growth continues and we remain committed to driving shareholder value. To provide some important update, along with our FY \u201812 and Q4 results, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Frank.","I will then walk through what we\u2019re seeing in the business and where we\u2019re focusing going forward. Frank would detail our guidance and then we\u2019ll wrap up with my favorite part the Q&A. Frank on to you.","Frank A. Calderoni","Thanks, John, and good afternoon to everyone. For the full 2012 fiscal year, we grew profits safer than revenue as we had committed to do with our operating model of discipline decision-making, down portfolio management, strong operational execution and a focus on driving profitable growth. Through these efforts, we have improved our operating margin leverage increasing our value proposition to shareholders. In my section, all results will be on a year-over-year basis updated.","Starting with the fiscal year performance, for the full year 2012 fiscal year, total revenue was $46.1 billion, an increase of 7%. non-GAAP net income was $10.0 billion, up 11%. non-GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis were $1.85, which grew 14%.","GAAP net income was $8 billion or $1.49 per share on a fully diluted basis, representing increases of 24% and 27% respectively. We generated strong free cash flow, meaning cash flow from operations activity, less capital expenditures during FY \u201812 of $10.4 billion, increasing 16%.","Given the stabilization, we\u2019ve seen in our business and our confidence going forward, along with the ongoing commitment to returning cash to our shareholders, I am pleased to announce that we are increasing our quarterly dividend for Q1, FY \u201813 by 75% to $0.14 per share, which represents a 3.2% yield on today\u2019s share price.","Going forward we intend to our capital allocation strategy to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually to dividend and share repurchases while providing sufficient financial flexibility to effectively invest in the business and strategic opportunities.","To provide some additional detail on revenue and profitability for certain product areas for the full fiscal year. Starting with switching; switching revenue was up 3% in particular we are pleased to see stability in our switching gross margins, as an example of what we are achieving with our newer product as they ramp, we\u2019ve seen the gross margin levels with our Nexus 7000 improved approximately 10 points over the past eight quarters.","Routing revenue grew 2%, the transition to our new platforms is going very well with the market shift from wireline to wireless providing us with a true competitive advantage. Collaboration revenue was up 3% FY '12 was the year of transition from a go-to-market perspective with increasing SaaS and software-based offering, which now represents approximately 50% of our overall collaboration business.","Wireless had a very strong year with revenue up 19% with continued wireless LAN upgrades and deployments driving strong growth. Security revenue was up 12% reflecting the growing requirements of security and cloud, as well as BYOD deployment.","In our data center business had strong growth with revenues up 87%, we continue to execute on our data center strategy by staying on top of innovation as well as delivering a convert stock architectural approach for our customers to meet their networking as well as their computing requirement.","Now moving on to our Q4 results, we had a solid quarter, total revenue in Q4 was $11.7 billion, up 4%; total product revenue was $9.2 billion, up approximately 3%, and services revenue was $2.5 billion, up approximately 12%.","Total revenue from a geographic perspective grew 7% for Americas, 9% for APJC and decreased 5% for EMEA. The decrease in EMEA was driven by a decrease in product revenue consistent with the macroeconomic related weakness that we\u2019ve seen in product orders over the past two quarters driven largely by weakness in Southern and Central Europe.","Total product book-to-bill for Q4 was comfortably above one and in line with normal Q4 seasonality. Q4 FY \u201812 total non-GAAP gross margin was 61.9%, down 1.2 percentage points quarter-over-quarter and down 0.8% on a year-on-year basis.","Non-GAAP product gross margin for the fourth quarter was 60.4%, a decrease of 1.6 percentage points quarter-over-quarter. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily driven by pricing, product mix, driven by strength in our data center business and to a lesser degree higher overall manufacturing costs due to higher warranty expense.","Our non-GAAP service margin for the fourth quarter was 67.1%, that was flat quarter-over-quarter and down 1.5 percentage points year-over-year. Total non-GAAP gross margin by geographic region was 62.7% for Americas, 61.6% for EMEA, and 69.6% for APJC. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, Americas was flat, while EMEA decreased 2.3 percentage points and APJC decreased 3.7 percentage points.","As a reminder, the APJC revenue benefited in Q3 from the completion of several large multiyear projects that we discussed from last quarter\u2019s call, which did have favorable margin impact in Q3. The margin decrease was also driven by a mix related to strengthen our data center as well as SP Video and higher manufacturing costs.","Non-GAAP operating expenses were 34.4% of revenue, approximately $4 billion in Q4 FY \u201812 and that was approximately flat as compared to the previous quarter. We recognize pretax charges of $202 million to our GAAP operating expenses primarily related to the intended sale of real estate consistent with our ongoing efforts to optimize our real estate portfolio and our restructuring activities.","Our non-GAAP operating income was $3.2 billion, 27.5% of revenue for Q4 and grew 14% consistent with our strategic financial goal of growing profits faster than revenue. We will continue to target non-GAAP operating margin consistent with our focus on balancing investments between gross margin as well as operating expense.","Our headcount at the end of Q4 totaled 66,639. That was up approximately 14,100 quarter-over-quarter. The additions are strategic including approximately 500 new university graduates, who were hired in Q4 mostly in engineering to approximately 300 additional hires in R&D and growth areas such as data center and approximately 330 in services to fulfill customer contracts.","From a geographic perspective, over half of the headcount added this past quarter were in emerging markets and other growth markets. We routinely review our business to determine where we need to align investments based on growth opportunities. Additionally, we continue to evaluate our organizational structure as part of our plan to drive simplicity, speed of decisions, as well as agility across Cisco. If we decide to exit or reduce investments in a business, we will have to make associated decisions that could impact our workforce.","Our Q4 FY \u201812 non-GAAP tax provision rate was 21.7%. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $2.5 billion, which represented an increase of 15%. As a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP net income was 21.6%. Non-GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for the fourth quarter was $0.47 versus $0.40 in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, which was an increase of 18%.","GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $1.9 billion as compared to $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, an increase of 56% year-over-year. GAAP net earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for the fourth quarter was $0.36 versus $0.22 per share in the same quarter of fiscal 2011, which was an increase of 64%.","The total of cash, cash equivalents and investments at quarter end was $48.7 billion, up $304 million from last quarter. Of this total balance, approximately $6.2 billion was available in the U.S. at the end of the quarter. Our cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter was approximately $3.1 billion.","During Q4, we did repurchase $1.8 billion of common stock under the share repurchase program of 108 million shares at an average price of $16.62 per share. A dividend payment of $425 million representing $0.08 per share was also declared and paid during the quarter. Product backlog at the end of fiscal 2012 was approximately $5 billion as compared to approximately $4.5 billion at the end of fiscal 2011.","Now, let me turn the call over to John for additional color on the quarter. John?","John T. Chambers","Frank, thank you very much. I'll now provide a more detailed discussion of the market and our five foundational priority areas in terms of revenues followed by then by discussion on geographic and customer segments and that discussion will be in terms of orders or what we internally refer to as bookings. The following foundational priority results are shared in terms of the year-over-year revenue growth for Q4 unless otherwise stated.","First, our core business, we continue to feel very good about our performance in our core markets, routing, switching, wireless and security. We continue to perform well in routing growing revenues 4% year-over-year while many of our peers are experiencing negative growth and sometimes negative growth in double digits. As you would expect, current industry analysts show our market share gains in both SP Core and Edge routing to be up dramatically year-over-year. We saw strong performance in mobility with ASR 5K up 67% and in the edge with ASR non-K up 97%.","We continue to do a good job of maintaining our access routing market share of approximately 85% with slight fluctuations up and down each quarter. Optical was down 20%. CapEx budgets will continue to be challenged in the current environment, especially European Series Routers and government in the developed world. With the strength of our portfolio, alignment of our priorities with our customer\u2019s priority and our architectural approach we believe we can continue to grow our shares spend in our key customer accounts with service providers being perhaps the best example from a customer segment perspective.","Now, moving on switching, overall switching revenues flat this quarter at $3.6 billion, with fixed switching up 3% and modular switching down 7%. Within the fixed switching, our Nexus 2 and Nexus 5K switching had another good quarter and was up more than 24% year-over-year due in part to strong data center build outs.","From a modular switching perspective, our Nexus 7000 (inaudible) strong growth, up approximately 13% in Q4. Our corresponding Cat6K decline reflects the product transitions to the Nexus 2, 3, 5 and 7K as planned. A number of factors have driven the strong demand including the gig Ethernet 10G transition with the 10G port shipments growing 54%, and solid momentum in the top 10 MSDCs were full-year FY \u201912 growth was 38% year-over-year.","The most recent quarterly industry LANE switching market share estimates are in line with our goals of 70% revenue and 50% (inaudible) in terms of market share, reflecting our continued competitive stands in this market. Our wireless business is very strong, growing 22% in Q4, with mobility driving one of the biggest market transitions in the industry.","With new products such as our flagship AP 3600 being well received with sequential order growth that is quarter-to-quarter \u2013 order growth of over 100%. In addition to the growth in enterprise and commercial segments, a number of large service provider Wi-Fi Deployments are now in full swing, driven by the ability to retain and attract customers with a bundled Wi-Fi offering.","Security grew 8% with growth of 15% in network security and 10% decline in content security. Network security growth was fueled by our high-end parallel offerings and product transitions to the data center systems and solutions in a day-to-day service engine, what we call [eyes] internally. I believe we have the right leaders and the right strategy to lead in security market and expect to continue to invest and execute here.","Transitions like the move to could-based delivery models and transitions to bring you in device, play to our strength and we plan to continue to capitalize on these opportunities especially in the security space.","Now moving on to the data center. Data center performance was extremely strong with overall data center revenue coming at 90% in Q4, up more than 42% from Q3 with year-over-year UCS order growth that is booking growing 58%, driven by the Romney Transition, seasonality trends and Cisco\u2019s compelling unified data center value proposition. The innovation we\u2019re driving and our traction in the data center is truly incredible, as measured on with every scale, revenue growth, market share and customer mind share. Our ability to move first in this market transition to unified compute, storage and networking and deliver on long-term ongoing innovation around unified fabric, unified compute and unified management has helped solidify our position as a leader in the next generation data centers.","Our approach to the data center has always been based upon open architecture and ecosystem of partners, proven solutions such as Vblock with VMware and EMC, FlexPod, with NetApp, the Exxon with Citrix and Private Cloud with Microsoft, have seen significant traction in the market and we expect we\u2019ll remain a key driver of our strategy going forward.","Momentum with VCE continues to be very strong. we saw continued traction in enterprise data centers and cloud service providers, both with new customers and existing customers going to our footprint. With strong demand growth in the second quarter, VCE continues to achieve our expectation that again, is our partnership with VMware and EMC with order growth in the most recent quarter of approximately 58% year-over-year.","An area that many of you\u2019ve asked us to discuss is our view and the focus on software defined data centers and specifically the effect on our strategy as it relates to networking. Our major discussion is around evolving networks to be more programmable, more virtual and more flexible. Make no mistake about it, our goal is to lead this evolution along with our partners and I would point to three advantages that we have in this marketplace.","First, customers understand that optimizing for the hardware and software combination to drive consistent experience, policy, quality of service, security and mobility, is the only way in our opinion to meet their total cost of ownership, reliability and scalability requirements. They want their networking vendor to deliver an evolutionary and also a comprehensive approach.","Second, we have a complete framework. Across the group folios it addresses all the elements of network virtualization. We\u2019ve recently announced an initial set of techniques under the Cisco open network environment umbrella called Cisco ONE. The customer and partner reception has been very positive and we have a quite a bit more of our sleeve as you\u2019d expect in this area.","Third, our global market presence gives us a unique clearance in the customer requirements, which helps us ensure our innovation engine is ahead of the market. Cisco pioneered network virtualization in 2009, when we introduced the Nexus 1000V, the first virtualized switch. Today, while our startups in this space can generally count their production customers on at most two hands, Cisco has more than 6,000 Nexus 1000V production customers using the distributed virtual networks to deliver highly secure, multi-tenant data center environment.","We have been driving the future of the data center for a number of years now, together with our strategic partners whether it is EMC, VMware, Microsoft, IBM, NetApp, Citrix, Intel and many others, our open approach is driving innovation and unique customer value. To be clear, we will continue to utilize our unmatched expertise in this evolution of the network and build band partner. As we've always done to drive network leadership for generations to come and the while we view this positive business driver for us going forward, it is also important to realize this evolution will play out over many years in the future.","Now, let me move on to collaboration. Collaboration declined 8% to $992 million in the most recent quarter. The decline is driven primarily by decrease in teleprinter sales due largely to challenges in the public sector, which were down year-over-year almost 30% in the European markets, which were down in terms of telepresence in the mid-30s as well.","We did see the launch of our new TX9000 immersive system gained solid acceptance in the first quarter. We believe that the move to post-PC World will be a driver of our business going forward, and placed our advantage. It also enables our evolution to a new business models and greater mix of software and software-as-a-service.","Let me just give you a couple of quick points on this. Our Jabber software application that enables instant messaging conferencing, voice and telepresence video to multiple devices across most major operating systems has gained significant traction increasing 55% in license volume, Cisco WebEx increased again in this quarter solidly on a global basis.","In our new enterprise, licensing agreements are off to a strong start with key U.S. enterprise customers. We believe strongly that an open architecture that enables communication at any device to any other is one of the top productivity drivers for this decade.","Now, let me move on to video. After three quarters in a row of comfortable double-digit growth, SP Video declined by 2% in Q4. Lower CMPS shipments were partially offset by growth in IP set top boxes where we continue to gain market share and cable modem.","As we began to think about this market move into the cloud, we see more software content and potentially more profitable growth opportunities. The NDF deal that we just closed will enable us to achieve these goals at a faster pace than we would have been able to do on our own. [Almost] without exception and I learn Rob can think of one, our customers understand that NDS bring Cisco at a much faster pace into the higher end of their business models.","A combination of data center, cloud, software combined with our capabilities and knowledge of video positions us very well for the future. The timing could not have been better in terms of what\u2019s going on in the market and I would like to take full credit for that, however this just happened to be how the market and our peers in the events of all together. Bottom line, so far, so very good.","When you think about what NDF does for us, their software and the services model should accelerate the delivery of Videoscape, a key component of our SP video strategy. With NDS, we have the opportunity to transform the way the next generation video is delivered to consumers worldwide. We believe our customers clearly appreciate the value of NDS to the Cisco portfolio and we look forward to delivering highly differentiated opportunities together.","NDS also has a strong recurring revenue stream as its primary source of revenue and is expected to help accelerate our evolutions of this business to more of a recurring revenue base both in the video, but in the other segments of our business as well.","Well, Frank will provide more details on the transition. I would be thrilled and I want to thank and welcome personally the NDF team on behalf of all the Cisco leadership team to the Cisco family.","Finally, our architectural approach in focused on delivering solutions has cemented our role as a strategic business partner with our customers worldwide. While we often discuss the innovation in our products, the innovation we are driving in our services solution and integrated architecture is as equally as impressive and fundamental.","Services which are a key ingredient to our move into solutions, and integrated architecture was up 12% this quarter, with particular strength in advanced services growing to 24%. Cisco's smart services and offering that navigates us the intelligence from Cisco's 50 plus million devices and customer connections to protect and optimize network investment, grew FY \u201812 orders by over 240%. And as a good example of an innovative offering fueling our services growth and attractive business model for Cisco and for our partners.","We are very pleased with our progress to date across almost the entire company. There are areas for continued focus and improvement and execution. And this is where I am asking you Gary to take the lead for us, you have done a tremendous job this last year and we just want to keep it going.","In summary, I am pleased with the innovation and differentiation we are driving across the business. I will now move on to provide some color on the geographic and customer segments, the following geographic and customer segment growth rates are in terms of year-over-year product orders for Q4 unless specified otherwise. In Q4, Cisco's total product orders grew approximately 2% year-over-year. I want to remind you that both the comparable Q4 of FY \u201811 and also the quarter we are now entering Q1 FY \u201812 where very strong year-over-year order quarters averaging comfortably into double-digits and therefore we will make the toughest year-over-year comps in terms of orders we will face for the next fiscal year and that this Q4 we just reporting and in Q1 for next year.","Looking at the numbers from a geographic perspective, specifically the Americas products grew orders by 4%. We saw the U.S. slightly stronger with Canada and Latin America both down. We first signal slowing of the market almost 15 months ago, the initial indicators of the slowdown occurred first in the U.S. state and local government followed by large, large global enterprise accounts, then general enterprise accounts in the U.S. then U.S. Federal and then into the commercial marketplace.","In Q4, with the exception of Federal government, we saw positive growth and\/or uptrend especially in the second half of the quarter. Now I want to say, it is way too early to call this a trend, but if this were to continue through Q1, this would be a solid indicator of potential future market improvement in the U.S.","Just to give you some additional data and I\u2019m going to give you by Q3 and Q4 order trends in the U.S. The following is a summary of the U.S. performance in those areas. U.S. state and local government grew 7% in Q3 and 17% in Q4, I\u2019d remind you 15 months that was the first one that really slowed dramatically.","GET and our largest 29 enterprise accounts declined in double-digits in Q3 and increased in double-digits in Q4. Those are our global enterprise accounts again in the theater. While U.S. enterprise grew 1% in Q3, it grew 4% in Q4. U.S. commercial for Q3 was 6% and for Q4 it was 7%. As expected our U.S. Federal business declined in both quarters with minus 8% decline in Q3 and minus 11% decline in Q4.","In Europe, Middle-East and Africa and in Russia region product orders were down 6%. The primary weakness was across all sections of Europe with most of customers not foreseen improvement in the near future. The UK was down 13%, Germany was down 4%, France was down 12%, Italy was down 24%, Europe not including emerging markets and EMEA and Russia represent approximately 19% of our company\u2019s business. Public sector in Europe was down 13%, social (inaudible) was down 15%, enterprise on the other hand was up 2% and commercial was flat.","On the positive side, our emerging markets in EMEA grew 12% with Russia up 12%. Emerging markets represents about 23% of EMEA to total business. Asia-Pacific, Japan and China are, their theater, of the three regions, it grew the fastest at 12%. We expected this growth in APJC and they delivered, and I want to congratulate (inaudible) and that and also how they\u2019re going into the new role.","There was also a nice rebound following Q3 growth of 7% up to 12% in Q4. China had a strong quarter up 17%, Japan which has been very solid all year was up 12%, Australia up over 13% and India flat. We continue to see India challenged largely self-inflicted by their own internal issues, but getting back to flat growth after multiple quarters of double-digit negative growth was encouraging. As many of you may be aware, we recently promoted (inaudible) run the APCJC region from sales operations to head up our global services business reporting to Gary Moore.","We are deliberately moving away, moving many of our high potential leaders at all levels within the company to new functions in the business as opposed to just promoting within a functional silo to provide the expediencies and the prospective that our customers and shareholders expect future leaders at Cisco.","Now, moving on to a customer market view, enterprise global grew at 6% in Q4 versus Q3 minus 1%. While we were glad to see some (inaudible) at the enterprise, we remain conservative and cautious in our expectations given the uncertainty remaining in the macroenvironment.","Commercial on a global basis grew 4%, but the U.S. as I said earlier continue to be very solid, which is 7% growth year-over-year. Service provider declined 1%, again I\u2019d like to just share with you the data that in Q4 FY \u201811, we saw 19% growth, so some really some tough comps this quarter. In Q1 of this year, we saw growth of 16% and Q2 of fiscal year 12 growth of 12%. We will currently have some challenging comps in these three quarters and FY \u201813 and Q4 of last year.","Despite the decline in orders this quarter, we believe we\u2019ve gained more than our share available market, and we believe this will be seen in share increases in the SP market. For the year, our service provider business grew 8%. Public sector in total global was up 1% for the year \u2013 1% for Q4 and was up 3% for the year.","We have always been able to control and [roughly] adjust both opportunities and possible challenges in the marketplace, this is a core strength. We will always have strategic partners with whom we believe partnering complete our commitment to open standards and to any to any positions as incredibly well to navigate through the changing industry dynamics. We've done this successfully for decades, and we feel very comfortable with our ability to control our own destiny.","And thinking about our guidance for Q1 FY '13, which Frank will give you in a moment here are the top things on my mind. First, from a challenges perspective, we are modeling Europe to continue to be very challenging over the several quarters. Second challenge global public spending will also continue to be challenge especially in the U.S. Federal Government and European government. And third, many of our customers continue to anticipate a challenging next 12 months on a global basis, and therefore these CEO will remain conservative both in their IT expenditures but also when they\u2019re hiring.","However we\u2019re also seeing a number of potential drivers for growth and balance to these challenges. First, our solid position in commercial accounts, and the strength of our channels, which Rob, we never should underestimate, how key that is for us. Second, Cloud and our ability to expand both our products and architectural wins in the data center, which grew this last quarter comfortably about 50%. Third, Cisco\u2019s expanding value with both traditional and new service providers and new partners in this area, especially in the growth areas such as cloud, video, mobility, open architecture, and hosted UC at a time when many of our competitors in the service provider marketing are really struggling.","Fourth, emerging countries, which represents about 20% of our business, and yet approximately 50% of the world\u2019s global GDP, while we are pleased with our progress in many of our top emerging countries, we believe we can do even better. Starting with the alignment of more resources to the emerging country opportunities, which Frank, he talked about earlier in terms of our headcount changes with 700 to the 1,400 going to emerging countries.","Fifth, while we are very strong in the enterprise marketplace. we think we can do even better with the appropriate caveats in our technology and business architecture approach to their leading accounts, in many ways taking our enterprise strength to the next level by replicating key parts of our success is in the service provider market.","Finally, we believe our continued profitable growth in leadership and services positioned us very well with the foundational base for future growth and profitability. We all understand the uncertainties in the macroenvironment, so as you would expect, we will focus on what we can control and influence with particular emphasis on gaining share of wallet and profitable market share leadership, managing tight expense control and enhancing shareholder value.","Frank, let me move on to you for Q4 guidance.","Frank A. Calderoni","","Thanks, John. I would like to remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements and you should review our recent SEC filings that do identify important risk factors and understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. The guidance is based on the current pipeline and our view of business trends based upon the information that we have available today and of course the actual results could be above or below our guidance.","The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with the reconciliation to GAAP. I will first provide guidance excluding the recently closed acquisition of NDS and then conclude with the guidance that does include NDS. So looking forward, we are placing our guidance on neither a significant improvement nor a deterioration in global macroeconomic conditions in the near future.","We expect Q1 revenue growth to be in the range of 2% to 4% on a year-over-year basis. As we have said in the past, forecasting gross margin has always been challenging due to various factors such as volume, mix, cost savings as well as competitive pricing pressure. So for the first quarter of FY \u201913, we anticipate non-GAAP gross margins to be in the range of 61% to 62%.","Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 is expected to be in the range of 26.5% to 27.5%, which is up approximately 0.4 to 1.4 points over Q1 FY \u201912. Our non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be approximately 22% in the first quarter.","Our Q1 FY \u201913 non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.45 to $0.47 per share, which is up approximately 5% to 9% year-over-year consistent with our goal of delivering profitable growth.","As we announced earlier this month, we have closed our acquisition of NDS, as with any acquisitions there will be adjustments to NDS\u2019 historical financial reporting as we can form NDS to Cisco\u2019s accounting policies.","The primary changes impacting the NDS income statements are write-down of deferred revenue as part of the purchase accounting adjustments, conformance to Cisco revenue recognition policies resulting in increased deferrals of revenue impacting the timing of the revenue recognition, as well as the classification adjustments that will increase NDS\u2019 cost of goods sold and reduce operating expense.","The classification adjustment is related to a portion of NDS\u2019 technology and development costs, which relate to the customization and integration of NDS\u2019 software or specific customers. As the costs are customer specific, our policies require their classification at cost of goods sold. This will have no impact on the overall profitability, but will impact the NDS standalone gross margin percentage and will be approximately neutral to Cisco\u2019s gross margin percentage over FY \u201913.","In addition to these financial adjustments, there will be integration cost for the first one to two year. We expect the full-year FY \u201913 impact of the acquisition to be approximately $1 billion to $1.1 billion in revenue and accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $0.03 and in the second half of the year, this fiscal year, now we expect that benefit to increase over time.","In Q1 FY \u201913, there will be minimal operating income contribution because of the accounting items referenced above and the integration costs. All NDS revenue will be classified as product and included within the service provider video category in our financial reporting.","In Q1, we are anticipating the NDS revenue to be approximately $200 million. We expect Q1 revenue growth including NDS, which is from a total company perspective to be in the range of 4% to 6% on a year-over-year basis.","For the first quarter of FY \u201913, we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin including NDF again total company, to be in the range of 61% to 62%. Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 including NDS is expected to be in the range of 26.0% to 27.0%.","Our non-GAAP tax provision rate including NDS is expected to be approximately 22% in the first quarter and our Q1 FY \u201913 non-GAAP earnings per share including NDS again total company, is expected to be in the range of $0.45 to $0.47 earnings per share, which is up approximately 5% to 9% year-over-year.","We anticipate our GAAP earnings in Q1 will be $0.09 to $0.13 per share lower than the non-GAAP EPS. This range includes our typical adjustments as well as any impact of up to $0.02 as a result of our anticipated restructuring charges.","Other than those quantified items noted above, there are no other significant differences between GAAP and our non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructurings and tax or other events, which may or may not be significant. And as a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through a specific public disclosure.","Related to our July 2011 announcements on restructuring, we have incurred total pre-tax charges of approximately $1 billion to our GAAP financial results to-date. We expect the total restructuring charges to be approximately $1.1 billion, which we will include to the first quarter of fiscal 2013.","This past year, operations excellence was one of our key focus items across the business and we executed as we said we would. This enabled us to continue to move forward on profitable growth in capital return. Our plan is to continue our focus on operational excellence and efficiencies, which we know is important to driving value for our shareholders.","Now I want to thank you again and turn the call back over to John.","John T. Chambers","Frank thank you and well done. As I reflect on FY \u201812, I am very pleased with our execution as a company. We delivered on our commitments to you, our shareholders, to our partners, and to our customers. We changed where we needed to, build around our core products, our channel and services strength, while prioritizing our resources to our five foundational areas. Each of us has a Cisco employee takes pride in our earnings per share growth twice as fast as revenue in FY \u201812.","Our operational discipline and ongoing company evolution is paying off, and the dividend and capital allocation roadmap we outlined today reflect our confidence in our business and our commitment to driving long-term shareholder value. Our products, solutions and innovations are at the heart of major market transitions. We are not just catching, we\u2019re very often driving and leading these transitions. However what is most important to me personally is how we have architecturally tied hardware and software products together to deliver solutions to our customers that achieve their top priorities. And therefore enhance our value to the customers and our ability to achieve premiums in the market and to continue to be among the very best in the industry.","As billions more people and devices come on to the network in coming years, we will be fueling unprecedented innovation, creativity, transformation and opportunity. 15 years ago, we said everything will be connected and ways that were hard to imagine at that time. Today we see the Internet of everything as another driver for our growth and opportunities in coming years.","We always face good competitors and new technology transitions, but our track record of success is among the best in the industry. While our focus will always be on our customers and the major transitions, we are also a company that love to compete.","Our market share position across all of our largest market is the best that I can remember in recent history. And we strongly believe that we are making major gains in share of wallet across many of our top customers. As we look to next quarter, our projections with all the appropriate caveats for revenue growth in 46% is well above that of many of our industry peers. Growing as we have through challenging times reinforces our conviction to capitalize on our expanding growth opportunities when the global economy recovers.","As we look forward to FY \u201813, I want to thank our shareholders, employees, customers and partners for their ongoing commitment, together we will continue to do amazing things and we are committed to managing the company to deliver the value you expect in Cisco.","As a last note, let there be no mistake, we are listening to you, our shareholders the entire company is committed to driving long-term shareholder value creation. Now Mel, I\u2019m going to open up the questions, I want to apologize it\u2019s a little bit long, but trying to do the fiscal year NDS some other transitions and the quarter was a little challenging. Mel?","Question-and-Answer Session","Melissa Selcher","Okay. Thanks John and thanks Frank. Operator, now let's listen to the questions. We still request that qualified analysts please ask only one question. Operator please open the floor.","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Rod Hall with JPMC.","Rod B. Hall \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah, thanks guys for taking my question. I just wanted to clarify on the capital allocation commentary. You guys had originally linked the dividend increase back to the international cash repatriation, and so I wonder John and Frank, may be one or both of you could comment on what the \u2013 if there\u2019s any change in your thinking on the probability of getting any cash back or if you\u2019ve just decided to move on with the dividend even though there\u2019s really no decision made? And then I also wish you guys could clarify a little bit on the macro commentary you made John, because the guidance doesn\u2019t seem, and it\u2019s a little bit weak, it's not terribly weak, but you did say that one of the guys you're talking to are thinking the next 12 months is going to be pretty tough. And I just wonder if you could tell us whether you're seeing them cutting budgets already, or if they\u2019re waiting to take any further actions until you see more evidence in the economy? Thanks.","John T. Chambers","Rod, I'm going to do something that Melissa is going to kick me for. When I answer your two questions, but then I'm going ask all of your colleagues please hold it to one. I'm going to take the easy part of capital allocation and give you the details, Frank as always. And I want to congratulate you Frank, you've been working on this for three quarters, you\u2019ve worked with our finance committee, Board of Directors, we\u2019re waiting for the right time to do this. So I want to just thank you very much. The easy part of the conversation is, no, this is not dependent in any way on repatriation nor are we signaling that. There are a number of leverage that we can pull in this area and putting the leverage together, we believe we\u2019re in good shape to be able to do it with the U.S. case that we will be getting over the next several years. Frank taking the...","Frank A. Calderoni","","John, definitely. So as I mentioned on the call, given the stabilization that we\u2019ve seen in our business, and really on the conference that we\u2019re going forward, and as John just mentioned really just the outreach with listening to shareholders over the past year, and what\u2019s important to all of you and trying to balance both the buyback as well as the dividend, and provide a framework on what we want to do going forward over a multiple years and our commitment to that. And that is really what we outlined today to have a minimum and I trust minimum of 50% of our free cash flow that we will allocate through the combination of the dividend as well as the buyback. When we announced the dividend, we did say we would support the dividend over a longer period of time. And this is just a further verification of that, we\u2019ll continue to support that over time and continue as it\u2019s appropriate to support the buyback as you saw, we had $1.8 billion of buyback in this past quarter. But again it\u2019s the provided framework, we feel comfortable based on the analysis that we\u2019ve done kind of looking out in the near-term as far as managing the U.S. cash, be able to make this commitment and we\u2019ll continue of course to be very strong advocate for Tax Suite form in the future as we work through this.","And taking the second part of your question, I\u2019m going to break it into a couple of parts, first when you look at comparisons and these are both for orders and for revenues and revenues you see slide slightly behind the orders by maybe half quarter or a quarter, Q4 last year in orders was our strongest quarter that we\u2019ve seen Rob, and during the last five quarters, and comfortably in double digits and so was Q1. So when you compare comps if you\u2019re really comparing sequential comps, that number would obviously be a little bit different in terms of what you are looking at, I\u2019ll encourage you to think about the market that way. So in year-over-year numbers these are actually pretty good aggressive numbers in terms of the marketplace especially when almost all of our large peers are forecasting flat to down revenues and many of our competitors are forecasting down dramatically in negative or actually double digit negative growth. So we don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves.","Secondly, Europe, it will be as fast as you are hearing. Europe for us in the last four quarters, if I remember this right and keep me honest Rob, I think it was 13% four quarters ago, then up 7%, then flat and minus 6% this quarter. We can all draw the curve that\u2019s probably going to get tougher before it gets better and that might last for a (inaudible). We\u2019ve got an amazing team in Costa Rica, team over there. So we will get whatever it is to get, but that\u2019s going to be tough.","Through the positive, normally I wouldn\u2019t be real excited or point our interest, but when enterprise was going down from mid to go back up from 1% to 4% in the U.S. was clearly there and while federal government remain tough for several quarters with government spending going up a little bit, again in the 6% level driven by state and local government, now you all know seasonality, seasonality for state and local government was in our last quarter, so it is heavier in terms of total percentage of business in state and local during Q4, where Q1 is much heavier on federal. Federal business is going to be negative and be tough for several quarters as we look out into the future.","But if you watch the trends, we wanted to just sharing with you, we saw in the last 45 days of the quarter, we also have a good book-to-bill, which you saw in terms of our comments going in and I would want to watch it at least another quarter, but I get real excited on it. Latin America was a little bit soft as we said earlier. But overall, we think we\u2019re getting our share of the market and our strategy seems to be winning well. So, [Matt], you got two answers Rod and two questions, and I will keep my answers tighter at Mill. Next question please.","Melissa Selcher","Thanks. I think your next question comes from Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities?","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities.","John T. Chambers","Hi, Jess.","Jess Lubert \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Hi John, thanks for taking my question and congratulations on delivering a solid quarter in a tough environment. I was hoping you could expand upon what you\u2019re hearing from your service provider customers with respect to their second half spending plans, to what degree do you still expect to see second half improvement and to what degree if there\u2019s been a changing your expectations from carrier business, particularly from some of your North American carriers?","John T. Chambers","So, what we\u2019re seeing in the service provider business, this one we believe we\u2019re taking very good share of wallet spend and we got to win that everyday. And as you\u2019d expect, our new \u2013 question was going to be what about the second half of this fiscal year in terms of cap spending? I think AT&T today said that their capital spending in second half of the year would be up over the first half of the year, that\u2019s what we were expecting from them.","If mixed across the U.S., I don\u2019t believe there is a flesh going to occur in terms of dramatic differences, second half of the year versus the first half. Asia-Pacific, we\u2019re modeling pretty solid, and I think, [it\u2019s already] done there, and what we see in Japan and in China and now started in India finally Rob. We are in good shape on, and we\u2019ve done very well in Australia and in Korea already. That looks solid, we\u2019ll get our share spin there. Balancing that, however, is very tough comps, because service provider had very tough comps in Q4 and Q1, and two of this last year. so that kind of, I think balances a little bit of what you\u2019re seeing momentum wise, European service providers especially the large, what we call the large five or six are going to not be spending much in the second half of the year when compared to people what they might have thought six months ago.","Most of them are going to be very conservative in our opinion over the next two quarters. And we\u2019ll get our share spin there and share of wallet and again, with that [one interest] there, I think would do well versus what\u2019s available, we\u2019re modeling that a little bit tougher. So overall, in service providers, we\u2019re positioned extremely well, balanced dramatically different across the three theaters, and we think we will gain share of wallet as we go forward versus almost all of our peers, especially in the Routing segment, where we were real pleased about how much share we\u2019ve taken. Thank you, Jess.","Melissa Selcher","Okay, thanks, Jess. Next question?","Operator","And your next question comes from Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank.","John T. Chambers","Hey, Brian.","Brian Modoff \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","Hi, John. A question here, obviously you\u2019ve addressed a little bit on SDN, but how do you see Cisco competing with VMware and Nicera in network virtualization? Do you see a need of beep up there? Do you see that have any effect on DCE, or maybe relationships that you have? Can you talk a little bit about that please?","John T. Chambers","Well, when you really think about SDN, I want to be very candid. We think the future is going to be hardware and software combined. we think when you have knowledge of the network, and are able to know what\u2019s going on in the network, you can program to it. You can get dramatically better flexibility, et cetera. Its nice way of saying, we think it\u2019s going to be A6 hardware and software combined.","Secondly, if you watch why we\u2019ve done in this area, we saw virtualization coming early. So it wasn\u2019t like its knock up on us. We went into the virtualization with the Nexus 1000V in 2009, which is exactly who entered the data center market with the UCS and our movement there. So we saw both of these trends coming.","Our view on this SDN OpenFlow in the same type of activity, as you are really looking multiple years out in terms of its impacts one way or the other. And our ability to handle transitions with our partners when it times compete and times partners has been unprecedented in the industry.","So as we look forward, we\u2019re completely saying committed with VCE and our ability to work together. We are looking at the innovation that we can do in our market, and we will have partnerships like what occurs of Microsoft and IBM and Citrix in this area as well. So good growth this last quarter, but if you look at it, we think we will encompasses and really an architectural play pretty aggressively. Rob, would you add anything to that?","Robert Lloyd","Just John that we obviously expect to leverage the strength of our install base, which is pervasive across the data center, multiple ecosystem players, we\u2019re going to support multiple hypervisors, multiple applications and operating systems. So we\u2019ve got that working underway in every area. And we can\u2019t forget some of the innovation we got going both inside and outside the company.","John T. Chambers","Just want to add, with VMware and EMC, it\u2019s been a very strong partnership. We\u2019ve both benefited greatly from it. They candidly need us and we like very much being a partner with them. So, I think you\u2019ll see us worked this out in terms of our direction. But we are going to be an open player, and we\u2019ve shown in the marketplace when we compete, we can be really very tough. Thanks, Brian.","Melissa Selcher","Thanks, Brian. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Hi, thank you very much. Just wanted to ask a question about product gross margin, I think you said it was 60.4%, which is the lowest it\u2019s been in quite sometime and I think one of the drivers you said it was pricing. So if you can just give us a few more examples of what areas you\u2019re seeing pricing be a factor in particular? And then also on a go forward basis, can you comment on how you see product growth margins, especially now that they include NDS?","Frank A. Calderoni","","Okay, Simona. If you look at where we are going, the pricing on a global basis has not changed, I don\u2019t think materially in the last one to two quarters. Those people who come and ask about price and unbelievably aggressive pricing at our bids. We are now learning how to compete very effectively against and our comfort level in competing not with our traditional players in the marketplace, some of whom \u2013 some people had concerns 12 to 18 months ago. But taking on Huawei and others, we are getting very good on doing.","So, on a global basis we do not have normal pricing in any area. Anytime you win large deals in emerging markets such as China and India, especially, in service providers, those have tighter gross margins and clearly you saw us win some of those these quarters. So I would not say that it\u2019s an unusual pricing environment, you just see time certain pressures based upon size, bids and also geographic issues, mix is probably something that I watch more and it was a positive mix when you have 90% growth with UCS and the Nexus. And well, the two together are clearly better than our server margins, it brings us down a little bit in terms of the direction. Frank, what would you add to that?","Frank A. Calderoni","Yeah, John. So we gave guidance for the quarter, for Q4, 61% to 62% came in at the high-end of that 61.9% overall at our product margin. As you said from a pricing standpoint, the pricing has been so stable now going on about two years, if you look at it from a quarter-on-quarter standpoint in the range of what we had expected. Yes, we did have a mix impact as you mentioned primarily from data center strength, which was positive. We also had a manufacturing cost was higher in this quarter driven by warranty costs. If you would kind of just normalize that Warranty Plus and Warranty Plus do kind of come up and down from quarter to quarter and you look at the margins going back, fairly consistent I would say from that perspective. And Simona, it\u2019s been \u2013 also a good thing as far as going forward, similar to what we\u2019ve done this past year, tremendous amount of focus on gross margins.","We have now incentives across the board from a leadership standpoint in the sales regions as well as in our business groups that are focused on profitability, which has been driving a lot of the emphasis on project like value engineering, which we saw great improvement on this past year and which we now going to see some further leverage as we move into FY \u201913 and we\u2019ve been investing more in FY \u201913 to see that continue as we move in to FY \u201914.","So many initiatives continue on the margin. And then I would say, as far as the guidance that we gave today for Q1, consistent guidance, 61% to 62% overall, which I would say, if you look at it from even a product standpoint, fairly consistent from a quarter-on-quarter standpoint, when you take into consideration the items that I mentioned.","John T. Chambers","","Gary, you\u2019ve been driving for us more discipline and really focus on profitability and value added engineering and even how we measure each of leaders in terms of profitability, maybe you can just spend a little bit of time on trends here and how that\u2019s going to help us in the margin picture over the next year?","Gary Moore","Yeah, John. So as Frank pointed out, when we started the transformation work last October, we invested more money in value engineering, which goes beyond just value engineering, it\u2019s value design. So bringing together the engineering teams with the procurement teams as well as the overall supply chain team has really driven value and Frank and I set targets for them. They hit the targets, which we thought we set pretty aggressive targets. And that\u2019s just one area where we think we have leverage to continue to drive the efficiency and effectiveness to drive profitability higher and certainly higher than revenue as we go forward.","John T. Chambers","Frank, I want to particularly thank [Ian Collard] and Kelly in how well they worked on your team, maybe you\u2019re interfacing to engineering and manufacturing and making me well here. So it\u2019s amounted to the indirect part of your question, we don't see anything unusual occurring in pricing, or margins, and while it\u2019s always a possibility that's been wrong. We\u2019ve actually been getting more accurate about forecasting that and mix rather than to be worse.","Melissa Selcher","Great, thanks, Simona. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley.","Ehud Gelblum \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hey, guys, thanks. I\u2019m just trying to speak my clarifications to make sure I understood them correctly, and then my real question. On the clarification, Frank, you gave lesser numbers, there were some $10 billion free cash flow last year assuming that\u2019s roughly run rate, 50% payout of that as $5 billion and your new dividend rate will give you roughly about $3 billion a year in dividends. So that would leave about $2 billion for buybacks, you just did $1.8 billion in buybacks this last quarter. So the math that I just went through, almost I did it wrong, I just want to understand if I did do it wrong.","Frank A. Calderoni","","We\u2019re going to count there is a question\u2026","Melissa Selcher","No, no.","Ehud Gelblum \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Let me ask my other question. My other question \u2013 I can throw that out there, and you can answer it any other time, because it would imply that, buybacks are going down. My other question really is when you look at your product order growth, it has now gone for the last couple of years where we have easier comps and your product order growth accelerates, and then you hit the tough comps, and your product order growth starts to decelerate for the last couple of quarters, I have it going down a few quarters in a row.","Are we in a world right now where product order growth accelerates for year that has easy comps and tough comps and decelerates and hit the easy comps and accelerates and that's kind of the pattern as we just kind of anniversary back and forth, or do you envision away, I know you\u2019ve structured the company in a way that we can actually have a multi-year order growth reacceleration, because something breaks out of them hold, or something else takes hold?","John T. Chambers","Okay. So on the question, we deliberately word it as a minimum of 50% of CapEx going into that. you\u2019re going to see us be aggressive, bit of opportunistic and predictability, we wanted to get the dividend to allow all that the shareholders clearly understood we\u2019re committed to and if we do our job right at the right times we\u2019re committed to raising. We also have been aggressive in share buybacks, and you continue to see us we\u2019re appropriate to do that. So I was kind of thinking about the question, my sense of humor is getting better here or at least I think it is, Frank, would you add anything to that?","Frank A. Calderoni","I know that\u2019s true, and then I wanted to stress that, because it\u2019s the framework of the multiple years, and it\u2019s also to set a minimum, so that you can expect us to at least get to the minimum. The other thing I just want to add the question was answered before, as far as when you look at U.S. cash and the question that came up on the tax rate. One thing to add that we factored in especially when you look at it in the near-term let\u2019s say over the next year or year and a half. One of the other factors that does give us a little bit more flexibility from U.S. cash position as we periodically make some distributions of our cash to U.S. from somewhere our foreign subsidiary earnings, these are some earnings that have been previously taxed by the U.S. so we have a little bit of flexibility there, and that\u2019s also have been factored in as I look at \u2013 or I take into consideration the commitment that we\u2019re making on the 50%. So again, that does add, we had little bit of benefit from that just in this past quarter. if you kind of look at the overall balance sheet and will continue to see some of that in the near-term and will factor that in as far as distributing the cash to the dividend as well as the buybacks.","John T. Chambers","The answer to your question about overall product order growth and how you\u2019re going to see waves like this, lowered not, I hope not, we went through the toughest recession in our lifetime and we went through an European Union issue that has shaken the world\u2019s confidence and yeah, we navigated through those I think pretty well. And if you look at profit growth, which I think all of you have encouraged us to focus on as much or more than the revenue growth, we grew profits last year twice as fast as revenues and that\u2019s non-GAAP profits. GAAP profits actually grew in the 21% and 27% range respectively. So, no, I would not expect this and it\u2019s a lot easier to manage through normal times, but these are two or probably the three toughest economic times that I\u2019ve seen in my lifetime and I think to be growing at the rates we did and gaining market share like we did, I\u2019d have to give the Cisco team pretty good marks.","In terms of are we going to move over time to a more predictable revenue stream, the answer is yes, we do that too fast, you see short-term growth rates dropped. So we got to evolve into that. And so when you see models like NDS in terms of what we do with NDS and keeping their revenue stream and actually using it as the model for the future as opposed to the path that\u2019s been able melt to not have a base behind this. So, we can build this revenue stream as good.","And if you watch what we\u2019ve done with some of our products at multicore EDGE as an example, we\u2019re leaning how to price both on the product itself and then price for software additions and be able to add and bring up gross margins over time. So, you\u2019re beginning to see as we think this through, Gary and team and Rob and team have a lot of work going on to this. And so making that revenue stream a little bit more predictable is the key, making that transition from primarily acquisition to a regular revenue stream over the period of years, we have to do that delicately as you would expect.","So, I had answered your question, I hope not on order growth fluctuations, none of us want to go through the last three years or four years again. And in terms of, do we see our ability to transition through this and became a little bit more predictable, I think we\u2019ve got to, we just have to be careful in the transition. Ehud, I hope that answers the question okay?","Ehud Gelblum \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yeah, and I guess Frank does agree that your sense of humor has been better.","Frank A. Calderoni","","I like your sense of humor.","Melissa Selcher","All right, thanks Ehud. Next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","John T. Chambers","","Hey, Tal.","Tal Liani \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Hi, I also have clarification on the question. So let me just stick with one clarification part. The how much of your cash flow is generated in the U.S. I am trying to reconcile between dividends and buybacks. I assume that buybacks are done also globally when you buy ADRs and convert them, but dividends have to be paid in U.S. dollars, in domestic cash flow generation. So when I do the math of how much cash flow you generate and then deduct the dividends, I'm not left with much for U.S. cash flow to do the buybacks unless most of your buybacks are done overseas. So I'm trying to understand the dynamics of the global use of cash flow from a buyback perspective and from a dividend perspective. Thanks.","Frank A. Calderoni","","So, first of all, if you look at from a buyback and from a dividend perspective, both have to be funded as U.S. cash. As you know, we mentioned we had a U.S. cash balance in the end of the fourth quarter about little over $6 billion and that would be what we'd use for both the dividend as well as the buyback and any other U.S. need that we have, we have to fund out of that. We will continue as far as forecasting what we will generate in U.S. from an operations perspective and work in that flow.","The other aspect as I mentioned just a few minutes ago is probably taking into consideration some previously taxed cash that we have which is outside the United States that we have the potential right now based on our analysis to bring back and use as part of this in the near term. And I have clearly I wouldn\u2019t go out there and make a commitment to a plan or a framework with the 50% commitment if we didn\u2019t have the ability to kind of work through that. But the dividend right now with the increase that we have today would be about $2.8 billion on an annual basis and then the buyback of course does change from quarter-to-quarter, and we\u2019ll have to work that in based on opportunistic as well as just kind of where we can fund that and work that through. But we\u2019ve done extensive planning looking at this based on expected business results, and be able to work this through, and then we'll continue to always look at, as I said before, ways of being a strong aggregate for U.S. tax reform as we go into the next several years, which of course would give us even more flexibility.","Robert Lloyd","","So we are not stepping off that, we think regards of who wins, this is something our country needs to do and we\u2019ll see what we can do as a industry and a business group in the period between the election and the next president becoming in the role. And we all know that there\u2019s one President that\u2019s already committed to supporting this, should he get elected in terms of the changes that need to be made?","In terms of the overall process, it\u2019s more data point, cash from operations was $10.5 billion this year, a year ago it was $10 billion, that\u2019s additional $1.5 that you should begin to think about our models. Lots of levers that Frank can pull, which ones he pulls in which sequence and which ones don\u2019t get pulled, that\u2019s really your call, Frank; I\u2019m very pleased with what you\u2019re doing and making this commitment. Thanks, Tal.","Melissa Selcher","Great. Thanks, Tal. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Sue \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","","Thank you. Gentlemen, if I look at Cisco from a S curve point of view, we went from a growth phase to now a stabilization phase, which results in faster profit growth and higher cash generation, which you\u2019re commendably returning to shareholders. What happens next on the curve, and how do you fund future innovation so that the trajectory of the curve points higher, and can you do that without growing expenses or do you take the approach of exiting certain businesses, and then acquiring higher margin software companies?","Frank A. Calderoni","","","I\u2019m going to take the easier part, which is really talking about growth opportunities. Then Gary, I\u2019m going to ask for you to fill in, in terms of how much we\u2019re freeing up resources to be able to move them both in terms of productivity duplication resources, layers, et cetera, which is what we did in this last change, and move into where the growth is like emerging markets.","In terms of the opportunities, Mark, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll surprise you in a big way, but there are lot more opportunities, we can go after than we can bring down, so we\u2019re going to stay within our five foundational frameworks with mobility and security, any across those, but even within those, when you think about the Internet of things, you begin to think about smart grids, you begin to think about how we do connected industries, how we really put this capability to work and drive video in a big way, each of those are major growth opportunities. And so what we will try do is share with you where we think the growth opportunities will come in normal times, and I think all of us would agree this is not no more anywhere near close to it. GDP growth in the U.S at 1.5% to 2% is anemic, growth in Europe and a full blown recession where every major country in Europe is showing negative year-over-year comps in mid to high single digits that is anemic. What we\u2019ve seen in challenges in Asia, even though we\u2019ve managed through them pretty well have been challenging.","So I think you\u2019re talking about an economic question, I think you\u2019re talking about our ability to move into new markets, and our ability for current core markets to grow, so I think it\u2019s a combination of that. Now however, one thing that we\u2019ve got much more discipline about and Gary, I really want to compliment you, and the whole team, but Rob, you and Frank as well as we\u2019re starting to say, where do we have resources that we are choosing it effectively, how do we realigned that resources with productivity implications, how do we move into emerging markets effectively, how do we not have duplication of efforts across the board, so Gary, your thoughts.","Gary B. Moore","","Yeah, so Mark, we wouldn\u2019t make the commitments that we\u2019ve made, if we didn\u2019t feel very confident that we still have operating leverage to bring to bear here. I think we\u2019re much more confident than we were a year ago about our disciplined focus approach, I think as the business is being well managed, you wouldn\u2019t see the results we achieved in Q4 or for that matter FY \u201812, if we want it. But we still have a number of transformational things going on that drive revenue, reduce expense and make us more efficient.","So without going into detail in every one of those, we\u2019re very confident that we still have almost 1,000 full time equivalents working on these programs to look at things. And what you don\u2019t see is, during the last several quarters, internally we\u2019ve also realigned 1,000 people, every quarter to the priority.","So if you think about what sales is doing, if you think about what engineering is doing, services and the rest of the business, we\u2019re putting our best people where the greatest opportunity is, and we\u2019re putting our resources where we have significant opportunity.","John T. Chambers","","Rob, could you expand a little bit just to get market feeling, for example what you\u2019ve done in sales, and how began to share the common resources, take players out, move resources to where the emerging markets are, et cetera?","Robert Lloyd","","Sure, John. We\u2019re now a full year into creating these three regions with the vast majority of our go-to-market sales resources all under one of those three leaders. You can see right now that as the opportunities in emerging markets exists, we\u2019re shifting investments and resources into emerging markets, and out of some of our slower markets in Europe, you can that we can prioritize architectures and investments across the board.","So the idea of creating that very simplified operating model with the vast majority of our resources is allowing those regional teams to actually move much more quickly, and we can see that in some of the results.","John T. Chambers","","Yeah, what\u2019s been exciting Rob, as you\u2019ve done this, and when I look to your regional leaders in the eye, and your key VPs and Senior VPs and say how much effect this is going to have on the business, they\u2019ve been in unanimous agreement, almost none, it will actually accelerate business overtime in terms of the direction.","So just giving you a feel Mark, we clearly understand the question you\u2019re asking both directly and indirectly. We think we\u2019re going to be even more disciplined and focused and we also think that, I always believe and hope this is not the market we\u2019re in for the next ten years with the current slowness.","Melissa Selcher","","Great. Thanks. Next question, please?","Operator","And your next question comes from Grady Burkett with Morningstar.","Grady Burkett \u2013 Morningstar, Inc.","Yeah, thanks a lot for taking my questions. Looking at security, it looks like we\u2019ve seen six quarters of sequential growth in this business. And it seems like the business is kind of turned the corner. Can you talk about what\u2019s working in our business and what kind of things you can do to maybe start taking share and drive growth little faster?","John T. Chambers","Okay. If you watch what has happened in security, I think it\u2019s a combination of issues. It\u2019s been one that we\u2019ve always felt architecturally could go across all of our products and time together in a unique way that no one else in the industry can replicate and our customers (inaudible) how to do that.","Second, we made some changes in the leadership there and I just want to congratulate Chris Young and the team that they are bringing together. We\u2019ve got leadership teams we really believe in. Third, the way Gary structured engineering, we\u2019re now moving much more effectively and crisply across the groups to say when we say, we\u2019re going to go after securities, this is what we expect each one and each group to be able to do. I like their plans and directions and Gary may surprise you, but (inaudible) Chris let me to meet the other end. I think this is one that we can do a lot better growth on but it can be the best example of how we tie it all together.","So I like the movement, as you saw we got our growth primarily in network security, farewells et cetera on that. We got to expand that and get an architectural plays to move forward. Thanks Grady.","Melissa Selcher","Thanks Grady. Next question please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sanjiv Wadhwani with Stifel Nicolaus.","Sanjiv Wadhwani \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.","","Thanks. John, I wanted to take another crack at the order growth situation. I understand that year-over-year comps are tough, but just going through the other metrics you\u2019ve given which is your backlog is up I think 11% year-on-year, your book to bill is comfortably above one. But your order growth is still about 2%. So just trying to see if there is anything we can go through to help us explain sort of the disconnect over there?","John T. Chambers","","Well, as you will see in our Q report, our backlog is up about $500 million versus last year. We clearly went out of this year with a good backlog, which is what you want in all Q4\u2019s, because our orders come in very back-end loaded. In Q1, as you know, the order rate was \u2013 it\u2019s always off dramatically versus Q4 even doing double-digit growth years.","In terms of the comps, the comps are tough when you have 12% or 13% growth in a quarter, and you compare with the next year to that, the comps in quarters where you only have 2% or 3% growth i.e. Q3 and Q4 this next year are lot different. So just with normal execution you\u2019ll begin to see things balance throughout the year in terms of the comps.","The second issue is, we\u2019re taking share at the present time, and our peers are all almost all at negative or flat growth. So for us to be at 4% to 6% or something, we are pretty pleased out in the industry given the economic challenges involved. I just don\u2019t want to see ahead of this, we are gaining share at the present time, if the economies turn, I\u2019d expect that to do better as they return, but I don\u2019t want to mislead you, Europe is going to get worse before it gets better, and federal government spending is not going to improve in the short-term here in the U.S. So we are focused on share wallet where we want to be one and two years out, and I hope we\u2019ll be apologizing to you a couple quarters out about being conservative. But I think these are pretty candid and aggressive numbers at the present time, especially based on what we\u2019re seeing from our peers.","Melissa Selcher","Great.","John T. Chambers","So I didn\u2019t mind you taking a crack at me second time on Sanjiv, more than fair.","Melissa Selcher","Thanks, Sanjiv. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Credit Suisse.","Paul Silverstein \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yeah. Hi, John. If I could return you all to the margins, two questions. One, Frank, can you quantify price impacts, historically it\u2019s been running about 250 to 300 basis points of degradation a year. I heard the comment that there was nothing extraordinary about pricing, but if you could speak to that. Then a question, related question on operating margin; 34% is the best you have done in terms of OpEx as a percentage of revenue, going back to the telecom bubble days, you got to get back to fiscal 2000, you are at 34.5% now, I heard your comments about further improvement. Can you talk to that 34% benchmark?","","Frank A. Calderoni","Paul, as John mentioned before, I mean, again if you look at the pricing aspect of, I mean, you can see it in the filings that we provide, the amount of impact on the pricing has been fairly stable from a quarter-on-quarter standpoint and that really hasn\u2019t changed much as we look back over as I said eight quarters. I am not sure what more I can share on that from that perspective. But if you look at, pricing from the standpoint in the last quarter, it\u2019s in the range of about half a point as far as how it impacts from quarter-to-quarter and again that\u2019s fairly stable as you look at it over a number of quarters and that\u2019s what we would anticipate.","The other items in gross margins I mentioned, you always have a mixed dynamics, it usually get benefits from a cost perspective; this quarter, we had more of a warranty impact that kind of took us on the negative side.","Now as far as the operating margin, yes, 34% is at a low level from what we had before. That is not \u2013 we\u2019re not saying we want to obtain it, we will continue to work through, I mean we are also looking at a period of time where we are going to be investing in the portfolio to make sure that we have strategic investments that we need to make, a lot of that\u2019s going to be done through just continuing to be much more efficient in aligning our portfolio as we work through it. And as Gary mentioned before, we continue to drive areas of productivity and efficiency continuing on some of the things that we\u2019ve put in place over the last year to 18 months.","So the overall, if I stand back and look at the overall commitment to what we\u2019d talked about last summer at the end of the last fall I should say we kind of looked at a three model revenue growth in that 5% to 7% range, profits growing at 7% to 9%, so better than balanced growing profits faster. And with that you\u2019re going have to see some leverage that\u2019s Gary talked about. But we\u2019ll have to continue to see how that plays out, but that is the objective that we laid out and one that we use as a management team to make sure as we make the decision we follow through on it.","John T. Chambers","Thank you, Paul.","Melissa Selcher","","Great, thanks. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James.","John T. Chambers","Hey, Simon.","Simon Leopald \u2013 Raymond James","Hi, thanks a lot. I know they will get my question in. I wanted to follow-up on some of your commentary around data centers and thank you for the clarifications on software to fine networking, because I think that has caused tons of confusion for folks. But maybe if you could elaborate a little bit to help us with some context and there is really two parts to the one question and legitimately two parts with one question.","John T. Chambers","","Okay.","","Simon Leopald \u2013 Raymond James","In terms of data centers, if we could get an understanding of your total revenue to derived from data center, so not just the data center segment, but if we\u2019re to get an understanding of the overall revenue coming from the data center markets including other switch and products going in routing. I\u2019m believing it\u2019s between 10% and 15% of revenue, I want to make sure that that\u2019s correct. And then just drilling down on the partners, I think there is some concern about the co-optation environment that you addressed. But if we could get an understanding of your diversification or dependency on partners beyond the VCE partnership, but how much is coming through partners indirect in that data center vertical in particular? Thank you.","Frank A. Calderoni","Okay, Simon, for the first part it\u2019s almost impossible for us to get that answered. It\u2019s not that we shouldn\u2019t go through and look at it may be at future times think about how we\u2019d answered. If you look at our run rate in what we consider data center and cloud that's primarily the UCS categories except or the run rate is well over $1.6 billion type of run rate in terms of that segment. We are up to over \u2013 I think 22% market share in North America, number two in terms of that segment and rapidly closing and the global market just little bit behind the number two player in terms of direction.","Our value to our customers has probably never been more relevant to the data center and where we\u2019re going to go. And we \u2013 Rob made on a heavy comment, we work across not just in EMC, VMware partnership, which is very good and very strong and very successful but we are an open standard in terms of where we go here. And we fully will control our destiny not to be dependent on anyone in terms of our long-term strategy although strategic partnerships must be a part of achieving that strategy. Your thoughts, Rob?","Robert Lloyd","Well, I think John as well you mentioned the Cisco 1 developers\u2019 approach where we're going to give programmatic access to our operating systems. I think it's going to have big impact on the value the customers can subscribe through our data center portfolio, and it's something that we plan on leveraging going forward. So I think it's an ecosystem play John in summary, great relationships across multiple environments, and that's exact what our customers expect.","John T. Chambers","I've seen this multiple times before also when we look at markets and there\u2019s often lot of excitement three to five years before it really is impactful some people might think. And each time that has occurred Cisco is not only responded will, we usually lead the transition. We're very comfortable doing it again, and as I said earlier, this didn\u2019t speak up on a sweet note, it\u2019s coming for well and you\u2019ll see us address it through strategic partnerships, partnerships where we compete and partner at times you see us address it to internal start-up, see us address it to spin-in an acquisition, and it\u2019s a firm and the play out. The nice thing is and this is the advantage of not being the big incumbent and this is largely new Greenfield trust to be going into in the direction, and if you think about Cloud and you think about virtualization, it is more network centric than any things been done. you got to know the network in this, and while there\u2019s always a chance we\u2019ll be wrong, I think we\u2019ll be three to five years from now and saying, it was about the network and the structure.","Melissa Selcher","Next question, please.","Operator","Thanks. Our next question comes from Brian White with Topeka Capital.","John T. Chambers","Hey, Brian.","Brian J. White \u2013 Topeka Capital Markets","Yeah. Hi, John. The cloud market, 50% growth phenomenal and as we look forward, I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s any other pieces to the puzzle we need to add here specifically, storage big data and what type of use cases, are you seeing in the most success in the storage market, is it in the Cloud market, is it more with enterprise customers and more with carriers?","John T. Chambers","Okay. Mel\u2019s give me the signal that that\u2019s the one we\u2019re going to kind of end on in terms of our last question. so we delivered to you all being done by 3\u2019o clock as we said we would on it. In terms of the cloud, the numbers and thank you for the complement of 50%, it was actually even better 90% revenue and 58% on the orders. And it does speak to a market where we\u2019re just starting to get penetration and while we have very good share versus the market, the server growth and our blade servers as well, all other growth is going as opposed to back and that\u2019s where our strength clearly is.","In terms of the use case board, we\u2019re getting a lot of use and Rob, I\u2019m going to ask about how service providers are going to do that, and some of the things we do with hosted unified communication to you in a second. I\u2019ll take the enterprise piece. The enterprise piece, when you look and we\u2019ve done our own surveys and we\u2019ve looked at some outside surveys, we\u2019re getting the vast majority of the true production clouds in the enterprise space, bid office Cisco and our partners and our win rate there is extremely, extremely good. Service provider sits even better, because very often they consider to close the incumbents in the data center actually competitors and Rob a little bit about both what we\u2019re doing from a positioning perspective and a little bit, how they\u2019re using more than just in their service provider space.","Robert Lloyd","","So I think across our portfolio, John the number one used case is private cloud. We\u2019re seeing obviously the move towards converged infrastructure playing very well for our strengths with UCS and the partners we have. The trend is our enterprise customers are looking for more benefits from automation and actually taking the benefits of virtualization even further.","Second most popular used case is for cloud providers where they\u2019re looking at provisioning and management as the number one area of focus. One of our used cases is extremely strong, it\u2019s our own call control, call manager operating as a hosted collaboration solution where we have dozens of service providers delivering call control as an enterprise class application from those centralized data centers.","The third used case is massively scalable data centers which we\u2019re winning in and you\u2019ve mentioned that before about our position there and the strength we\u2019ve seen and some of the innovations we\u2019re bringing in those areas. And then obviously there are multiple used cases that exist across the board. But those are the three that we\u2019re focused on, we\u2019re winning in enterprise cost apps, we are seeing Microsoft and SharePoint and other applications, we\u2019re seeing SAP and Oracle in our virtualized environments. And actually I think our strength is that we are bringing this infrastructure to enterprise class applications and matching service providers trying to drive services for business apps.","John T. Chambers","","Yeah, it\u2019s interesting. I\u2019m going to talk about the sales meeting Rob a little bit more, but we had two really good competitors medium size that recently have said the same thing from their sales leadership to their field. And that is, that at Cisco sales technology and you compete against Cisco in technology you got a chance. The minute this goes to the business decision makers, then they begin to look at a business impact, cost of ownership where they\u2019re trying to achieve their business goals, they\u2019re now telling these teams when I\u2019m with the major wireless player and when I was a major switch player in the data center. There are just saying you need to go away, you\u2019re not going to beat Cisco there and it does speak to how our strategies come and melt together. It isn\u2019t about standalone products, it\u2019s about how do you solve customer problems, not just in theory, but having the services behind it Gary, which your team is doing amazing on having the capability to think about how you solve their problems with the British government. I mean, we did everything from job creation to education to help in the needs London in terms of the implication to point of the Olympics, to be an example how you do innovation within a country and tie together the innovation centers, that\u2019s a different conversation than any company in the world has with the government leader.","And it\u2019s our ability to really pull that together and to teach ourselves was Rob, which I know is very key, they\u2019ve not \u2013 go just learn products, they\u2019ve got to learn product technology architectures and then they can learn how does this solve their business architecture, but brand would be the first one that [gets] up to our enterprise environment to say that he is staring to see our ability to sell that, be more and more across the plan or at least in the business levels, Gary, our ability to pull together services and I guess that\u2019s the right one to wrap up on Mel.","Bottom line for the quarter and for the year, we did what we said we would do, very pleased with the results. We appreciate your confidence and trust in us and continue to appreciate us on the challenges, our strategy and vision appear to be working well, we wouldn\u2019t have done the dividend commitment and the cash commitment, if we didn\u2019t see stabilization in our business and have good confidence going forward, and most of the major market transitions were all over, and a couple of them where we got good people we can do even better, and I think you all brought it up in a couple of your questions, and that\u2019s what you saw reflecting our guidance probably more aggressive than most \u2013 any of our peers and the industry will see if that\u2019s the right scenario or not and thank you for your confidence. Mel, let me turn back over to you.","Melissa Selcher","","Thanks, John.

At the request of Cisco Systems, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. ","Now I would like to introduce Melissa Selcher, Senior Director, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Melissa Selcher","Thanks, Kim. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our 88th quarterly conference call. This is Melissa Selcher, Senior Director of Analyst Investor Relations, and I'm joined by John Chambers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Frank Calderoni, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Rob Lloyd, Executive Vice President of Worldwide Operations; and Gary Moore, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.","The Q2 fiscal year 2011 press release is on U.S. high tech Marketwire and on the Cisco website at http:\/\/newsroom.cisco.com.

Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted.","I will now turn it over to John for his commentary on the quarter.","John T. Chambers","Mel, thank you very much. Over the last several quarters, we've continued to make consistent major progress on our comprehensive action plan to position ourselves for the next stage of our growth and profitability. ","Q2 was a very solid quarter in terms of this continued progress, with record revenues and earnings per share, both GAAP and non-GAAP. We grew profits faster than revenues, and we achieved our $1 billion expense reduction targets one quarter ahead of schedule. Our value to our customers continues to increase as we focus on catching the major market transitions occurring in our industry sector. ","By focusing on our 5 foundational priorities of core networking, data center cloud, video, collaboration and business architectures, we are positioned to lead across the most significant market transitions in our industry that our industry is facing today. These market transitions represent our customer's most important care-abouts, including mobility, cloud, BYOD or bring your own device, and the reality of pervasive video driven by new collaboration and social networking solutions.","Each of these transitions require the increased value of intelligent networks, along with technology architectures, that enable both better performance and integrated products, software and services. By building on Cisco's intelligent network, our customers are innovating and solving their toughest business problems. We believe our vision and strategy are working and Cisco's value to customer is -- our customers are -- is increasing. We appear to also be gaining that increasing share of our customers' total spend on IT, as evidenced by our revenue growth versus many of our peers and competitors. ","The bottom line for Cisco is simple: innovation, speed and agility is in; costs and complexity are out. In the initial part of this call, I will first provide a high-level financial review, then cover our progress and results and how they relate to executing on our 3-year plan that we believe will drive the future of Cisco and of our intelligent networks. ","Second, we will give an update on Q2 progress with regards to our 5 foundational priorities. And third, we will cover the order momentum in each of our 3 geographic regions and 4 customer segments. Those segments are enterprise, public sector, commercial and service provider. And finally, we will provide Q3 FY '12 revenue guidance. ","In the second part of the conference call, Frank will go into more detail from a financial perspective, as well as expand on our Q3 guidance. I will then make some summary comments regarding perspective on Q2, as well as our momentum for the second half of the fiscal year followed by Q&A. ","First, we continue to make very solid progress in Q2, both in terms of our results and execution in the second quarter of our 3-year plan. Our performance in Q2 exceeded the guidance we provided last quarter for both revenues and earnings per share. We had record quarterly revenue of $11.5 billion, an 11% increase year-over-year compared to our guidance of 7% to 8%. ","Non-GAAP earnings per share was a record $0.47, again, above our guidance, a year-over-year increase of 27%. GAAP earnings per share was also a record at $0.40, a year-over-year increase of 48%. Non-GAAP total gross margins were 62.4%, a little higher than our original expectations, while non-GAAP product gross margins were 60.9%. Our entire company continues to focus on gross margin improvements. ","While revenue and earnings per share in Q2 were solid, we were especially pleased with our non-GAAP and GAAP net income, growing 23% and 43%, respectively, year-over-year, representing a revenue increase of 11%. We achieved our goal of $1 billion expense reductions, measured from a quarterly run rate perspective in Q2, one quarter earlier than our stated goals. ","Overall, product book-to-bill was approximately one. Total product orders grew 7% year-over-year. As a reminder, in Q2 of last fiscal year FY '11, our product bill -- book-to-bill was greater than one. We are a very strong company with a very strong balance sheet, solid customer relationships and leadership in many healthy markets. However, we will continue to address a few areas for improvement, with the power of the entire company focused on these improvements. ","We've organized our business around our customers' buying patterns and with a focus on the most important business transaction -- transitions. These transitions are leading to a convergence of our products and solutions, as well as our customer segments: enterprise, service provider, commercial and public sector. These are no longer distinct silos at Cisco. ","During Q2, we continue to see how the restructuring and the organizational changes benefit our customers and our shareholders. ","Our U.S. enterprise performance is a strong example of how our shift is working. The close rate in this business, in terms of the pipeline of the sales organization, is nearly twice as high when we're talking about business technology and business budgets versus just IT budgets. We are continuing to expand our ability to sell solutions and innovation that align to our customers' business opportunities and problems. ","The market transition from information technology to business technology based on architectural approaches appears to be playing out pretty much as outlined in our vision and strategy. We are in the sweet spot of where our customers are focusing their efforts, whether it is in innovation, cost reductions, productivity, business transformation or revenue growth. ","Our customers' goal is often tied 1:1 to our 5 foundational priorities, and our customers are increasingly understanding this differentiation. The results appear to be that we are getting a higher share of the total IT spend versus many of our peers and competitors. In my opinion, the franchise value of Cisco represents is continuing to expand. Most of our customers just expect us to continue to innovate and change with industry trends, customer needs and to get in front of the major technology shifts, and to expand the partnership with them in doing the same in their respective industries, and we believe we are accomplishing this goal at an accelerated rate. ","When I look back at the last 2 to 3 quarters, the steadfast commitment of our people to adapt to rapid change and continue to execute against market demands reflects the intangible value of Cisco, the ability of a $45 billion revenue company to turn quickly and move forward, not weaker but much stronger. Our goal is simply to continue this pace of consistent improvement. ","Of particular importance to me is the feedback that we are receiving from the meetings that we have around the world with enterprise CEOs, CIOs, SPs, CEOs, CTOs and government leaders.  They understand the importance of the transitions we made and strongly agree with our strategy and direction. At the World Economic Forum, we met with over 100 of our top customers, ranging from government leaders, service providers, enterprise, partners, et cetera, and I can say that I believe, almost without exception, we are gaining mind share and most of the time, wallet share. ","Second, I would like to provide an update on our 5 foundational priorities, which we believe will be the key in both the growth of the Internet and also, in our differentiation and total cost of ownership proposition versus our peers in the industry. These 5 foundational priorities are the key drivers of the future of the network and the core Internet. ","They are, in my opinion, not only the most important and difficult elements in intelligent networking but at the same time, the hardest to provide true integrated leadership. Our customers know Cisco is uniquely able to deliver in these areas to support their business success and protect as much as possible their investment, flexibility and future innovation capabilities from both a technology and a new business model perspective.  ","The first foundational priority is leadership in our core, and as a reminder, core to us means routing, switching and services. Q2 updates will be provided in terms of revenue from a year-over-year perspective in each of these 5 foundational priorities. Total switching grew 8% in terms of revenue. We have continued to focus aggressively on gross margins, and as such, achieved additional improvements in gross margins in switching, although there's still room for continuous improvement. ","As a note of interest, our switching gross margins in Q2 have returned to where they were approximately 2 years ago. For example, our Nexus portfolio of switches, introduced a little bit over a year ago, showed an improvement in terms of gross margins, in this last year, of about over 800 basis points from a year ago date of start. We are continuing to see stability in our switching portfolio from an order, market share and gross margin perspective. ","Our total NGN routing grew 8% in terms of revenue. High-end routing grew 11% in terms of revenue, mid- to low-end routing grew 6% in revenues. Routing gross margins were up about 3 percentage points versus Q1, but we need to continue to focus in this area. We appear to again be gaining market share in routing versus many of our competitors. For example, in the most recent quarter, one of our major routing competitors reported routing product revenue being down over 20% year-over-year. ","Services grew 11% in terms of revenues year-over-year. Gary, just a continued nice job by your team. As we continue to expand on our architectural approach focusing more on solutions and selling to the business side of our customers' organization, services will continue to play an increasing role and be an increasing percentage of our total sales. ","Second, the data center. It is evolving from bare metal to virtualization to the cloud. The results in this area have been particularly outstanding given that we are taking on big competitors in the data center. As we focus on the market transition with the convergence of server, networking and storage in the cloud. Our UCS product grew year-over-year at 91% in terms of revenue. ","Even though the Nexus 2000 and 5000 are included in our switching product summaries, not the data center, they are obviously tightly tied to the UCS server technology. Again, you saw the Nexus 2000 and 5000 combined revenue growth of over 100% year-over-year. We added 1,786 new UCS customers in Q2, bringing the total to 10,763. ","The third priority is collaboration, which represents major productivity opportunities in a wide variety of our customers in all industries. Collaboration, which had some tough comparisons in terms of year-over-year, grew revenues by 10%. TelePresence, which is including collaboration and not in video was up 19% in terms of revenues. ","Fourth, our video strategy is in very good shape. We had, by far and away, the strongest end-to-end architecture for video, going from the cloud to the end device regardless of what that end device is, enabled by Medianet architecture and our Videoscape platform. This makes video much more practical, easier to use and easier to consume. ","Along with the cloud of mobility, video is one of the most significant transitions our service providers and enterprise customers are experiencing. Following a very strong Q1, SP Video had another very strong quarter, with 23% revenue growth year-over-year. ","In terms of our set-top boxes, we are very much committed to this marketplace. Our service providers customers asked us to partner with them as they move from the traditional set-top boxes to IP set-top boxes to the cloud in our Videoscape solution. Receptivity so far has been very, very good in terms of our strategy. We have demonstrated our capability to bring video to large volumes of any combination of devices, whether these devices are Cisco, our peers or even our competitors. ","The following video data illustrates the pervasive video growth that is occurring in the market. Our emerging video technologies grew at 59% from a revenue perspective, and gross margins have improved dramatically by over 20% in the last year. These areas include physical security, media experience, analytic BU, et cetera.","Fifth, architectures for business transformation. Our technology architectures are gaining momentum across our enterprise, public sector, commercial and service provider customers. These customers recognize the value of an integrated network architecture and the many important factors of an architectural approach, including increased reliability and security, products actually designed to work together, ease of addressing new business demands and the ability to adopt new technology trends faster, such as cloud, video and mobility. ","We are also rapidly improving our ability to translate for our customers how technology architectures enable them to achieve their most important and yet most challenging business goals, by presenting, Rob, what you, I think coined, is the whole offer to our customers, combining products, intelligent networks, services and solutions. ","In summary, we are moving ahead of our competitors and our industry peers. You can see this in our market share gains, our reported results compared to others, and there is significant anecdotal evidence that customers are embracing this strategy, our strategy. This leads us to believe that the changes we have already made in our business, not only in terms of positions us well given the uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment, but are also resulting in Cisco capturing a larger share of our customers' spend. ","We've been most successful when we capture market transitions, if you will, tipping points or inflection points in our industry. As I explained earlier, we believe a number of these are occurring at the same time, and our intelligent network is key to helping our customers solve their toughest business issues as they navigate through these transitions. ","Perhaps what I'm most proud of from this quarter is the balance between operational excellence and innovation. What I find remarkable for a $45 billion company is our ability to innovate with a sense of urgency. For example, last year, we simultaneously refreshed practically our entire switching portfolio, which is the largest ever product portfolio refresh in such a short period of time. This significantly drove down price performance to the benefit of our customers, and today, our shareholders see the benefits of that in our reported numbers, both from a revenue and a gross profit perspective. ","In addition, over the last 2 years, we disrupted the server market with a unique offering and created a $1 billion product line that grew over 91% this quarter. On a large -- and that's from a revenue perspective. On a larger scale of disruptive industry innovations, an example is our ability to anticipate the evolution of the data center, going from bare metal to virtualization to the cloud. We started on this over 6 years ago, and it's our ability to evolve this to where we are today that sets us apart from many of our peers. ","This innovation, combining the server products with our top-of-rack capability, our storage strategy and partnerships, such as BCE with VMware and EMC, has allowed us to set the pace for the entire industry, with our annualized run rate of over $2.5 billion, and that's the UCS and the Nexus 2000 through the 5000 growing over 90% year-over-year. ","Innovation is at the heart of our company, more so now than ever, and you can expect more in quarters and years to come. ","Third, from a geographic regions and a customer segment perspective. This is a discussion across our 3 geographic regions first. As the basis for your consideration, the Americas region represents about 54% of our total business; EMEA, Europe, Middle East, Africa and Russia, represents about 29% of our business; and Asia Pacific, Japan and China represent about 17% of our business. ","Balance was reasonable across all 3 geographies. The Americas grew product orders by 5% year-over-year. But to put this in perspective, if you adjusted for the absence of our consumer video line of business, the growth would have been nearly 8%. EMEA grew product orders by 7% year-over-year, and Asia Pacific, Japan and China grew by 14% year-over-year. ","As a reminder, in Q2 1 year ago, our product book-to-bill was greater than 1. To add additional details to the regions, we saw more variance in the growth rates of the top 10 countries than we did in Q1. Japan and Canada continued on a tear at an extremely strong growth rate each with 29% growth. U.K. grew 13%. Germany was down 2%, and France was down 3% year-over-year. In the emerging countries: China grew 13%; Russia grew 19%; Brazil grew 15%; Mexico grew 16%; and India was down 13% year-over-year. As many of you have been reading, India has some unique challenges especially in the public sector. ","Fourth, customer segments. As mentioned earlier, Cisco's total product orders grew approximately 7% year-over-year. Enterprise grew 7%. Commercial grew 7%. Service provider grew 12%. Public sector was down 1% year-over-year. Our performance in the service provider market this quarter is proof of the power of our integrated architectural approach, and the benefits of our intelligent network in helping our customers to transform their business and capitalize on new revenue opportunities.  ","This architectural approach makes us a strategic partner to our top service provider customers globally, and it's what differentiates us from our competitors. So while others talk about the decline in service provider CapEx, we are pleased with our performance and the alignment of our portfolio with our service provider customer's spending priorities. ","This is our second quarter executing on our 3-year plan outlined in our financial analyst conference a short time ago. We were pleased with hitting or exceeding our expectations, in most cases, in terms of profits, order rates, gross margins, book-to-bill and the good balance across our 5 foundational priorities, geographic regions and customer segments. ","Of particular note, our record-breaking revenue performance and above industry growth is basically organic growth during the period. Cash generated from operations this quarter was a very solid $3.1 billion. While our revenue performance in the quarter was based on organic growth, the competitive strength and positioning of our portfolio and solutions architectures is a testament to the quality of our acquisitions made in prior periods and is a validation of our build, buy and partner strategy. ","We have been able to integrate our new solutions into our portfolio and drive real value for our customers and opportunities for our business. ","We've used acquisitions as a part of our strategy for most of our history. We've been at this longer than most in the industry, and we believe we are very good at it. ","We understand the complexity of acquiring and successfully integrating technology companies. Over the last year, we curtailed our M&A activity to a large extent as we worked hard to refocus. Now with our staff executing well, we expect to be more active with acquisitions in the quarters and years to come, selectively adding to our portfolio with a focus on our 5 foundational priorities. As we have in the past, we continue to be disciplined and thoughtful in regards to price, value and strategic fit to meet our approach to M&A. ","When asked what are the key takeaways for the quarter, they are, in my opinion, first, our strategy and vision outlined in our 3-year plan is taking hold and continuing to gain momentum; second, our Q2 revenue growth and guidance for Q3 appears to be proof points in how we've been breaking away from many of our competitors; and third, our technology and business architectures built upon integrated products, services and software platforms are enabling our customers to innovate and to focus on new solutions and business models. ","At the heart of these transitions are our intelligent networks. Our customers understand and appreciate our strategy, organization changes, our technology and business architectures built upon integrated products, services and software platforms. Our ability to help them solve the most important business issues through these intelligent networks is our strategic differentiator. There will always be challenges. ","At the present time, we are also watching very closely the developments in Europe and the global economy, public sector spending, India challenges, conservative IT budgets and the results of some of our peers in the industry that have been a little bit challenging as well as their guidance. And of course, we'll continue to focus on our own internal challenges, which we'll do throughout the entire calendar year. ","In our opinion, and Q2 reinforces our view, we are much better positioned than most of our competitors from an architectural leadership, product leadership, innovation leadership, emerging market leadership and strength of our customers and partner relationships, combined with our current business momentum in the networking industry. Once again, we are firmly committed to driving shareholder and customer value. ","Now moving onto Q3 FY '12 revenue guidance. Before I get to the numbers, let me remind you, and again, that our comments include forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially. Also, Cisco will always be affected by major economic changes, capital spending patterns, new and existing competitors, potential issues affecting our suppliers, our ability to execute or not on our strategy and other risk factors discussed in our SEC filings. ","The guidance is based on current pipeline and our view of the business trends based upon the information we have available today, and the actual results could be above or below our guidance. Also, we all see the uncertainty in the global markets over the last several quarters and even today. It is too early to determine the effects on capital spending in calendar year 2012. Therefore, as you would expect, we will be conservative in our expectations for Q3, again, with all the appropriate caveats discussed during the conference call. ","With that in mind, for Q3 FY '12, we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 5% to 7% on a year-over-year basis. I will now turn the call over to Frank for more details from a financial perspective, as well as to expand on our Q3 FY '12 guidance. Frank, to you.","Frank A. Calderoni","Thank you, John. We had a very solid second quarter, with record revenues of $11.5 billion, which grew 11% year-over-year. Along with a number of other strong financial metrics, we had record profitability with non-GAAP net income of $2.6 billion, up 23% year-over-year. ","These results are encouraging, given the ongoing market dynamics and reflect our commitment to the 3-year model we shared with you last September, which includes growing profits as measured by earnings per share faster than revenue. Again, our total Q2 revenue grew 11% year-over-year. Our total product revenue was $9.1 billion, up approximately 11% year-over-year. ","Let me highlight a few of the areas within our total revenue -- product revenue. Switching revenue was $3.6 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Next generation networks or NGN routing also grew 8% to $2.1 billion. Collaboration revenue was $1 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year, and we saw good growth in service provider video, which was up 23% to $1 billion and in data center, which grew 88% year-over-year to $333 million. ","Services revenue was $2.4 billion, up approximately 11% year-over-year. Our year-over-year revenue grew across all geographic regions, with increases of 9% for the Americas, 15% for EMEA and 11% for APJC. Our total product book-to-bill for Q2 was approximately one. ","Q2 FY '12 total non-GAAP gross margin was 62.4%, which was flat quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. For product only, non-GAAP gross margins for the second quarter was 60.9%, a slight decrease of 0.4% quarter-over-quarter. This change was primarily driven by strengths in lower-margin data center and service provider video products, as well as pricing, discounts and rebates, partially offset by higher volume and lower overall manufacturing costs. ","On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP product gross margin was down slightly by 0.2%. We continue to see solid momentum and positive impact from our value engineering efforts in key product areas which have provided stability to our gross margins over the past few quarters. ","Our non-GAAP service margin for the second quarter was 68%, up from 66.8% last quarter and up from 67% in Q2 FY '11. Total gross margin by geographic region was 62.7% for the Americas, 64.5% for EMEA and 57.5% for APJC. ","Non-GAAP operating expense was 34% of revenue or approximately $3.9 billion in Q2, down approximately $158 million, as compared to the previous quarter. Our continued diligence in this area has allowed us to now realize, one quarter ahead of schedule, the full targeted savings of $1 billion on an annualized expense run rate using Q4 FY '11 as our base. We intend to leverage the shift in cost structure, coupled with the efficiencies and evolving our operating model, to fund future innovation and achieve value for our shareholders. At the end of Q2, our headcount totaled 63,870, and that was up approximately 400 quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by growth in advanced services and technical services and strategic engineering hiring, which was also partially offset by the remaining actions of our workforce restructuring. ","Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 28.4%. To remind you, as we shared at our financial analyst conference in September, we expect that the non-GAAP operating margin for our 3-year model will be in the mid-20s as a percentage of revenue. ","Our Q2 FY '12 non-GAAP tax provision rate was 22%. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $2.6 billion, representing an increase of 23% year-over-year, and as a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP income was 22.2%. Non-GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for the second quarter were $0.47 versus $0.37 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, a 27% increase year-over-year. ","GAAP net income for the second quarter was $2.2 billion, as compared to $1.5 billion in the second quarter of fiscal year 2011. GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for the second quarter were $0.40 versus $0.27 in the same quarter of fiscal year 2011. ","Now moving on to the balance sheet. The total of cash, cash equivalents and investments at quarter end was $46.7 billion, up approximately $2.4 billion from last quarter. Of this total balance, approximately $5 billion was available in the U.S. at the end of the quarter. Our cash flow from operations in the second quarter was approximately $3.1 billion, our strongest operating cash flow since Q4 FY '10. ","Our accounts receivable balance was $3.9 billion at the end of Q2. Also, at the end of Q2, days sales outstanding or DSO was 31 days compared to 35 days at the end of Q1 FY '12 and 40 days at the end of Q2 FY '11. On a year-over-year basis, the decrease in DSO was driven by continued shipment linearity, strong collections performance and service billings linearity during the quarter. Going forward, as we talked about previously, we do expect DSO to be in the range of 30 to 40 days, given our business mix, linearity and also the growth of our services business. ","Total inventory at the end of the second quarter was $1.6 billion, relatively unchanged from Q1 FY '12. Non-GAAP inventory turns were 10.8 this quarter, down 1\/10 compared to last quarter and up 8\/10 from Q2 of fiscal 2011. Inventory purchase commitments at the end of Q2 were $4.2 billion, relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. ","I am pleased to announce that Cisco's Board of Directors approved a 33% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.08 per share. This dividend will be paid on April 25, 2012, to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on April 5, 2012. We remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders through both dividends and our share repurchase program. ","For the second quarter, we repurchased $466 million of common stock under the stock repurchase program or 26 million shares at an average price of $17.84 per share. The remaining approved amount for stock repurchases under this program was approximately $8.2 billion as of quarter end. ","A dividend payment of $322 million, representing $0.06 per share was declared and paid during the second quarter. And over the past 4 quarters, we have repurchased approximately $4.5 billion of our shares and paid quarterly dividends of approximately $1.3 billion, for a total of $5.8 billion of cash returned to shareholders. ","Total deferred revenue was $12.5 billion at the end of Q2, an increase of approximately 6% compared to Q2 FY '11. Deferred product revenue grew to $4 billion or roughly 6% year-over-year, and deferred services revenue was approximately $8.5 billion, an increase of about 5% year-over-year. ","Let me now provide a few comments on our outlook for the third quarter. I would like to remind you, again, that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. The guidance is based on the current pipeline and our view of business trends based upon the information we have available today, and the actual results could be above or below our guidance. ","Given the ongoing business climate, as well as the uncertain economic situation globally, regionally and with certain countries, we will continue to take a measured approach that balances business upside with potential risk. And while we are encouraged by continued demand from our customers, we are mindful of the possibility for slower IT spending in calendar 2012. In light of these factors, we encourage you to continue to model conservatively, and it's important that expectations do not get ahead of where the market is today. ","The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis, with a reconciliation to GAAP. As John said earlier, for Q3 FY '12, we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 5% to 7% on a year-over-year basis. As we have said in the past, forecasting gross margin has always been challenging due to various factors, such as the volume, product mix, cost savings and also, competitive pricing dynamics. ","As we indicated last quarter, we are continuing to actively monitor and evaluate the flooding situation in Thailand. We have business continuity plans in place in order to minimize any potential impact as we expect this situation to continue for the next several quarters. Our financial results reflect minimal negative impact from the situation, consistent with our expectations. ","In our guidance for the third quarter, we have factored in the minimal impact that we have estimated at this time. For the third quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately in the range of 61.5% to 62%. Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 is expected to be in the range of 27% to 28%. Our non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be approximately 22% in the third quarter. ","Our Q3 FY '12 non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.45 to $0.47 per share, and we anticipate our GAAP earnings in Q3 will be $0.07 to $0.10 per share lower than our non-GAAP EPS. This range includes our typical differences, as well as an impact of up to $0.01 as a result of our anticipated restructuring charges. ","Other than those quantified items noted above, there are no other significant differences between GAAP and our non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructuring and tax or other events which may or may not be significant. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. ","Relative to our July 2011 announcement on restructuring, we have included total non-GAAP pretax charges of approximately $925 million to our GAAP financial results to date. We expect the total restructuring charges to be approximately $1 billion, with the remaining charges to be incurred in the second half of fiscal year '12. ","In summary, this was a very solid quarter for Cisco. Our results reflect our ongoing focus on profitable growth where profits can grow faster than revenue. In terms of forward-looking guidance, we are executing against a long-term strategy, and we'll continue to take it one quarter at a time and advise you to do the same. ","Overall, we are seeing good progress against our 3-year financial strategy. We will continue to drive operational excellence within a very disciplined financial model, while also making the right strategic investments to fuel our business growth. ","With that, let me turn the call back over to John.","John T. Chambers","Frank, thank you very much. Moving forward, I would like to provide some perspective on Q2 and our momentum going into the second half of FY '12. ","We believe our vision, strategy, financial strengths, broad architectural approach, as well as our culture that accepts change, positions us well for growth. We have always used these market transitions to make bold and tough decisions, and then to execute in a way that further extends our leadership over our peers. For several quarters in a row, our business orders appear to be growing faster than many of our comparable industry peers.  Rob, I just want to say a great job by you, by Chuck, by Nick, by Edzard and Chris, very, very solid and Paul. So across-the-board nice job and we're expecting it again.","Robert W. Lloyd","Of course, John. Thank you.","John T. Chambers","We also want to continue our focus on operational excellence, driving productivity and making Cisco a simpler place to work and for our customers to do business with. At the same time, organizing Cisco in a way we believe our customers will buy and our products will need to be developed, given the major market transitions that are occurring and creating the opportunity that we discussed earlier. ","Gary, I did just want to congratulate you on the services group. I think what you've done and the team's focus on gross margins, the overall operational excellence, the customer ease of doing business, you see it across the board. So doing a super job. I want to thank you for that, what Angel's doing is really great. Well done.","Gary B. Moore","John, thank you. It's a real team effort.","John T. Chambers","It really is. Good progress but a long way to go, good journey. In every major market transition over the last 20 years, we have historically emerged stronger and with more market share and with intense target focus. In our opinion, we are on our way to doing the same once again. But it is a journey, and we are still in the early stages. ","You will continue to see us move aggressively to pull away from our competitors as they adjust to these market challenges, having already made these changes well ahead of our competition. This is also a competitive advantage for us, in our opinion. ","Industry challenges and our own challenges this year cause us to make needed changes. But as we said last quarter and I'm repeating this quarter, we will not stop here. We will aggressively continue to change and transform and drive our Cisco entrepreneurial spirit through the combination of innovation and operational excellence. ","At the same time, we will maintain our laser focus on creating value for our shareholders, customers, partners and employees. You will continue to see us a very focused, innovative, agile, aggressive and lean Cisco moving forward. ","The major transitions from an information technology to business technology are accelerating in our enterprise, service provider, public sector and commercial accounts, and across most industries and geographies. Although we are only in the early stages of this transformation, our ability to use innovative solutions and intelligent networks to enable our customers to achieve their goals and their growth, productivity, cost savings, new consumption and business models is increasing and achieving increased customer acceptance. ","These are, in many ways, unusual times. On one hand, the business feels good. The demand for Cisco products and services is healthy, and our relationship with our customers are the strongest they have ever been. On the other hand, there is significant uncertainty in the broader macro environment, and as such, it is prudent for us to remain conservative in our outlook for the second half of the fiscal year. For the remainder of FY '12, you can expect us to make the required investments to advance our market leadership and drive innovation while holding to our financial model. ","I want to thank our employees, our Cisco family for the speed and willingness to change that has positioned us to move with our customers and drive value for our shareholders. I know it has not been easy, but you all have executed and adapted to these challenges and opportunities extremely well. And that, more than anything else, embodies the Cisco franchise: our ability to merge quickly, stronger and more focused and more driven, as we have in the past. Our Q1 and Q2 results certainly reflect that. I want to thank our shareholders, employees, customers and partners as we've transitioned to the reinvigorated Cisco, the aggressive, focused and simplified Cisco you have come to expect over the years. ","Mel, with that, let me turn it over to you.","Melissa Selcher","Great. Thanks, John. We will now open the floor to questions and answers. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please open the floor to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities.","Jess L. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","My question is on your operating margins, which are above your long-term target in the mid-20% range. So I guess I was hoping you could help us understand how you plan to balance spending versus sales going forward. Is it right to think that operating expenses basically grow in line with your revenue forecast, with the top line performance dictating the direction of operating margins? Or do we see you start to ramp expenses more aggressively here in order to take advantage of what appears to be an improving environment?","John T. Chambers","I'm going to have Frank handle the difficult part of that. Just let me say that we are extremely disciplined in terms of our financial model, and that while we will make investments, we're going to make those with the proper productivity focus. Just as a reminder, this last quarter versus a year ago, our productivity is up to a record 724,000 per employee. That's almost a 20% increase. So you will see us continue to focus on the combination of the end as opposed to one at the expense of the other. So with that guidelines, Frank, well, you had a chance to think about it?","Frank A. Calderoni","So Jess, let me start by just reiterating what we talked about back at the Financial Analyst Conference in September. So the model that we've put in place is really over a 3-year period of time, and we're looking at clearly with the overall objective of growing profits faster than revenue. And from a model standpoint, and I know I've talked about this a lot over the last couple of months, we're looking at, over that extended period of time, revenue growth, 5% to 7% and EPS in the 7% to 9%, growing faster. Within that, we're looking at operating income, as I talked about, in the mid-20s and getting that right balance. Now I did say back then and we've continued to say that we feel that, that model is -- we want to make it conservative so that it's realistic and achievable and we have the ability to continue to have an opportunity to overachieve where we can. In this past quarter, in Q2, our non-GAAP operating margin was 28.4%, and we also had our expense of -- at -- achieving ahead of schedule, $3.9 billion, which is 34% of revenue, and we talked about trying to get to that $1 billion expense reduction. We were going to get there in Q3. We did it a quarter earlier. That early achievement gave us operating leverage, clearly, significant operating leverage in the second quarter. But it's one quarter, and I want to make sure that we again look at this over a longer period of time and really focus on that long-term model. And the key thing here for us going forward -- and a lot of the groundwork that we laid in the last couple of quarters is being able to make sure that we've continue to drive productivity, and we expect to do that. I mean, if you ask anyone here and around the company, that's #1 focus for all of us. And we know...","Unknown Executive","While we increase margins.","Frank A. Calderoni","Yes, well, that's a big part of it, too. And we want to make sure that we can continue to invest in the portfolio to drive innovation. And that's -- in our business, that's also with M&A. John talked about M&A. And we want to make sure that when we do this, we're supporting the 5 foundational priorities. So it's that balance, staying with that long-term model and working that operating margin, making necessary investments to continue to drive productivity, knowing that investors are looking for that operating leverage that we've talked about with growing profits faster than revenue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer & Co.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I wanted to tie, John, some of your individual segment margin commentary. You've talked about improvements in your switching business with gross margins back to where they were 2 years ago, then you talked about routing and service providers as well, areas where your gross margin has been improving. Yet this quarter, your product gross margins have now hit a low of 60.9%. So maybe can you give us a little bit more color as to what's still not working right from your standpoint on the product side? And maybe a little bit more color on the mix that has been impacting your gross margin here? And how should we think about that evolution over the next quarter or 2?","John T. Chambers","So Frank, I'm going to ask you at the end to summarize our guidance that we did at the Financial Analyst [ph] Conference, which is right in the middle of our -- actually a hair better. It's primarily a mix issue in terms of this quarter, but I don't want to dodge that issue. We saw improvement in routing margins. We're continuing to put focus on that as well. We still have some of the overflow from some of our large wins in Asia, where, as you heard from Frank's comments earlier, our margins are not as high as they are in Europe or in North America. In terms of the continued improvement, the Nexus was probably the best example, 800 points in a year. And it had a way to go -- ways to go on that, but pleased with the results that we're seeing there. You'll find each of our groups, even the emerging technologies, with new start-ups such as emerging video. Even if it's relatively small revenue per year, under $200 million, you see them focusing on major, major improvements in gross margins. So you see it in every category. Services, Gary, we're obviously at a very high gross margin, probably one that you can't stay quite that high on, but to say that every element of the company is focused on it. So it's not a question of not working. I'm actually pleased with how it's working. And it's an area of mix in terms of the approach. But even reminding the comments about our Nexus 2000, 5000 I made before, the margin improvements on those were very good in the first year that we are actually shipping. So we are all over this. You will see it fluctuate it up and down. And I think your guidance actually was up a hair from last quarter's guidance, Frank. If I remember right, last quarter was 61% to 62%. This one was 61.5% to 62%. But the guidance for the longer term, just as a reminder, what we said at the analyst conference?","Frank A. Calderoni","So John, if I add to that. I think that's a good question. The key thing they want to put on this is managing the portfolio. We've been managing this portfolio now for 2 decades, and we're always going to have different dynamics from a quarter-to-quarter standpoint. I think clearly, what we've emphasized over the last number of quarters, especially the last 4 or 5 quarters, is this whole portfolio approach and really kind of making this a very systemic focus item across the company, really driving across company as a major initiative, making sure we have the right incentives in sales and engineering, make sure we're driving margin and cost improvement and also making sure that these cost improvements are not just short term, that we continue to have them ongoing and that we continue to make emphasis. So we'll continue to do all that and balancing the portfolio. And I think the success that we've had in the past will be also the ability to kind of balance this going forward. Yes, we did have some mix dynamics, as you talked about, primarily with strength in data center as well as SP Video. The pricing was relatively stable this quarter, as we've seen in the last couple of quarters, and that's a good thing. And we've got cost improvements to offset that. We'll continue to work those cost improvements, and we have some other opportunities as we go forward. The guidance I gave for this coming quarter, Q3, is 61.5% to 62%. We try to kind of work that and have that conservative so we can do better than that as well, and I think that kind of allows us to have this continuity that we've seen in the last couple of quarters continue for the rest of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from -- okay, our next question comes from Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of quick things, just, I'd say, a clarification on what you started saying, John, before about gross margin. You've thought -- talked a little bit about the overhang from those Asia deals. And in the past, I think you and Frank have been talking about the China routing deals and -- as a reason for gross margin going down. Just if you could just, as a clarification, just say whether they actually came through because gross margin was actually terrific this quarter. So it looks like they didn't. So perhaps that is something -- if you'll describe the dynamic there. But my real question has more to do with the routing market. When you look at routing, both what you're seeing now, your service provider is actually very good, and you look at routing over the next 2, 3 or 5 years, do you -- what is your estimate now on the growth in the routing market? And is this still a double-digit growth market? Or is it kind of decelerating as other technologies are being -- kind of coming in the networks? And is -- are networks moving more towards the application side and in the cloud and other things? Or is routing going to continue to be a strong business and a strong market for you to grow into?","John T. Chambers","Sure. So in reverse sequence to the way you asked it. If you look at pervasive video and you look at -- and the importance of intelligent networks and you look at how these tie together with routing, switching, the cloud, data center, UCS, Bring Your Own Device, mobility, all these pieces come together. Without intelligent routing, it doesn't work. And so the ability, whether it's on the Edge with the ASR 5000, the ASR 9000, both of which we had very, very good quarters, or the ability in the data center to tie it out or the ability from any device to bring it forward, as you begin to talk about proliferation in video with intelligence underneath that so you can search to it, so you can push it to common communities of interest, the routing, well, switching will actually blur. The lines between service provider and enterprise and commercial will blur, and the consumer. If you don't have an architecture that goes across all of those, you're going to be a piece player, buried somewhere in the cloud, behind the scenes, in my opinion. We're well positioned, although we can improve in each of these categories. And so I see routing continue to be a very important factor. It isn't that it isn't a growth market. The price performance in routing is we keep really setting new challenges for ourself and others just like we did in switching. And yet as you watch, to have routing grow to the high single digits at 8% was pretty solid. I think when we did the financial conference, Frank, the numbers that we gave for routing was actually a little bit below where we are, but in the mid to high single-digits in terms of the approach. Now without me changing that because I'm not going to do it at this time, we are very pleased in a market that is not growing as well. We still have challenges in public sector where we are the leader by a long way in terms of share. And it was down in the Federal Government by 14% in a market where Southern Europe was down 14%, in a market where even small countries, like an Argentina because of export-import issues, was down dramatically. In effect, our number in Latin America and with India, Gary, a little bit slower than we'd like it to see especially in the public sector. So I feel good about routers being a key part of where we're going to go. Rob, when you won a big deal along with Edzard and team and Nick and Pankaj in Korea, it was about an architectural play where it isn't about individual component parts. I apologize if I get pumped up on that, but I feel very good about where we are on it and it will be a key part of our ingredients. In terms of the deals in Asia, they will constantly new deals pop up, but we completed the large orders to Asia both this quarter and last quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A follow-up also on the carrier side in routing. I think you talked about some uncertainty in carrier CapEx as influencing your guidance. And yet your own service provider bookings were quite strong at 12%. And obviously, your peers, as you pointed out, have had a very difficult period. So can you just give us a bit more color on what you are seeing in the carrier spending environment? Any standout areas of strength or weakness? And then specific to your own routing business, where, as you pointed out, your major competitor had a significant decline, do you think that difference in performance is driven primarily by the timing of your respective product cycles? Or are there any specific major customer opportunities where you think you've actually displaced your competitor?","John T. Chambers","Okay. So in sequence that you raised it. The 12% was revenue growth, not orders. And if you look at where we're going in the service provider, we are becoming the sweet spot. It doesn't matter if you're talking to Time Warner or Verizon and AT&T, a Sprint, a Deutsche Telekom, a British Telecom, a Telefonica, an NTT, a China Mobile, a Telstra, all of which we have in the last month at multiple levels. Our role in terms of what they're trying to accomplish is changing. And so we are, in our opinion, and Simona, you're pretty good at verifying this, getting a much larger share of their spend. In terms of our ability to provide value way beyond \"a router,\" back to the earlier question that was asked, they don't buy routing. They buy an architectural play from the data center all the way up. And repeating the Korean telecom and what Chairman Lee did there, he's aligned with us all the way from the data center all, the way to smart services that his company delivers across 16 countries. So our role in service providers as they focus on the key elements: mobility. Mobility. The second key element, video. Both for entertainment video and business video. Third key element, cloud. Cloud is it delivers new services, opens up new revenue opportunities for them. Fourth key element: How do you dramatically cut costs in this environment? And how do you balance within it? We're getting a pretty clear lineup in terms of how we play in these categories. Now are we replacing our peers and competitors in here? Rob, I'm going to let you talk about that.","Robert W. Lloyd","Sure, John. I would love to. I know you would. But I know that Simona was asking indirectly where some of the negative growth and weak outlook at some of our competitors are reflecting on a changing CapEx patterns. We heard one of those competitors claim that their Tier 1 SPs in the United States have reduced their spending, they've seen weakness in Japan and delayed projects in China. In fact, we saw just the opposite. We had high-end routing revenues in both the United States and in China. We're up in the high teens. And actually, our high-end revenues in Japan nearly doubled in the last quarter. So there is a clear change in our position in terms of the market. We're gaining relevance, and we're winning back major franchises in Tier 1 providers around the world. I do agree with you that some of the CapEx right now is being prioritized and that prioritization is going towards mobility and towards cloud. And in that place, I think our service provider customers are very happy where we stand, and I think they feel we're headed absolutely in the right direction.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Morgan Keegan.","Simon M. Leopold - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to see if we could drill down on one particular market, namely that of data centers. In terms of public commentary, we've heard about service providers, talked about cloud initiatives and investing in data centers. And we've seen some of the largest data center spenders', and most notably Facebook, recent disclosures talking about very significant increases. But I appreciate that that's really only a sliver of overall data center spending. So if you could drill down on this end market, not specifically your data center segment, but the data center end market in terms of what it means to you and what these overall trends are.","John T. Chambers","Okay. So if I look at the data center end market, it is a market that is in tremendous transition at a very fast pace. We bet, and we were lucky, but we also listen to customers, over 6 years ago on this market and developed products and skunk works for 4 years to really address it at the same time we built an architecture that high-end routing would handle billions of videos. In terms of the importance to us, it is major because we believe this will actually be a free flow of data centers and clouds, private and public, coming together and with the capability for enterprise customers, as an example, but the same thing is true for commercials or even consumer to be able to migrate wherever they want to purchase in terms of the capability or invest within the architecture. We do think it will blur completely between server technology and networking technology and storage across applications and across-the-board, and that's where our partnership with VMware and EMC was very, very good. And [indiscernible], she made some very positive comments about our $800 million run rate in that category where we share in terms of the market and the growth. In terms of our numbers, you saw the growth again very close to 100% with the 2 combined, but it is the ability to provide these overall services. Now while I won't particularly talk about an individual customer, but in the massively scalable data centers, we're picking up momentum, Rob, pretty good. And we've been able to track both engineering talent as well as sales talent to go after it aggressively. So key to our future. You see the end user market changing. But this is where the change is taking place, where you're going to reduce your cost in the data center. And data centers as they consolidate are going to have reduced total CapEx. We do the same within ours. I think Rebecca's down by about $25 million as she consolidates the data centers, per year savings and yet delivering dramatically more capability. So this is a share of wallet based on market transitions. Rob, you're looking like you want to jump in.","Robert W. Lloyd","I was just going to add, John, that there is clearly a segment that we appeal to with our full architecture, and that's the enterprise-class workloads that are migrating to this platform. So we do see general-purpose applications, like Exchange, SharePoint, SAP, migrating to our UCS architecture. The growing one that's very exciting for all of us is the virtual desktop infrastructure moving in this environment. And of course, there's Unified Communications, our own apps. So I think the question is what does the blade server appeal to? It's enterprise-class applications or private clouds. And obviously, for the public services, then, many providers will be delivering based on Cisco architecture.","John T. Chambers","And Simon, we're expanding on your question because you allow us to hit 3 or 4 areas at the same time. Rob, if I remember right, in terms of both our UCS sales and cloud sales, as well as video, our commercial, and as example in the U.S. territory, had almost half the deals. So it isn't just with the people's focus on massively scalable data centers. Gary, I'm going to ask you to pull this together because if you think about it, what our customers are also asking us is services. They want the whole offer, Rob, that you kind of, I think, invented here for us. And services are playing an increasing role. That's where we actually added headcount this quarter. Kind of bring that home in terms of what you're seeing in terms of how the market's evolving and what role we're trying to play here.","Gary B. Moore","So as it relates to the data center, I think it's in addition to what you've already said and Rob said. The thing that's really pushing this is the opportunity to move applications into the cloud and do that in a way where the ease-of-use and the cost to do that is really controlled. So if you think about the conversion architecture we have with the Vblock as an example, our ability to help a customer turn that up very quickly has to do with the services and the pre-integration of that stack, and then also the automation we put with that relative to the management systems, so that you have a single pane of glass to man these -- that environment. Significant reduced cost there. So services plays a role to help our customers understand the technology and move to it much more quickly. So if we can accelerate how fast they can do this, then they can also accelerate how fast they turn it into revenue. And that's what they want.","John T. Chambers","It's interesting. We have not done a good job, by we, let's start with me, in terms of really talking about our innovation on almost every product front that we talk about, from collaboration to cloud to video capability to the data center to switching and routing playing architecturally together to business models to the integration of services. When you talk to our customers what they wanted, it doesn't matter if it's a country what they want, such as Canada or Russia or the Middle East or India, or a company, they want us to help them in this transition. And services plays a very integral role in both reducing the risk, being able to take ownership. And that is a transition that is even occurring in emerging countries where while price per port is important or price per user, average revenue per user is important, they also realize the ability to move effectively in this, perhaps is an area that I think we can add a lot more value to. So Simon, thank you for letting us answer about 4 questions, and we reversed it. Normally, we hold to one question, but I thought it was an important area to hit.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rod Hall with JPMorgan.","Rod B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. One is on the revenue guidance. Just wondered if you could clarify -- I mean, you're guiding for basically flat revenue in Q3, and we haven't -- in most Q3s you're up on revenues, so -- and I know Frank talked about IT services spending potentially being down in 2012. So I just wondered if you guys could elaborate a little bit on why that guidance -- what is it you're seeing out in the marketplace that makes you maybe a little bit more cautious than you otherwise would be given you've just delivered such a strong quarter. And then on the UCS comments, if you could just clarify. I don't think I heard the gross margin impact on UCS. I'm not sure if I missed that or if you said it. But if you could justify what the gross margin impact from UCS was this quarter given you had such strong growth, that would be helpful, too.","John T. Chambers","Okay. I'm not sure we're going to be able to answer that last question specifically, so I'm going to give Frank just a second to think about it. And I'm not sure we can answer too specifically without giving away our gross margins on UCS, which we clearly don't want to do, Frank, in terms of [indiscernible]. But if you look at what's occurring in the market, I think we're well positioned in terms of our ability to get share of wallet spend. You all have to make your own decision on that. And there are things that, Gary, we've got to do better as well. But we're making very, very good progress. So I think what you want to look at is the macro issue, kind of the macro issue. I think we're all aware in Europe, although I would split it into 3 categories, Northern Europe, Central Europe and Southern Europe, and with the Northern and the U.K. component part of that going better than most people anticipate. In terms of public sector spending, it's going to be tough. U.S. federal budgets, anybody that thinks that those aren't coming down dramatically this next year? And it will vary by department. So if you're only in a department that happens to be spending money, it might be different. Or if you're part of large projects where your products are automatically built into it, that there's one of my peers reminding us. They said, \"John, you're a great leading indicator. We are not. We are lagging because often, it takes almost a year to work through the systems in terms of our direction and power.\" You are seeing some challenges still in India that we talked about. That's primarily public sector. And I would hope that the business leaders and the Indian Government and the citizens come together on that. But then you're having some bumps like Argentina where their import-exports issues take a major problem. And while it's not a big number, it's a big number relative to Latin America. A nice way of saying there are a number of challenges in the marketplace, not the least of which has been a surprise to us of our peers. And many of our peers have been very conservative, and I think, Frank, the vast majority of those who reported in our industry, I think, 70%, have actually guided down versus expectations already in the market. We clearly are guiding up versus what the consensus was for this next quarter. So I think that's a conservative approach. You would be disappointed in anything else. And given all the variables that are going on, even though we made, in relative terms, positive comments about Northern Europe, I think this is what the better part of prudence would be in terms of the direction, and one that we will focus on again. But it is conservative. Real quick answer on UCS without giving too much detail.","Frank A. Calderoni","John, overall, if you look at it from a sequential standpoint, overall product gross margins were down, as I said, slightly by 0.4 of a point. If you look at the -- we had a benefit from a cost standpoint, which pretty much offset the -- what we normally would expect from a price range. But the delta, couple of tenths of a point, was related to mix, and the mix was driven by, as I mentioned before, a combination of UCS or data center as well as strength in our SP Video. So I would say a portion of that delta was driven by mix. But as I said before, we're doing many things to kind of look at other cost benefits as we go forward, continue to keep managing and managing that gross margin portfolio.","John T. Chambers","I just wanted to say, Gary, for what engineering supply chain, what the Cisco transition is doing, the focus on gross margins is world class and couldn't more be more pleased with it. So without going on a line -- in a limb too far, I would say our gross margins feel pretty stable at this point in time. And Frank, would you agree with that?","Frank A. Calderoni","Yes, absolutely. And the value engineering work, while we've made great progress, is really on the front end of that. So I feel our ability to stay competitive and hit those ranges very clearly.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I want to ask a question about something that was asked many times on this call, which is gross margin. When you look at gross margin in Asia, Asia Pacific, Japan and China, the contribution to sales in the last 2 quarters were $142 million, and the contribution to gross profit was minus $20 million, which means the incremental sales came at negative margin. Another way to look at it is just if you give discounts on many other things and not just incremental sales. But the question is that now, there starts to be a measurable gap between the margins in Asia Pacific, Japan and China and between Americas and Europe, which means -- or the question here is what's the risk that the pricing level that you're now introducing to these Far Eastern markets will filter into Americas and the U.S. and will pressure prices there.","John T. Chambers","Got you. A fair challenge. So going in the sequence you raised it. If you look at the overarching issue across Asia Pacific, Japan and China, while we do it as one region, it is probably 5 or 6 different regions. And the margins in Australia and New Zealand and Japan are more in the developed market type of margins. The margins in China and in India and some of the other countries are more the emerging price points. However, if you don't get this as a land grab, Rob, early on when the franchisers start to get built out, you miss on it for the next number of years. And so as you look at this, I would look and anticipate that we improve our margins by account over time as we earn more and more of their confidence. What is fascinating to me were, Gary, you were just there in India, and Rob, you and I get there regularly, is they -- the service providers in India used to make it entirely on price points. They're now realizing that isn't their core competency. They're realizing we bring value, our peers do not, and looking at it from an architectural. They still, however, beat the tar out of us on the balance of this market, and we will participate aggressively in striking that right balance while still maintaining our financial model. This is why you have to think about the markets different. And Asia is an exploding market. You must play to get across the board with a little bit different business model. Now our ability to compete effectively there is improving. So the ability to not only contain this approach in Asia, as is appropriate, is absolutely being seen in the neighboring countries like Japan and Korea and Australia and New Zealand, where our ability to bring to service providers dramatically more value-add in terms of their profitability, their new markets, their ability to introduce new services at a faster pace, their ability to cut their support spending, that's something that very few other people can do. And over time, Rob, we're in that same type of ride in emerging markets. But you've got to get into that opportunity, and you've got to get your share established. And you've got to send a message to your competitor: \"we will take you on in your home territory.\" We will take you on aggressively in your home territory, and we will selectively pick the deals we want to be in long term. So Tal, that's I'd answer it. I think in summary, what you heard from all of us today -- and it's hard to look way far out, but over the remainder of this fiscal year, we like the progress we're making in gross margins, we like the balance that we have the whole company focused on it, we're paying ourselves lead on profitability not just on bookings. And so we're all over it, but we would also agree this is one of the categories that I think you'll continue to see us improve on. And there'll be bumps along the road. Some of those will be necessary bumps to get market share that will hold for profitability later. But there will also be a couple of bumps we have to do better ourselves. But I like the work we've done in gross margins, and I'd probably give us pretty good grades at this time. Now, Gary, it's up to Angel and team and the engineering team and supply chain to continue this focus and what Collette [ph] and others are doing. But I feel good about it.","Gary B. Moore","Me, too.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And thank you for the dividend increase.","John T. Chambers","We listen, we listen. And we'll continue to listen. We knew that the honeymoon on doing a dividend would be very short lived and that we must look at that on a regular sequence about increasing it. And our goal is clearly to do that.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I had a question on the service providers. If we look longer term, does it increase inclination by carriers to reduce their CapEx as a percentage of their revenues? And it's also happening at a time when they're also seeing their margins decline. So I guess for Cisco longer term to grow their service provider revenues, you have to gain more share of a shrinking wallet. Does that mean structurally there's a ceiling on margins as you push your architectural approach? Or does the dialogue suggest with your customers that they actually will pay more since they get more?","John T. Chambers","Okay. So the answer is the last point that you made and set me up with a question. Most service providers will absolutely pay more if they get more. Their problem is very simple, as you articulated very well. Their capital spend was going up, using the U.S. as example for some of those service providers, at twice the rate their revenues were, and the profitability in the revenues were sliding. So this is where you see them get excited about what they can do in cloud and delivering services. This is where you see them getting excited about new mobile capability. This is where you get to see them excited about moving to video into the home, which is why we must be in that set-top box business, going to a hybrid-type approach, growing clearly to the cloud and the data center. And this is where, I think, you see, perhaps more than any other time, Mark, why we had to play across architectures, which we clearly bet on a decade ago, and why we're getting better at operations of them, Gary, in doing better at efficiencies and ease of doing business. These are bets and good execution we've done over a period of time. Nick Adamo and Pankaj are joined at the hips on this, along with Sameer from the services side on it. So I think we have share of wallet opportunities in front of us that will continue way more than a couple of years. But secondly, for any CEO, you turn to them and say, \"I can bring you a certain amount of revenue, and I can increase your profits.\" And if they believe you can do that and you show it a step at a time, then it's a very good model and it plays right into our sweet spot on it. And we don't compete against them like several of our large data center peers. This is a market that we do not compete against them. We enable them as we move forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nikos Theodosopoulos with UBS.","Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can you discuss how comfortable the company is with the $5 billion in U.S. cash balance given the plan to increase the dividend, continue the buyback and now start looking at some M&A? Do you anticipate raising some debt, given the low interest rates, to give you some cushion on the U.S. cash balance? Or not -- and what should we think about as the size of the deals you might do over the next year or so?","John T. Chambers","I knew that last one is coming. So in terms of sequence, if you look at where we are, we have historically done pretty good job on deals, and the ideal one has not changed. 100 engineers, a product about to come to market and there are customers who say, \"Go buy them.\" And our ability to ramp that through, I would argue, is the best in industry, and our shareholders have really benefited from it. The 2 most recent big deals are Starent and TANDBERG, both of which are growing very well for us, allowed us to expand our footprint in the market and allowed us to integrate it tighter, et cetera. We all know that in an industry where the vast majority of them fail, I personally believe 80% to 90%, our hit rate is much higher than that of our peers. And probably the only other -- one other player, Oracle, is good at the acquisitions of the scale that we're talking about. In terms of our size, we believe you partner big-to-big, you acquire big-to-small. And that's how we approach our market in terms of direction. In terms of the cash balance, we clearly built up a little bit more because it's easier if we buy small company to pay cash for that as opposed to other segments. What I read in the merge -- the M&A activity, we'll play across multiple groups in it. We normally have done very well. I would hold Ned and the engineering team accountable to continue to do well in this space. And in terms of the debt, I still believe that every other country in the world understands you must bring back your profits outside a country into their existing country at 0% to 2%. I think regardless which president wins, whether it's the Republican side or the Democrat side, they will have to address that this next year. In the interim, make no mistake about it, when you look at the Prime Minister of Canada or the Prime Minister of England or the Prime Minister of India, they're saying, \"What do I need to do to get your jobs here?\" And they are partnering with business. They will say: \"How do we grow it here?\" \"How do you keep your employment here directly?\" So you will see us supply regardless which way it goes. But I am still -- I haven't changed at all. I always believe when there's a very logical solution to a problem, that will eventually come around. And I'm bringing back a policy of consistently bringing back foreign earnings is the only we stay on exports type of direction. So I would not think of it in terms of incremental debt, that you don't ever close any doors. But Frank, I think, basically, we are where we're headed pretty consistently where we are. And by the way, congratulations. $3.1 billion free cash flow was excellent. All right, your decision about number of questions to go.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank.","Brian T. Modoff - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So a couple of questions actually. Can you talk a little bit about campus versus data center in terms of how you see both of those packing up, that you're -- obviously, you've got carriers, as you mentioned, looking at building private clouds? So how do you feel about campus? Some of us have recently been a little more positive on that area. So can we get a little feedback there? And then specifically on service provider earlier, what specific products are you seeing share gains? And is it CRS-3, ASR 9K, the Starent box? What is it?","John T. Chambers","Okay. All right, Mel was about to tell me we're going to hold only one question. But since you asked two that I think are interesting, we'll finish the questions with those 2 in terms of the direction. In terms of the campus type of approach, that is obviously dependent upon part on the requirement for the speed of the connections. As video really takes off and as the new products come out from Intel, you're going to see a lot of requirement in terms of increasing port size, capabilities and evolution to the next generation of switching within that. So it's an issue both on employment type of issues, bandwidth requirement, et cetera. And if you watch as our organization changes, we've now organized data center with one group, i.e., primarily Nexus, and Catalyst with another group, primarily with what we're doing on the campus side, and those are being  run by Rob and by David, respectfully, within that. In terms of service provider spending in terms of the overall business, I think we're doing -- Rob, you've got to keep me honest here. I think we're doing well in almost every category. We're doing very well in high-end routing, year-end growth there was in low double digits. We've done very well at the Edge with the ASR 5000 and 9000 and big franchise wins at -- well, you might allude to without mentioning the companies, what you're doing in that area. We're doing very well in the data center. There are always a couple of areas that we need to do better, and I think you all and we are very much aware of those and you'll see us continue to focus on it. But I'd say the service provider spend by product category is only part of the question. The real question is: What value do you bring to those, as you're alluding to? And what value do you bring in terms of integrating together with being able to deliver services in a much quicker time frame? What value do you bring together going with a service provider to jointly go to the market? What value do you bring to in terms of innovation, which is why a lot of service providers business with us? And if that's your decision criteria as a CEO, our win rate is extremely high in most all product categories as long as we're just competitive within it. Rob, additional thoughts?","Robert W. Lloyd","Just to summarize, John. 5 consecutive quarters of market share gains with the CRS-1 and CRS-3, and 3 consecutive quarters of market share gains with the ASR 9000, ASR 5000 and ASR 1000. So I think the answer is in all of those environments, even in challenging CapEx environments, we're winning market share.","John T. Chambers","So if I were to summarize, Brian, your question and kind of use it as the closing for the call, if you will, Mel, our vision and strategy is working very well. It's a continuous journey, and we're making good progress on it. And Gary, we're making great progress in terms of operational excellence, but that is a multiyear journey and making good steps along the way. Rob, I couldn't be more proud of what the sales force has done. I mean, your momentum and share gains and really taking it to competitors in an aggressive but fun and fair way is going to continue, and that feels very, very good. Record revenues, earnings, growing profits faster than sales. I don't think it could have been a much better quarter in terms of the trends, and I appreciate your comments on that. Five foundational priorities, there are always elements in foundational priorities we want to do better in, and you probably have a feel for those. But they were solid this quarter, and a couple I want to see us do a better job on. Unusual balance in terms of geography, customer segments and products, given what's occurring on a global basis. Our watch-outs and caveats are largely macro or spending within a category type of comment. And I think you'll hear from our customers and you see it by how they view us as opposed to an individual product company, an innovation company with innovative products and innovative way to help them solve their type of business needs and with the core intelligent networks made up of routing and switching and other devices that our peers don't have integrated together. And at the present time, we've done exactly what we outlined in our 2- to 3-year plan for the first couple of quarters. We said we're going to focus on the 5 foundational priorities. We made good progress on all 5. We said we'll become more innovative and move faster. We've done that well. We said we're going to be simpler for our customers, which we already had the best customer relationships, but boy, Gary, we've made good progress there. And Joe Pinto and Randy Pond deserve multiple gold stars, as well as everybody else, working toward that. And we're moving with a faster speed on innovation and our ability to get tighter to our customers and the value we bring is there. So I would summarize it as a solid quarter. It's just one step along the journey. We don't want to get too far ahead of our headlights, especially given what we're hearing from our peers. And while I'm a little bit more optimistic on Europe, a little bit is just a little bit. They get serious challenges they have to address, especially for Southern Europe, on that. And the federal spending is going to be tough. I think India will work its way out. So it's a nice summary back on what we can control or influence. I'd give us reasonably good marks on it. I want to see us do better. On the other issues, we have to be conservative, as we've always been, in terms of interfacing to you. Please give Mel and team and myself and others feedback, both today and tomorrow as well as ongoing, on what you think we have to improve on, the value of the call, have we got it about right in terms of how we had prepared comments and then Q&A and any other constructive criticism, either in terms of the direction of the company or in terms of making the call even more effective for you. We're very open. So with that, Mel, let me turn it back to you.","Melissa Selcher","Great. Thanks, John, and thanks, Gary, Frank and Rob.
