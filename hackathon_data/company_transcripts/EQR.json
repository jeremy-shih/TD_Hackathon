Today' conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead.","Marty McKenna","Thank you, Cynthia.","Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's third quarter 2016 results. Our featured speakers today are David Neithercut, our President and CEO; David Santee, our Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Parrell, our Chief Financial Officer. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.","I'll now turn it over to David Neithercut.","David Neithercut","Thanks Marty. Good morning everyone, thank you for joining us this morning's call. As we discussed over the last several quarters, 2016 will not turn out to be a year we had originally expected due to elevated levels of new supply in both San Francisco and New York City which combined made up a large share of our initial growth forecast for the year. And as a result after five years of extraordinary strong fundamentals, revenue growth this year will now be more in line with long-term historical trends.","Good news however is that exceptionally strong demand continues unabated across our markets with current occupancies remaining at or near 96% and lower exposure on the horizon. Turnover across all markets when excluding same property movement is actually decreased for the first nine months of the year compared to the same period last year. Move outs to buy single-family homes remain a non-factor in our high cost of housing markets and our recently completed development properties are absorbing units to significantly faster and at rates above or closer to our original expectations.","Furthermore while our markets have experienced the slowdown in the growth of high income jobs, the absolute number of new high income jobs remains relatively strong and our preliminary indications that the trend may be reversing. Perhaps more importantly for the first time since recovery began there are abundant times and wage growth occurring in all the industries across the country which obviously the very good signs of the apartment business.","So as we look forward to what we see as peak deliveries next year, our teams across the country will work very hard in carrying for our existing residence, welcoming prospects and trying them into new residence and we remain extraordinarily excited about the outlook for our business, portfolio and the company.","So with that said, we\u2019ll let David Santee go into more details on what we\u2019re seeing across our markets today.","David Santee","Okay, thank you David. Good morning everyone. Today I'll update you our Q3 results, discuss the current state of each market which we operate as well as providing additional color on 2017 deliveries.","As David said, demand for quality apartments remain pretty robust with occupancies and our markets averaging 96 or better and resident turnover continuing to decline. Year-to-date turnover net of same property transfers decreased 30 basis points versus the 10 basis point increase and the gross turnover that we reported demonstrated the strong customer satisfaction that are fully strived to deliver each and every day and the great locations our portfolio continues to enjoy.","Renewal rates achieved for the quarter continued to be well above historical averages at 5.3% while new lease over least pricing was plus 90 basis points. Combined results were in line with our revised expectations at 3.1%.","Moving on to the market, in Seattle new lease over lease growth average 4.9% for the quarter while renewals achieved were 8.1%. Seattle continues to distinguish itself as the epicenter of cloud computing services as Amazon remains the catalyst with the rapid downtown expansion of both jobs and new apartment deliveries. Through August Seattle, Bellevue and Redmond realize job growth of 3.50% that allows 7,200 apartment deliveries this year to be easily absorbed with virtually zero pricing pressure.","Now with 7,000 new deliveries expected in '17 and job growth well above the national average, we see Seattle is our best revenue growth market next year. Again easy job, Amazon job openings is a proxy for demand. Last week there were 8,000 openings in Seattle almost double from same time last year, 3300 of which are for high paying software developer positions.","This concentration of intellectual capital is also forcing the large well established tech companies to expand their presence in Seattle to better compete for talent.","Microsoft, the region's second largest employer, recently committed to a significant investment in a new artificial intelligent's group and most recently announced record operating results. With cloud computing in early innings and Boeing the areas of largest employer having a seven year backlog in airplane production, Seattle is poised for continued growth as rents are the lowest of all the markets in which we operate likely delivering strong revenue results that are slightly lower next year.","Then the San Francisco, while operations were quite volatile during the summer peak leasing season, where recently the market has been more stable across the key drivers of revenue growth. Occupancy has improved to 96% versus the low 95% that we saw only a few months ago. The percent of residents renewing are at peak levels and contrary to some reports of rents being down double digits, our San Francisco portfolio average asking rents are down only 1.4% versus same week last year.","Growth in higher paying tech jobs as not as robust as 2015 but the growth is nonetheless positive and while VC capital investment has slowed, the actual amount of VC funds available for investment have increased. All the fundamentals are still in place for the market to absorb 2017 deliveries. However elevated supply and a slower pace of VC investment that drives the tech segment will continue to have a negative impact on pricing power in sub markets that see the most deliveries.","Achieved renewal rates for the quarter in San Francisco were 6.2%, new lease over lease rate averaged minus 30 basis points. The modest increase and turnover is more than accounted for about same property transfers. Netting this out year-to-date turnover has actually declined 70 basis points on top of the improvement we saw last year.","2017 we\u2019ll see the market deliver 8400 new apartments with deliveries that are less concentrated then in 2016. In the downtown areas some will see 50% fewer units delivered with the balance spread across Mission Bay and the Dogpatch areas.","The mid Peninsula will also be more disbursed with only 1600 units spread across all directions of San Mateo and Redwood City. San Jose and Santa Clara will see the majority of deliveries in South Bay and with the less geographically competitive with our same store portfolio.","Based on current delivery estimates, the 2017 supply appears to be more frontloaded in the year which means most of the supply will begin leasing up and periods of peak demand. San Francisco remains ground zero for innovation and tech stalwarts continue to expand their footprint. As artificial intelligent and the Internet-of-Things continues to grow less, we expect San Francisco continued to lead the world in tech and overcome any short term challenges with supply.","Time and time again San Francisco has proven to come back faster and stronger than peak to the past but we would expect San Fran to deliver revenue growth in 2017 that is much lower than 2016.","Dropping down to LA, job growth continues to be very strong but is dominated more by lower paying hospitality and leisure sector. However, as downtown LA focuses on its Renaissance efforts and Silicon Beach continues to develop and build out the higher paying professional services sector is expected to lead job growth through 2020.","As non-traditional entertainment content continues to grow, Southern California is poised to capture this additional investment as well. Demand for apartments continues to be strong with occupancy across our LA portfolio at 96.3%. Renewal rates achieved for the quarter were 6.8% and new lease over lease growth was 2.5% on lower turnover for the quarter.","Based on current estimates, LA will see peak deliveries of 10,000 units during 2017 with over 80% of these units spread across three sub markets. Downtown Hollywood will represent 50% of the 80%, Glendale-Pasadena, 20% of the 80% and then Koreatown mid-Wilshire at 14% of the 80%. To-date deliveries in the urban core and west LA have had modest impact on revenue growth which today is in the 3% to 5% range.","As LA continues to add sully the urban core, downtown continues to be more attractive lifestyle that has been non-existed for many years. With virtually no units been delivered this year or next, the East and West San Fernando Valley, Ventura County and Inland Empire continue to show signs of accelerated revenue growth upwards up 6% to 7% for the current month billings.","For 2017 we would expect greater LA counting to deliver modest renewable revenue growth, pressured by the level of new supply in the urban core. Orange County at 96% occupancy today achieved renewals for the quarter of 7.6% and that was the strongest across our portfolio and new lease - over lease growth of 4.4%.","After taking a breather from elevated deliveries in 2015 and for the most part 2016, Orange County is expected to deliver 5700 units in 2017 and about 50% concentration in Irvine, Newport Beach sub market and the balance spread from Anaheim up through Huntington Beach.","With almost 65% of our portfolio in South Orange County, we would expect slightly lower revenue growth as a result of the concentration of deliveries at urban where we have 35% of our revenues.","San Diego was extremely strong job growth in the first half of the year has seen strong demand for apartments with very little supply. San Diego is distinguishing itself as the life science medical device tech manufacturing center and continues to have high paying jobs in these sectors albeit at a slower rate.","Second, only the Orange County achieved renewal rate growth for the quarter averaged 7.4% with new lease over lease growth of 4.4%, again on lower turnover. San Diego will deliver 2300 units in 2017 which appear to be disbursed equally between downtown and the I15 corridor on lower expected job growth. The I-15 sub market is already showing modest deceleration and we would expect revenue results in '17 to be somewhat lower next year.","Jumping over to Boston, as we previously said 2016 would be a window of opportunity in the urban core and especially Cambridge where deliveries were few. Today that has played out where we have seen modest deceleration and revenue growth with more pressure on rents in the suburbs than downtown. New lease over lease growth of 1.6% for Q3 was the strongest quarter since Q3 of '15. Achieved renewal rate growth was 4.9% and again on lower turnover.","As Boston continues to position itself as a major tech, biotech hub and an endorsement with the GE headquarter relocation, the future of Boston and professional services job growth is very bright as professional services sectors moves from 35% of jobs created to 45% of new jobs created this year. In the near term Boston is expected to deliver approximately 6200 units in 2017 split evenly between Downtown Cambridge and then North and West Suburbs.","Given the concentrations of the new supply to our portfolio, we see continued deceleration across the market and expect revenue growth to be lower than 2016. New York for the quarter achieved an average renewal rates of 3% and minus 2% on new lease, over lease growth, again on slightly lower turnover. With the trend toward affordability over neighborhood loyalty, prospective renters are proving to be more flexible in where they choose to live.","To-date 55% of the 2016 deliveries have been absorbed. Concessions have yet to become widespread and appear to be more targeted to specific unit types at stabilized communities. The Upper West Side and West Side down to Chelsea are currently the weakest neighborhoods in our portfolio and are delivering slightly negative revenue growth for the current month.","The New York MSA will see 14,000 units in 2017 and to clarify these are units that are identified and so very considerably to be within the competitive boundaries decline by our portfolio. It will not match the higher MSA numbers provided by third party data shops. It should be no surprise that Brooklyn will deliver the lion\u2019s share of new units where we have less than 8% of total New York Metro revenue, followed by a Long Island City, where we have no presence, Midtown West will deliver a good portion as Hudson Yard comes online and then the Hudson Waterfront, specifically Jersey City.","These four submarkets were account for a little more than 70% of all deliveries with a balance spread across various Manhattan neighborhoods. While there has been lingering pressures on the financial services sector, high paying tech jobs and venture capital continued to migrate to the area. Some believe that Brexit could bring back additional financial services jobs and that would be a good thing.","While supply pressures are driven largely by the expiration of the 421a program, the lack of any existing replacement legislation will create a scenario and the near future of significantly reduced supply. With expectations of more affordability in any future legislation and increasing concession cost is hard to imagine deliveries that come close to historical norms. Given all these factors and the deceleration we see today, we see New York as our worst performing market with the high probability of revenue growth turning negative during the year.","Last but not least the, DC, the metro area continues to improve, coming off of best job growth since 2008 out of our 10 submarkets are currently delivering accelerated revenue growth where our current month of growth exceeds year-to-date growth anywhere from the 100 to 300 basis points. For the quarter renewal rates achieved were 4.6%, the strongest in the last seven quarters and new lease over lease growth was plus 20 basis points again the strongest in seven quarters with flat occupancy and turnover.","With expectations of future job growth being very favorable and over half of the 10,000 units being delivered concentrated in the Southeast and Southwest submarkets we would expect continued favorable absorption and accelerating revenue growth in the submarkets and which we operate. Like LA and living in Downtown DC, 10 years ago was not a consideration for most as more apartments come online, more restaurants and activities are creating an urban environment that did not exist previously, brining in suburban renters who find downtown more attractive and active lifestyle, given the traffic congestion and commuting costs that currently exist in the region. We expect the acceleration revenue growth that we see today to continue into next year.","And in closing 2017 revenue growth were certainly be lower than 2016. Job growth and job sectors will just take the ability of each marker to absorb these levels of elevated supply. The degree of management sophistication and discipline will determine how we price it and overall impact to revenue growth. With occupancies still in the 96% range, demand remains strong, but elevated supplies that are not supported by the necessary job growth will face varying degrees of pricing pressure in the near-term.","So with that said, I will turn it over to Mark Parrell. Mark?","Mark Parrell","Thank you, David. Today, I will be giving some color behind our same-store expense growth in the quarter and on normalized FFO guidance and I\u2019m going to move on to talk a bit about our recent debt deal. On the same-store expense side, we moved our annual same-store expense range to 2.8% to 3.2%, which moved the center of our range back to the mid-point of our original February guidance range and to the high-end of our July guidance range of 2.5% to 3%.","This is the relatively modest change for us, 25 basis points in annual expense growth is about $1.5 million. Our same-store expenses through June 30 grew at a rate of only 0.9%, therefore as we mentioned on the second quarter call, we always expected our second half expenses to grow at a considerably higher rate somewhere in the mid 4% range in order to meet our July guidance range of 2.5% to 3%.","In a moment I will give some detail on payroll expense and on leasing and advertising expense which were the two main drivers of our change in expense guidance. But first I want to mention one of the bigger drivers of our overall same-store expense growth this year and that\u2019s the recent adverse legal decision regarding the calculation of property taxes for several of our properties in Jersey City that I noted on our second quarter call. The same-store impact of this decision was an increase of 2016 annual real estate tax expense of $1.6 million.","We were aware of this and maintaining our same-store expense range of 2.5% to 3% back in July, but still thought that we could stay within that range. So overall for 2016, we expect property tax expense to grow by 6%. So getting back to the change in same-store expense guidance on the payroll side, cost in the third quarter were about $1 million more than we had originally planned because we ran our properties in the third quarter at higher employment levels to keep our properties competitive in some of these challenging markets. We also made aggressive efforts to retain our field personnel in the face of the great demand for them in our markets as new supply gets delivered and needs to be staffed up.","In the leasing and advertising lines, we incurred promotional expenses at the high-end of our expectations mostly in New York and San Francisco in response to higher supply in these markets. This heightened spending of about $1 million included about $670,000 in gift cards given to new residents and payment of broker commissions on a few high rent units. We did anticipate some gift card usage in the third quarter, but the order of magnitude is higher than we expected back in July.","We also spend a bit more on internet listing services in the quarter. Please do remember that higher occupancy in 2015 and we are able to reduce such spending in the comparable quarter. We expect additional promotional spending to continue in the fourth quarter though at a lesser pace. So just an accounting note, those rules, the accounting rules require that we account for gift card spending as an expense.","However, if we have accounting for the cards is a reduction in revenue, the impact of the Company\u2019s results would have been a reduction in quarterly same-store revenue of 12 basis points which would have reduced our reported 3.4% quarterly same-store revenue growth number to 3.3%. The impact on our full year same-store revenue as a result of the gift cards we gave in the third quarter the ones I just discussed and that we expect to give in the fourth quarter will be even less about 5 basis points if they were to be treated as a contra to revenue.","So now I\u2019m going to switch over and talk about move-in concessions on our same-store portfolio and those we do treat as reductions in revenue, so again on the same-store portfolio in the third quarter we gave approximately $190,000 versus in these concessions versus the $235,000 in move-in concessions we gave in the third quarter of 2015.","In terms of the sensitivity of our revised guidance range or expense range, leasing and advertising and payroll are the two likely pressure points that can move our annual expenses for the higher end of our new range of 2.8% to 3.2%. On the leasing and advertising side, we expect less gift card spending for the rest of the year because of the lower turnover we expect in the fourth quarter and our strong current occupancy. If we are incorrect in these assumptions, our expense growth could be pressured.","Another possible pressure point is the payroll cost continues to escalate due to wage pressure or service levels required by heightened competition in our markets. On the revenue side, we have left our mid-point of 3.75% unchanged and David Santee has already provided you bit of color on that. ","We just fine-tuned a few other guidance numbers, so we will just talk about that for a minute and we continue to see normalized FFOs remain within our prior range that we narrow that range as we customarily do at this time of year. Our current annual normalized FFO midpoint of $3.08 per share is nearly identical to the $3.10 per share midpoint of the range we originally gave you back in February as reductions in same-store NOI were offset by changes in transaction timing and amounts.","Now just a note on our debt deal. On October 12, we closed on a $500 million 10-year unsecured note offering with a coupon of 2.85% and an all in effective rate of approximately 3.1% which includes underwriter's fees and the termination of a small interest rate hedge we had. There is great demand for this debt and we printed the lowest tenure in our history and one of the lowest ever by a REIT and we thank our unsecured bond investors for their support of the company.","Proceeds from this issuance was used to for working capital and general corporate purposes. Our projected combined line of credit and commercial papers amount outstanding for those two combined at December 31, 2016 is now anticipated to be 130 million versus the 430 million we previously estimated back in July and that's due to proceeds from the $500 million debt deal, reducing line usage and that\u2019s offset by a net $100 million reduction in disposition proceeds that we now expect in 2016.","So I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Cynthia for the question and answer period.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Nick Yulico from UBS.","Nick Yulico","Thanks everyone. I think the primary worry for your company and some of the other multi-family REITs remains New York City and San Francisco and how bad these markets can get in 2017. You gave some commentary on it, but I was hoping to get some more parameters on how you're thinking about the downside for same-store revenue or rent growth in these two markets next year.","Mark Parrell","I believe we probably said and we intend to say at this junction Nick and we'll save more in detail, more color than we actually given, more complete guidance on our next quarter conference call. I think David was pretty clear about directionally what was happening in the supply and what have been happening in jobs et cetera and so what our expectations would directionally but we won\u2019t go any further than that at this time.","Nick Yulico","Okay. And then could you just remind us for those markets what the assumptions are for fourth quarter, this year same-store revenue growth?","Mark Parrell","I'm sorry. Do you mean the overall or by market?","Nick Yulico","For San Francisco and New York separately what were the assumptions for fourth quarter this year?","Mark Parrell","I am going to talk just for a second about the overall assumption. So our guidance is wise about a 3% fourth quarter same-store revenue number, about a 4.5% or so same-store expense number in the fourth quarter. I am not sure if we have market-by-market numbers right here in front of us and we don\u2019t.","Nick Yulico","Okay. And then just going back to, David, if we think about multi-family valuations in the private market, do you think cap rates have changed in the past year for your core markets, particularly in New York or San Francisco, if rent growth has come down? Do you think, if you were to sell assets in those markets today versus a year ago, has the pricing changed?","David Neithercut","I think it's tough to tell, Nick, I am not sure if there has been sufficient price discovery but if there has been some modest change in cap rates I am not sure that it\u2019s had a big impact on value. We've had even San Francisco we'll still have strong decent NOI growth on a year-over-year basis so any modest change in cap rates they don\u2019t necessarily mean value so they have decreased.","We've certainly seen fewer players in the marketplace looking for assets but I will tell you, not a week goes by when Alan George is not showing me some deal that traded at some very strong price across these markets. So we're watching it closely. Certainly revenues not growing at the same rate, bottom lines are not growing at the same rate that they had but bottom lines by large they'll continue to improve, continue to grow. There continues to be a need or demand for yield, and so when you do trade they continue to trade fairly strong pricing.","Nick Yulico","Okay. So given that's the case, that valuation seems to be holding up in the private market and your stock is at a big discount to NAV, what point do you think about, does the Board think about, selling more assets, doing a stock buyback to exploit that arbitrage in pricing? And also, did the asset sales year-to-date and the special dividend delay any sort of process you might have had to sell assets this year and do a buyback to force that discussion until 2017? Thanks.","David Neithercut","In response to the answer of your second question, no, I can tell you that very specifically as the Board table as we talked about large portfolio sale and the special dividend, distribution back to shareholders, we spoke very specifically with the Board that, that did not - would not impact any other things that the steps we might take to address the discount that you know.","So those things are not - we're not precluded by having done what we did do. In terms of when does the Board do that, there is no bright line, every situation will be different but I can tell you I guess I have on this most recent call and the call even before that, that we talk about that at the Board level. And the Board just believes that that activity we requires probably a bigger discount than what many on the street might suggest there what answers they get with their arithmetic.","We got a significant amount of gain built into most of our assets and that there is just not a lot of capacity after - we are doing things on debt neutral basis and distributing - dealing with the gains actually buy much stock back with the proceeds.","And then with respect to borrowing to buy stock back that these are - you get relatively few bites of the apple and we want to make sure that if and when we do, there will be appropriate time. And we'll continue to monitor this as we do on a regular and consistent basis with the Board and we'll \u2013 makes sense to do something down the road, we are certainly - we would be willing to do that.","We've done in the past and we certainly will do so in the future if the circumstances are large and we talked about it with the Board all the time but in terms of when exactly what's the bright line I can't tell you that's we'll know when we see it.","Nick Yulico","All right. Thanks, David.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citi.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. Giving the operating environment is at inflection point, how do you think about setting the 2017 same-store revenue growth guidance range? Historically, you've had a pretty tight range of 75 to 100 basis points for that initial range. So how wide could that be in 2017?","David Neithercut","Well, I guess I won't say how wide it could be, but I'll tell you it will likely be lighter to your point. We acknowledged that by now operating in fewer markets. There is risk of more volatility in those - in our results and that we will likely provide wider guidance and what we have been able to do in the past. In terms of how wide that will be, will be same and you will certainly see when we share those results with you with that guidance on our next earnings call.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. And then just appreciate the details on the concessions and the gift cards. But from an operating standpoint, how do you think about incentivizing with free rent versus using gift cards or other basic incentives?","David Santee","Nick, this is David Santee. As we've always said even in the last downturn, we were very committed to our net effective price again that is our preferred method of pricing because it provides complete transparency, it's easier to manage from here.","So that will always be our tried and true method. Occasionally, you get into some submarkets or different owners that do different things that cater to certain niches in our prospect base, and we try to stick to our guns as far as net effective pricing, but at times we find it we have to kind of match the market.","And I think that's been our philosophy for the last seven or eight years and that will be our philosophy going forward.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. And just finally on supply, I appreciate the detailed walk through by market. But if you step back and think about all of your markets blended together, what are your expectations for next year\u2019s supply deliveries of the urban versus suburban sub markets? I think we heard from one of your peers yesterday that they think there will be two times the amount of supply in urban submarkets as suburban?","David Neithercut","Well, I guess I would say that we just \u2013 we don\u2019t necessarily look at it urban, suburban. We look at it as what set of properties are in a reasonable and conservative geographic area that could potentially compete with us and probably New York is a great example of where we have nothing in Long Island City. There will be a lot of new supply in Long Island City and the price point maybe very attractive that could draw people from Brooklyn or Manhattan or what have you and the Long Island City just because of an affordability issue. So I mean all in numbers for 2017 are 65,000 units. I would say a very high percentage of those are in the urban core.","Q \u2013 Nick Yulico","Thanks.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI.","Rich Hightower","Hi, good morning, guys. I want to go back to one of the prepared comments related to San Francisco, I think when David Santee was giving the market detail there. I thought I picked up on some comments around a potential stabilization there. Is that accurate, just in terms of how new and renewals are trading today, or is that just a function of lower turnover at this point in the leasing season, or a shift in timing of supply, or some other factor?","David Santee","Well, I guess I would say stable relative to what we experienced over the past four or five months. I would say certainly not \u2013 the market is not moving back up, it\u2019s kind of moving sideways right now. But we started off with going from rent that were up 5%, 6% that within a couple of months went down to negative 2%.","We saw occupancies that were well above 96% fall off over a 100 basis points in the peak leasing season, which is not a time that you would expect lower demand. So the market just zigging and zagging for most of the summer, and so today our exposure is right back where it was, our occupancies for the most part right on top of last year.","We don\u2019t see any crazy pricing mechanisms in the market, I mean the newbies up will continue to offer the one, one and a half months free rent and we expect that. But for the most part, I would really just say the market appears to be more disciplined today, instead of stable, it\u2019s just more disciplined today than it has been over the last four months.","Rich Hightower","All right, would you say then that properties that are in lease up currently, the market overall is just getting a little more rational, in that sense? So it would indeed be a positive change that we could sort of extrapolate from here or anything else?","David Santee","Yes, I mean you had a very large concentration of assets in the SoMa area, which really trickled across, as well as South San Francisco and I go back to the kind of original underwriting where the market rent growth in San Francisco are out paced underwriting or new assets. I mean even looking at our own assets the market went well above what we underwrote on our new delivery.","So owners had a lot of wiggle room to price discover. There hasn\u2019t really been any high rise brand new vertical class, great views with the way assets delivered in San Francisco for years. So there was some element of price discovery and I feel like some could have probably achieved higher rents when you look at the pace of lease up.","So I think you'll see, obviously you'll see less of that type of product. In 2017 probably more podium, traditional development that you see down in San Jose what have you and pricing should - we expect and hope that it would be more reasonable than what we saw last year or this year.","Rich Hightower","All right. That's actually very helpful color. Second, and final question, it's another twist on the 2017 question. But would you guys be able to rank order your markets next year, just in terms of top to bottom, strongest versus weakest?","David Neithercut","Okay. At Seattle we would expect it would be the best. I think Southern \u2013 all three of the Southern California markets would probably be in the middle. Boston would probably be below that and there would be a wide range between SoCal and Boston. Well, actually we want to put D.C. before Boston, I'm sorry. So D.C. would be between SoCal and Boston. D.C. continues to improve, great acceleration, great job growth. Boston will be at the bottom and probably only slightly above our worst market New York.","Rich Hightower","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Conor Wagner with Green Street Advisors.","Conor Wagner","Good morning. I noticed that you guys are offering some 24-month leases in New York and in the Bay area. What was the uptake on that? And is that something that you're going to continue to offer going into 2017?","Mark Parrell","So we've tried in different ways we had a better take rate with no step up we've tried it with built in step ups. I think our customer is well educated enough to know what's going on in the market. So when we built in the step up meaning you know call it 2% or 3% increase in year two, our take rate bill to basically zero.","So you know we did that in D.C. When we expected rates to fall in D.C. we had probably in the neighborhood of 15% take rate. That's what we're seeing today is about 15% take rate and we will continue to you know experiment with that, but monitoring so that we don't you know get to committed.","Conor Wagner","And in the Bay Area how is the performance of your East Bay assets versus the overall Bay area versus San Francisco.","Mark Parrell","The East Bay is you know obviously the best I thing you know when we just look at you know were we flip today I mean obviously you know we were if not - if not the accelerating as such as example year-to-date East Bay is 7.5% on revenue growth the current month, buildings are 5%. So the East Bay still hanging I mean obviously Berkeley is helping that as well.","Conor Wagner","And then a question for David Neithercut. You mentioned the challenges of doing a stock buyback due to the gains. What do you view as your most attractive use of capital going into 2017?","David Neithercut","All right now complaining our developments we've made a significant amount of money we will make a significant amount of money on the developments and we've got yet to complete and much of the free cash flow that we have for the next couple of years we\u2019ll complete that and we make significant returns. In fact we\u2019ve got a page in the most recent investor information we put up on our website. It sort of shows how we\u2019ve done throughout the cycle.","And then after that we\u2019ve not started much development at all so that the development spend will slow. We continue to do very well with our redevelopment, with our kind of kitchen and bath rehab spend that\u2019s been up 50 plus or so million dollar of spend per year which we\u2019ve been realizing very strong low-to-mid double-digit returns for the foreseeable future and we look at those as great uses of capital.","Connor Wagner","And then as kitchen and bath spend has been elevated this year versus last year, have there been any markets that you've been particularly focused in with that, or has it been broad-based?","David Neithercut","It\u2019s been rather broad based.","Connor Wagner","Okay. And do you have an estimate on what contribution that's been to revenue growth this year?","Mark Parrell","Year-to-date Connor its Mark Parrell. It\u2019s 10 basis points and remember it varies around that. It can be zero to 20. It doesn\u2019t move the meter that considerably.","David Santee","Just to be clear, when we talk about this program because others talk about programs that they call rehab or whatever. We\u2019re spending depending on the property $10,000 to maybe $14,000 per door on kitchen and baths. This is not the $30,000, $60,000, $80,000 a door total renovation that some people undertake. We may remove that from same-store. And if we did, we have done that very limited, we removed that from same-store ourselves when we do something of that magnitude.","Connor Wagner","Thank you guys very much.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Wans Nabria with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Wans Nabria","Good morning. I was hoping you could comment a little bit on the performance of A\u2019s and B\u2019s you're seeing across the market and maybe specifically between New York and San Francisco?","David Santee","Well, I guess I would say that San Francisco especially all of our communities kind of down the Peninsula what have you, are mostly be communities, garden communities. I am not sure it\u2019s about A\u2019s and B\u2019s. I think it\u2019s more about location, supply, pricing of that supply, so there is no definitive obvious answer to your question.","Wans Nabria","And across the portfolio? Any comments you could make about A versus B?","David Neithercut","Again it\u2019s sub market by sub market. We can tell you that one sub market maybe doing, as David just did about downtown San Francisco versus East Bay but that\u2019s more sub market versus sub market rather than A versus B.","David Santee","I mean a lot of it has to do with market momentum. I mean, you look at our DC portfolio in the District. We have high end building that we bought in the last downturn that were built to condo and specs that are doing just as well as the 30-year-old old Charles E. Smith portfolio up Connecticut Avenue. So again it\u2019s probably more about location and the impact of supply.","Wans Nabria","Okay. Great. Thank you. And you made some comments earlier about concessions and gift cards. But if we combine those two, what was the change 2017 over 2016, and do you have those numbers for New York and San Fran?","Mark Parrell","Well I gave it. It\u2019s Mark Parrell, for the whole portfolio a moment ago. And it would have moved the number 0.10, so 0.10 lower. We actually have lower concessions than we had last year. So that isn\u2019t going to make any difference. The concessions right now are $100,000 a quarter. They\u2019re just not that material. They were more than significant first quarter of this year.","Wans Nabria","And that includes the gift cards, or that's a separate bucket?","Mark Parrell","Gift cards and expenses accounted for under leasing and adverting. Concessions are accounted for the month that they\u2019re given as a reduction in revenue.","Wans Nabria","But if you combine the two, because they're essentially kind of getting to the same ends\u2026","Mark Parrell","You have combined the two because the same-store revenue numbers reported on a cash basis and then the deduction is already made for the concession. So all you need to do is subtract the gift cards which was the number I gave earlier.","Wans Nabria","Got you. Okay, thank you for that. And just one quick question on kind of 2017 and how we should be thinking about renewal spreads versus new with how you're thinking about things today or maybe for the fourth quarter and kind of how that may trend going forward?","Mark Parrell","Well, I guess I would say kind of going back to the last downturn which is probably the best comparison. We were still able to maintain positive renewal growth. And most recently DC which is probably a market that \u2013 many markets could mirror in the next year we were able to achieve high 2s to mid 3s on renewals. So I think regardless of what the markets do we should be able to achieve favorable renewal revenue growth.","Wans Nabria","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Rob Stevenson with Janney.","Rob Stevenson","Good morning guys. A few questions away from San Francisco and New York, if I might. David Santee, I think when you were talking in your prepared comments about DC, you mentioned, I think, 8 of 10 of the sub markets there showing strong growth or accelerating growth. Can you just talk a little bit about those two that aren't, what are they and is that just all supply related?","David Santee","Yes, it is. Let me get to it. Give me one second.","Rob Stevenson","Well, let me ask David Neithercut a question, while you're flipping ahead. David, you sold the Berkeley land parcel. It looks like you've got $115 million in the supplement of land for development in the future. How many projects is that? Or are we likely to see any of that starting in the next couple of quarters?","David Neithercut","It\u2019s possible. We got some land sites in Boston that were really \u2013 land sites where densely, we were able to carve out of the existing deals that we had previously acquired that could create some development potential. But we\u2019re going to watch this all very, very closely Rob. We started very little this year after running about $1 billion average in 2013 and 2014, we cut that by almost two-thirds in 2015 and cut it by another two-thirds in 2016. We\u2019re down considerably.","So we\u2019re going to watch all that very carefully. And I am not saying that we were not going to start anything, but whatever that starts will be, at least the present time will de minimis relative to what we have been doing.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And then one for Mark in terms of, what's the $0.05 difference between the fourth quarter guidance on a NAREIT in a normalized FFO basis?","Mark Parrell","So that\u2019s the \u2013 we moved Rob from the third quarter the sale of a piece of land that\u2019s in the Northeast, so that\u2019s the $0.05 difference.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And back to David Santee on DC.","David Santee","Okay. The two markets that are not accelerating are the Bethesda Chevy Chase market which represents about two or three properties for us, 9% of revenue and then far out Fairfax which is 5% of revenue. So the bulk of our revenue in DC is accelerating.","Rob Stevenson","And that's just because those two sub markets are getting hit with supply, or is the demographics moving away from that? What are you identifying as the primary issues there?","David Santee","So Fairfax I would say is probably more supply, Bethesda is probably more of a demographic.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. All right. Perfect. I appreciate it, guys.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Tom Lesnick with Capital One Securities.","Tom Lesnick","Hi, Thanks for taking my question. Most of them have already been answered, but just curious on the financing side. You guys clearly have one of the lowest cost of capital of all REITs, and I think the most recent bond deal is indicative of that. But on the working capital side, how do you guys think about using the mix of your line and commercial paper? And are there specific instances in which you would be compelled to use one over the other?","Mark Parrell","Hi, it\u2019s Mark Parrell. Thanks for that question Tom. So right now, we have about $200 million of commercial paper outstanding and nothing outstanding underline of credit. And I'll tell you the main reason, we use the CP program is that it's another talk in a money and right now which is vastly cheap. CP now has being priced at LIBOR plus 30 basis points, on line a credit it\u2019s LIBOR plus 95. We are saving more than half a percent on that. So the way we think about using the CP is an adjunct to our line of credit and when it is cheaper or that market is cheaper for some reason or better for some other reason we will use the CP capability that we have.","Tom Lesnick","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","We will have next from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Tayo Okusanya","Good morning. Two quick ones from me. First of all, again back to New York and San Francisco. In regards to underlying trends for renewals, I think everyone gets the fact that for new leases, rental rates have come down a lot. Could you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing with renewals? Has the situation with new rents caused existing tenants also to start to become more aggressive about asking for concessions or lower rents, or what have you when they come up for renewal? And how do you see that playing out going into 2017?","David Neithercut","I think what we've seen over the eight or nine years that we've been tracking this is that, number one most residents are just programmed to expect some kind of increase from their landlord. Our expenses go up every year regardless of what happens with revenue. The other thing we see is that - the two things that people don't like most are negotiating or conflict and moving.","So we see a vast majority as long as we send out reasonable requests you know a great percentage of people will check the box and choose to renew so that they don't have to relocate and go to the hassle of moving. And then there's you know then there's a very small percentage those are always the holdouts that you know kind of renew with the very last minute. And you know there are people that are well educated on what's going on in the market and those are the pros that you have to work with.","Tayo Okusanya","Okay. But as a subset of people where there may be some pressure, but again, it's just a subset.","David Neithercut","Yes, the majority, again assuming were reasonable. It's played out the same we've tracked it year-after-year it's a pretty solid trend.","Tayo Okusanya","Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then just another quick one, just in the Bay area and San Francisco again, a lot of conversation around increased rent control initiatives showing up on the ballots during the election season. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing from that perspective, and what could be the potential risk to your portfolio out there?","David Neithercut","Sure. So in terms of you work the exposure that we have it's about three property 6.4% of total NOI of San Francisco only. Okay, so it's very small percentage of the total portfolio. I would tell you that the details are unclear. As an example Mountain View has two separate items on the ballot, one is put forth by to the council and the other one is a just a voter initiative both of which have two different approaches to any potential outcomes.","So that's all that I can tell you today. So we will just have to wait and see what the outcome is on the election and you know ultimately what the fine print will be.","Tayo Okusanya","Okay, much appreciate it, thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay","Good morning, guys. Do you think increased regulation of Airbnb could lead to another step down in demand? As you look to formulate your guidance, is this something you might contemplate? And it looks like you guys might be doing some pilot programs with Airbnb. Do you have a sense of how much overall room demand you get from Airbnb?","David Santee","This is David Santee, I guess I would say that you know the legislation that occurred in New York City I believe is a benefit to us. Historically you know the state would, or the city, I am sorry, would find the building owner if any transient rentals were discovered and transient rentals mean anything less than 30 days. ","On the other hand they do allow sharing as long as the owner is in occupancy, so I am not really sure how that gets policed and so I would say to what extent it affects Airbnb, I am not sure. But we do have a pilot, one property, we continue to learn, we continue to understand how to build-out this platform to really for the purpose of transparency and control. This would not be a huge money maker for any particular owner or any particular property, this is more about transparency, control, managing something that is already happening and will happen regardless.","Wes Golladay","Okay, excellent. Do you think as a percentage of demand, it would be relatively small, the people that were in an apartment and then just sublet it out various nights on Airbnb, do you think that's a smaller part versus the people that maybe every once in a while, they're in the apartment and they just rent out the other room they have. Do you think that's a bigger part of the picture?","David Santee","Yes, I mean I don't know, I guess, I don\u2019t understand Airbnb that much, I know they kind of put out what percentages of people that rent out entire spaces and what percentage of people rent out rooms. I guess I would say if there is a large percentage of people that rent out their entire space in New York, then that's going to be a problem for them.","Wes Golladay ","Okay. I hear you. It's a hard one to track. Thanks a lot.","David Santee","Yes, and it\u2019s just not an important part of the overall picture for us. What being Airbnb is doing or not doing in any particular market has no impact on the way we think about our expected revenue for the upcoming year.","Wes Golladay","That's what I was trying to get at. It could be a component of a demand, and it could be just 1% or 10 Bips of overall city demand for people that want to run mini businesses from Airbnb\u2026","David Santee","We don\u2019t allow those people. So we don\u2019t allow anyone to rent an apartment from us with the sole purpose of running an Airbnb business.","David Neithercut","That is one of the benefits of the pilot is to have the transparency to prevent that.","Wes Golladay","Yes, that's exactly what I was trying to get at. So you don't have any of that subletting going on in your - unoccupied sub letting. Okay. That's what I was looking for. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley","Unidentified Analyst","This is [Ronald Camden] [ph] on Richard Hill's line. Thank you for your time. Just two quick ones from me. One, going back to DC, you mentioned bringing in suburban renters to downtown. Just curious which suburbs are they coming from? And is there a way to quantify that for us so we can get a sense?","David Neithercut","Yes, we did that a couple, I think a year or so ago when we saw tremendous absorption of units on top of virtually zero job growth. And we just picked the handful of properties and look to see where people's previous address was when they applied and what have you. And it was clear that lot of people were - I mean just around the gateway we are choosing to live in a city.","I mean we have our office at 1500 Mass Avenue, downtown DC, we moved it from Tysons Corner and then we have people to live out near Culpeper and what have you, And it can take them - it can take them two hours just to get to the bridge to get across the river and then another hour just to go get across the bridge to the office.","So, if you ever lived in DC, I live there three times, it's a very difficult place to get around and there is every reason in the world why someone would want to move from the suburbs into the city today.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. That's helpful. And then the last one, when I look at, take a step back looking at the portfolio of Southern California with same-store revenue growth above 5%, compared to New York, with the supply issues that you mentioned, when you think of longer term steady-state growth, what do those numbers look like? Is it one where, do they get to 3% to 4% type range. Where do you guys see a sustainable number for those two markets? Thanks.","David Neithercut","I guess, I won't talk about specifically about those markets but just in general in the markets in which we have elected to invest our capital and\u2026","Unidentified Analyst","Yes. That would be great.","David Neithercut","The presentation we put our website that does show over extended time period, the outside revenue growth in these markets, the outside increased in sort of underlying asset values in those markets compared to other markets.","So like I said about those specifically, but just long term outperformance of these coast and gateway cities in which we have invested relative to more commodity like markets in a country, in general we got several slides on our website that we'll address that for you.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. That's all for me. Thanks so much, guys.","Operator","And next we'll hear from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill","Thank you. The first question, sorry if I missed this, but did you give the new lease growth and renewal growth that was finalized for the third quarter for the company-wide?","David Neithercut","Yes, that was 3.1%.","Dennis McGill","Separately the new lease and then the renewal?","David Neithercut","Okay. So renewal yes - renewal was for the quarter - renewal rates achieved were 5.3% and new lease pricing was plus 90 basis points for combined number of 3.1%.","Dennis McGill","Perfect. And do you have the assumption that's baked into 4Q for those same numbers?","David Neithercut","No, we do not.","Dennis McGill","Separately, with regard to the development pipeline, just cost to go vertical, any kind of color you can provide on what you're seeing for both labor and material costs and all-in costs of vertical construction and how you guys think that might trend over the next 12 to 18 months?","David Santee","Well, across our market we are looking at the growth in hard in cost anywhere from 2% to as high as 6% and 7%. And that's on top of 3% to 7% growth or so a year ago. So we're looking at continued increase in cost a lot of that driven by labor and you know this is just another reason why we believe that we are going to see a reduction in starts and reduction in new deliveries going out, because land prices were up, the hard cost are up and those two yields are roughly low.","So we are certainly seeing solid middle or single digit growth. We are expecting growth year-over-year on top of on a light growth of one year ago.","Dennis McGill","And David, if you do get a pull back in supply, whether that's capital driven or some other reason, do you think there's an opportunity to that to alleviate some of this burden and lessen that cost increase?","David Neithercut","Well, I guess costs are just being driven, but what's going on in new supply. Labors being - these costs are being driven by what\u2019s going on lots of different places and in Boston lot it\u2019s been impact of some casino that\u2019s been built. So, it\u2019s not simply and only exclusively multifamily and but certainly I mean if there is a reduction you\u2019d expect there to be a modest some reduction in construction overall you'd expect to see this growth rate to moderate.","Dennis McGill","That's helpful. Appreciate guys.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. McKenna at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Marty McKenna","Well, thank you all, appreciate your time today. We look forward seeing many of you Phoenix, and go Cubs.","Operator","That concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead, sir.","Marty McKenna","Thank you, Ann. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's first quarter results. Our featured speakers today are, David Neithercut, our President and CEO; David Santee, our Chief Operating Officer and Mark Parrell, our CFO is here with us for the Q&A.","Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.","And now I'll turn it over to David Neithercut.","David Neithercut","Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. As reported in last night's earning release, our teams across the country did just a great job during the first quarter. Achieving 5% growth in same store revenue which was driven primarily by continuation of the strong occupancy that we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. We also did a terrific job on controlling expenses and delivered first quarter NOI growth of 7% and normalized FFO growth for the quarter of 11.3%. ","There is absolutely no doubt that we continue to enjoy very strong apartment demand across our core markets. And David Santee will go into much detail in just a moment. But the strength is been experienced in nearly every market in which we operate. Driven by all that which we\u2019ve talked about over the last several years, including modestly improving economy that help produced a million new jobs in the last four months, 3.3 million in the last year. The creation of new households by the millennial generation which is generating significant demand for rental housing which is not being met by new supply today and the desire of so many to live in 24x7 cities across the country that have very high cost for the single family home ownership. ","So, all in all multifamily fundamentals remain very favorable. The first quarter of 2015 produced very strong operating performance and we\u2019re pleased there are results here to-date and how we are positioned going into the primary leasing season have enabled us to raise our same store revenue guidance for the year to 4.3% to 4.7%. ","With that said, I\u2019d let David Santee discuss in more detail what we\u2019re seeing across the country today. ","David Santee","Okay. Thank you, David and good morning everyone. Today, I\u2019ll be reviewing our results for the quarter, discuss our current position with respect to base rent and renewal increases and then update you on our markets and our three buckets of revenue growth. ","All of these give us the confidence today to tighten and raise our full year 2015 revenue guidance. And while our expectations for Q1 performance were high, actual results were even slightly better. However, we remained full in the peak leasing season and peak deliveries across all of our markets are still ahead of us. ","Q1 performance was a result of the continuation of the strong operating metrics that we delivered in Q4 with the key driver of being elevated occupancies compared to Q1 of 2014. On the same store portfolio realized in 80 basis point pickup and occupancy however more notably our core markets delivered a 100 basis point pick up ranging from a low 50 basis points in Boston to a 180 basis point in San Francisco.","We continue to believe that these improved results are driven by strong demand from an improving economy, a shift in generational lifestyle preferences as more and more methods are chasing the urban lifestyle and continued declines in home ownership. As a result of the strength that we saw in Q4 and the expectation that the trend would continue, we have the confidence to extend renewal offers that achieve 6.3% growth for the quarter, higher since Q1 of 2012. Additionally, the percentage of residents that chose to renew with us this quarter was the highest since Q1 of 2008, a 56.1%. ","Turnover continues to decline quarter-over-quarter falling from 11.3% to 11.2% with the percentage to move out to buy home dipping to 11.9%. The lowest percentage we\u2019ve seen since of 2012. In terms of real numbers move out to buy homes from 1,330 to 1,296 quarter-over-quarter representing about 1.3% of our total same store unit count. ","Net resident turnover which factors out same community transfers fell 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter from 10% to 9.7%. As residents desire to remain in their building and neighborhood calls to them to move either up or down in rent with 60% choosing to move up. ","Net affected new lease rents, the foundation for determining renewal increases average 5.1% year-over-year for the quarter versus 3.1% in Q1 of 2014. And it continues to remain at these levels till today.","As we introduced second quarter the significant occupancy gains that we enjoyed in Q4 and Q1 have began to moderate as expected. Although, today we still enjoy an exposure rate that is 10 basis points slower than same week last year, an occupancy at 96.4% which is 50 basis points higher than same week last year. Renewal increase is achieved for April and May today are 7.2% and 7% respectively and based on our results thus far for June and July offers, we expect to achieve similar results for these months. ","While Q1 for these outstanding revenue growth, those results were slightly better than our expectations that drive full year guidance, the peak licensees in just ramping up and reminding ourselves again that 2015 will see peak delivers. We\u2019re extremely pleased with our quarter to-date results and expected outcome till May and June. ","Expenses for the quarter were generally in line however the route we took was quite different than our original road map. The North East storms resulted in significant snow removal cost and also impacted our ability to perform many services in house as our staff dealt with the inferiorly affects of the storm we were simply not able to make it to work. In the plus column all of these unexpected events were more than offset by the short declines in energy cost. ","Real estate taxes representing over 36% of total expense are being revived downward from 5.35% for 5.1% for the full year. As a result of lower than projected values in Virginia and lower overall taxes in Denver and King County in Wash you\u2019re going to stay. ","In the minus column, to save even real estate taxes will be not by higher payroll cost which is 22.5% of total expense as a result of the over time north east storms and fewer vacant positions across our portfolio. With energy cost remain sharply lower and a slight reduction in property insurance cost, we remain confident that we\u2019re track to hit the midpoint of our expense guidance range of 2.5% to 3.5%. ","Moving on to the market to lead up with Washington DC metro area, despite anemic job growth in record delivers during 2014, the DC metro area was able to absorb more than 14,000 units. As many as the government retirees live in homes in Suburbs, they\u2019re younger replacements chasing to live in the city with the amenities and transportation they need right outside their front door.","New lease lands remains under pressure and on average are flat across the portfolio. However renewal rates achieved have increased from the low 3\u2019s during 2014 to the low 4\u2019s in Q1. Renewable on the books for April and May indicate this trend will continue throughout the year. Improvements in job growth are beginning to materialize and the previous multi year declines in the professional service sectors have bottomed and are expected to be positive going forward. At 17% of total NOI, any improvement in Washington Metro will certainly have a favorable impact on our full year results.","With 13,000 units being delivered in 2015 and by our count another 9,700 in 2016, the metro area continues to be fairly stable. With occupancy up a 100 basis points today but with same week last, DC performance thus far is dead on our projected revenue growth assumptions.","Seattle continues to meet expectations with concentrated deliveries in the East and North. Amazon\u2019s recent financial results board well and their 4,000 plus open positions in Down Town which paying an average $90,000 per year increased by 200 jobs versus same time last year. Expedia recently announced there would be relocating its headquarters from sub urge to the city with a high quality talent chooses to live work and play. Corporate relocations from the verge to the urban core are playing out in every major city across the U.S. and we would expect this trend to continue.","San Francisco was the winning beneficiary of the improved occupancy that we saw in Q4 and Q1 with a 180 basis points increased over Q1 of \u201914. With minimal deliveries relative to outsize demand, we see no reason why San Francisco should not lead the way again in 2015 and we look forward to scale our results as we begin lease up on our new product and Emeryville and Downtown.","Denver thus far continues to maintain its ranking as the second best market across our portfolio with peak deliveries of over 9,000 units this year. We would expect softness in the urban 4 to continue with softness being defined as only 5.5% revenue growth. With the majority of our portfolio located in the suburbs we wouldn\u2019t expect to see any material deterioration revenue growth for the full year. Additionally reports of actual or projected job losses as a result of the energy crash are few and far between.","Los Angeles performance has shown tremendous strength in recent leagues. With net effective new lease rent growth approaching 7% today and renewal rents achieved averaging 7.5% thus far for Q2 versus 6.5% in Q1 will be moving Los Angeles to our plus 5% revenue growth bucket for full year 2015. With most of the port drama behind us and very strong demand in the valley and far North. Our broad base economy recovery has clearly materializing.","With only 8,500 new deliveries expected in 2015 or should be minimal impact for this improved trajectory. Today representing almost 11% of our NOI, LA is delivering outcomes of 96.6% which is 100 basis points higher the same week last year and exposure that is 100 basis points lower than last year. It appears that LA is now on track for an extended month that will provide outsize growth for an extended period to the EQR portfolio.","Orange County, San Diego and Emeryville Empire are all performing as expected. Since softness in Downtown, San Diego for new deliveries will constraint new lease rents. However renewal increase was achieved across the three markets range from the mid 6\u2019s to the mid 7\u2019s.","Jumping over to Boston, new lease growth is going to continue to be under pressure as 70% of the 5000 new deliveries are concentrated in the urban core and Cambridge. With late 2004 deliveries spilling over into 2015. However despite the proceed impact from the winter storms, Boston absorbed over 4,600 units in the first quarter as demand and rental activity saw mill impact. As newly delivered office and lab space come online, we would expect to see increased demand in the urban core as the financial services and biotech industries continue their expansion. Our Boston portfolio is slightly better positioned than same week last year with lower exposure and 30 basis points better occupancy. With new lease pricing under pressure on the concentrated deliveries, the key driver of revenue growth for 2015 will be in the form of renewals where we achieved plus 5% through June.","New York is steady as she goes. For Q1 the Jersey waterfront beat out Manhattan but only as a result of the poor results they experienced in Q1 of 2014. Going forward, we would expect Manhattan to continue to lead the metro area in revenue growth with modest weakness on the upper west side due to new and large unit count deliveries. Improved job growth in the higher paying sectors of business and professional services will certainly bolster demand for all the high-end product that has been recently delivered. In addition, it will help now to drop losses and the financial sectors appear to found the bottom. With the outsized deliveries in Brooklyn and Jersey City coming online, we are already seeing new lease price pressure and would expect that to play out in the next 12 months to 18 months.","Last but not least, South Florida with over 12,000 units being delivered this year across the three county metro area, we expect the most severe pricing pressure in the downtown Miami submarket, where 50% of these new apartments will be located. The balance of new deliveries are mostly east of I-95 from Lauderdale all the way to West Palm Beach which insulates the bulk of our portfolio from direct competition. With only two EQR assets near downtown Miami and the balance of the portfolio further west of I-95, we should be well positioned to deliver another year of plus 5% of revenue growth. Job growth remained strong and diverse across the entire region with the potential implications of Cuba\u2019s new open for business policy providing more questions than answers.","So summarizing our buckets of revenue growth, we now see the DC bucket is half full versus half empty and have challenged our team to meet or receive 1% revenue growth for the full year. And 13,000 new units still to come and meaningful job growth in the early stages, Washington DC will be a slow and steady climb from the bottom. Our 3% to 5% revenue buckets now contain San Diego, New York and the cautiously optimistic Boston which will be challenged to achieve a 3 or better.","Our plus 5% bucket has the usual suspects with San Francisco and Denver leading the way yet again. LA now breaking out with 6 plus revenue growth followed by Seattle with a solid low 6 and then South Florida and Orange County in the low 5s. As we\u2019ve demonstrated it\u2019s still a great time to be in the apartment business and improve the economy and the generational shift in lifestyle choices will continue to produce outsized demand in the urban core. A decline in deliveries in 2016 across most of our core markets will most certainly extend the runway we have to grow revenue and produce results that are above historical trend for the foreseeable future. David?","David Neithercut","Great, thank you David. As evidenced by the recent activity in our sector that remains a very strong bid for multifamily assets for many different segments in the investment community. As a result, the first quarter saw no acquisition activity in our part as pricing remains aggressive. We did sell three assets in the first quarter, two in Redmond, Washington and one in Agoura Hills, California for a total of $145.4 million at a 5.27% cap rate that we sold with the expectation that the buyer acquired about a 5% yield on those deals. These assets were each multiple building, gardens now assets average in 31 years of age and represented opportunities for us to sell into a strong investor demand of value-add product.","Thus far the second quarter we have had some transaction activity occur that we think an interesting example of the market trading that you\u2019ll see as try and undertake going forward. Two weeks ago, we required a recently completed 202 unit property in Boston or a $131 million and a low four cap rate. Around that same time, we also sold a 41 year old 193,000 square foot medical office building in Boston or a 123.5 million or $639 per square foot at a mid four cap rate.","This property is located next to Mass General and was required as part of our charges with investment 16 years ago with the current demand or healthcare assets, we saw great opportunity dispose of this billing and trade into a multi-family asset with far more upside in both earnings and NAV growth going forward.","On the development side, we commenced construction on one new project in the first quarter representing the last of the four downtown San Francisco sites that we acquired as part of the Archstone transaction. We\u2019re building 449 units at a cost of $290 million and expected yield on cost at today\u2019s rents in the mid fives. We continue to assume that we\u2019ll start about $450 million of new development this year and we have a couple of smaller deals that we\u2019ll have to get underway yet this year to reach that goal. But more importantly similar to the acquisition market there is a lot of capital chasing development opportunities and land pricing has increased significantly.","As a result and noted on our last call, we\u2019re not acquiring land to new development of the same rate as we\u2019re commencing construction and existing side in inventory. So in addition to reductions and start this year, we would also expect starts in Q3 is to be down from the level same over the last several years.","And with that Ann, we\u2019ll be happy to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Nicholas Joseph with Citi.","Nicholas Joseph","Thanks so much, on the Boston acquisition, I wonder if you can talk a little more about that. What was attraction about that deal and if you\u2019re underwriting criteria have changed at all?","David Santee","Well, I\u2019m not sure changed at all, we think that deal today Nick is probably our best located assets in the city. And we underwrote that deal that a high 7% IRR than I think that our expectation over the last several years then high 7, low 8 and we think that this will deliver within that range.","Nicholas Joseph","And I guess just more broadly on the transaction environment today. You mentioned the strong bid and aggressive pricing. Is this an opportunity to actually trade out some of your non-core markets, if you can sign core deals to redeploy the capital?","David Santee","Well, essentially all have been doing over the last half of dozen years. So yes, the challenge there is not finding interest in those assets we like to sell as evidence by $4.5 billion of assets we sold to help of the Archstone acquisition. But it\u2019s finding the uptake to redeploy those assets that capital. And I can tell you that of what we own today that we like to sale were no hurry to sell any of it, we\u2019ll happy to continue to own it, we will exit Orlando in the next month or so. But other than that what we have on our listed itself we\u2019ll in the meantime and when we find right opportunities to reallocate the capital we will, but we\u2019re in no rush to do so.","Nicholas Joseph","Thanks. And then just finally on those dispositions, will they be from non-core markets or will they be non-core assets in your core markets?","David Santee","I would say would be all of the above. We\u2019re getting low point today where, we can sale last non-core assets in our core markets, while we continue to sell out of non-core. So you\u2019ll see us do both.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Derek Bower with Evercore ISI.","Derek Bower","Great, thanks. I just had a question on the guidance and the outlook. Are you certainly appreciate the guidance rate for the full year, but still imply deceleration to the back half of the year especially at the top-end. So can you just elaborate a little bit more on maybe the risk factors that get you to the midpoint even the top-end of guidance still has deceleration you had turnover I think is down lower since 2008 renewals or high 2012. So can you just collaborate a little bit more or may be what brings the deceleration throughout the remainder of the year, just given how strong the household formation numbers have been?","Mark Parrell","Hi Jack, it's Mark Parrell, and I think David think you'll probably supplement this a little but we are mentioned before we really got a substantial occupancy and as such in the fourth quarter and again repeated that in the first quarter. And occupancy as David think, he just mentioned, remains very high.","And so we do have positives in all regards on the operations side. But as you compare our occupancy in the second quarter; that we expect in 2015, the occupancy that we had in 2014, and you keep doing that throughout the year, they get closer those two numbers and there's just less occupancy benefit. So I don't think it's really as much anything about slowing down or decelerating our household formations being worse or anything like that. It's just the mechanics of the numbers when you have this occupancy improvement, that was so substantial, and that was in the slower part of our year in the end of the fourth quarter and be at the beginning of the first.","David Neithercut","And the only thing I would add is, the fourth quarter and the first quarter, the numbers are great. Both on new lease rents, both on renewals, but your transactions on those quarters are so few. So that's why I remind everyone that we do have peak deliveries. We're just now entering the peak leasing season where more than 50% of our lease will turn and that's where we will make most of the money. So we don't see any really deceleration, like Mark said, it's just the mechanics of the numbers.","Derek Bower","Okay, got it. And then just touching on margins, there was a bit of a deceleration sequentially from the fourth quarter. I know that's typical from the seasonality basis, but you get 100 basis point margin improvement last year in 2014 over 2013. What do you think is the projected run rate for \u201915 again?","David Neithercut","As a margin? Yes, we put out 66%., 67%, I think those are good numbers. Like I want to point out our margin is fully [indiscernible]. So our property management cost, and everything that it takes to run that operation, IT, all property related legal, I mean all property related accounting -- so just when you're comparing apples-to-apples, you have the right comparative.","Operator","We will go next to Nich Yulico from UBS.","Nicholas Yulico","David, you mentioned the transaction market being -- what words you used exactly, but I think it was implying that pricing is pretty good and the selling apartment we you can't take out a cap rate that was probably about 100 basis points higher then, you guys had a much different portfolio. How do you think about, recognizing you guys don't need the capital, but how do you weigh may be doing a JV of punching your best lowest cap rate asset, just to kind of demonstrate to the market that this is where market pricing is and, this is where our stock is?","David Neithercut","Well, I guess we consider such an event if we did have a use of the capital, and I guess I would suggest you that every day away from us there are trades being printed that demonstrating value of these assets. So I don't think we need to do something to make that clear to marketplace. That's happening every single day all around us. So again if something we consider, if we had a use of the capital, we don't at the present time. Development is fully funded. But it's not something that we would not consider. We will certainly be open-minded, if it makes sense.","Nicholas Yulico","Okay, and then going back to this occupancy issue, you talked about. It looks like the comps get a little tougher throughout the year. You also said that, I think, in the second quarter so far you are over 96% occupied, and you're showing a good year-over-year growth and occupancy. So how do we think about this idea of recognizing that? The whole industry is kind of peaking occupancy and people are worried about year-over-year occupancy growth and yet, maybe we would get a push through that as an industry just because the main trend is so strong. What was considered as peak occupancy won't be peak occupancy.","David Neithercut","Well, I think you are referring to kind of 97 is the new 95, and I mean I think we are optimistic that could play out. We didn't do anything differently relative to pricing philosophies or processes in Q4 and Q1, but yet demand really is the key driver and if you take the position that some of these core markets are really under house going back 10 years and we have an improving economy, I completely agree that there is no reason why 97 could [audio gap] be kind of the new standard for the years to come in some of these core markets.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to John Kim with BMO Capital markets.","John Kim","Thank you. I really had just one data point with some seasonality. But how concerned are you of the weak GDP number that came out this morning? And particular if GDP moderates, let\u2019s say 2% growth this year, how much will that impact your ability to raise rents at two times that rate?","David Santee","We haven\u2019t that time of course to analyze the GDP number that just came out a couple hours ago. But some of that relatively low number was based on lower exports and U.S. dollar strength and things that just really don\u2019t have a direct impact and I\u2019m not suggesting none of our residents or employee being export oriented industries. But it\u2019s just I think one number for one quarter and it\u2019s been a pretty uneven recovery. So I guess we don\u2019t, we feel like supplying demands [we can sell] at this point in our business.","John Kim","Okay and on the asset sales during the period, was it an important distinction that they were sold in the sub-urban markets? Are you continuing to focus your portfolio in the core studies?","David Santee","I guess they are representatives of the assets that we\u2019ve been selling over the past half of those years being older, garden surface park kind of properties and in response to one of your earlier questions that you\u2019ll being to see more of that in our core markets going forward. So the older garden type product in our core markets, you\u2019ll see is trade out going forward providing we can find the reinvestment opportunity.","John Kim","Got it and then also on your development pipeline the stabilize deal you disclosed this period on complete and stabilized development with 5.9% which I think was one of the highest number if you produce in last few quarter. But I was wondering if you could disclose the yield of the developments that we are stabilize this quarter of a completed in prior quarters?","David Santee","Stabilize this quarter, I mean approaching 6% I guess the deal is that we completed in 2014 which I assume will then be those would stabilize this year. We think we\u2019ll stabilize in the upper five close to 6%.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Good morning, just a few questions here and I\u2019m going to guess that they are both for Mark will take them, the first is the Fannie and Freddie issue with their production caps. If the FHA doesn\u2019t increase those caps, are you concerned about an impact as far as in the most multi-family market or is it something the private lenders already stepping up and even if both Fannie and Freddie have accounted for 60 billion in total. It\u2019s not going to impacted in that private lenders will step in there but it won\u2019t disrupt pricing or transactions in multifamily?","Mark Parrell","I mean we\u2019ve been monitoring that situation for a while and just so everyone has the fact straight Fannie and Freddie were given by the regulator a $30 billion per year production limit and they are getting relatively close to those limits. Currently the regulator is considering this matter and may have some sort of decision in the near term. What I\u2019ll say about EQR\u2019s capital needs and you were asking more about this positions which I\u2019ll get through in a minute but I mean we\u2019re lucky and it\u2019s enviable position of having access in the secured market and preferred market and the like company market will trade now is very competitive and very strong and all those markets now except the preferred market are cheaper than Fannie and Freddie for us.","On the disposition side we have not seen any impact and in fact just sold an asset few days ago in Orlando and though there has been a lot of discussion about this matter in investment sales community. There wasn\u2019t any impact on our pricing we weren\u2019t re-traded on it, so we\u2019ll have to see what the regulator decides i.e., more of the opinion that the market can adjust to some of this if given time, but we\u2019ll just have to wait and see.","David Santee","Let me add just one thing here out if I may, I\u2019d be far more concerned about this if we still own the $5 billion of product that we had sold over the last couple of years and what we own today. As I\u2019ve noted in one of my responses to one of the previous question, we\u2019re fine knowing that what we have today and I think that to that source of debt capital is far more important to what we have already sold and what we would sell going forward.","Alexander Goldfarb","And then the second question is on your CP program. The recent articles in the newspaper about moving some of the money markets to flooding any of these rather than fixed, does that affect the buyers of your CP paper? Would those buyers now buy short-term governments or the buyers of your CP paper are not the same as the people who have the prime funds et cetera?","David Santee","Yes I think the later. We\u2019re A2\/P2 rated, so corporate own us maybe a life insurance company or two owners love put money aside waiting for long term bond issuances to come out in the market generally. It is at the high quality. They\u2019re not really allowed to own A2\/P2 paper, so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to make a great deal of difference to us.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors.","Dave Bragg","On the topic of elevated occupancy, we seem to be attributing not a lot to strong demand, but can you talk about what you\u2019ve done to reduce frictional vacancy if that could get everyone a lot more comfortable with this idea of sustainable higher occupancy levels?","David Santee","Well I mean that your biggest cost in vacancy is on turnover is vacancy I mean turn costs are relatively minimal. Actually just in the last let\u2019s just say three weeks, we have sales meetings across all of our markets twice a year and I attended four of them in the past two weeks. And really the easiest way to reduce frictional vacancy is through retention and I think a lot of people in San Francisco understand what\u2019s going on. Residence and under -- in San Francisco expect large increases.","We see we get numerous emails from residence regarding renewal increases and what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve really made an effort to give our people the tools to better negotiate and not necessarily negotiate but to educate our residents. So our renewal discussions with residents are more about showing them what our competitors are charging bringing up rents on online and so that they can see that this isn\u2019t something that just EQR\u2019s doing, this is a macro event that is impacting pretty much everyone. And I think we have very good success with that and that\u2019s why I think you see even though renewals continue to accelerate, turnover continues to decline. And then certainly just well-located buildings with access to amenities let outside the door and great service by our onsite staff altogether produce great retention.","Dave Bragg","Also, can you point to a change in the number of days that an apartment is down between when a renter departs and the new renter comes in? Have you been able to achieve any efficiencies on that front in the last call it five years or eight years?","David Santee","Well so, so that\u2019s \u2013 there was a seasonal impact to that, so kind of average days vacant call it November through January or probably in the high 20s as you start getting into high traffic season, it comes down to the low 20s, it\u2019s not 20 on average, but there is a lot of noise in those numbers. What we do is we really hold, we measure the -- whole time. So everyday we\u2019re measuring how many days our staff are holding apartments for people that are moving in the vacant unit. Someone wants to run a vacant unit, they have to kind of take occupancy financial response within five to seven days. And we try to do that on our notice to vacant unit as well and some of that those vacancy days are influence to some degree by the level of rehabs that we\u2019re doing, because it just, it kind of extend out those days by two to three weeks.","Mark Parrell","Yes, I just want to reinforce that distinction between the time of economic responsibility and the time of occupancy. Right, some of the comments any department 60 days is decline to choose or paying for today. And that\u2019s one let me take off a lot of people out there, I think on the top operations that will not require as strict about when we have to take on the financial obligations relatively one actually take, compared to one actually take occupancy.","David Santee","And David just at a final note. David Santee mentioned on the last call are we moved a lot of our lease expertise around. So that we had four of them in the periods of time where as David Santee said we have the longer whole period. So we have move to significant amount of our lease explorations out of that slower period of demand. So that should give you higher occupancy overtime as well.","David Bragg","Okay, thank you for all of that. Next question relates to the Boston acquisition. Can you just walk us through what looks to be a mid four cap purchase to a high 7 IRR?","Mark Parrell","Well, it\u2019s call rental growth. All being in a great asset, in a great location that May as David Santee is discussing today be one that is maybe challenge because of new deliveries, but we think over an extended time period we\u2019ll do very well for us.","David Bragg","Okay. Just rental growth no cap rate compression.","Mark Parrell","No, no. In fact not cap rate compression on the exited all.","David Bragg","Okay. Last question just goes back to this broad currently very robust appetite for multi-family assets. Given the interest some interest in other assets aggregators. This is always a tough thing to quantify. But David you observe any degree of portfolio premium today?","David Neithercut","I guess, its portfolio premium or platform value. I don\u2019t know, I think look at quite obvious that the private equity firms have raise off a lot of capital. Many of them under waited, under invested in multi-family. Multi-family is an extremely leverageable asset and I think that\u2019s may people very interest in the space and be willing to be very aggressive in pricing. Whether or not that creating portfolio premium, I can\u2019t tell you what platform value, I\u2019m not sure. But there is no question that is an off a lot of large capital sources out there that have been looking at this space.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Ian Weissman with Credit Suisse.","Ian Weissman","Good morning. Most of my questions have been asked in answer. But just if you could flush out a little bit your color on DC. -- are mentioned yesterday that the recovery in DC is really happening more in the urban core. I was hoping you can maybe address some of that comment and maybe decide for between CBD and suburban markets?","David Neithercut","Yes, let me, it\u2019s can\u2019t jumping around for few one, the numbers can play out, you see the strongest growth and the I270 code or suburban Northern Virginia and then South Arlington. However, this year you are going to see most of the deliveries in the I-270 Corridor more possessed. So Q1 the only market that was really negative for us was Alexandria and again South Alexandria, Alexandria is where a lot of the deliveries in 2015 will occur. So what was good this past year will probably be under pressure this year. If that helps.","David Neithercut","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And just one final housekeeping issue, it looks like there was 6.9 million or so an income from the law suit settlement that JV in 1Q that should be backed out to keep the normalize FFO. It looks like you are backing out $0.02 more in 2Q, is that also from a law suit settlement or is there something else going on?","Mark Parrell","Correct. That\u2019s another expected $10 or $11 million we\u2019ll see timing could shift and ops can shift.","Ian Weissman","Related to another issue or [indiscernible]","Operator","You\u2019ll go next to Richard Anderson with Mizuho Securities.","Richard Anderson","I guess when I just do a quick look at my NAV and I put a foreign on quarter type cap rate I mean I get to something close to 90 bucks for you. I mean is EQR too big to sell?","Mark Parrell","I wouldn\u2019t think so. I think Sam has demonstrated the sale of EOP that we wouldn\u2019t be too big to sell.","Richard Anderson","Okay. I mean we talk about portfolio premium all the rest maybe just occurred to me maybe we should be talking full anyway. The other question is much more term of a small level on the Boston acquisition would you made that deal in the absence of the MOB sale or is it all about the trade?","Mark Parrell","I guess, I\u2019m not sure, I can answer question Rich because we didn\u2019t think about it in that manner. We like this asset, we\u2019ve look this asset for a while, that have been first part of like portfolio sale and there is one that we had identified. But we\u2019d like to own if we could break it out of the portfolio. When it became available, we moved on it and my guess is we probably would have bought it. We think positively long-term about this location about the quality of this asset, about what\u2019s happening Boston and my guess is that we probably would have bought it without the sale of the office [building\/billing]. But being able to trade with the office building I think probably just help. But I think it is something that we would have strongly considered even if we didn\u2019t have the office building of the source of capital.","Richard Anderson","Okay and then last question quick on for Mark. I know this duplicity charge declined this quarter versus last, is there a some sort of accounting adjustment there?","David Neithercut","Yes, just the change in estimate. This is charge we thought pretty exact comp program would be 11 million and now in the 9 million and just we as we got full information we just refine the estimate.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Rob Stevenson with Janney.","Rob Stevenson","Good morning guys. How active these days are you guys on the redevelopment front? Are you taking on wholesale redevelopment or you basically just selling those assets and redeploying capital?","Mark Parrell","We are doing and we give you a fair amount of disclosure and then on page 21, our kitchen and bath renovation process which we call rehab and we spend about 50 million doing that, some of that is asset preservation and some of that certainly optional and accretive.","We are doing a couple of large redevelopments one specifically out in Los Angeles. We took that asset at a same store. So I think as you see that we own more and more of these that are very hard to replace. I think you\u2019ll see spend money on these larger scale renovations and we move those from same store like other folks do and now these kitchen and bath refreshes I think those will stay in same store and be something we spend $30 to $60 million on the year end. Just help us to stay current in the market.","David Santee","Yes, I would say in general Bob assets that we considered to be medium long-term holds will continue to do these rehabs as Mark suggested. On assets that we think would be short on term holds that might benefit from such a capital expenditure. We might often sell that asset not unlike the three that we sold in the first quarter for a value add player. We think that we would might realize more value selling that upside to a third-party rather than trying to do it ourselves and then sell it after the fact.","Rob Stevenson","In terms of the 144 million of land for development on the Page 19, how many projects does that include and how many of those are shovel ready today?","David Santee","I can\u2019t say definitely how many that includes and any that would be shovel ready today may very well be starting. We do have a couple of sites in DC that have kind of been ready for a while that we kind of put on ice, but anything outside of that, they\u2019re not shovel ready yet and when they are ready, we\u2019ll start construction on them.","Rob Stevenson","And then lastly, given the commentary around the reduction in real-estate tax expectations for this year, do you guys think that you\u2019re finally over the hub in terms of the really big increases or is this just a specific instance where you got a good benefit out of a couple of markets?","David Santee","Well I think if you go back and listen to some of our previous discussions, the 421 A abatement or burn off in New York City will add a 160 basis points to maybe a 180 basis points to our real-estate tax number for the next four years to five years. So I think this year, we\u2019ve kind of couple of breaks. There\u2019s still some bright spots that could materialize throughout the year, but I think high 4s low 5s are probably in the cards for the next several years.","Rob Stevenson","Okay.","David Santee","Just as a result of New York.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Dan Oppenheim with Zelman & Associates.","Dan Oppenheim","I was wondering if you can just talk a little bit about DC I think with that comments of in terms of having a site that\u2019s ready you\u2019ve been waiting on. It seems that there are many others as well in that position. You have any concern that when you do see some sort of recovery in the market that there\u2019s enough supply that comes that ends up being a very immediate recovery there?","Mark Parrell","I guess that\u2019s how the process that will analyze Dan when we believe that it might make sense. I\u2019m not sure that if there are [indiscernible] a lot of other sites they\u2019re ready to go, I\u2019m not sure the owners of those sites will have the capital and the financing given that marketplace to go forward and there may be an opportunity for the more highly better capitalized companies to actually sort of get ahead of that, but it\u2019s certainly something that we\u2019ll consider when we decide to go forward on that.","Dan Oppenheim","And then in terms of 315 on A in terms of the acquisition there buying a one year old assets there [indiscernible] for value add projects, do you think it\u2019s a better market in terms of the acquisitions for those who where you can buy something that\u2019s recent development but without the lease up risk to it that way?","David Neithercut","I\u2019m not sure I can say anything for certain. Last year a fairly significant share of what we did acquire, we bought either in some stages of lease up and even considered buying something that was under development and my expectation we\u2019ll continue to consider those kinds of opportunities because I think that can help us get a enhanced yield, but I guess it\u2019s very difficult to say if there\u2019s anything going on out there of any sort of opportunity other than there\u2019s just not a lot of supply and a lot of capital chasing it.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to George Hoglund with Jefferies.","George Hoglund","Yes I just wanted to see on San Francisco and Northern California in general if the strong job growth continues, how long do you think we can see these sort of high single-digit low double-digit rental increases?","Mark Parrell","Well we\u2019ve been asking that question for four years now. who\u2019s to say, I mean the deliveries are primarily in downtown San Francisco. So you\u2019re not delivering much of anything in the peninsula, a lot of your growth is being, you\u2019re seeing double-digit growth far out in Dublin and now Auckland which was not desirable place to be. So I think what was a Facebook added double the number of positions or increase 50%. As long as that continues, I don\u2019t see any into these increases.","David Santee","And let me just maybe answer that question in a different way. And say that our average rent in San Francisco still well below New York City and Boston. Right, so putting a size the rate of average, the absolute rents are still not at the highest in our portfolio.","Mark Parrell","I think, I just suggesting that would see at they would continue to be headroom there.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thanks for that color. And then also on DC just given the recent trends. When do you think, we could really see material improving DC, I mean giving all the delivery still coming online?","Mark Parrell","I mean we\u2019re still at that flat to down. So I think it\u2019s just going to be the velocity of job growth perhaps change in administration and reallocating more dollars back to defense spending. I think it\u2019s going to take something from the government to really jump start the economy. But like I said, I think it will be a slow call back until there is some meaningful catalysts which most likely would be the federal government.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Jana Galan from Bank of America.","Jana Galan","Thank you. Just a quick question on the development pipeline looks like 170 Amsterdam push that one quarter was that just weather related?","Mark Parrell","Yes, I guess, I just got no that you can push property back one month and have that be one quarter was really nothing to be. There is no story there Jana.","Jana Galan","Okay, thanks. And then just on the energy cost savings, is that change outlook for the rest of the year or maybe we could see some benefit as the year --?","David Neithercut","Well, I guess, I would say that we\u2019re from a natural gas perspective, we\u2019re writing the market. We did take average of some great for the winter strip beginning December and that continues into March of 2016. So we\u2019ve locking some material savings there. But I think we\u2019ll continue to see days in both electric, electric actually is the bigger driver and as more -- plan in the Northeast convert to natural gas, I think we\u2019ll continue to see benefit from that on both natural gas and electric.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Michael Salinsky from RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Salinsky","Dave, I think characterize the market I saying a lot of demand just seeing a little of supply on the market today. Is that supply today, I mean is that quality supply sitting in -- house or is it mostly value-add. And then just as for several years into the cycle right now, while the early supply that was build --. Do you seeing more and more that kind of come to market there is kind of restocking the pipeline?","David Neithercut","Well, we keep expecting too. I will tell you every year Alan, George and his guys comeback had may senior into January saying that the brokers have telling them that they\u2019re getting being also to request for opinions and value et cetera and we continue expect to see new supply. But I guess maybe with financing rates available to refinance these assets and just the scarcity of them it\u2019s possible people that are not willing to sell at this period of time. Clearly, we\u2019re probably a little bit more selective and what we\u2019re willing to buy today which may have served narrow the scope of what we\u2019d be willing to consider but there is just not much out there, we do underwrite a lot, we bid on what knowing that we\u2019re not likely win, so we stay in touch of the market. But I think that never seen our acquisition list as be as it is today. ","Michael Salinsky","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. We\u2019ve see a lot of actual grounded up to that kind of development in New York city right now. Have you seen any pick up in terms of conversion activity be at New York or any other market right now. ","Mark Parrell","I think what would -- the conversion I think is been more talked than action. There is certainly been some limited but they\u2019re very risky proposition takes an of lot of capital and takes an extremely long time to actually execute and people have talked a lot about potential for conversion but we have seen less than we would expect given the share that we\u2019ve heard about it. ","Operator","At this time there are no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the call back over to David. ","David Neithercut","Thank you very much. So, before you hang up I want to thank everybody for your time and your interest in Equity Residential today. And to let you know that on Monday afternoon of the meetings in New York City in June we\u2019re got to be hosting some tours of our new developments our Park Avenue South and Amsterdam at 68, street. And you all will be receiving a notice and invitations of that. So, stay tuned for more details. So, thank you very much, look forward to see you all in meeting June.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Marty McKenna. Please go ahead, sir.","Martin McKenna","Thanks Nick. Good morning and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential\u2019s third quarter 2019 results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO and Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer. Bob Garechana, our CFO is also with us for the Q&A. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.","Now, I will turn it over to Mark Parrell.","Mark Parrell","Thanks, Marty. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Continued solid demand for our product is driving absorption of new supply and our excellent people and properties that produced record high resident retention and this all resulted in same-store revenue growth that is in line with the expectations we shared with you on our July call. While we are not giving precise guidance at this time, we do want to share the basic building blocks and thought process that we are undertaking to determine next year same same-store revenue guidance.","The important inputs to our process include expected supply, our embedded growth which for us that means the growth inherent in our rent roll headed into 2020, and most importantly and most difficult for us to handicap our perspective on demand, which influences both our occupancy and rate growth estimates. A new factor this year is a negative impact of regulatory changes in California and New York, will have on our same-store revenue numbers. In a moment, Michael Manelis, our COO, will give you color on our third quarter operating performance and revised full-year same-store operating guidance, and discuss our 2020 building blocks and then we\u2019ll open the call up to your questions","So moving on to investments, with the exception in New York, where activity since the new rent control on June is too limited, the draw any conclusions on the product we own. We have seen cap rates modestly decline across our markets, pushing up values, bidding tense are more crowded and competition among buyers is fierce. This is especially true for B and C quality assets were value-add play may exist. As we have stated previously, this is compressed cap rates between new and older product. Our response to this has been accelerate the sale of older or less strategic assets and the purchased assets that better fit our long-term strategy and minimal to no dilution.","During the third quarter, we are busy acquiring four new properties, consistent with this strategy and selling seven older assets, three properties we acquired are in California, these are new properties, so they will not be subject to the new rent control law for almost 15 years. The first property is a 237-unit property in the Little Tokyo submarket of Downtown, Los Angeles. This asset was built in 2017, and we bought it for a purchase price of approximately $105.2 million, and at a cap rate of 4.4%. With a Walk Score of 96, the asset is a short walk to multiple transit hubs and is proximate to both extensive employment concentrations and interesting entertainment options. The second is a 398-unit property built in 2017 in the Korea town submarket of Los Angeles at a purchase price of approximately $189 million and at a cap rate of 4.3%. The property, which is a retail component, has excellent access to both public transit and freeways, with abundant nearby entertainment options and sports a 97 Walk Score. The third asset we acquired is a 137-unit property on the Peninsula in the San Francisco Bay Area, which was acquired for approximately $108 million at a 4.3% cap rate. This property is very near Caltrain station and is in close proximity to many large technology employers.","Our last acquisition was the purchase of a 312-unit property in the Denver suburbs. This asset was built in 2016. We bought it for a purchase price of approximately $88 million and at a cap rate of 4.7%. This property is an example of the kind of well located suburban elevator building and is likely to make up about 30% of our portfolio in Denver. During the third quarter, we also sold seven assets; one was Park at Pentagon Row, a 30 year asset and near Amazon HQ2 that we discussed on last quarter\u2019s call, the other 6 sales with the vast majority of our portfolio in Berkeley, California. These were 6 smaller buildings that totaled 343 units, and were sold for an aggregate price of approximately $187 million. These buildings are about 20 years old and have significant student populations, making them operationally intensive to operate. The 7 properties sold during the quarter had an average disposition yield of 4.7%, and generated an un-levered IRR of approximately 7.6%.","We also completed two developments during the third quarter, with offset Kendall Square 2 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This is an 84-unit property built at a total development cost of approximately $51.4 million, that we expect will generate a stabilized yield of 5.4%. This property was developed at the second phase of our existing Kendall Square Loft asset and is an excellent addition to our portfolio in the booming Cambridge Life Sciences area. We are particularly pleased with the speed of our lease-up at this property. We also just completed our 137 unit Chloe on Madison Project in Seattle. The total cost of this project was approximately $65.3 million and we expect that it will generate a stabilized yield of 5.4%. This asset was built adjacent to our Chloe on Union asset in the Pine Pike Corridor of Seattle.","Switching to new development, the capital availability story is somewhat different than for existing assets. We continue to hear from reputable local and regional developers with good projects, unable to put their equity stack together in light of escalating construction costs and shrinking build to yields. We have been pursuing a few of these opportunities as joint ventures and believe that investing our capital in shovel-ready deals, in sound deal structures that provide some protection to our capital is a good way to source new properties, while managing some of the risk inherent in development. We started two developments during the quarter. Arrow Apartments is a 200 unit mid-rise property that we are developing in a joint venture with a prominent regional developer. This property is part of the master plan community on the site of a former Naval Air Station and will have dedicated Ferry Service to San Francisco. We expect to build our 200 units for a total development cost of approximately $117.8 million and we expect to produce a stabilized yield of 5.3%.","Our other new development is 4885 Edgemoor Lane. This is a 154-unit property in downtown Bethesda, adjacent to an existing EQR asset. This is a ground lease deal, where we have the right to acquire the fee interest in about 20 years. We will develop this 15-story high rise for a total cost of approximately $75.3 million and expect to produce a stabilized yield of 5.9%. We think the recent increase in office space in Bethesda will create more demand for rental housing that this well located property will capture new office workers who want to leave conveniently to work, while having excellent access to the Metro and entertainment amenities. On the capital markets front, as you saw in the release, we took advantage of a very favorable environment and issued $600 million in unsecured debt, with the yield of 2.56%. There was tremendous demand for the issuance and we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the execution and I congratulate the team for it.","Finally, before I hand it over to Michael, I want to make a comment on rent control. With California recently passing AB 1482, both that state and New York have introduced new regulations on rents, the new laws are complex and will create compliance challenges for all landlords, while also acting as a powerful disincentive to building the new affordable apartments needed in these two states. We agree that there is a shortage of workforce in affordable housing in many places in our country, but believe the actions taken in New York and California will not help solve these problems. These new housing loss would discourage the production of new housing and do not materially address the root causes of housing production shortages, like zoning regulations that prohibit construction of multi-unit housing and other excessive governmental regulation. We also think that over time it will lead to the deterioration of the existing affordable housing stock. Through our trade associations, we will continue to encourage policymakers to embrace actions like zoning reform and the removal of regulatory barriers to new housing construction as well as programs that create incentives for private market developers to build the affordable housing units our city so badly need.","I will now turn the call over to Michael Manelis.","Michael Manelis","Thanks Mark. So I would like to begin with a shout out to all of the employees of Equity Residential. The third quarter represents our busiest leasing period of the year, with just over one-third of the entire year\u2019s transactions taking place. The team\u2019s focus on delivering remarkable experiences to our new customers and current residents continues to pay off, and allowed us to achieve our highest recorded resident satisfaction scores, while increasing our all-time high online reputation scores. Favorable operating fundamentals continue through the quarter with strong occupancy of 96.5% which is 20 basis points above Q3 of 2018. Record low resident turnover delivering a 5% achieved renewal increase for the quarter and strong demand to close out the peak leasing season.","While we reported strong occupancy this quarter, we anticipate that the balance of the year will moderate in line with normal seasonal decline, a process that has already begun, and should result in our full year same-store occupancy ending up at 96.4%, which supports our 3.3% same-store revenue growth. Today, our portfolio is 96.2% occupied, which is exactly where it was this time last year. Base rents are up 2.7% year-over-year renewal performance continues to be very stable with expected achieved renewal rate increases around 5% for the balance of the year,","Heading into 2020, the following represent a few top level inputs that will serve as building blocks for our guidance process. Most markets will deliver relatively the same amount of new supply with the exceptions being New York which will have considerably less and Boston, which will have more. We expect demand for our high-quality and well located assets to be relatively the same as 2019, which should equate to similar occupancy next year.","Revenue growth in both our California markets and New York will be negatively impacted by about 20 basis points each due to recently enacted rent control rules. For the entire company, this equates to about a 15 to 20 basis point impact to our 2020 same-store revenue growth. We also anticipate starting the year with better embedded growth than we had entering into 2019. So, overall, assuming these inputs hold, we would expect New York, DC, Seattle, and San Diego to deliver equal or better revenue growth next year, and Boston, San Francisco, LA and Orange County to be less. We are in the early stages of our budget process and we will be updating our models throughout the balance of this year and we will issue specific guidance on our January call.","So on to the markets, let\u2019s start with Boston. Full year revenue growth expectations have been raised to 3.9% from 3.5% as the results for the quarter were better than expected. The reprieve from head to head supply delivered strong rate growth and most notably an occupancy of 96.4% that was 70 basis points better than the third quarter of 2018. On the supply front, after a quiet 2019, we\u2019re starting to see new competitive supply return to the city of Boston. We are tracking about 5,800 units being delivered in 2020, with roughly 60% of those units in the city of Boston, heavily concentrated in the Seaport. Demand remains strong, bolstered by large corporate expansions and relocations. It also helps that strong demand and increasing rents for office and lab space seems to be tilting the highest and best use for development parcels away from multifamily in the Seaport District, while we have only seen a few of these deals shift, this could create more renters and less supply in future years.","The New York market continues to demonstrate strength in overall operating fundamentals, and its performance during the quarter was in line with expectations. There is no change to our full-year same-store revenue growth projection for New York of 2.5%. Overall, we continue to see good economic activity and strong demand for our product in this market. The impact from changes associated with the rent regulations that went into effect in the middle of June are playing out exactly as expected, with approximately a 50 basis point reduction to achieved renewal increases in the second half of the year and about a $400,000 reduction in application and late fees. Combined, these changes to the regulations will reduce our expected New York Metro market revenue performance by approximately 20 basis points in 2019, a similar impact from rent regulations is expected next year.","On the supply front, next year we will deliver just over 4,300 units in our competitive footprint, a 50% decline from 2019. While we still see some pressure, the overall competitive nature of this supply will be much less, which should allow us to absorb the impact from rent regulation changes. Washington DC continues to demonstrate strength, despite the elevated deliveries with our full year revenue growth projected to be 2.5%. Results for the quarter were in line with expectations. The market unemployment rate of 3.3% remains below the national average and job growth remains healthy with gains being driven in a large part by the professional and business services sector concentrated in Northern Virginia. Deliveries of 10,000 units per year or more seems to be the new norm for the Washington region. The continued strength in demand is fueling robust Class A absorption, which delivered strong occupancy and improved pricing power for the third quarter. In 2020, we are tracking just over 12,000 units with a notable increase to the capital riverfront area, where we have no direct exposure.","Heading over to the West Coast, Seattle outperformed our expectations for the quarter. We have increased our full-year revenue growth projection by 20 basis points to 3.4%. Job growth remains robust. The market is creating jobs at its fastest pace since 2016 and Seattle\u2019s office absorption is the highest it has been in a decade. Gains in job growth was widespread, not just in the technology sector, overall demand for our product remains strong, which has allowed us to maintain high occupancies while pushing rate. On the supply front, the concentration shifted to the East side in 2019, which has allowed pricing power to return to the CBD, where we have several assets. Suburban submarkets have yielded greater rental income growth over the last several years, but that trend reversed for us over the summer, as the downtown submarket rent growth led the pact for the third quarter.","Overall deliveries in 2020 will be similar to 2019, with just over 8,000 new units coming online, the concentration will continue to be weighted to the East side in the first half of the year and will then shift back to the CBD Belton submarket in the second half of the year. As I move to the California markets, let me start by providing color on the impact of the new rent control laws. These new regulations go into effect on January 1, 2020, and we have 97 properties or about 70% of our California portfolio subject to the new restrictions next year. The most pronounced impact will be on renewals, as there will be a cap on increase equivalent to CPI plus 5% on all properties that are 15 years or older . The law allows vacancy decontrol, meaning upon move out rents can increase the market pricing about a cap. If these regulations had been in place for 2019, they would have reduced our renewal growth rate by about 50 basis points and our same-store revenue growth in these markets by about 20 basis points.","So, moving to San Francisco, we now expect full year same-store revenue growth to be 3.8% which is 20 basis points lower than our July guidance. During the third quarter, we were unable to maintain both occupancy and rate at the high levels we anticipated. We had continued strength in July and August, but September traffic was a little lighter than expected, Today our San Francisco portfolio is 95.5% occupied, which is 10 basis points lower than the same week last year. While reduction in occupancy at this time of the year consistent with normal seasonal declines, this is something that we will continue to watch. Strongest results continue to be posted Downtown and the East Bay continues to face pressure,. On the job front, the Bay Area topped 4.1 million jobs, with 10 straight months of employment gains. It\u2019s possible that the rate of job growth is slowing, But these gains are still strong. Heading into 2020, we\u2019re tracking 9,800 units being delivered, which is similar to 2019. The East Bay will deliver less units and the concentration will shift to the South Bay.","Moving down to Los Angeles, full year same-store revenue growth projection is 3.8%, which is 10 basis points lower than our July guidance. As we stated last quarter, we anticipated deceleration due to pressure from new supply that was back half-loaded and had a difficult occupancy comp for the second half of 2018. Occupancy remained strong at 96.3% but we didn\u2019t quite get as much pricing power as expected, resulting in softening rate growth to maintain the needed leasing velocity. Continuing the trend on supply, roughly 2,800 units of deliveries were pushed from 2019 into 2020. These units were originally scheduled to deliver toward the end of 2019, but the story remains the same. With labor shortages and construction delays, this shift results in both 2019 and 2020, having approximately 9,700 units being delivered. Downtown LA, West LA and the San Fernando Valley are the highest supplied submarkets in 2019. We are still about 3,900 competitive units under construction, scheduled to complete by the end of the year, which will continue to put pressure on rates.","Moving into 2020, the supply will be concentrated in West LA, Hollywood, and the San Fernando Valley. Downtown LA is expected to see a reduction, so only 1,200 units being delivered which should benefit our pricing power and performance in the back half of the year and a submarket that is close to 20% of our LA revenue. Orange County delivered third quarter results, which were better than we expected, primarily driven by 40 basis points of stronger occupancy than this time last year. Our full-year revenue growth guidance has been increased by 20 basis points to 3.8%. As I\u2019ve stated before, we have a diverse set of properties in Orange County, and not all victim competes head to head with the 2019 supply. 2020 is expected to be similar with just over 2700 units being delivered. San Diego performed as expected in the third quarter and there is no change to our full-year revenue growth guidance at 3.4%. Overall, the newer product downtown continues to pressure our pricing power as we think about next year, supply will be lower with just over 2,100 units being delivered.","On the initiatives front, we continue to make great progress toward the sales and service road map that we shared in our June investor update. On the sales front, we will have just over a third of our communities on our artificial intelligence e-lead platform by the end of the year we will have deployed self-guided tours at over 25% of our communities. On the service side of the business, our new mobility platform for our service teams will be fully deployed by the end of the year. We also have approximately 2,500 units enabled with smart home technology.","During the quarter, we launched our new resident portal and app, our app adoption has grown to 55% of households, with our original portal, residents will continue to pay rent and service request online, but now have many additional features that will allow them to engage with each other. We can already see them taking advantage of self-service functionality in the portal to reserve amenities, register guests, and leverage the social platform to facilitate gatherings and post items for sale. We hope that this continues to increase resident satisfaction and stickiness. The evolution of our operating platform is underway. The new technology will enable continued centralization and digitalization to further enhance the resident and employee experience. Over the next few quarters, we expect to provide more detailed updates on the financial and customer impact from these and other initiatives.","At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead, sir.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. Maybe just starting with guidance, historically, for the fourth quarter, you have seen an acceleration both in terms of core NFFO and also same-store NOI growth and this year seems to be an exception. So I am wondering if you can walk through what\u2019s the variance of that versus historical years?","Bob Garechana","Thanks Nick. It\u2019s Bob Garechana. It is really three-fold items overall as it relates to the NFFO guidance, the $0.03 identified in the press release. The first of which is really timing of transaction activity. During the fourth quarter, our guidance incorporates about $300 million in dispositions and in the third quarter we had a similar amount of dispositions, but actually had $500 million roughly of acquisitions that Mark went through, front unloaded, so that\u2019s about a penny of delta. It is also timing of other items, predominantly corporate overhead and some other expense items as well and then that\u2019s another penny, and then the last penny is to same-store, so you are right. As you look at sequential same-store revenue, it specifically does decelerate between the third and the fourth quarter, which is what we have embedded in our guidance today, that modest kind of traditional deceleration that you see from seasonal activity. You usually also see some expense seasonality and you see expenses actually decline from the third quarter to the fourth quarter in a pretty material amount historically and we don\u2019t expect to see that as much this year and that is largely driven by the timing of some real estate tax appeals and some other items and that is really driving that last penny that we identified in the release.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. And then Mark you are active with California acquisition and I note the recent law doesn\u2019t impact those assets, but is your underwriting standards change at all either quantitatively or qualitatively, given the more broad regulatory environment in California?","Mark Parrell","Thanks for that question, Nick. Yes. We have talked I think more than ever before. And we have always had a regulatory component to our underwriting, but it has been a bigger discussion. We have done things like sensitized exit cap rates. We generally think about asset whole periods in our pro forma is 10 years. So 10 years from now, these assets will be closer to the end of their protected period. So we have sensitize those cap rates at the end, those exit cap rates, a little and thought about them in a few different ways, so that we would be more thoughtful about maybe how those assets might trade 10 years from now. Again, mostly we do generally hold assets longer than 10 years, but we need to be a little bit more mindful, so we did that analysis and we were still happy to hold the assets, so generally changed our IRRs from mid 7 IRRs to high 6 IRRs by doing that, Nick.","Bob Garechana","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please go ahead, sir.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. So you had this unusual dynamic this quarter for new lease growth where, strengthened on the East Coast and it weakened in California. You talked about some of the California issues, but it also looks like your new lease gross debts were weaker than some of the industry stats we\u2019re looking at in California. So just hoping to get a little bit more info on how new lease growth turned negative in the third quarter for the California markets?","Michael Manelis","Yes. So, this is Michael. So I guess first I just want to call out that I think we\u2019ve talked about before that looking at any of these stats for the stand-alone quarter on new lease change, it\u2019s probably not the best way to think about it, it\u2019s probably more indicative to think over long term of the year, but specific to the quarter. I guess I want to call out what we report on Page 15 in that release is really the impact from all lease terms, meaning regardless of what lease was in place when the resident moved out to the replacement rent, when we tend to when we isolate the leases that were just like term or just 12 month lease to 12 monthly month lease, we see about a 100 basis point improvement in the results for the quarter. So I would say that we started, we understood that we were going to see deceleration. I think I mentioned in on the previous call, but if you look specifically like at LA, LA instead of reporting the negative 20 basis points would have reported 80 basis points if I just isolate it out for the life-term or the 12 to 12 and that would have been a positive. The quarter actually performed pretty consistent with what we expected. We knew we were going to face back half pressure on supply and you can see that in San Diego and you can see that and LA and the areas that we have supply have the most pronounced kind of pressure on that new lease change. As I said in my prepared remarks, I mean Downtown LA actually is going to see a reduction in supply next year. So we would expect some pricing power to return to us there.","Nick Yulico","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. So it sounds like the read through here is that you\u2019re not expecting these, the new lease growth numbers in the California markets to stay negative going forward?","Mark Parrell","Well, I guess I will tell you as we hit the fourth quarter, they will most likely be negative, they typically are negative and I talked about that before that there is a seasonality component to these stats, which is why when you isolate any one quarter, it\u2019s not always indicative of the full year.","Nick Yulico","Okay, thanks. Just last question Mark I guess how are you thinking about doing more acquisitions right, EQR hasn\u2019t been a net acquirer in a while and your stock price is looking more attractive. Would you issue equity to do that, what is kind of the size of the opportunity set you\u2019re looking at, is this something that you would be considering at all?","Mark Parrell","Thanks Nick. No, we are certainly open to getting larger, I think the market is giving us a growth signal, I would start by saying, as I said in my prepared remarks, the transaction market with the kind of quality assets we want is extremely competitive. So it\u2019s not like we have a whole bunch of things that have piled up that we\u2019d love to acquire. I mean we\u2019re buying pretty well everything again that fits into the window that we\u2019re comfortable with on price. So I would start by saying, there isn\u2019t a lot left that we haven\u2019t done to begin with. I also point out that if you were to use, for example, the ATM. The implied cap rate on the stock as compared to the kind of asset cap rates we have is not going to create a great deal of accretion at least immediately for the company. I would say we\u2019re more interested in potentially issuing debt and buying assets. I mean I think we have a pretty modest leverage profile, we are not suggesting we are going to pile the debt on, but I think we\u2019re in a position where we could certainly spend a considerable amount of money and fund it with debt to buy assets if we could find enough good assets to buy. So definitely that\u2019s top of mind for us Nick. But it\u2019s probably more of a debt play at this point than it is use of the ATM or some discrete secondary.","Nick Yulico","Thank you, Mark.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Shirley Wu with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Shirley Wu","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, just a follow-up to Nick\u2019s earlier question on the rent regulation AB 1482, so what is your most input based on it? Did you guys see any impact to transactions markets or in terms of, let\u2019s say hesitation to jump into those markets, just given that new regulation has been in place?","Mark Parrell","Hi, Shirley. It\u2019s Mark. Thanks for the question. We have not. California has really just kept going. I mean, cap rates have generally kind of been steady to declining for our kind of assets. So we have not seen, I think that\u2019s because California was so well discussed to the credit of the policymakers the activists representing the tenant groups, and the companies like ours and the owners, everyone was involved in this conversation about rent control and rent reform. And so when this all came to pass, everyone understood it and the regulations made sense in the market digested it. I contrast that to New York, where it was done, as I\u2019ve said before, sort of in the dark night, probably wasn\u2019t as well thought through. And I think the implications are harder to understand the transaction market in New York. But in California everything feels about the same to us.","Shirley Wu","That\u2019s great to hear. But there is talks of a new ballot initiatives that kind of brings back this the previous conversation about repealing Costa Hawkins in 2020. Have you heard anything in terms of updated news on that front?","Mark Parrell","Sure. So this is what the industry has been calling Prop 10 2.0, and the proponent put out a press release recently saying as we expected, but they have enough signatures to put this on the ballot. Again that\u2019s what the industry anticipated. I will tell you we are very well organized. There have been the industry meetings about this. We beat this by about 20 percentage points back in November, educated the public, educated policymakers it was just a bad idea. We think the same approach is justified here again, we intend to be very much aggressive and out there having these conversations in the public space about how this sort of repeal of Costa Hawkins is going to do the exact opposite of what people want, there will be less supply, there will be less investment in existing stock of housing, both single family and multifamily by the way, and we\u2019re going to have that conversation to be very forthright about it So at this point, I feel pretty good about, again our organization in the industry to oppose that measure.","Shirley Wu","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Rich Hightower with Evercore. Please go ahead, sir.","Rich Hightower","Hi, good morning guys.","Mark Parrell","Hey, good morning.","Rich Hightower","Good morning. So, Mark, I want to go back to a couple of your comments in the prepared remarks around developer equity appetite and just in the sense of the portion of the cap stack required from the equity or the cost of capital and maybe wondering if there is something of a disconnect there between public and private in the sense that the apartment REITs are obviously trading very well and have opportunity that comes from that versus what you are seeing on the private side and how does that lead to opportunities for EQR. I know obviously at least one of the developments that you guys started in the quarter was it was a joint venture? And just wondering what the opportunity set might be that emanates from some of this phenomenon?","Mark Parrell","Yes, we have a few other. Thank you for the question. We have a few other of these sort of opportunities we are talking to. We have just seen and we telegraphed this on the prior call, it was just more inbound call volume. Developers we know, regional folks, reputable local folks that have had no problem getting equity and now do and we think some of that is just again build to yields have gotten low. A lot of folks who made a lot of money on development maybe they are a little anxious about where they are in the cycle. A lot of people that are building, they build for a window. So these, developers are building, needing to deliver as merchant builders in a window and things need to be great in 2022 or 2023 or they don\u2019t make money, that is not the way we think about development. We want to like our unit cost in our per square foot cost and our location in the long run. So I think we do have an advantage right now at the moment where we\u2019re able to take a longer view, where we do have ample capital and these opportunities, again you can put in front of you, the capital of the developer, they\u2019re out there, taking the completion risk initially, now again these developers have capitalization, not as significant as ours and they have experience and we watch over their shoulders. So we think we get a little risk mitigation and there is a little bit of an opportunity right now to kind of jump in the deals that are ready to go. So I do think there is a little bit of a window here for us.","Rich Hightower","Okay, great. That\u2019s great color. And then maybe just a second question quickly \u2013 2020 supply, sorry about that. So obviously, the numbers we look at coming from Axiare or other sources seem to change every single quarter. It\u2019s very hard to get a grip on what\u2019s really in the pipeline. What\u2019s really likely to open by a certain date? So how much flex do you guys put into your forecast in that regard?","Michael Manelis","Yes, I mean so we have a process right where we have boots on the ground kind of validating this stuff, I mean it\u2019s pretty hard right now to think that in most of these markets that anything to get delivered in 2020 that we\u2019re not aware of, as you start to get to the shoulder periods, especially like the Q3, Q4. You could see things shift from what we thought was going to be a completion in 2019 shifting into 2020. We\u2019ve seen that now in LA consistently occurring. So I think as you get to the shoulder periods, it\u2019s normal to see some of this stuff shift. And I think on average we see about 10% to 15% shift, in LA we started seeing it to be a little bit more pronounced like 20%, 25% of the unit shifts. But as far as the total quantity, the process that we go through with our local investment team in the market trying to understand the competitive nature of supply in our competitive marketplace, the deals don\u2019t kind of come and go.","Mark Parrell","Yes, I want to add one thing, Rich. This stuff becomes competitive even earlier. So before the CMO comes there out their pre-leasing that pressures operators and people like us with properties in the area. So sometimes moving from December to January, it looks like something in all of us from a distance, but from the operator perspective it\u2019s meaningless. And I also point out, when you have 20% of LA move from \u201818 and \u201819 and 20% move from \u201819 and \u201820, nothing really happened. I mean all that happened is, we have done some good interesting analytical work where we see the pattern and really this is the point where the numbers for example, for 2020 are at their highest and from here they\u2019ll just decline because deals will keep getting pushed or moved or changed in some regard. So there is a bit of a pattern here where I think we all start looking at numbers that end up being much lower in the long run, because stuff just naturally pushes.","Rich Hightower","Got it. Thank you very much.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead, sir.","John Pawlowski","Thanks. Mark, apologies if I missed this. Could you just give us on the development opportunities, what you expect a reasonable development pipeline size to look like for EQR next year?","Mark Parrell","Thanks, John. So I would probably put it in terms of spend, if that\u2019s helpful. So the way we\u2019ve talked about it with the Board is, we feel like we can spend $500 million a year on development, which would consist of the $300 million of excess cash flow that we have every year after all, our CapEx needs are met, as well as, call it $200 million of additional leverage from the growth in EBITDA. We do that, we don\u2019t need to sell assets, we don\u2019t need to access to capital and we won\u2019t need to do anything, we can just sort of self fund and in that case, then we think that\u2019s the best safest way to do it. So I would expect our goal is to get close to opening starting, say $500 million in 2020. We have one large deal in the West Coast. We are working hard on that would be half of that. So, and there is a number of other play, that are really interesting that are density plays, where we\u2019re knocking down say 40 or so garden units and replacing them with 200, 250 mid-rise units and we have a number of projects like that going on in the West Coast that we hope to start next year, and a few going on in the East and may take a little longer. So I mean that\u2019s where you should see, in terms of a range, probably spend $300 million, $400 million, $500 million a year and us looking at both JV development, some of this legacy land bank we still have of lower priced brand and these density plays that we think are interesting.","John Pawlowski","Okay. And Michael, can you give us some more specifics about your opening remarks about weakness in traffic, foot traffic in San Francisco and not able to maintain occupancy or rate and just what are you seeing on the ground in terms of leading demand indicators for your San Fran portfolio?","Michael Manelis","So, I mean it\u2019s really \u2013 it\u2019s submarket specific. So even if I just think about the results in the quarter, like the Downtown portfolio produced like 6% revenue growth compared to the East Bay at 2.5. When you start looking at the traffic patterns our traffic is down, but like I said it was strong July and August. And then in September, we started to see that shift. We went back and we kind of just looked against all of our available units, the volume of traffic we\u2019re getting, just as a ratio and compared it. And when you look at it, it\u2019s really seems to be following more of like a 2017 pattern versus the 2018 that really defy kind of a seasonal decline. So I think right now the demand is really just kind of overall it\u2019s mixed. It\u2019s definitely kind of following the normal seasonal decline, but I haven\u2019t seen anything that suggests it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s going to be any greater than normal. Does that help?","John Pawlowski","Is it is Oakland supply starting to suck out demand or...","Michael Manelis","Yes. So it\u2019s interesting. So at the back door, meaning people leaving us and giving us forwarding addresses to Oakland. We see very little of that activity. Less than 2% of our kind of move-outs give us that forwarding address, but you can look at the Oakland assets that are coming online right now, and they are performing well, their concessions are reasonable than what you would expect from a lease-up. So they are probably siphoning off some demand on the front door right now.","John Pawlowski","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Richard Hill","Hey, guys. Quick question on the leasing spreads, I thought your comments about like-for-like leasing spreads were around 100 basis points higher, it was pretty interesting and I hope that hopefully I got that number right. I\u2019m curious, are you seeing tenants ask for longer leases. Because it seems like your commentary would suggest so, and the reason I ask is one of the consequences of written regulation was maybe tenants would stay in their leases for longer, so I\u2019m curious, are you seeing leases longer and is that intentional on your part. And how are you thinking about it?","Mark Parrell","So you are correct. First of all that, the spread is about 100 basis points improvement in new lease change when you isolate to the 12 to 12. I haven\u2019t really seen much from a demand standpoint changing in the willingness to take long-term leases we\u2019ve done some stuff in LA we do some stuff strategically in front of some of the supply to try to get some longer leases in place, but we haven\u2019t seen anything whether that be in New York or California yet that would suggest consumers are looking for longer term leases or that turnover has changed. I mean New York turnover, for example, one of my questions, which is whether we would see a difference between our market rate and our rent stabilized portfolio in terms of turnover and they both are moving in the similar way. So maybe I guess it\u2019s just one quarter of data and we\u2019ll see, but my expectation was that the rent stabilized portfolio would start to have even lower turnover than the market rate portfolio, but that has not yet proven to be true.","Richard Hill","Got it. And look, I mean is going everyone focusing on the negatives of rent regulation, but I think there were some foreign investors that would argue that this in the consequences of restricting supply and accelerating rents, could you comment about how you think about that maybe over the medium to long-term and either California or New York?","Mark Parrell","Yes, it\u2019s Mark. We certainly have talked on several occasions, the fact that these rent control rules in the long run are going to reduce supply and even though the affordable New York program for example wasn\u2019t specifically changed, these sort of rules have a chilling effect on capital going into development. And so for an owner like us of properties that already have a relatively low basis because we\u2019ve owned them a long time, in a lot of regards the government has now been our partner in reducing supply and increasing the competitive moat. But and we also have opportunities on expenses that we\u2019ve talked about whether it\u2019s leasing and advertising, because again, we\u2019re more highly occupied, turn costs and the like, but I have to be fair about this and I\u2019ve said this before, rent regulation when it reduces the amount the supply of housing, ultimately reduces the dynamism and vibrancy of a city and that\u2019s not good for us. We would rather see and take a little bit of pain in the short run but see these neighborhoods continue to build out and our existing assets become even more popular and there will be even more entertainment options and more of everything. So I would suggest that rent control is I think we can manage through and to this point has been not as significant as maybe some folks who thought it would be, but it\u2019s hard for me to say that it\u2019s a positive in the long run to these cities.","Richard Hill","Got it.","Mark Parrell","Because \u2013 I think it\u2019s very damaging to the cities.","Richard Hill","Got it. And just one follow-up question, the 4.4% cap rate that you cited, I think, some would say that\u2019s pretty compelling against the global macro backdrop where we stand right now, is 4.5% cap just sort of steady state for where you see cap rates right now. I guess I\u2019m not asking you to tell me where they\u2019re going forward. But is 4.5% cap representative of where you think you could buy, let\u2019s just say the LA market for instance?","Mark Parrell","Yes, I think that\u2019s probably fair or maybe a little bit lower. I mean I think the range we\u2019re operating in is 4.3% to 4.7% for markets like Boston near the low end of that cap rate range, where it\u2019s just super competitive and a market like Denver more toward the higher end of that range.","Richard Hill","Got it. Helpful color guys. Thanks very much.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","John Kim","Thank you. This quarter your dispositions were very targeted in Berkeley. And as we get prop 10, 2.0 as you call it coming back. Are you looking to reposition out of certain markets within California or is age really the primary factor of the asset sales?","Mark Parrell","Certainly the regulatory scheme, the pressure we feel, the welcome frankly that the city puts out for us is a factor. The Berkeley assets had both asset characteristics and city characteristics that made them worth selling. So I\u2019d say we aware of places where it\u2019s more difficult to do business and we factor that into our decisions to sell.","John Kim","Okay. And sticking to the market, do you have any commentary on Google and Facebook and potentially other tech companies investing billions of capital into the housing market in San Francisco? Is there any potential for you to partner with these on the development or to participate in their incentive program?","Mark Parrell","Sure. While we welcome those sorts of conversations certainly, and I know we try and engage in of sort of dialogs. I think this is great. I think Facebook\u2019s announcement I believe was $1 billion and I think that equated to about $50,000 a unit. So clearly there is something else going on here in terms of the government matching or contributing land or doing some other things. I think it\u2019s great to alleviate some of these housing shortages. I think it\u2019s very thoughtful for big office users to also be thinking about housing. And I think this is just another ingredient in the solution that the government can utilize if it sees fit.","John Kim","But can EQR partner with them or is that not really\u2026","Mark Parrell","Sure, we are open to that. We are absolutely open to that. And a lot of cases they are making \u2013 if they are building a project that\u2019s employee specific, for tech company is building what amounts to a dormitory for their employees, that\u2019s probably a little less interesting for us. If they are building properties where in along with maybe the city contributing land and they\u2019re contributing capital and we are in a partnership and we are building it, that\u2019s all, that\u2019s very interesting. Those kind of opportunities would be very worthwhile for us.","John Kim","Thank you.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","Thanks. And our next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Derek Johnston","Hi everyone. With cap rates currently low and development yield targets hard to justify. We expect continued and possibly accelerated capital recycling. Going forward, I think you guys have mentioned that, will you be focusing on Denver I think that\u2019s certainly a key market, but currently a pretty small earnings contributor. So what is the target NOI contribution you\u2019d like to see from that market?","Mark Parrell","Yes, great question. So our goal, as we mentioned in Denver is to get it up to call it 5% of our NOI. Right now it\u2019s about 1.5%. That\u2019s probably funded with some incremental capital but probably some recycling out of places like Washington DC, where we like the market, but we have a significant concentration and where there been some serious supply issues over the years, as well as maybe some money from some of the other markets here and there. So I think you can expect us to continue to acquire in Denver, we acquired one asset in the past quarter, we have almost $600 million invested in that market and I\u2019d like to see that number closer to $2 billion and our concentration closer to 5%.","Derek Johnston","Excellent. Helpful. And then what is the new low end requirement on development yields from your perspective. Just given the environment today, I think you mentioned a projected 5.2% on an asset, I think was in San Francisco during the opening remarks. So what would the low end be?","Mark Parrell","Well, the way you just spoke to that is really the merchant builder thought process and that\u2019s fine, that\u2019s not our thought process. I mean the fact that we can build something in a place for example it\u2019s very hard to build like Boston, the fact that we can build a tower there and maybe, and we\u2019ve said this, we have slightly lower than 5% current yield on that property mark to market, if you mark the land to market on that deal, that doesn\u2019t bother us in the least because we really like our basis in the asset, it\u2019s hard to buy, it\u2019s a location we really like, we like everything about the demand and supply dynamics. So I don\u2019t have a number \u2013 it was a 4.5% cap rate on current rents, we are were done. I don\u2019t feel that way. I think as we talk about, it is a group as a management team and with the board. It\u2019s about how protected is that market, what are the demand dynamics, how do we feel about our basis and our per square foot and unit basis. So for us, it isn\u2019t just I got to deliver it at a 5.5% cap rate, two years from now, because I got one year to sell it or else my equity would wipe me out as a developer. That\u2019s just not the kind of deals we do. For us, I think it\u2019s a little bit different of a thought process and it isn\u2019t a minimum. It\u2019s just part of the ingredients of the thought process. You still there?","Derek Johnston","Yes. Thank you.","Mark Parrell","Thank you","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please go ahead, sir.","Rich Anderson","Thanks. Good morning. So on the cap rates, can you just \u2013 those are economic cap rates that you saw in the acquisitions and dispositions?","Mark Parrell","Yes, they are after our normal thought process on CapEx for these types of assets.","Rich Anderson","Okay. So is it, what do you assume on the buy side and what do you assume on the sell side from a CapEx perspective?","Mark Parrell","Well, it depends. I mean some of the older assets we sell. it\u2019s got a higher CapEx low to them I have some of the stuff in front of me, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m in a position to give you exact numbers \u2013 we talked about in our disclosure materials on \u2013 page 27 I think we define for you acquisition capitalization rate or cap rate and give you a sense of kind of what the underwriting looks like from a in unit replacement, CapEx etcetera, and how that\u2019s kind of condition that might give you some color, Rich.","Rich Anderson","Alright. So I guess my point is very little, if any dilution from these trades, but if you were to load, got to the FFO line. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s more important. But if you were what would the spread be or do you have that number available to you, if it\u2019s 30 basis points on an economic basis?","Mark Parrell","Do you mean FFO \u2013 AFFO of after the replacement reserves and everything else for example? Yes, like Park at Pentagon Row that\u2019s, that\u2019s a good thing to talk about for a second. I mean we looked at the buyers numbers as best we can. And again, that\u2019s not what we disclose and we put in $200 a unit for that per year. I can tell you that number is way too low. We also put $200 unit in some of the 2017, 2018 product we bought in California. And I think that number is just fine on stuff that was built a year to 18 months ago. So I think when you start to get to where the rubber meets the road and what you\u2019re replacements really are a lot of the stuff we\u2019re doing isn\u2019t accretive in the long run, it\u2019s accretive right then and now.","Rich Anderson","Yes. Okay, alright. And then shifting to California, 48% of your portfolio, housing shortage, regulation, business unfriendly, wildfires, earthquakes, school funding issues, out-migration of population, you know, there is a lot of things going on in California and yet you are showing signs of continuing to grow there. Would it be fair to say that you\u2019re not going to get smaller in California, but younger, is that the basic game plan or do you see yourself, sort of whittling down your exposure to rent control inclusive of New York City, which brings up to about 63% exposed to rent control situations?","Mark Parrell","Well, I mean there\u2019s so much to un-bundle in that. I mean, I just want to start by saying, you do have plague a horrible, as you mentioned in California, but there is a lot of positives that we wouldn\u2019t known and I know, is that you\u2019re a veteran guy, you know that. I mean the job creation machine in California. The Company creation machine, a whole employment picture in the United States is to some extent driven by what\u2019s going on in California In terms of technology and going on in the West Coast and now spread everywhere throughout the country. So I would say, we like a lot of the dynamics there and things that would scare us about California are mostly about those job dynamics changing, that sort of demand stuff would be most concerning to us, we don\u2019t, as Michael said in his remarks on San Francisco, we just don\u2019t see that yet. I also say that Prop 13 and remember the split role initiative doesn\u2019t affect us in the apartment business. Having your largest single expense, significantly lower, I mean we have a lot of markets where outside of New York, where property taxes are going up 5%, 7% a year. And in California, they are considerably lower. That\u2019s a huge advantage to us in terms of what our return is. So I\u2019d say there is still plenty of positive things about California, notwithstanding some of the elements of the plagues that you mentioned earlier. And I think you hit it on the head in terms of the California strategy. We do not want to have more NOI in California that we have now. I think we\u2019re about right, maybe a little lower be okay too, but I think we do want to be younger. I think we have some older assets that even withstanding, notwithstanding rent control we want to sell. And I think we\u2019ll continue along that play and you\u2019ll see us sell some of the stuff that\u2019s a little bit older in the portfolio and try and keep our portfolio in California particularly young.","Rich Anderson","Perfect. That\u2019s all I got. Thanks.","Mark Parrell","Thank you, sir.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Drew Babin with Baird. Please go ahead, sir.","Drew Babin","Hey, good morning.","Mark Parrell","Good morning.","Drew Babin","Wanted to expand on Richard\u2019s question, demand growth in California, obviously there is a bit of a North heavy element to that and with LA with the revenue growth expectations coming down to say, despite some supply being pushed out in the next year, I guess is the demand picture in LA and I guess Southern California generally been somewhat disappointing, I know had kind of a slow start to the year, kind of came back. Can you talk a little more about that trajectory, as it applies to Southern California and what we might expect for next year?","Mark Parrell","Yes, so I don\u2019t say that Southern Cal is disappointing at all on the demand side. I think what you\u2019re seeing right now in our numbers and what we\u2019ve talked about even in the previous quarters is we knew deceleration was going to be come and just based on the supply coming right on top of us. So even though while there was that shift of supply kind of moving the supply is on top of us in Downtown LA right now and we feel that, but the demand is still strong for our type of product. It\u2019s just, we\u2019re not having as much pricing power. And as I think as you go into 2020 just in my prepared remarks, we recognize that we\u2019re still going to have that pressure sitting on us in the first part of the year and LA. So I think it\u2019s clear to say that it\u2019s not that the demand is shifting. It\u2019s really more just the pressure that we\u2019re feeling from the supplier.","Drew Babin","Okay, appreciate the color. And then on one more shift to the East Coast new leasing spreads. If you kind of average that over the full year have gone from negative in some cases to flat to kind of what I\u2019ll call may be inflationary levels, given the current national employment backdrop, wage growth trends, home ownership trends, demographic trends, all the things you look at, I guess how do you feel about the potential for those leasing spreads to maybe exceed, to maybe go to like a CPI plus type of territory in the near-term, based on everything we know right now, kind of the steady state economy?","Mark Parrell","Well, I guess, I would tell you, I kind of opened it up, which is what we thought about kind of next year at the high level for some of those markets. But I would say the momentum for the East Coast markets has been strong, but you\u2019ve got to factor in just like I said, for next year with Boston. We\u2019re starting to see the supply come back on us in Boston, which mean just like the conversation we had in LA, we will experience some pricing pressure that we haven\u2019t had to deal with this year, but the overall demand picture and the overall momentum that we feel on new lease growth and renewal growth is really good in the East Coast markets.","Drew Babin","I appreciate all the color. Thank you.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Alexander Goldfarb","I guess it\u2019s still good morning out there.","Mark Parrell","Good morning","Alexander Goldfarb","I have two questions. Good morning. I have two questions. You gave some color on revenue, the other element obviously our expenses which have outpaced revenue this year. So as you think about next year and what you\u2019re seeing on the different elements that form the OpEx, do you think that this year\u2019s sort of outpacing revenue that\u2019s going to continue next year, or are there some initiatives or abilities for you guys to contain such that OpEx will grow inside of revenue next year?","Bob Garechana","Hey, Alex. Bob. Obviously, we\u2019re very focused on reducing that number. Overall, I think if you look at our 10-year history, we generated something that\u2019s well under 3% on expenses and we\u2019d like to get to that arena again. One of the things that we\u2019ve talked about on the screen called many times that is a challenge for us is the 421a assets. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress in the sales that we\u2019ve had in reducing that rate of growth, but it does to overall, same-store expenses on average contribute 60 basis points of incremental growth. So anything away at that could obviously present some opportunities. Michael talked about in the past initiatives and opportunities that we will focus on there, but it\u2019s hard to get over that real estate tax piece, although we\u2019ve done a lot to make that better.","Alexander Goldfarb","Right. But I mean looking across all your items are sort of 3% plus. So it\u2019s not just the real estate taxes.","Bob Garechana","No. Yes. So it\u2019s not just real estate taxes, right. There are some things that I think we give you some color on page 16 on expenses on certain things that are one-time in nature, for instance, that are \u201819 or might be one-time or less frequent like the ground lease revaluation that\u2019s other expenses and the HOA kind of holiday. That was in other expenses that you wouldn\u2019t expect necessarily to recur. We\u2019re not giving you 2020 guidance. I got to say that in 2020, there might be some things that pop up that could go the other way. You heard us and others talk about the benefit in real estate taxes that we saw in Seattle this year that may not repeat itself, but we\u2019re very focused on making sure that we can manage those expense line items to be lowest possible growth rate overall.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then the second thing is Mark appreciate your upfront comments on the California rent control and New York. As you look to next year, it seems like Albany is taking that CPI plus rent cap to try and have a market rate rent control. So, which would not have, as best as we can see from the press reports, would not have all the flexibility that California has, what do you guys see differently in how you and the industry would approach Albany in the upcoming legislative year versus what happened in the prior year?","Mark Parrell","Well, I\u2019ll start by saying I don\u2019t think anyone on this call, myself included, is in any position to predict what a politician will do or what the political system will do and how many or elsewhere. So it\u2019s hard to say. I\u2019ve read the same things you read, Alex, and we\u2019re working with our advocates in New York. So what I\u2019d say is I think there needs to be more dialog than maybe there has been so far. And we\u2019re working to do that. I know that the people we have on the ground talk a lot to policy makers, but I\u2019m not sure those channels couldn\u2019t be opened even wider. I do know that there has been some conversations even from the mayor\u2019s office about whether the first stage of rent control is working very well in New York. I think there is already things that make you wonder about whether this is such a great idea. And I would hope the policymakers would take that into account before considering or passing new rules on top of the already onerous regulations passed back in June. So what I hope for the most is to have the industry have a seat at the table for that dialog and that\u2019s what as a member of the industry and as a big owner in New York, we\u2019ll push for.","Alexander Goldfarb","Thank you.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Hardik Goel from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead, sir.","Hardik Goel","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions. We\u2019ve heard a lot about cost controls in terms of \u2013 on the personnel side, where you essentially have less employees. Maybe you pay the remaining once more and you essentially are leveraging technology to achieve that. Can you talk a little bit about how much of that you\u2019re doing and what you see the future of that over the next two years? How does that play out?","Mark Parrell","Yes. So I think I said over the course of the next couple of quarters, I think you\u2019ll see us talk more specifically around some of the financial kind of impact from some of these initiatives, I would say, sitting here right now, it\u2019s pretty clear that several of these initiatives combined are ultimately going to create some operating efficiencies in the portfolio. For us the goal of doing all these initiatives has really been around better experiences for our employees and residents and we expect that the efficiencies that we gain on the operation staff that will impact staffing level will really just happen through attrition in the workplace. The initiatives on the sales side of the business are already starting to show time save, definitely offering our customers flexibility and convenience. And on the service side of the business, right now our expectation is that our dependency and reliance on contractors and overtime that we pay out should start to be reduced over time. So I think it\u2019s clear in the next couple of quarters, we\u2019ll start putting some more financial numbers in front of you guys, but over the course of the next couple of years, the operating efficiencies will start to manifest themselves through leveraging this technology.","Hardik Goel","And just a quick one on utilities as well, which line items will this effect overall, I guess, and then a little bit on utilities, are you guys doing anything pertaining to that?","Michael Manelis","Yes, so just to make sure I understood the question, kind of what\u2019s driving the utility cost in the quarter and year-to-date, and that\u2019s mostly, it\u2019s been pretty self-contained in the gas and electric component, most of the increase, we are slightly higher in the third quarter, was coming from some garbage and trash-related expenses, which is predominantly from the West Coast, from a couple of markets in the West Coast.","Hardik Goel","Got it. And then I meant to ask which line items are most affected by the efficiency savings over the next two years that you mentioned?","Mark Parrell","Yes, the \u2013 what the payroll obviously which Mike alluded to, but also repairs and maintenance is where you tend to see most of that contract labor flow through. And oftentimes that\u2019s a line item where you might see some of that as we \u2013 on the service side. I don\u2019t know Michael if you have anything else?","Michael Manelis","Yes, I think, look, some of the, some of the initiatives around the smart home technology or even smart thermostats being put in the unit can help reduce some of the vacant electric cost associated with it. But those aren\u2019t significant dollars for us that are going to really equate to anything meaningful for us to be talking about.","Mark Parrell","Yes, on the utility side, because you did call that out specifically, we\u2019ve done almost every LED-type lighting project we can do, so some of the low hanging, really all the low hanging fruit is gone. We have a lot of solar installs and some of which are actually going to be pushed into the beginning of next year that we\u2019re going to do in this quarter and the fourth quarter that stuff will benefit us to. But, yes, on the utility side, it\u2019s this sort of the sustainability thought process we have that \u2013 we just put a new report out on our ESG efforts. There is a lot in there about it. That\u2019s going to help us on the utility items, but it takes some time to kind of get through the numbers, but again I think we\u2019ve done all the easy stuff and now we\u2019re onto things like solar and co-gen and other things that will save us money and be good for the environment but take a little time to manifest.","Hardik Goel","Thanks guys. That\u2019s all.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Wes Golladay","Yes, good morning guys. So you sold about $1 billion this year that \u2013 that\u2019s the plan and you\u2019re still have some non-core assets with you, but you did mention potentially using leverage to buy assets. I\u2019m trying to get the magnitude, if you will be a net acquirer next year. Is it a fair to assume that you\u2019ve done the heavy lifting on some of the non-core assets this year?","Mark Parrell","Yes, I mean we \u2013 have a $40 billion portfolio, there is always an asset or two that is becoming obsolete for whatever reason, where the neighborhoods change, the dynamics change, there will always be an asset here or there that need selling, but it isn\u2019t significant. It is like we have this incredible burden where we\u2019re tearing a whole market, we don\u2019t want to own or anything like that, that\u2019s just not the case anymore, and you can evidence that most by seeing our little dilution in this case, in this year none that we have because we are basically buying and selling in the same markets and just buying newer product versus the older. So next year, will we buy more than we sell, we will see and that mostly depends on the competition, it isn\u2019t that we\u2019ve been hesitant to start raising debt by assets. It\u2019s just that we haven\u2019t been able to find enough good product at prices we were willing to pay in order to fire up that acquisition machine. So it\u2019s really more about our spend in the next two or three months, seeing if there is enough in the pipeline for us to really buy in order to to kind of have a net acquisition year in 2020.","Wes Golladay","Okay. And then looking at the turnover, that just continues to trend lower, kind of surprised a lot of people, and when I look to next year. I\u2019m thinking about the smart home technology is going to be more robust next year, more people going to adopt it, does that actually drive turnover lower, is that too aggressive of an assumption on my part?","Mark Parrell","No, I don\u2019t think the correlation there, I think lifestyle changes of our resident base is really, the probably most significant catalyst to the reduction in turnover, and we\u2019ve proven time and time again that turnover is correlated to resident satisfaction. So as we keep focused on increasing our overall resident satisfaction, we should still continue to see reductions in turnover. How much lower it can go. I don\u2019t know, I would think that it stabilizes here at some point, but I guess that every quarter we continue to inch that down a little bit.","Wes Golladay","Thank you.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","Thanks. And our next question comes from Nick Joseph again with Citi. Please go ahead.","Michael Bilerman","Hi, it\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Nick. Mark, you mentioned Prop 10, 2.0, you had I think it was $4.5 million last year that you spent on that campaign, you added that back to normalized FFO, even though I would argue you\u2019re in the business and you spend money to advocate for your business, that\u2019s the business cost, putting that part aside because that\u2019s in the past. I would assume your costs are going to continue as rent control initiatives and just going to happen next year in California, and it\u2019s going to go across the US, how should we think about the money you\u2019re spending. How much it could be, how you\u2019re going to treat it?","Mark Parrell","Yes, good question. Thank you for that. Michael. So you can see on Page 25 that the amount we spent this year on advocacy is $200,000 versus the number last year that I think approached 5 actually at the end of the day, mostly California related. So there is great variability, it\u2019s like a lawsuit. We sometimes settle a lawsuit and get money, which we then settle a lawsuit and pay money, they\u2019re not important to the core operation of the business.","Michael Bilerman","I don\u2019t think I can get any money back on this one.","Mark Parrell","Yes. So what I tell you is we\u2019ll do and we promise to do is be very clear , like we are on Page 25, we\u2019ll tell you what we\u2019re spending, whether it\u2019s in or out of norm FFO will convene our Chief Accounting Officer, our very capable CFO, and our audit committee and we\u2019ll decide what we\u2019re going to do next year, but I agree with you that at some point if you have large recurring every year costs, then they are just part of your business. For us this has been unusual. Last year was, I don\u2019t remember any year like that. And I\u2019ve been at the company for 20 plus years, so that\u2019s when we call out something is when it\u2019s unusual and it was not affecting the run rate of our cash flows.","Michael Bilerman","Thank you. And then if we think about the acquisitions and you\u2019ve been fortunate that you\u2019ve been able to match them perfectly with dispose and not have any dilution, which you had in years past, where you\u2019ve been calling higher cap rate assets, you mentioned early on about IRRs and thinking about rent control and how the deal that you bought are going to pencil in the high sixes versus in the sevens. How \u2013 what is in that IRR analysis over the next, let\u2019s call it five years from a fundamental standpoint there \u2013 we are obviously extraordinary long in this economic cycle. There is a significant amount of caution flags that are out there right now from an economic and a global perspective, are you modeling any sort of slowdown in that IRR and when are you doing it?","Mark Parrell","So the way we think about, and I\u2019m going to use rent growth as revenue growth as the kind of biggest thing you are thinking about biggest variable. We have a good sense of what will happen in the next year. We know the markets we\u2019re going into, we know if there is a bunch of supply. We know if the prior owner was running asset well where the rents are too low, maybe they have been, they have, nominally high rents but high concessions. So we understand the existing rent roll in the market and then you\u2019ll get a number that\u2019s very specific as a result of that. So I\u2019m looking for example at our underwriting for Denver and our number for rent growth in year one is slightly negative. And it\u2019s slightly negative because we understand what\u2019s going on in that submarket and we have priced the deal to that. Over the long haul we pick a number that we think is appropriate. We don\u2019t pro forma year that\u2019s going to be negative, even though we know there is one there, just like we don\u2019t perform a year when it\u2019s 6%, even though we know there is going to be one of those. So in the near term, what we do Michael is we really think hard about what\u2019s going on and for the first year or two we feel pretty good about that on revenue growth after that we\u2019re putting an average out there, it\u2019s usually somewhere around 3 and saying to ourselves, there\u2019ll be years where it will be way low on that number, of years we will be way high and this will be a good average. And then we spent a whole bunch of time thinking about the cap rate at the end of the deal, and that\u2019s kind of the thought process that the team has.","Michael Bilerman","And then I wanted to come back on your financing comment about maybe using some additional leverage. Do you think the debt markets not only availability of capital but the cost of that capital being so low, both on the secured and the unsecured side is perhaps driving on economic decisions that could come back and bite us from a basis perspective?","Mark Parrell","That we are talking about us specifically being EQR I\u2019d say no, with the thought being that we\u2019re talking about relatively small amounts of money relative to the size of the company. Do I think there is excesses in the sovereign debt market or in with the central banks are doing, I think there\u2019s a lot of people to think that\u2019s true. I mean there\u2019s a lot of interesting and unusual things going on in those markets in the short-term funding market, things like that, but I don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re putting the company in any risk adding several hundreds of million dollars of debt to the balance sheet and adding hundreds of millions dollars of high-quality assets, that feels fine to me.","Michael Bilerman","I said now whether there was expenses that you see in the apartment acquisition market given the amount of cheap financing available where you\u2019re seeing assets trade at levels that perhaps you would want to own them long term?","Mark Parrell","I wonder if some of that isn\u2019t the equity, are you really on the debt, so the debt\u2019s been cheap for a while. This isn\u2019t like a new factor really. I think what really is going on as you got a hard asset class with stable to good operating performance, good demographics that\u2019s easy to understand and we are to some extent a safety, then we are also a substitute for fixed income, I think a lot of people look at apartments and the private side is all over it because they feel all those things. So I think a lot of the positive you see, that may be why development capital is a little less available equity because that is perceived correctly, is ,considerably more risky whereas buying a stabilized asset in a great market at a 4.5% cap rate feels like a good trade not going to turn out bad.","Michael Bilerman","Yes, great. Thanks for the color and see you in a few weeks.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Haendel Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Haendel Juste","Hey, there. So had a few questions, first, I guess given the low cap rate decided and challenge of putting capital to work for new acquisitions here in your core markets, what\u2019s your current view today or more recently with the Board on expanding the portfolio year to perhaps some vibrant secondary markets that offer higher returns that not too dissimilar from say a Denver maybe Austin, Portland and Salt Lake and then what type of yield IRR premium would you require to go into those markets versus say your more established core markets?","Mark Parrell","Great question. Thank you for that. Yes, we had our regularly scheduled board meeting a few weeks ago and at that meeting, we talked about market allocations and I think you\u2019ve been around a while, so you know in our book we have page usually it\u2019s page 16 of our investor book, where we talk about other markets \u2013 our markets and other markets and the relative attractiveness. And the example you gave of Austin, Austin screens particularly well. The issue to date has been that Austin trades as good or better at the moment as some of our other primary markets do and we\u2019re not sure that makes a lot of sense and that IRR is defensible. So would we go into another market, is that possible? Sure, that\u2019s possible. But in the near-term what we are trying to do is do things that makes sense both on the real estate side but are good on the FFO side and the buy \u2013 there is an asset that traded recently in Austin \u2013 it was a good asset that\u2019s a sub-4 cap rate, I don\u2019t know why that\u2019s a good idea from our perspective. So for us it\u2019s both having these great demand and good supply statistics like Austin has, especially on the demand side, but it\u2019s also just a matter of price, there may be markets we\u2019d like to be, and they\u2019re just not price for our entry as they\u2019re just too expensive. So I can\u2019t give you an exact premium, but there is a cost to us going into a new market because until we have a good enough size. We don\u2019t have as good a coverage. We don\u2019t have the same number of people in that market doing maintenance items for example and oversight. We have people on-site doing their jobs, but just we don\u2019t have an on-site human resources manager for Denver, those sorts of things. There\u2019s travel costs and stuff. And then as you build it out, you have those people on site. So I would tell you that you don\u2019t need to just get to be a market with a little higher cap rate for it to be more compelling.","Haendel Juste","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks Mark. And then I guess the perceptual potential risk of going maybe back into the market that you exited in 2015. I believe I know that you had a largely suburban older portfolio and I think you\u2019re a bit more concentrated or focused on more urban locations, but just curious how that weighs into the consideration as well.","Mark Parrell","Well, I mean the good news is this team has been here a long time. Some of us are newer to our jobs, but none of us are new to the company. So we know that thought process, we understand it, some of the markets we exited, many of them we are delighted to have exited. We were in Austin, many, many years ago with a very different suburban portfolio and to me that\u2019s an argument like Denver. We didn\u2019t leave the Denver market we left did specific Denver assets we own. So I feel like, if the markets changed, circumstances have changed, and we can explain it to ourselves to the Board and to you, then we go back into that market. And if we can\u2019t, we wouldn\u2019t and nothing will change our minds on that.","Haendel Juste","Okay. And then one last one, I think you mentioned $500 million of potential new development starts on an annual basis at least near term. I guess I\u2019m curious, should we assume these will be all within the existing core markets. And then given the development challenges, the rising costs, yield compression you outlined earlier, how confident are you of meeting that that figure and then should we be expecting similar low 5 stabilized yield on that? Thank you.","Mark Parrell","Well, next year, we will see whether we get to $500 million and it was more of a spend number. So we have existing assets under construction, especially the Alcot deal in Boston that are going to be a significant amount of cash next year as we get closer to completing it. So whether we start exactly $500 million or not, I\u2019m not sure, but we expect to start modestly more development than we have seen this year and last year, but I can tell you it won\u2019t be outside our markets. It\u2019s not a great idea from our point of view to have our first asset in the new market, be a development deal, we would rather buy some stabilized assets, make sure we understand what\u2019s going on and then there is a development opportunity like Denver, we\u2019re open for business to do development for sure in that market, but I don\u2019t expect us to enter a new market by doing development.","Haendel Juste","Thank you.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from John Guinee with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Aaron Wolf","Hey, all, Good morning. This is Aaron Wolf on for John Guinee. I just have one \u2013 you provided a great amount of commentary on your development pipeline in your project list and you may have covered this and I apologize if you have, does the 489,000 unit for the Edgemore project, does that include capitalized ground lease?","Mark Parrell","So it does include a ground lease. But let me give you some statistics. Just bear with me as I find the correct pile here but I gave you a cap rate I believe was about 5.9% cap rate, and that cap rate would go down to a 5.1% if we had bought the land. So going to take that question a different way, imagine we had bought the land, the per unit cost of the land would have been about 100,000 a unit in our estimation. And that would have driven down the yield from 5.9% to 5.1%. So that gives you an idea. We always think about ground leases AS financing tools. So the answer is yes. It\u2019s in our numbers and it\u2019s correctly accounted for as a GAAP matter. But when we think about it at the investment side, we\u2019re thinking about it is a financing and making sure we\u2019re comfortable that if we had bought the land in FY, it\u2019s still a good transaction.","Aaron Wolf","Okay, great. Thank you. That was my one question.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we have no additional questions at this time.","Mark Parrell","Thank you very much. We appreciate everyone sticking with us on the call and we will see you around the conference circuit.","Operator","Thank you all for your attention. This concludes today\u2019s conference.

And welcome to the first quarter 2012 earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded today, Thursday, April 26, 2012. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Marty McKenna. Go ahead, sir.","Marty McKenna","Thanks, Jo. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's First Quarter 2012 Results. Our featured speakers today are David Neithercut, our President and CEO; and Fred Tuomi, our EVP of Property Management. David Santee, our EVP of Property Operations; and Mark Parrell, our CFO, are also here with us for the Q&A.","Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Law. These forward-looking statements are certain to economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.","And now I'll turn the call over to David.","David J. Neithercut","Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everybody. We appreciate you taking the time to join us today for our first quarter call. Clearly, the strength and operating fundamentals that the multifamily space has enjoyed the last 6 quarters or so has certainly carried over into the first quarter 2012 and should continue for the balance of the year. And those fundamentals drove our first quarter results, which came in very much in line with our expectations. ","Our same-store revenue growth in the quarter was 5.5% and same-store NOI growth was a very strong 7.8%. Our new lease rates are pretty much where we thought they'd be and renewal rates continue to trend in the sixes just as we had expected. So we feel very good about where we sit today and to help you understand how we're currently positioned moving in to our primary leasing season, I'm going to hand the call over to Fred and he'll share a bit about the current trends we're seeing across our markets.","Frederick C. Tuomi","Thank you, David. Let me do this, talk about some of our key markets but before I do that, I just want to give you a quick update on our key drivers of our revenue. ","And for the first quarter, the drivers of our revenue support our full year same-store revenue growth around the midpoint of our guidance that we gave back in January. So let me give you a quick update on each of those 4 drivers. ","First is turnover. And the recent turnover is up. It\u2019s up 100 basis points the first quarter of this year versus last year. However if you look within the quarter, January and February did have a pretty good spike in move outs compared to the same months last year. But then March came right back in line with 2011 and as did April after the end of the quarter. ","So look at where we are in the market. Kind of as expected, the markets with the strongest rent growth have been having some price resistance on renewals. And it's natural when you think about it, residents who traded up in quality and in rent levels during the recession will eventually be priced out at some point and that's happening in some of our high-growth markets. ","Home buying is up in a few areas but not by much and still well below historic norms. Home buying is really not a problem and continues to be in check. That takes us to occupancy. And while occupancy did match the first quarter of last year at 94 9, it was below kind of what we wanted for the first quarter, below our budgets, below our expectations. And the occupancy in our key markets actually declined throughout the quarter as we held on to our higher rates. And we believe that making a trade right now in our strong markets, trading some occupancy or holding those higher rates is actually a good strategy at this point in the cycle.","Now as we enter the leasing season, we fully expect and begin to see a recapture of that occupancy at those higher rates that we held onto as we enter the leasing season. And let me make a point here, that new residents still showed no problem at accepting and achieving these new rates. So we are seeing some turnover based on the prices of the stack but not on new leases coming in. ","So that takes us to the base rents. And as David mentioned, base rents running just as we expected to Q1 averaging about 6.5% over 2011 levels during the quarter. ","And then finally, renewals. Renewals remain very strong. We averaged 6.6% increases for the quarter and in the month of April, we actually closed out 6.9% real increases for the quarter. Now let's take a quick look in the sampling of some of our markets. ","First is Boston, Massachusetts. Boston has been on a great run as you know. After several quarters of double-digit rent growth, we did experience price resistance during the first quarter. And therefore turnover did move up in this market. Occupancy is now recovering very quickly at rents 10% or more above last year. In town, in Cambridge, some markets are doing great and definitely Quincy not quite strong as we're having some a little more of turnover and some home buying down in Quincy.","New York. Well, New York, the financial sector is still holding very strong, very steady. And the new trend of people coming in from tech, new media and entertainment is continuing. We continue to see folks from those industries moving into our markets, into our properties there, especially in the markets of Upper West Side and Chelsea. Turnover did spike in New York also, being a high-growth market. January and February especially on the loss of some short-term corporate leases and in some anecdotal reports of people trading down and moving into other neighborhoods from -- as the rents recover back to peak periods. ","Current traffic and leasing trends made in the last few weeks are very strong and occupancy is now rebuilding quickly at rents 5% to 6% above last year. And renewals through the whole quarter remaining stable in the mid-6% increase range from New York.","Moving down to D.C. We, like everyone else, expect D.C. to experience the slowdown throughout this year. Government cutbacks and hiring freezes and salary freezes and per diem freezes are in place getting to show up and then contractor uncertainty because of this is beginning to take hold. As we go later in the year, this is going to match up with the delivery of the 8,000 units this year and it's going to create a little more payment in the backside of this year. ","Renewals remain strong right now however at 6%. And base rent growth still growing but the gap over last year is narrowing to the 3% to 4% range and this will continue as we come up to a tougher comp period from last year. ","So jumping across the country over to Seattle. Seattle has been a great market. But when we talk about Seattle now we're going to have to talk about it in terms of submarkets. Because I don't know if you know or not, but our Seattle market, as reported, includes 2,347 units from Tacoma. And Tacoma is not really the same market as Seattle. It's pretty much a military town. And the military rotations out of Fort Lewis have been dramatic and ongoing and has been a drag on our results. So without Tacoma, our 6.1% revenue growth in Q1 for Seattle is actually a 7.1% revenue growth. ","And within that, CBD, in the downtown and East Side are very strong, CBD posted a 6.6, east side a 8.7 and the big tech firms are all continuing to hire. New hiring is strong, interims hiring is strong and they're doing great. So currently, our base rents are up 10% year-over-year and renewals are in the 8-plus percent range in these submarkets. ","Also in Seattle, Snohomish up North and the King County South are not quite as strong and still doing fine. So we expect Seattle to have a good run here but to eventually slow throughout the year as the development pipeline begins to deliver the 3,000 units this year and I guess looking forward to 2013 and '14, there is still that pipeline of about 6,000 more units coming in, mostly downtown and the near downtown submarkets.","Going down to San Francisco. San Francisco as you know has been a very hot market for some quite time now, several quarters, very strong double-digit rent growth. So it shouldn't be a surprise that that's what seeing the most push back on pricing. And the results has been a pretty big increase in turnover during Q1. 30% of our first quarter move outs gave us the recent increase to expenses or my rent's just too damn high. So like Boston, we believe in this market, we have confidence that the new lease potential is there. So we're holding rates in San Francisco at the expense of Q1 occupancy. So we're now filling April and May traffic at rates of 11% and 12% above last year and renewal increases are steady at 10.5% for April.","Down to Southern California. Los Angeles is still definitely in recovery mode. It's continuing on but still a little bit lumpy. L.A. is still constrained by its local economic problems, especially in the government sector. However, job growth has been revised up pretty dramatically for 2012 but we just haven't seen it yet. Q1 was flatter down as job growth has mostly back ended in the second half 2012. Base rents are growing steady in the 5% to 6% range, but we are seeing some persistent price sensitivity keeping occupancies below 95% by touch [ph] so far this year. April renewals in L.A., 5.5%.","And that takes us down to San Diego and, take us along with others, we'd have to say San Diego remains a disappointment. It's in positive territory, it's steady but at low levels of growth. Base rents are 1.5% to 2% above last year. April renewals are up 4.7% and occupancy just continues to lag on low demand based on military lease breaks and a little bit of an uptick in home buying in San Diego.","So overall, as David said, things are kind of as we expected at this point. The leasing season will really make the year. So we look forward to reporting you the results of leasing season on our second quarter call come July.","David J. Neithercut","Alright, thanks, Fred. So let me turn now -- about transactions and just like last year, our first quarter acquisition activity was minimal and well below our full year guidance of $1.25 billion might suggest. However, also like last year, we do expect the activity to increase as the year progresses and we've kept our full year acquisition expectations unchanged for the present time. We did acquire 3 assets in the quarter totaling 544 units for $159 million at a weighted average cap rate of 4.4%. We bought 102 units in Marina Del Rey, California. That built in 2003 and was acquired for $371,000 a door. We also acquired 319 units in Redmond, Washington built in 2009 and acquired for $299,000 a door. This asset is in the heart of Redmond in very close proximity to our Red160 develop deal, which should provide some operating synergies for those 2 assets. ","And lastly, in Redwood City, California, we acquired 123 units and an older asset on the Peninsula, midway between San Francisco and San Jose and immediately adjacent to the Stanford medical facility. It's a terrific value add deal that we acquired for $211,000 a door that we'll spend about $10,000 a door rehabbing. We're very excited about that opportunity. ","During the quarter, we sold only 3 assets, 2 in Portland, Oregon and 1 near Princeton, New Jersey totaling 1,522 units. We sold those deals for $206 million, averaging $136,000 a unit at a 6.2% cap rate and we're pleased to have realized a 12.6% unleveraged IRR inclusive of management cost in those transactions. ","Now you'll no doubt notice that the spread between our acquisitions and dispositions in the first quarter was a whopping 180 basis points on that activity, and I ask that you not read too much into that. This book cap rate is probably a pretty good proxy for what we expect to sell at least in the first half of the year but the acquisition cap is on the low end. In fact, just last week, we closed on a $230 million acquisition at a 5.3% cap rate and that averaged that spread down, compressed that spread delta to 127 or so basis point. So we still think this spread at 125 for the full year is the right estimate. ","So also I'll add, I tell you, I know I sound like a broken record when I say this, but there still is a great deal of capital chasing very few deals in the marketplace today. As a result, at least in our core markets, cap rates remain in the 4% to 5% range, where they've been for much of the last year. And it really is quite simply a very competitive acquisition environment out there today. ","So with the acquisition market intensely competitive, we continue to look for new opportunities for our development business. Last quarter, we acquired 2 land parcels for future development. One, right on the Biscayne Bay in Miami, Florida where we'll build 390 units for $97 million and we expect to achieve a mid-6% yield on current rents on that transaction. And we bought a land parcel in the South Lake Union neighborhood of Seattle where we'll build 283 units for $66 million and expected to achieve a low to mid-6% yield on current rents of that transaction. So for the full year, we currently expect to be in the position to start 8 projects totaling 1,430 units and totaling $630 million of total development cost. Now you may note this is down about $120 million from expectations at the beginning of the year because we've decided to first see if we can sell one asset that we are contemplating doing some work on that's actually an expansion of an existing property we own on the intercoastal in South Florida where we're recently able to increase the density of that site were going to look at disposing of that first.","So the sites for our 2012 starts are all currently on our balance sheet. We have 2 in New York City, 1 in South Florida, 2 in Seattle and 1 each in Southern California and the District of Columbia and current underwriting on those opportunities suggest the yield on cost in the low 6s on current rates. So before we open the call to questions, I what to say a few words about the Archstone situation, which I know a lot of the people have questions about. But you must bear in mind that I'm extremely limited as to what I can actually say. But what I can say is that we remain interested in working with all of the parties that have an interest in Archstone to see if there is not some way we can create a win-win situation for everyone. I'll tell you that doing that is not an easy task because there are a lot of parties involved and that many of those parties have different agendas, and we're trying to get everybody squared away. ","But to give us more time to see what we can get done, we recently extended, and this being for the second time, the period under which we have an exclusive right to cause the banks to sell the remaining 26.5% interest to us. And any offer that we do make will need for at least $1.5 billion and that offer will again be subject to Lehman's right to match it. And if they do, we'll receive a break-up fee of $80 million. Now we continue to think that much of the Archstone portfolio with hand and glove of ours, make a lot of sense in our platform and we are going to try to make it work. ","And so with that, Jo will happily open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Dave Bragg with Zelman & Associates.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Just wanted to touch on the disposition environment for you. Could you talk a little bit more about your expectations for the year, including whether or not you're current marketing assets for sale and maybe expand on that, as well as your perception of the appetite in this market for a portfolio sale?","David J. Neithercut","Well, we're always actively selling deals, Dave. And we've got properties out in the marketplace in Orlando, Jacksonville and Phoenix and most of the markets that you'd expect us to be disposing of assets. The remains of what we think is a pretty good bid for those assets. Fannie and Freddie continue to finance them. And we don't see any reason why we'd be unable to meet a goal of $1.25 billion on the disposition side. A lot of that will be a function of what kind of acquisition opportunities that we can find. Because our acquisition business is really self-funded from the disposition side. And our guys tell us that there could be interest in a large portfolio. There are a lot of people out there with a lot of capital that would be very interested in putting a lot of it to work in a single transaction. And if we wanted to do that, I think we could and do so very successfully.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Okay. And now that you've accomplished a lot on the restructuring side. As you look at some of the other markets that you might consider non-core, can you talk about your priorities in terms of incremental exits when you think about Atlanta, Orlando, Phoenix, maybe even Tacoma, et cetera?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I guess, we're -- continue to sell assets in many of those markets. As we continue to focus more on the higher density core markets. But I'm not sure that they are necessarily priorities. We'll continue to sell assets on a one-off basis across those -- some of those markets and continue to reduce our exposure there.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Okay. And then just a question on the outlook for the year. I think that you have a track record over the last few years of coming in at the high end of your revenue growth expectations. And you seem to be indicating that you're trending towards the midpoint. Can you talk about what has changed or what you're seeing over the first 4 months of the year that causes you to be maybe less comfortable with that high-end?","Frederick C. Tuomi","Yes. This is Fred Tuomi. As we mentioned, the first quarter kind of points to all the indicators right smack dab in the middle of our guidance. And the one area of our first quarter kind of held back a little bit. That would be -- the turnover was up in some of our key markets in January and February. And most of that turnover, when we dissected it, was these short-term corporate apartments that we had in there for late December, January, February in the key markets, the big rent markets like Boston, New York and lesser extent, in Seattle and San Francisco. So we had some of those high-paying premium units vacate during a slow period of the year so it's a little bit longer to refill them, and that's why we carried a little more vacancy during the Q1 than we had hoped for or really planned on. So first quarter was kind of -- the story was increased turnover due to some corporates, especially short-terms, some price resistance in our key markets leading to some lower occupancy. Now if you extrapolate that forward, like we said, that thing kind of guides us right towards the middle, around the middle of the range. We'll know more come July because the leasing season is just really cranking up. And the last couple of weeks, and in fact this week, very strong traffic, very strong leasing momentum building in those key markets like Boston's coming back quickly, San Francisco's coming back quickly, Seattle, Downtown and East Side, very strong, et cetera. So our strategy is that we held rates, we took that vacancy in Q1 and now we're going to refill the leasing season at higher rates. So in a perfect world of -- if the stars align, we could have good results. But right now, as I said before last quarter, we expect our average growth over last year of our base rents to be in the 5.5% range. If we get that, you can just kind of do the math and that's what we're saying kind of around the midpoint. But based on leasing season, that kind of the makes the year. So we'll know more here in just several weeks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citi.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just had a question about Fred's comments about seeing more turnover in markets with the best rent growth. I mean, would you actually see the resident turnover right now as a sign of strength in those markets or is it really more so that you need to start holding back on renewals given a higher turnover?","Frederick C. Tuomi","Yes. That's the essence of our -- what I meant by our strategy right now. We're happy right now to take that trade at a little more vacancy early in the year when there's not many transactions anyway. And keep our rent roll growing, keep our base rents up there and then just be waiting for the traffic to flow in the leasing season and fill up quickly at the higher rates versus tanking the rates, filling up and then be stuck with those leases throughout the year. So that shows confidence in the forward of the market in terms of demand will be there. And as I said earlier, the prices that we're at right now, we're not having a lot of resistance from new people coming in. Our rent to income ratio is still strong, credit is still strong, none of that has changed. So there is an ample supply of people willing, ready and able to pay the new leases. But we are already pitting that point of resistance on some renewals. And as I mentioned, the corporate people, as you top out the rents, plus the corporate premium, we're squeezing their margins. So naturally they're going to look for some alternatives at some point. So I would agree with you that things play out perfectly, that's going to be actually a good thing and not a bad thing at this point in the cycle. Different points in the cycle, you may play a different strategy.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. That makes sense. I just had a question on your leasing and advertising costs. I guess I look at your advertising cost for the last 2 years. They've come down pretty dramatically as has the rest of your peers. So I'm curious, is that just renegotiation of rates or was print that big a piece of your advertising? And I guess, thinking about it from another perspective, if you're reducing your advertising budget, is there a risk that you're not creating the same number of leads that you were before and it's having an impact on revenue?","David S. Santee","This is David Santee. When you look back, I think you have to go back about 4 years. And prior to the downfall in 2008, I mean, basically markets like New York and Boston were -- those are 2 big broker markets. And then during the downturn, the obligation to pay broker fees switched from the resident to the landlord and we increased those fees several million dollars. So when you look at our advertising costs today, you see that decline. All of that decline is associated with less broker fees in Boston and New York. All everything else -- I mean, certainly we've done a great job of reducing print. We continue to optimize our paid search and our other ILS's [ph] but really the entire savings is due to less broker fees than last year.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got you. And then one more quick question along those lines. I guess, how would you think about your sort of average customer acquisition cost in terms of advertising or however you allocate sort of the expenses to that category?","David S. Santee","Well, I mean, certainly the largest cost to acquire a new resident is the vacancy. But as far as hard cost go, when you have 50% turnover, 50-plus percent turnover and we're in $100 a unit, we run in the $200 to $250 range as far as all-in L&A [ph] cost.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of different questions here. First, can you remind me how much of your unit base is in corporate apartments? Trying to figure out -- I didn't think it would have been that meaningful to have caused that much of an issue or the amount of commentary we've already had on this call.","David S. Santee","Well, when we look back, we had roughly 700 corporate units. I don't know that it's a matter of the sheer volume. It's more about when they vacate. So when corporates take units in the summer, typically when our rents are at the peak. And then in addition, we are getting a premium on top of that, which is typically 20% to 30% on top of peak rents for that year. And then they move out in Q4 or the beginning of Q1 when rents are at the bottom of the cycle. You're re-renting those apartments for sometimes 20% to 30% less when your average renter rents them at a 12-month lease. So we just saw a lot of volatility. We saw some spikes in some markets, particularly Boston, New York City. And we constantly strive to kind of minimize our exposure to the corporate business because like we've just discussed, it creates unneeded volatility and it really doesn't align with our goal of creating loyal customers.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Given your strategy here of letting the occupancy slip a little bit and rebuilding at a higher price. To me that implicitly would suggest if the turnover maintains on a up year-over-year basis, ultimately you're going to need higher traffic levels relative to last year. Is that what you're betting on? Is that you're going to see more traffic flow into your units this year?","David S. Santee","This is David, when we look at all aspects of our traffic, everything for the quarter was up. So applications were up. Move ins were up 4-plus percent, phone calls were up 20%. Foot traffic was up. The only thing that was down were e-leads and I attribute that to, I think, our industry or at least the larger players in our industry. We continually play cat and mouse with Mr. Craig from Craigslist as far as playing by his rules. So we really suffered in Q1 as far as our ability to promote our properties through Craigslist as they change the rules. But as far as all the indicators, everything is up and I have no reason to think that, that won't continue through the leasing season.","Frederick C. Tuomi","This is Fred. One other point is, yes, we have that confidence at this point in the cycle also not only because of the traffic that as David mentioned, but based on the demographics, but don't forget about supply. There's still very little supply in the system this year, especially the first half of this year. So again that gives us confidence that this leasing season is going to be pretty favorable.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And David, last question for me on Archstone. Can you give us a sense of how much of senior management's time has been spent locked in rooms with bankers and lawyers? And how much of a -- I don't want to use the word distraction. I guess that's probably not the right word. But how much time has been committed over there?","David J. Neithercut","Less than you think. A lot of people have worked a lot on this over the last 9 months or so to get us in a position to have made the original bid that we made back in the fourth quarter. But since that time, I'll tell you it's just been myself and Mark Parrell and Bruce Strohm, our General Counsel. They're just the guys that are really running the railroad day-to-day basis, have not been distracted at all.","Ross L. Smotrich - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And do you see any real possibility at this point that you wind up with the whole thing or are you playing for a result realistically other than...","David J. Neithercut","I can't comment on any of that.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Swaroop Yalla with Morgan Stanley.","Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to touch upon the guidance specifically. You mentioned that -- I mean, I think your guidance for G&A is up by $2 million or so and also the ATM issuance was a little bit higher. So just wondering, the FFO number seems to be the same. Are there any one-time items that aren't discussed in the guidance?","Mark J. Parrell","No. It's Mark Parrell. I mean, on the G&A side, it\u2019s just an estimate change on some comp expense. When we put our guidance together. We do it earlier then done with our comp process. So that's the reason for the change on G&A. The delay in disposition activity has been the offset, so G&A is certainly up. And the addition of the shares to the fully diluted share count from the ATM issuance is also a reduction to our FFO number. On a compensating side is we have less a dilution from transaction activity because we're going to be selling assets later in the year than we thought. So before our assumption had been, we more or less were selling $300 million of assets each quarter. And now we'll sell, we think, about $300 million to $350 million in the totality of the first half of the year and that difference is the offset and that's why we're still really right at the midpoint.","Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And then David, there were all these news headlines about housing finally hitting the bottom. And you mentioned that home buying move out to home purchases were up slightly. If you can just give us a little bit more color on that, which markets are you specifically seeing that? And what are those numbers relative to?","Frederick C. Tuomi","Okay. Swaroop, this is Fred Tuomi again. I mentioned home purchasing did tick up a little bit but still well inside of historic norms and still not really an issue on most of our markets. For the whole portfolio, Q1 of last year, home purchasing as a reason for move out was with 11.6, a very low number. Q1 of this year, its 12.6, so it's up 1 point. So up directionally, but still very, very small. The markets with the least home buying and actually a reduction, continued reduction in home buying, Seattle was down almost 1 point, Denver is down, Orange County is down, San Francisco is down, Boston is down. Those that did show an uptick, Maryland, where it's housing is fairly pretty cheap and plentiful, it went up 470 basis points. Atlanta, as you'd expect, where housing continues to go down the tubes, was up 380 basis points. Phoenix, we did see an uptick of 310 basis points. San Diego, as I mentioned earlier, did tick up, 240 basis points. L.A., we saw some home buying. So showing some confidence there maybe that's a good thing, it's up 200 basis points. In South Florida, with the continued clearing of the condos there and some of single-family I think that market has definitely bottomed out, prices are recovering strongly there in South Florida as well Phoenix, so that's why you see some people jumping in to buy there in South Florida.","Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And just lastly, sorry if I missed this, but what are the renewals being sent out for June and July? May and June, I guess?","Frederick C. Tuomi","Renewals, as I said, for the quarter averaged 6 6, April we closed out at a 6 9. May, we're quoting basically 9% and expect to achieve 7 or low 7s. June, we're quoting in the above 8 range and expect to achieve in the mid-to high 6s. In July, we're quoting an 8 as well.","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","And our next question is from Conor Fennerty with Goldman Sachs.","Conor Fennerty - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Fred, can you provide a little more color on L.A. You mentioned obviously job growth got -- revised up a little last year or, excuse me, in 2012, but you also talked about price sensitivity. Can you kind of bridge that disconnect there?","Frederick C. Tuomi","Yes. Well, job growth was revised up. We're saying now that we're going to get 50,000 jobs this year. I mean, that's the economist's prediction. I hope that's true. But so far, Q1 actually the local economic reports showed a job loss in L.A. So it's really bad -- that's what I meant when the job growth is expected to be back ended. You're still seeing some losses from the local city county state government and some manufacturing and some defense areas there. But entertainment is up slightly. The port net-net, imports, exports is up about 1%. And some of the defenses now retooling and selling to foreign governments, et cetera, et cetera. So that's our -- the expectation is some good growth coming second half of the year. And if you remember back the last couple of years, L.A. has kind of been fits and starts. It'll start getting some traction and then pause, and get some traction and then pause. And now it's on the steady upward swing but I'd say, the accelerator continues to go up and down. So we push rents, we get some good results and then it kind of stalls. So we actually -- we had rents up about 7% there for several weeks and then demand kind of slowed, occupancy dipped, so we had to bring the rents back into the 5% range. So it's still -- I have confidence in L.A. I think it's going to be fine. It's just not -- doesn't have that consistent, strong, steady power curve of a recovery like we've seen earlier in the cycle in markets like Boston, San Francisco and New York.","Conor Fennerty - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And David, you mentioned the seasonality of acquisitions. But has Archstone impacted the pace of acquisition for the year either or is it just mainly the seasonality?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I guess I'm not so sure. It's sort of seasonal.","Conor Fennerty - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","For available product?","David J. Neithercut","I mean it's just like there's just not a lot of supply, not a lot of product and we sort of seen this for the past 3 or so years. And generally, the beginning of the year, we've not seen much and it sort of picked up more towards the end of year. But that's something that's happened over the last several years and I wouldn't say that's its seasonal would imply that it's been for an extended time period. I think if you would look back at our acquisition activity over an extended time period, it's been fairly ratable during the year. But it's just been over the last few years or so that, that has been a little early on and we begin to see more as the year goes on.","Conor Fennerty - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then just lastly, on land sales or land acquisitions -- excuse me. You guys have been obviously active on the land front last kind of 8 quarters. Any change there in terms of pricing? I mean, you guys still expect kind of weighted average yields to be in that kind of 6.5, 6 area going forward on land deals?","Mark J. Parrell","Yes. If you look at some of our pursuit log right now that the guys are working across the country, I tell you, yes, that it is high 5, low 6 to maybe a mid-6s is generally what we're looking at across the markets today.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I appreciate your earlier comments on the 4.4% average cap rate being kind of on the low end of your acquisition cap rate range. I was curious if these deals, do they have -- are they significantly below market or is there more redrive or value add opportunities outside of the Redwood, California acquisition?","Mark J. Parrell","Well, a little bit on the one deal in Redmond, Washington where there's some vacant retail we think we can turn into some residential units. But generally, we think -- it was only the deal on The Peninsula that we think we'll see here to a significant increase in that cap rate through the work we'll do on the rehab.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And were there rents below the market?","Mark J. Parrell","On The Peninsula, I'll tell you that we thought the rents to the Peninsula were very much below. So in addition to what we think we'll achieve because of the rehab, there was opportunity to bring those to market. But I'll tell you just in general, the other properties were probably more stabilized and I don't think represent the same opportunity.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Andrew McCulloch with Green Street Advisors.","Andrew McCulloch - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","You guys are always in the market I guess on both the acquisition and disposition fronts. Can you talk a little bit about how the spike in treasuries that we saw in March impacted the investment sales market? I know rates have since retreated, but did you see any disruption in the market in the form of either re-trades or deals falling apart?","Mark J. Parrell","Well I guess I presume that there were a lot of deals, Andy, and I don't know if there are a lot of deals. I can tell you that just on the construction side, we've heard from more merchant-like developers that there continues to be equity out there. But the merchant builders are sort of fighting for it. There's not enough equity to fund all of the opportunities that are there. How that changed may have affected -- the change in treasury may have affected what the preferences might be for that equity. I don't know. I think, it's probably -- construction financing probably plays as big a role in that and that continues to be fairly inexpensive. Difficult to get but relatively fairly inexpensive. So I don't think it was as disruptive to that business as your question might imply.","Andrew McCulloch - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","And I guess it was more geared towards how sensitive is the investment sales market or the acquisition market for lower quality assets that you might be selling to short-term move in treasury.","Mark J. Parrell","Again, I think it's more sensitive to -- okay, how treasuries may impact Fannie and Freddie financing?","Andrew McCulloch - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Right.","Mark J. Parrell","I'll tell you, on the assets that we've been selling, it is very sensitive to that, which is why, as you know, that we've been fairly aggressive on the disposition side, thinking that increases in interest rates will negatively impact the values of those assets we want to sell, as well as any change in the liquidity that Fannie and Freddie provide that space. Now, in addition to just treasuries going up though, it is all-in spreads do matter and the agencies will, if necessary, will trim their spreads in order to offset that if it's important to maintain their share.","Andrew McCulloch - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Thanks. And then just generally on asset value. Can you talk about what movement you've seen so far this year across your major markets?","Mark J. Parrell","Well, guess, as I told you in the kind of more prepared remarks, I think that cap rates have generally stayed fairly consistent. But we've seen bottom lines improve and so I think you've seen values increase modestly.","Andrew McCulloch - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Just one quick question, on your JV to main development, San Jose, looks like inflation stabilization dates got pushed out quite a bit. What's going on there?","Mark J. Parrell","Yes. Well, it was just time that it took to pull permits. I think San Jose is not unlike many municipalities where they're a little understaffed and it's just taken longer to get the permits pulled to get through that process than what we had hoped.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to go back to the base rents. I think you said 6.5%, which I'm assuming is a blended number. Can you give us what new lease rates were in the first quarter? And not necessarily year-over-year but on a lease over expiring lease basis?","Mark J. Parrell","You mean the replacement rents?","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes.","Mark J. Parrell","Yes. It was up 4.3% during the month of April. During the quarter, it was kind of ramping up from the 2 as we came into the year up to that number. So we're right now at 4.3%.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then traffic during the quarter, I don't think that there was any mention of that. Can you give us a sense on how that's trended as well in April as well?","Mark J. Parrell","April is up, e-leads are up, our daily traffic to ea.com (sic) [equityapartments.com] is up over last year. Things appear to be strong on all fronts.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, so it wasn't traffic, it was really just holding on price then is where the occupancy [indiscernible]...","Mark J. Parrell","Right. And as I've said earlier, when you look at our move outs and move ins, I mean, our move outs for Q1 were 10% more than Q1 of last year. Yet move ins were up over 4% over last year. That's driven by more foot traffic, more phone calls, more applications, et cetera. So it's really on the back end.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. David, a question on Archstone not pertaining to negotiations. But the $1.5 billion purchase price you are talking about now, when you announced the $1.325 billion purchase price, I think you said that was a 5 recap rate on in place. Where does the 1.5 pencil to on current cash flow in terms of cap rate?","David J. Neithercut","About a 5.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","About a 5, okay. And then finally, just a question on financing. Where are you seeing GSE rates today? And also, where could you guys do unsecured paper 7, 10 years?","Mark J. Parrell","It's Mark Parrell. On the -- you said 7 and 10, I'm more focused on the 10, but I have some color for you on the 5 as well. On the unsecured side, assume the treasuries at about a 2% rate. I think our spread would be about 2% and we issue around 4%. For 10-year unsecured paper. On the secured side, the GSEs are probably for guys like us and this would be an interest-only loan with favorable terms given our scale would be about 3.85%. So maybe 15 basis points or so better. That relationship reverses on 5-year debt, the GSEs don't particularly care for 5-year debt. And they would be more like 2.5% over the 5-year treasury which would be about 3.3% where I think the public market is happy to do 5-year debt and they would be more like 2.7% or about 180 basis points or so over the 5-year treasury. GSEs, as David Neithercut said earlier, continue to be very active and continue to be very good sponsors of debt in the sector.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just going back to the whole occupancy versus rate, is there's some sort of occupancy floor where if occupancies were continuing to fall, at some point you guys would say that's it, let's just cut rate, fill back up occupancy?","David S. Santee","Alex, this is David Santee. I mean, first, I think we needed to keep things in perspective. Our occupancy was right on top of where we were last year. So I mean, yes. Yes, there is a floor but we didn't come close to that floor. I think it's more about our expectations for improved occupancy versus being flat on occupancy over last year.","David J. Neithercut","Right. And I would say that would be really a property by property sort of decision, Alex. We run these things, not just property-by-property but unit type-by-unit type. So certainly the answer to your question is yes. But really would be on a property-by-property basis.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","And then on the Marina del Rey and Redmond deal, if those are sort of market deals sort of curious why you did them if you think the cap rate, was this 10\/31 driven or is there something beyond where getting those properties and those areas helps you further down the road with something else?","David J. Neithercut","I think you should -- it's a very good question and you should interpret that as just kind of trading, right? We're trading out of Jacksonville and trading some assets in Orlando, and trading some assets in Phoenix and were just trying to trade into other assets that we think will represent a better total return over an extended time period than what we realize if we were to stay in the assets that we're selling.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. Then that makes sense. And then finally, David, on the Archstone. It's just hypothetical, if there were a deal for just some assets, do you have a preference for markets versus quality or age of asset or you're agnostic if it came down to that decision?","David J. Neithercut","I'm not going to comment on any of that, Alex, I'm sorry.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Donnelly with Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess, Dave, how do you think about rent affordability from this point? I mean, as consumers ability to digest incremental rent increases regardless of whether or not they had a housing alternative and ownership. I guess I'm wondering if you might think we're running out of room in consumers' wallets at this point?","David J. Neithercut","Well, look, we track rents as a percentage of income, and the numbers are still -- demonstrate that there's significant amount of runway across all of our markets.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Do you feel though, maybe on more of a disposable income basis, or, something that actually takes into account all the other pressures on consumer's wallets, that you maybe have less run rate than you think? Or do you still feel pretty confident by those markets.","David J. Neithercut","Well, I guess, we just stayed in perspective relative to the past, the actual numbers kind of come down. As Fred and David mentioned that, we're losing residents that are unwilling or unable to pay our higher rents but having no problem attracting new residents who are willing to pay that rent. And those people that are willing to pay that rent have got incomes that support that rent significantly better than past residents.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. Just one last question. Just considering that we are a little further into the cycle and growth has been certainly good to date. How are you or are you changing your underwriting on future growth as it relates to acquisitions and how does that affect your going in cap rates, are you sort of tweaking down your growth expectations for multifamily or has it been really unchanged the last few months?","David J. Neithercut","We feel very good about the multifamily space in 2012 and beyond for all the reasons we've been talking about for the last several years. Just the supply and demand situation is very compelling. The single-family homeownership situation is very compelling. The markets in which we're in, given the cost of the single-family home ownership kind is very compelling. So we continue to feel very good about this space. As I mentioned in response to Alex's question, we're trading assets from one market going into other markets and we think that the trade makes a lot of sense for the long-term.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Philip Martin with Morningstar.","Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question, again, following up on the move outs. Can you give some clarity as to the profile of the move outs? Are they more heavily weighted toward a certain age group or income profile?","David J. Neithercut","Well I would say it's probably more weighted toward specific markets. So I think Fred mentioned earlier, in San Francisco, 30% of our move outs, really for the last 2 to 3 quarters, have been due to price or too expensive. So when you see 30% for 3 quarters, that pretty much covers all profiles and demographics. And I think we've seen that for the last 2 quarters in Boston as well, 20%. So it's more of -- it's probably more of a lifestyle preference. And we just see it across all demographics.","Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Is it fair to say, it sounds like the rent to income profile is being maintained if not improving a bit. So are you seeing -- is it fair to say that we're seeing more of a want-to renter as opposed to need-to renter?","David J. Neithercut","When I look at our credit statistics, we have a credit model and for the last 2 years, the number of people that are auto-approved, meaning we receive their Social Security Number, we run their credit and they're instantly approved, that number has been increasing. For Q1, it was the highest it's ever been. We look at the distribution of our FICO scores across all of our properties. The percentage of FICO scores above the 720 are the highest it's ever been. Again, this is partly due to the profile -- I'm sorry, the property repositioning but I think that's what we're after.","Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. Thank you for that. Now on the acquisition. I know there weren't too many here in the first quarter, was it $150 million, $159 million, I missed that number.","David J. Neithercut","Yes. $159 million. And all that's laid out in the press release.","Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Exactly. So the $159 million, you mentioned that on one of the acquisitions, you were looking to spend $10,000 per unit. Is that a fair assumption across the entire $159 million?","David J. Neithercut","No. $10,000 a door is what we budget to rehab 123 units that we acquired in Redwood City, California.","Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Exactly. Now, looking across this portfolio, what is the CapEx per door?","Mark J. Parrell","It's Mark Parrell. If you turn to the release and go to Page 21, there is some pretty detailed disclosure on CapEx, both for the same-store property set where we have given guidance of about $1,225 a unit for 2012. That is inclusive -- these are same stores. These are stabilized assets. On acquisitions, there's a different number and those are non-same-store property set. So you do have some visibility into those numbers as you go through the release.","Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, just the existing portfolio. When you look going forward, can you give us some sense of just the organic growth potential that you have in your existing portfolio from a redevelopment value add, just looking out a bit?","David J. Neithercut","Well, we continue to rehab. Probably spent $40 million to $50 million a year on rehab of properties out there. So that's 5,000 or so units a year, and we think there will continue to be some opportunity there. And again, we just think that the fundamentals of the business are such that we're going to have some pretty strong organic growth just through the ability to raise the top line just in our existing portfolio. So again we think that there's a lot of opportunity for the foreseeable future on the top line of our portfolio.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Omotayo Okusanya from Jefferies.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question in regards to the tenant survey that you do. Just trying to get a sense of apart from moving out because of higher rents, if there's any real change in regards to the key reasons tenants are moving out?","David J. Neithercut","Changes on the reasons people are giving us for moving out?","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes, any big change trend-wise?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I mean, the over-arching trends kind of a remain the same. Of course, they just from the historical patterns but the number one reason has always been job, job transfer, job change. Historically, the number two reason was always buying home and then, rent increase. Too expensive was number four or number five on the list. Now depending upon which market you look at today, in some markets, home buying is number two, a place maybe like a Phoenix. But yet rent increase too expensive to be number three. In markets where we see tremendous rent growth, places like Denver, places like Boston, San Francisco, certainly without a doubt, the number two reason for moving out is rent increase too expensive. And every quarter, we pull the aggregate verbatim results. You mentioned our surveys. We look at the verbatim remarks that all of our residents moving out make. And it's definitely -- the rent increases are definitely a key driver in their decision.","Frederick C. Tuomi","This is Fred. I'll add to that. That's a natural thing to expect and to observe at this point in the cycle. Because during the recession when rents were going down 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% in some cases, not everyone lost their job and those people with steady income enjoyed an increase in their housing value by being able to afford a nicer apartment, better location, better building at a lower rent. So they actually basically would have profile shift up and they were the beneficiary. Now that rents are pretty much back or above peak levels at some of these key markets, now we've had a couple of years of very strong rent increases, those people have traded up now are going to just to trade back down. They're not going to be able to either afford or want to afford those rent levels. But the good news, as we mentioned earlier, is there's plenty of people behind them who are willing to fill those apartments especially during the leasing season. So when we look at the marginal resident coming in, all of the credit and income statistics are very favorable and encouraging and those moving out, we have a special case in the corporates whose margins get squeezed. Then we have a case of those people who traded up who are now trading out. Then one other just anecdotal comment, we looked at our transfers. Early on in the recession when things are really going down, we analyze our transfers within our system and people were transferring out of expensive apartments and into cheaper apartments [indiscernible] and what's happening now is our transfers why we look at those. And more people actually transferring to larger more expensive apartments within our buildings versus the contrary. So it's another indicator that our resident base is healthy and...","David J. Neithercut","That's an important thing to point out as well. Fred mentioned that our turnover was up 100 basis points and 20 basis points of that stays within the family of Equity communities, either they are moving from one apartment to another or they're moving from a community in New York City to a community in L.A., and we track all of that.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Nic Yulico with Macquarie.","Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research","Just quickly on the acquisition guidance. If we're to assume that you do get Archstone? Would you then also have the desire of doing, say, $1 billion on top of that acquisition so you could actually be a significant net acquirer this year?","David J. Neithercut","The guidance that we've given in the press release has nothing to do with Archstone and if something were to happen to Archstone, I'm not quite sure what would happen to the normal transaction activity.","Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research","Okay. And just I guess assuming that at some point if you did become, say, net acquirer of say over $1 billion, I mean how should we think about how you guys might finance that? I mean do you sort of target -- what's sort of target leverage level that you want to keep the company at these days?","David J. Neithercut","Well, we've not suggested at all. Our guidance suggest that we -- we have no intention of being a net acquirer this year. And in fact we'll acquire -- we'll sell whatever we need to sell to match the acquisitions and we're comfortable with our leverage levels. They're well within the ranges that we've been operating for the last 19 years and sometimes we've been up within that range, sometimes down in that range, and we're very comfortable with where we are today.","Operator","And our next question is from -- a follow-up question from Eric Wolfe with Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Michael Bilerman. David, I just wanted to come back just in terms of the Archstone cap rate. And I don't want to split hairs. But you talked about a 5 3 and then you said it went down to a 5 at the $1.5 billion implied equity. I get something closer to 5 10, 10 basis points depending on how much you acquire, if you acquire, could be a lot. So I just didn't know if there was something I was missing in that math?","David J. Neithercut","No, Michael, I mean we're just talking generalities here.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I know but 10 basis points on $18 billion potentially could be a lot depending if you're at 5, 5 3 or 5 10.","David J. Neithercut","You're speculating a great deal. And should we be able to work something out, we'll be delighted to give you the specifics at that time.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just to make sure I remember correctly when you guys originally did the $1.33 million implied a $5 billion equity value -- sorry, a $5 billion equity value now at 1 5, you're at a 5 7 equity value. And I think I remember Lehman was at that point where they said they thought it was worth at least a $6 billion equity and then another $1 billion enterprise value for the platform. Was that sort of general how things had gone?","David J. Neithercut","I mean, is that what Lehman said, is that the question? I do believe Lehman said -- it's publicly stated something on along those lines, yes.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. So I will turn it back to management. You may continue.","David J. Neithercut","Great. Thank you all for your time today. We appreciate it. And we'll see you around.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your call for today. Thank you for your participation.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead.","Marty McKenna","Thanks, Chris. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential\u2019s first quarter 2017 results. Our featured speakers today are David Neithercut, our President and CEO; David Santee, our Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Parrell, our Chief Financial Officer.","Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.","And now I will turn it over to David Neithercut.","David Neithercut","Thank you, Marty. Good morning everybody and thank you for joining us for today's call. As you will hear in just a moment from David Santee and Mark Parrell, the first quarter came in pretty much in line with our expectations. Occupancy remained quite high, particularly on a seasonal basis, clearly demonstrating the continued strong demand for rental housing in our core markets. And we saw retention improve over the first quarter of last year while achieving renewal rates of 4.3%, clearly demonstrating the benefits of remarkable customer service and the dedication of our teams across the country.","As expected, new apartment supply continues to pressure new lease rates, causing our portfolio to produce negative lease over lease growth in the first quarter. Fortunately, the apartment demand is proving sufficiently strong to absorb this new supply while maintaining healthy occupancy levels in existing assets across our market. In fact, our own lease up activity in southern California, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington DC is going exceptionally well where we are leasing units with a pace well above our original expectations and net effective rents are generally at or above what we had originally projected. I will let David Santee go into more detail about how our markets performed in the first quarter and where we sit today going into the extremely important leasing season, and then Mark Parrell will give some color on operating expenses.","David?","David Santee","Okay. Thank you, David, and good morning everyone. I want to spend a few minutes reviewing our performance across our markets and our positioning as we head into the primary leasing season.","Our goal in 2017 is to focus on retaining our existing residents to drive the new lease growth and thus far our teams have delivered. Meeting with the local teams and making sure that we all understand the dynamics in every market is crucial for how we run our business and I spend a great deal of my time with the properties for that reason.","Over the past several months, my senior team and I have travelled to all of our markets for meetings that included everyone of our employees in each market to ensure that our highly collaborative team members understand our strategy and tactics. As part of these meetings, our sales folks and managers attended an in-depth renewal negotiation workshop focusing on sharing best practices in order to better feel prepared in the coming months.","Our reported Q1 results leave us well positioned as we enter the early stages of our peak leasing season. We are pleased with how the quarter played out, given the elevated deliveries across many of our markets. Our revenue growth of 2.6% was driven by pure rate growth as renewal rates achieved for the quarter were 4.3%. More importantly, the percentage of our residents who renewed with us increased from 57% in Q1 of '16 to 60% for this quarter. And this was on a pool of units up for renewal that is about 3% larger than last year. Already, we are seeing good results as our renewal rates achieved in both April and May are up 4.7%.","As David said in his remarks, this is a great indicator of the terrific work being done by our teams across the portfolio. Now while renewal rates achieved thus far are encouraging, the peak leasing season has many potential risks, either through elevated supply or uncertainty in part of the economy. We know that summers lag around the corner and following the expected normal seasonal pattern, inventories will be begin to build and occupancies will start to moderate. Our team will continue to work hard, lease by lease, to deliver for our shareholders.","Now moving on to the market, I will give you some color on what we are experiencing today and describe where we are on the delivery cycle for new units. Additionally, I will provide a renewal and lease over lease results for the quarter as well as provide color on our average net effective new lease pricing. And just to clarify, our lease over lease results are the net change when we compare old lease rents to new move-in rents for the same unit. These results are influenced by the old rent as well as the term of the previous lease and are not always indicative of current market conditions, especially early in the year.","Our net effective new lease prices better represent the year-over-year trend in a market and are the prices the customer uses in making their leasing decisions. So starting with Seattle. Renewals achieved for the quarter were up 7.1% and lease over lease results were up 4.1%. Both well within expectations for the quarter. Net effective new lease pricing was strong and has averaged approximately up 7% versus the same quarter last year. Both rate growth and occupancy for the quarter was good and demand remains healthy. And while a greater percentage of the new deliveries will occur in the back half of the year, we continue to expect Seattle to be our top performing market for the full year.","At Amazon alone, the open positions numbered within 9000 jobs, many of which are high paying and the recent news of the Boeing layoffs and overall downsizing in their engineering function, specifically in Seattle, should have minimal impact to our portfolio as we have minimal exposure north of town. San Francisco has been stable thus far despite the level of new deliveries that are heavily weighted in the first half of the year. Renewal rates achieved in the quarter were up 3.9%, lease over lease results were negative with 1.7%. Net effective new lease pricing growth was up 2% throughout the quarter and remain at that level.","Tech job growth remains muted in San Francisco but there is growth. [DC] [ph] investments appears to have bottomed in Q4 of 2016 and maybe improving. With new apartment deliveries more dispersed across the [indiscernible] than in 2016, we believe that San Francisco should be better positioned this year to absorb these deliveries in a rational manner. Southern California, which makes up about 26% of our total NOI and is expected to deliver nearly 60% of our total revenue growth in 2017, is on track.","Orange County in San Diego are leading the way with plus 5% revenue growth for the quarter. LA is feeling the effects of peak deliveries in Q1 while Orange County will see peak deliveries in the back half of the year. As expected, the far north and east LA submarkets are very strong as most of the new supply is concentrated in the urban core and closer in submarkets like Pasadena and Korea Town. Renewal rates achieved for LA were plus 5.7% for the quarter and lease over lease results were positive 60 basis points. Net effective new lease pricing growth averaged just under 12% versus same quarter last year.","Orange County and San Diego achieved 6.6% and 5.2% renewal rate growth respectively and lease over lease results were up 1.7% and 60 basis points respectively. Net effective new lease pricing remains at expected levels as we enter the [indiscernible] months of peak demand and average 5% for Orange County and San Diego combined.","April renewals results for the three markets are showing seasonal strength with LA achieving growth of 7.1% and Orange County and San Diego achieving growth of 6.7% and 6.3% respectively. So moving over to East Coast and Boston. Most of the Q1 revenue growth was driven by 110 basis point improvement in [indiscernible], as quarter over quarter turnover declined by 260 basis points with fever deliveries pressuring the market then we experienced in the second half of 2016.","Renewal rate increases achieved for the quarter were 3.7% and lease over lease results were negative 5.4% and in line with our original forecast. Net effective new lease pricing increased in average of 2.5% for the quarter. With peak deliveries reoccurring in the urban core in Cambridge in Q2 of this year, we expect Boston to perform to expectations for the balance of the year. However, Boston has always been greatly influenced by the high percentage of students, especially in the urban core. With the uncertainty around current immigration policy and the strength of the dollar, we are playing close attention to demand from international students as we began the student season churn.","In Boston, our renewal rate growth achieved thus far for April and May our 3.4% and 4.6%, with less than 16% of May renewal offers still open. Net effective new lease rents remain positive but are moderating as inventory is growing as students get there notices to vacate and new deliveries open their doors. New York has remained disciplined thus far considering that more than 10,000 new units are currently in lease-up in the market. Half of these units were delivered in 2016 and the other half delivered in Q1 of this year. Deliveries will continue to grow throughout the year peaking in Q3.","Upfront move-in concessions were basically the same in Q1 of 2017 versus 2016 and net effective new lease pricing, and that includes concessions, continued to hold, down only 1% versus same period last year but on an expected lower occupancy. It's no surprise that Brooklyn and the West side are under the most pricing pressure as the largest amount of due deliveries are occurring in these submarkets. On the flip side the East side and Jersey Waterfront are still delivering positive revenue growth approaching 2%. Renewal rates achieved in New York for the quarter were positive 2.3% and lease over lease results were negative 6.2%, both of which are modestly below our expectations.","Net effective new lease pricing has averaged negative 1% for the quarter. April renewal rates achieved came in at 1.7% while May results are currently 2.7%, with only 9% of offers still outstanding. Given that the growth in higher-paying jobs is weaker than one would hope and the market continues to see elevated deliveries, we are pleased by the pricing discipline that we have seen in the market thus far. Across the board concessions appeared to be limited to lease-ups as standard operating procedure, while stabilized community concessions are very targeted based on unit price exposure. For instance for the quarter, our move-in concessions averaged $575 per move-in are about 4.5 days of free rent per move-in.","Washington DC has performed to expectations despite modestly depressed demand due to the federal hiring freeze and uncertainty about the future of many government agencies. Renewal rates achieved were up 4.1%, lease over lease results were minus 4% which was slightly below our expectations but mitigated with an increase in occupancy. Net effective new lease pricing averaged up 2% for the quarter.","April renewals which are essentially close delivered 4.5% rate growth, and in May with only a few renewals open, we are achieving 5% growth. Given the political uncertainties and new deliveries that are extremely weighted in the first half of the year, we would expect the softness in the net effective new lease pricing to remain under pressure for most of the peak season but offset by improving renewal increases as the back half of the year would see a sharp fall off in new deliveries. So the theme for us in 2017 is renewals. It's about working hard to keep our current residents happy with their choice and more importantly, keeping them living in an EQR community. And so we have taken the time to strengthen the skills that our employees need to meet the challenges of elevated supply.","As a person who began his career as an assistant manager of a 1500 unit property in Washington DC, I never forget the challenges that our people face. In no other industry does your customer live with you 24x7, 365. I would like to thank all of our employees for what you do each and every day. I am inspired by your spirit, always motivated by your energy and humbled by your commitment to excellence at Equity Residential.","Mark Parrell","Thank you, David. It's Mark Parrell. I want to take a few minutes this morning to discuss same store expenses. Our same store expense growth of 3.9% in the first quarter was primarily driven by increases in real estate taxes, on-site payroll and repairs and maintenance. This was slightly higher than we expected due to the impact of the California storm cost that I'm going to go over in a moment.","So here is some quick color on some of the bigger expense line items. We saw a 4.2% increase in real estate taxes driven by assessment increases in Boston and Seattle. Also the burn off of 421(a) tax abatements in New York added 1.8 percentage points to this quarter's number. For the full-year we continue to expect real estate taxes which make up about 42% of our total operating expenses, increase between 4% and 5%.","Moving on to on-site payroll. These expenses increased to 4.6% in the first quarter. For the full-year we continue to expect an increase of between 4% and 5% as we face the higher property level wage climate with our employees in high demand in a very competitive market. And David Santee just mentioned our laser focus on renewals and as a result of that, we have also added staff in some markets to provide even better service to our residents and to support tenant retention.","Payroll expense this quarter was also impacted by the California storms as our property staffs worked longer hours addressing storm damage. Now I'm going to turn to repairs and maintenance where we saw a 6.7% increase in that line item in this quarter. As you saw on the news, mother nature made up for several years of severe drought in California with heavy and consistent rains which resulted in increased roof repairs, tree trimming and similar costs. These costs totaled approximately $570,000 in the first quarter which drove this number up to 6.7% from about 3.7%.","Now on to a less material expense line item, leasing and advertising expense, which in the quarter increased to 12%. The increase in the quarter was driven by increased resident referral fees, including broker fees and more spending on resident activities to keep our customers engaged. These expenditures were generally all budgeted and expected. Last year, we reported an increase in this line item due to promotional spending, including the use of resident gift cards primarily in New York. We have budgeted about $700,000 in gift card spending in 2017 but thus far card use has been minimal. We still expect leasing and advertising expense for the full-year 2017 to be flat compared to 2016.","I will now turn the call over to David Neithercut.","David Neithercut","Thanks, Mark. On our last call, we indicated that following the year in which we sold nearly $7 billion of assets that 2017 would look quite tame on the capital allocation front and that we would transact if and when we found an opportunity to redeploy disposition proceeds into a higher pool of return asset. That remains the case. Although the one asset we did sell in the first quarter was a sold over from last year. This was a 304 unit asset built in 1970 and located in Milford, Massachusetts. For the handful of you that don\u2019t know where north of Massachusetts is, that\u2019s about 40 miles west of Boston. This leaves us with one remaining asset left to sell, also an older property in Massachusetts, in Franklin, Massachusetts, also well west of Boston.","And those are just significant as a holdover from the large portfolio that we undertook to sell in 2016. Although we did not acquire anything in the first quarter, guidance for the full-year continue to assume $500 million of acquisition activity funded by a light amount of disposition activity at a negative spread of 75 basis points. We are underwriting a handful of possible acquisitions at the present time that we think would make great new investment opportunities for us but only at the right price. It remains to be seen where these deals will actually trade. We will continue to hang around the hook, ready to play if it makes sense to do so and track the potential opportunities as they occur throughout the balance of the year.","So with all that said, Chris, we will be happy to open up the call to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Nick Joseph of Citi.","Nick Joseph","In terms of same store revenue guidance, would you Mark, consider keep an eye on the most volatility that would either result in you ending up towards the high end of same store revenue guidance or towards the bottom end?","David Santee","This is David Santee. Given that Southern California is going to deliver almost 50% of our expected growth for 2017, we are obviously laser focused on the results coming out of those markets.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. And then you mentioned the lower turnover. What do you attribute that to? Is it something that you are doing from a strategy perspective or is it something that you think is happening across the markets overall?","David Santee","Well, I think if you just look at our industry, I think there is an overarching trend that residents are just more confident in the future. There was a Freddie Mac study that said people are staying longer. I think we have seen that over the past years. People just like where they live. They don\u2019t want to move from their lifestyle. Most of these communities are not two-storey walk-ups. They are much less transient. And I think we are seeing the benefits of that.","David Neithercut","I think residents, Nick, they get comfortable with the staff. We create essential family and neighborhood in the building. They grow accustomed to the amenities that are nearby and their inclination and desire is to stay. We do everything we can to do encourage them to do that and we are very pleased with the results that the team is delivering out there.","Operator","We will take our next question from Rich Hightower of Evercore.","Rich Hightower","So I am going to start with a question on expenses. Just to make sure that I have got this correct. I am having trouble squaring, I think, the couple of statements that real estate taxes and payroll, which are the two biggest expense categories. I think you said you are going to grow 4% to 5% for the balance of the year and I just want to square that against the 3% to 4% expense guidance which was unchanged after the first quarter results.","Mark Parrell","Yes. It's Mark. It's 4% to 5% for the whole year for those two line items. For payroll it's 4% to 5% for the annual expense number, and it's 4% to 5% for property taxes for the whole year.","Rich Hightower","Okay. Thanks, Mark. I guess that begs the same question though. I mean if the two largest expense categories are growing greater than the guidance range, where do you make up for it on the other side, I guess, is the question.","Mark Parrell","Well, for the utilities, which we see as pretty low number in the 1% to 2% range and it's 14% of our expenses, is one of the line items where we are going to see a benefit.","Rich Hightower","Okay. That helps. Second question from me. This goes back to what David Santee referred to in the prepared comments. There was a comment about sharing best practices. It sounded like on the revenue management side of things, in the face of new supply and maybe changing the game plan a little bit versus what happened in 2016. I am just wondering if you can provide a little more color as to what some of those specifics might be going forward.","David Santee","Well, I don\u2019t know that we are changing our game plan. This is more about, a lot of our leasing folks, these are entry level positions, it's probably the highest turnover position in our industry. And it's just included as we enter the peak leasing season each year. The fact that we had a sales meeting before peak leasing season is not necessarily new. We do this every year. What is new is the fact that myself, our senior leaders here, we went out, we spent time with these folks. We heard their concerns. We discussed our opportunities, especially with our service employees. They are a critical piece of the renewal puzzle and this was all about giving them the support they need to be as successful as they can over the next several months.","Operator","From UBS, we go next to Nick Yulico.","Nick Yulico","First, I guess, on New York. Obviously, a lot of concern with all the supply that\u2019s coming. Can you give us a sense for now much of your portfolio in New York you think is actually exposed to the high, luxury segment of the market where all the supply is being delivered.","David Santee","Well, I guess I would say probably most of it. The question that we have always -- that will be answered soon is will Long Island City become a new value destination and will that draw folks from Manhattan or Brooklyn in search of a lower rent. It's probably easier to talk about lower to least exposed, which is probably Jersey City, and the upper east side. But the bulk of our revenue comes from -- well, over 30% of our revenue is just on the West side. So that will, and that\u2019s where most of the deliveries that will directly compete with our portfolios are coming on line.","Nick Yulico","Okay. And then, David Neithercut, I had a question on you and the board's capital allocation views right now. So in March, I think, you are doing your annual NAV analysis to the board. I am wondering what the conclusion of that analysis was and specifically how you are weighing external growth versus buying back your stock.","David Neithercut","Well, we talk about this on a quarterly, at the board level, and we have for quite some time I think taken a more cautious approach with respect to capital allocation. As you know, we throttled back our development considerably and following the large disposition that we did last year and even last year we did not acquire a great deal. For the past several years our free cash flow has gone to fund our development pipeline which has been extremely profitable and successful pipeline. That has been communicated with our board in our most recent meeting but that spend will begin to reduce and beginning in '18, you know that commitment to that business will not be at the magnitude that it had been over the past few years and that capital could be used for many different uses, including stock buyback, if we thought that was appropriate to do at that time.","Nick Yulico","Okay. I guess just a follow-up. Are you also thinking about other options, maybe to free up some more capital. Whether it be selling some of the recent New York City developments or maybe even raising your leverage a bit, sacrificing your A minus credit rating. Because you are, maybe not getting that much of a benefit from it right now versus if you went down a notch. I mean how do you think about some of those approaches which would create even more capital to reinvest somewhere else.","David Neithercut","Well, I mean we did sell an awful lot of assets last year and did return a significant amount of capital to our shareholders. So it's not as though we have not been thinking about that kind of thing. In terms of selling assets, we believe that many of the assets that have been recent developments really will be the value creators for the company over an extended time period. Assets that may not be as important to the long-term strategy of the company as demonstrated by that which we sold last year and the meaningful gains they will produce, because of the requirement of distributing those gains that produce a lot of excess cash flow. We have, as you note, our balance sheet is probably in the best shape that it's ever been. Mark and his team has spend a lot of team with the agency getting to know about what we have been doing there and that number has come down. And we have communicated to that side of the investment community that we are not unwilling to use that capacity if and when it makes sense to do so. We fit in the ranges in the bottom [indiscernible] in which we have operated since we went public back in 1993. So I guess I would tell you that we have had these discussions and we will not be afraid to use that capacity if and when it makes sense to do so.","Operator","Our next question comes from Conor Wagner of Green Street Advisors.","Conor Wagner","David Santee, can you tell us where San Francisco renewals are for April and May?","David Santee","Yes, I can. I think said those in the prepared remarks. San Francisco for April 4.8%, and May still has about 42% to be worked so it's 4.2%, so that number should close May much higher.","Conor Wagner","Okay. And then what's your positioning on renewal offers for June. Are you guys looking to raise them or hold them to where, probably not just in San Francisco, to where you have been sending them out for May.","David Santee","Well, so a lot of the West Coast markets are on our 30-day notice requirement markets. So we haven't issued many of those renewals yet. But I can tell you, on the East Coast where we have to issue those about 75 days in advance, those are, let's [indiscernible] on par with May.","Conor Wagner","Okay. And then I don\u2019t if you mentioned, David Santee, in your prepared remarks, the portfolio-wide lease over lease growth for 1Q? On the new renewal growth.","David Santee","The lease over lease, that is minus 2%.","Conor Wagner","Minus 2%. Okay. Thank you. And then David Neithercut, in the transaction market we have observed a slowdown in total transactions in recent months. I don\u2019t know if you have seen the same thing, I assume so, and then what you would attribute this to or any difference you have seen either as a seller or as a buyer on your counterparties behavior?","David Neithercut","Well, I think you have seen and everyone has sort of seen, it's just a widening of the bid ask spread, which is not, shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise, when there is some question about where interest rates are going, where you are seeing some of the softness on the new leasing and this new supply. So you continue to have owners and sellers who think the properties are worth a certain price and you have got buyers sort of saying I am not so sure. So there has been a slowdown of transaction activity for quite some time and certainly we have seen very little in the first quarter away from value added product for which the remaining is a fairly good bid.","Operator","And we will go next to Juan Sanabria of Bank of America.","Juan Sanabria","Just a quick question on the job growth on the West Coast, in particular Southern California, given its importance to your growth. What are you guys seeing on the grounds in terms of job growth creation, both there, maybe if you can comment on kind of what you are seeing in Northern California as well? Do you see signs of improvement or more softening that you had expected when you set guidance earlier in the year.","David Santee","I guess I wouldn\u2019t categorize it either way. I mean it's kind of where we thought it would be. I think the better news for LA specifically is that the number of high paying jobs that are being created are in the places where we are developing new apartments, specifically the urban core. But LA has always been very broad-based, many product types, many different municipalities. So I think it's too soon to say anything either way as we are on track and we will meet the expectations.","Juan Sanabria","Okay. And then do you guys have a view on how the investment community should be thinking about the permitting numbers, like the latest month data in March, trailing 12-months was up over 20%. Do you see that as a risk to the expectation that supply would come down at some point in '18 and '19?","David Neithercut","Our expectations are notwithstanding recent permits. Based upon the intelligence that we gather from our teams with boots on the ground in the markets in which we operate suggest that generally '17 will be a peak and that we will see new supply reduce from there. We are certainly aware of the permitting activity. We know historically, 85% or so percent of those trends are [starts] [ph] etcetera. But our belief is with land pricings where they are, with construction financing becoming more difficult to get, with the new supply that\u2019s coming into the marketplaces today, we just continue to believe that we should see new supply come down from this peak level that we are going to experience in 2017.","By definition, if 85% or so conversion of permits in the starts, that means there is some things that must be left. You know I don\u2019t know what the range is, what the dispersion is around that number but I certainly would believe that there would have to be years in which it would be below 85% and certainly would expect that number to [indiscernible]. Our guidance is around, we are looking at everything. Any of the [indiscernible], any of the players. Mark Parrell, I would ask him to just jump in. Well, he has been on the finance side, what he is sort of seeing and hearing about the debt side. But between land prices, construction costs continue to go up, the challenges that the markets are seeing would result in reducing supply and sort of compressing rent growth. Just making it become even more challenging to sort of pencil and we don\u2019t see any reason why we shouldn\u2019t come down from the 2017 peak.","Mark Parrell","And just on the development financing side, I mean we are constantly following banks, talking to loan brokers, talking to developers that are out there in the private market. And it certainly was an inflection point back in December of '15 when the bank regulator issued its letter. There is a pretty significant view from the banks at that point that they weren't going to increase their partner lending. So what we think is going in the apartment lending generally is that spreads are higher, 300 or so over LIBOR is pretty common. That advanced rates moderated in to the 60%-65% advance rate. So you need to come up with a good amount of equity. And thus all the things that David Neithercut mentioned about higher land cost, higher construction cost coming to play and just make the deal harder to pencil for what is now a pretty big size equity check that needs to be written. Now with the bank financing market is allowing though is as these deals roll off, so in other words become stabilized and are often refinanced with Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, that does create capacity at these banks to re-up and to do loans. So we don\u2019t see precipitous declines, to be honest, in bank volume as a whole. We don\u2019t see it going up either as it relates to apartment lending and over time we think that will cause the moderation that David referred to.","Juan Sanabria","Okay. Great. And then one last one from me. How should we expect occupancy to trend for the balance of the year?","David Santee","This is David Santee. I think we expect, I think I have mentioned that in my prepared remarks, we would expect occupancy to kind of begin to moderate a little bit through the summer months, just due to the level of activity. And then steady off in Q4 that will follow a normal seasonal pattern. There is still good demand. We don\u2019t see any really material changes expected.","Operator","And from Morgan Stanley, we will go next to Rich Hill.","Rich Hill","I wanted to get a little bit more questions on maybe New York City. So on new leases, I think you commented new leases were down negative 6%. Curious if you just maybe give us some look as to what you think the glide path might look like, sort of given what seems to be some new supply. So said in other words, when do you really start to see that to stabilize.","David Santee","Well, I guess I would say that peak deliveries in New York are most likely to occur next year. So 15,000 units this year of which only five have been delivered. And then another 17,000 units next year. So that\u2019s kind of, we have kind of the deliveries mapped out on a graph and for this year those deliveries peak in Q3. But, again, some of the deliveries in Q4 will obviously carryover into '18 as well. So I think David said in his prepared remarks, looking at new lease prices, they will probably continue to be under pressure, but on the other hand these lease over lease numbers that I quote, I mean more often than not they are always negative. It's just one of those nuances in our business. And what's not factored in that number are the fees. Most of these people that move in November, December or January, February. These are people that are forced to move. These people are the people that typically have to early term their lease. We are charging significant fees for the privilege of doing that. And those do not show up in these lease over lease numbers.","David Neithercut","And to just expand on that a little bit. So we know that lease rates moderate through the year, so I mean if someone leases his unit from us in July, August, and as David said, needs to vacate in the first quarter, we will lease that at a lower number and we expect that rate rather to be a lower number. Which is why as he says, often times first quarter lease over lease is going to be negative. Now because of this new supply, it's probably more negative today than it would otherwise be. But I don\u2019t want people to -- we want people to understand that it's even in an upward market it's not uncommon for there to be negative lease over lease in the first quarter.","Rich Hill","Got it. So maybe a little bit of improvement as we go towards, as we progress through the year?","David Neithercut","Because the market rates will increase as we get in the primary leasing season, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies.","Tayo Okusanya","Congrats on the quarter. I know it's a very tough backdrop but the execution looks pretty good. Quick two questions from my end. The first one is, 1Q is a seasonally slower quarter. You still put up, same store NOI growth above your guidance or 0% to 2%. From your comments today it sounds like things are incrementally getting better. So I am just curious why maintain the guidance of zero to 2% for same store NOI growth in 2017? Kind of what are you expecting in the back half of the year that could be negatively impacting that number.","David Neithercut","Let me just start by, sort of you have answered your question I think when asking it. And that is, transaction activities accrued up to now were just now getting into the primary leasing season and when the rubber meets the road. So we are trying to give you a sense of what we have seen in the first quarter but as David said, David Santee said in his prepared remarks, we recognize that the heavy lifting is yet ahead of us.","Operator","John Kim from BMO Capital Markets is our next question.","John Kim","Recognizing that this is the peak year of supplies in your market except New York, can you provide some color on where you think supply will be in 2018 versus 2016.","David Neithercut","Sure. Basically these are numbers which as of today most likely will be built because if you are vertical, you are already moving there. So we are looking at across all of our markets, about 54,100 units.","John Kim","So is that higher or lower than last year?","David Santee","For '18 that will be lower than this year '17.","David Neithercut","The question was, how does that compare to '16?","David Santee","'16, I don\u2019t have --.","John Kim","Okay. ","David Neithercut","John, [indiscernible] I mean it\u2019s [200,000] [ph] plus in '17. One thing to just think about this supply, when it gets delivered is at a point in time it takes a lot of leasing up. So even '16 deliveries are complication for us today and '17 deliveries will be complication in '18. I know there would be fewer deliveries in '18 than in '17. So we are watching very closely, as I said earlier, we have got our guys, our investment officers, development folks, our management people on the ground. They are on track on all the stuff. And when David gives you that number, so I make it clear, that this is the number of supply that we are looking at within sort of the markets that we draw, that we believe to be competitive with our product. That was not intended to be a number for the entire marketplace but only that which we believe there is product that would be competitive with our portfolio set.","John Kim","Okay. Great. Thanks. I have a question now on your utilization of two-year lease terms. Are there certain markets we are using this more. And how much growth do you typically bake in to that second year of lease term, if any.","David Santee","So I would say really the only place where we are using two-year leases are primarily in New York. We are obligated to offer two-year leases and I think our belief was that we have done thus far year-to-date, it's about 15% of total move-ins. Again, we very low volume in the quarters, so 15% of a very low number is again a very low number. So it's not a material part of our leasing strategy.","John Kim","And is that second year typically flat or is there growth in that second year?","David Santee","I would tell you that in experimenting obviously we have had more takers when there is no increase built-in, but depending upon what we expect as far as deliveries in 2018, we may offer two-year leases with no increase built-in.","Operator","We will go next to Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Two questions for us. First, on the last call you guys mentioned the CapEx and the need to obviously be more competitive with the new supply. Have you guys sort of qualified how much you think your CapEx spending could change and I am not just talking sort of light apartment upgrades but sort of to make those properties as competitive as they can be with new supply. Have you guys sort of quantified what you think it's going to be over the next few years versus your historic run rate, especially as you commented, focus on turnover and keeping tenants in place versus having them jump for better deals elsewhere.","David Santee","So Alex, we had talked in the last call about a number as a percentage of revenue for the same store set of around 7% for all CapEx spending where rehabs replacements were all shooting match. This year we are into low 8% range. Again, talking to the team it seems like 7%, 7.5%, somewhere in that range is the right number for us. So that equates to about $2,300 per unit versus the $2,600 we are spending this year. So, again, from our point of view, we don\u2019t feel like our assets have a great deal of deferred maintenance such that we require some sort of catch up. But we are trying to make our assets just a little bit more [indiscernible] accelerating some things we would have done in out years to this year to make the leasing season all the bit better for us right now. So I guess I don\u2019t feel like the run rate has changed past this year.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then maybe for David Santee, can you just give us your thoughts now that the 421(a) discussion is sort of coming out. It would seem from a quick read that its, from Manhattan and the trendy parts of Brooklyn, the new 421(a) is probably not helpful and may actually be positive for existing landlords as far as restricting supply just given the terms. But I am sure you guys are much closer to it. So can you just give your thoughts as far as it pertains to your Manhattan and Brooklyn portfolio, how you think the new 421(a) -- if you think it will encourage development or because of the terms it won't actually add to development necessarily.","David Neithercut","It's David Neithercut. We have concurred with your conclusion. Our team in New York has underwritten some transactions and applied the new affordable New York to those and their takeaway that while there are some nuances between the two, there is not really a dramatic change from the private programs. We think that the, to your point, that the big condo land in New York City and all and the rising construction cost would continue to make Manhattan and the Brooklyn markets that you mention, very restrictive for new apartments going forward and that this affordable New York program will likely promote and encourage some rentals but that is more in the outer boroughs. But we do not see it as something that\u2019s going to have a meaningful impact on bringing new development into the Manhattan and of course in Brooklyn markets.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tom Lesnick of Capital One.","Tom Lesnick","I guess, first following on those comments about why New York, particularly increasing next year. Can you comment on the makeup of that supply, and by that I mean should we see a shift from Manhattan to the boroughs in New Jersey? And in turn does that mean less direct supply for you, the bulk of your products in Manhattan proper.","David Santee","This is David Santee. I have kind of misplaced my New York delivery. But regardless, there is no hold on of supply in Jersey City or East Manhattan. I mean a lot of the supply this year and next will be centered in kind of Northeast Brooklyn, Long Island City, continuing the upper Westside, the Westside, and then a smattering of midtown down to lower Manhattan. I mean that\u2019s where all of the development is located both this year and next.","Tom Lesnick","Okay. So you are not seeing a concentration shift of any kind?","David Santee","No. I mean, concentration -- have to define them. When Long Island City is only train stop away, we will have to wait and see if that\u2019s a drawl out of Manhattan. So there is some jockeying around. There is obviously less neighborhood loyalty, so to speak, and probably what we were accustomed to five to ten years ago. We hear stories of people moving from lower Manhattan over to Jersey City. We see people moving from Jersey City to upper Westside. And really it just comes down to what lifestyle are you trying to achieve.","Tom Lesnick","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then, I guess secondly, thanks for mentioning the occupancy cadence expectations for the remainder of the year. I was just wondering if you guys could comment on the cadence of same store growth quarter by quarter for the year as well and perhaps the revenue and expense components as well.","Mark Parrell","Hey, Tom. We don\u2019t quarter by quarter same store revenue numbers. Generally speaking, the number will be lower through the quarters and will sort of flatten out towards the end of this year on the revenue side. On the expense side a lot of the quarter-over-quarter numbers are functions of our comps periods. Our comp period at the beginning of this year, you know relative to the first half of 2016 are very easy -- are very hard, towards the end of the year they are much easier. We had relatively high expenses, same store in the back half of 2016. So, again, what I would tell you is when we sum this all up, we still feel good about our ranges and that\u2019s why didn\u2019t need them. But each quarter is going to have a lot of volatility based on its comparable period.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ivy Zelman of Zelman & Associates.","Ivy Zelman","First question, I was just hoping you could maybe clarify your comment on supply. I think earlier when you talked about the peak in supply in '17 and your analysis, you were speaking of it, it sounded like more from a start to endpoint from a capital availability and construction cost and so forth. So just wanted to clarify, when you think about supply and talk about '17 unit peak. Is that starts completions or lease-up pressure?","David Neithercut","That\u2019s deliveries. We would have like a year in which a product is delivered, and I am glad you asked the question in that manner to us because we do track this. There is not, obviously, not simply in the year or quarter in which a property is delivered. And delivered means essentially complete. But our team is out in the field tracking very closely when those units will first be available for occupancy. And it really did become competition days prior to that. So there is a difference between when something is \"complete\", and when it actually is competition and we track the latter on quarter.","Ivy Zelman","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And so as we triangulate against the national numbers which are showing both permits and starts being strong double-digits. So far this year I think even over the last six months, inputs the way, I guess, that\u2019s happening outside of your market concentration as you look at it?","David Neithercut","Yes. I mean we are certainly aware of what those national numbers are and we are tracking those assets in our markets that we believe are competitive with us. And then just to add a little on the loan color side. Some of the feedback we have gotten from the banks and the brokers and the like, as it relates to our urban markets is that the banks are more interested in making loans in areas in the suburbs, where there is a little bit less construction over the last year or two. Just again seeing the numbers decline a little in the urban core is discouraging. Also they would suggest the hardest loan to do right now is a syndicated urban loan. So a very large $100 million-$150 million loan. From our perspective that\u2019s particularly good news because that\u2019s the kind of competition that David Santee and his team are facing most of these larger urban assets that do require pretty significant syndicated construction loans.","David Santee","And just to double back on the deliveries in New York. Basically the easiest way to describe this is, where the concentrations are today, they are even more concentrated next year. So this year Brooklyn is 3700 units, next year Brooklyn is 4500 units. Queens this year, the Long Island City is 3000 units, next year that is 5700 units. So next year just between Brooklyn and Queens, that makes up 10,000 of the year of 17,000 units.","Ivy Zelman","Okay. And then David Santee on the new lease and renewal rates. Thanks for the color by the markets as you progressed here into April and May. Do you have a portfolio-wide number on 2Q today for both new renewals.","David Santee","Not Q2 to date. Just for the quarter.","Ivy Zelman","Just for first quarter. Okay. We can follow up there. And then also just to clarify the comments you made on Boston. With new leases under pressure, I think you said 5% in the first quarter. And I thought you said that was going to moderate through the year but then I also thought you said that the supply was front half heavy. So maybe you could just clarify how you are seeing supply play out through the year and the trend in Boston.","David Santee","Yes. So the supply is kind of coming on us right now and it's definitely concentrated back into the urban core and Cambridge. Kind of that\u2019s the same time that the students which make up a vast -- well, not a vast but a large majority of our residents in those two sub-markets, begin to give notice for the end of the school year. So there is just, the next several months will be a period of very high leasing activity where we try to prelease for fall of 2017.","Operator","And from RBC Capital Markets, we will go next to Wes Golladay.","Wes Golladay","Actually I was going to ask some questions on the international students, but I guess I will go to my next one. Looking at New York, when do you see that market reaching equilibrium when you factor in all the lease-up and maybe some, just maybe take a little bit longer to lease some of these projects.","David Neithercut","Well, that\u2019s not just simply the discussion of supply that David shared with you, it's a function of the demand as well. So as I mentioned, product being delivered in '18 would continue to be the leasing up in '19. So it would take probably into '19 before things can stabilize unless we see a nice pickup in the higher paying jobs sector in New York which we all -- that we haven't seen in a while.","Wes Golladay","Yes. Fair enough. I hope for that as well. And then looking at the increased retention ratio, is that something that\u2019s coming as a surprise and do you expect that to continue?","David Neithercut","Well, if it is one quarter, while it was a more turns in the first quarter '17 than it was in the '16, it's still not a lot relative to the churn that we all experience throughout the whole year. As David mentioned, the overall spending we have spent and not just recently but over the last year, spent a lot of time training out people. Making sure they appreciate who important renewals are and the service expectations that we expect for them to deliver, to do that. And so we have every expectation, every hope that retention will remain strong because we have got our focus on it as David in his prepared remarks.","Operator","And we will go next to Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.","Rich Anderson","So just if I could wrap up just a couple of things that were said but not explicitly committed to. New York, you said supplies moving out of the suburbs and into the -- out of the urban core into the suburbs in the sunbelt. Would you second that? Kind of directly can you answer that question?","David Neithercut","In the sunbelt. No, I...","Rich Anderson","From the urban core into the suburbs and the sunbelt.","David Neithercut","I don\u2019t really have -- I know nothing about what's happening in the sunbelt. Although Mark Parrell just mentioned that the lending community had suggested that they prefer the smaller size loans out in the suburbs as opposed to the larger deals that require syndication downtown. But I have got to no -- can't comment on what's happening in the sunbelt.","Rich Anderson","Fair enough. And then one question was answered, things are turning out the way you thought they would be turning out. And I am wondering if that\u2019s actually a good result. By that I mean, if you compare how you feel today versus how you felt in the fourth quarter when you were doing this call, would you say you feel incrementally better that things have actually stabilized and met your expectations and hence maybe you feel better about the future as well when you think about supply kind of starting to decelerate next year. Could you make that type of statement today or no?","David Neithercut","I guess it's hard as we see here around the eve of the primary leasing season recognizing that we have the least amounts of actual transaction activity in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter. But we have talked about some markets like San Francisco maybe having found the bottom, having reset to a level, that David in his remarks mentioned, that in San Francisco we hope that the position, they have got more rational pricing as new products comes online. But we just do want to emphasize that work is yet to be done ahead. Because most of the leasing we will do, will be done in the next 90 days and we will have a better perspective of how it's going and we view the shape up when we visit with you at the end of July.","Rich Anderson","Okay. And then just on New York, you mentioned, I think Santee, you called a disciplined. So do you feel like just specifically about that market despite all the commentary about supply, do you feel a little bit better going into the heavy leasing season in New York because of that discipline that you are sensing in this past quarter.","David Santee","Yes. I certainly feel better but that doesn\u2019t mean things can't change very quickly. You know we look at our fully committed concessions, May looks very good and we will see how that plays out. But again, we still have to deliver, we are in the midst of delivering another 10,000 units on top of 10,000 units that are currently making in lease up.","Operator","And we will take a follow up question from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies.","Tayo Okusanya","I just wanted to understand the delta between the offers you send out for renewals and the actual rates you end up looking. What's happening to that delta? Does it continue to kind of expand? Is it starting to close up? I am just kind of trying to get a sense how tenants are reacting to the renewals offers that they have given?","Mark Parrell","So we use March as an example since that\u2019s closed out. Typically that spread has been 180 basis points. We closed March at basically 190 basis points. So I would say for the most part all the market spreads are holding as we expected with a little wider spread in New York City.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. McKenna, at this time I would like to turn the conference back to you for additional or closing remarks.","Marty McKenna","Well, I thank you all for joining us and look forward to seeing many of you in New York City in June.","Operator","And this does conclude today's presentation. Thank you all for your participation and you may now disconnect."],"8669":["Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) Q3 2014 Earnings Call October 29, 2014 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Marty McKenna - Spokeman","David J.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead.","Marty McKenna","Thank you, Pam. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's third quarter results. Our featured speakers today are: David Neithercut, our President and CEO; and David Santee, our Chief Operating Officer. Mark Parrell, our Chief Financial Officer, is also with us for the Q&A.","Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.","And now I'll turn it over to David Neithercut.","David J. Neithercut","Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our call. As we've said for quite some time, that we're very confident. The impact on multifamily fundamentals by the millennial generation and their desire to live in high density, urban environments with the flexibility and optionality provided by rental housing would produce an extended runway of growth for our portfolio. That is certainly what we are seeing today and expect to see for the foreseeable future.","Thanks to a great leasing season and the hard work of our teams across the country, we expect to deliver same-store revenue growth for the full year of 4.1%, which is above our original expectations and at the high end of our most recent guidance. This comes from continued exceptional growth from usual suspects, markets that are enjoying strong job growth and are highly attractive to young millennials, such as San Francisco, Seattle and Denver, along with very solid performance from other markets, including Southern California.","This strong revenue growth will help produce full year 2014 normalized funds from operations of $3.12 to $3.14 per share. The results are above both our original and most recent guidance and represent a year-over-year increase in normalized FFO of nearly 10%, an increase that is among the largest we've experienced in the last 15 years.","And it's because of the incredible portfolio we've assembled over the last few years, concentrated in high density, urban markets with close proximity to public transportation, dining, culture, education, nightlife and the like.","The demand for high-quality rental housing in these markets remain very strong. Occupancies were at all-time highs for this time of the year. Renewal increases are at the highest they've been all year and our current left to lease remains below normal levels.","In short, fundamentals remain very good. With continued strong demand for quality rental housing like that provided by every residential, and we're delighted with where we are currently positioned with our performance this year, and we all eagerly await the year ahead.","So with that said, I'll now let David Santee, our Chief Operating Officer, discuss in more detail what we're seeing across our markets today and how that is shaping our thoughts about 2015.","David S. Santee","Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. We are extremely pleased to produce another very strong quarter, and I would like to take a moment to recognize everyone on the EQR team for all of their extra efforts during our peak leasing season and continued excellence in the execution of our operational strategies.","Our reported third quarter revenue growth of 4.1% and commitment to delivering results at the top end of our revised revenue guidance represents continued strength in fundamentals and acceleration in many of our key drivers of revenue growth.","First, this change in physical turnover. Although we reported a slight increase, it is directly attributable to an increase in the number of intra-property transfers, meaning, residents moving between apartments in the same community. Netting out transfers for the quarter, resident turnover was flat and down 150 basis points year-to-date.","We also believe it's important to understand the motivations and economic impact behind these transfers, which represent over 10% of move outs in any given year.","Through September, 64% of all these intra-property transfers moved to a larger and\/or more expensive apartment, paying an average increase in rent of $349. All transfers, both up and down, produced an average favorable rent change of $66 per month.","The continued decline in turnover helped by a 90-basis point quarter-over-quarter reduction in move outs to buy homes gave us confidence to maintain our aggressive pricing strategy despite record deliveries and lease-ups across many of our markets. Net effective base rents have increased 6.7% year-to-date and for the third quarter average 4.5% greater than Q3 of '13.","Renewal rates achieve accelerated for the fourth time in 4 quarters moving from 5.2% in Q4 of '13 to a very strong 6% in Q3. We would expect to see similar results through the year end though transactions will be few.","Increased demand as a result of an improving job market allowed us to maintain our aggressive stance with pricing, but also realize substantial occupancy gains during the peak leasing season, increasing from 95.7% in '13 to 96.1% this quarter. Year-to-date, occupancy stands at 95.7%, a 30-basis point improvement. And as we sit here today, occupancy is 96.2% versus 95.4% same week last year, with 120-basis point improvement in left to lease down to 5.9%.","Looking out over the fourth quarter, we, of course, anticipate the typical seasonal slowdown. However, our net effective base rents remain elevated over same week last year, creating year-over-year net effective rent growth in excess of 5%, the highest year-to-date.","Should this trend continue and we don't experience the full effects of the normal seasonal decline in both rents and occupancy, it is possible that we can slightly exceed our revised full year revenue growth of 4.1%.","Now going around the horn with some brief market highlights, Seattle continues to outperform with 100 basis points better occupancy. Renewals achieved for September and October are above 9%, and net effective base rents are up 5.7% versus same week last year.","Our delivery estimates for 2014 and '15 are 7,800 and 7,300 units, respectively. Growing relocations of various company and regional headquarters, Oracle as an example, offer encouraging signs of continued diversified demand in the urban core.","Amazon alone has over 4,800 open positions in its downtown locations. San Francisco, the only question here is how high can it go. With few deliveries relative to demand, San Francisco's positioned yet again to lead the way. Renewals achieved for September and October were once again above 10%. Occupancy today is 97.1%, which is 130 basis points better than same time last year, and left to lease is 170 basis points better at 4.7%.","Net effective base rents are 12.5% above same week last year, and there are no indications that this will slow down in the next couple of quarters. Now like the other West Coast markets, L.A., Orange County and San Diego are all experiencing 80 to 90 basis points improvement in occupancy and lower left to lease. All 3 are experiencing broad-based job growth and improving fundamentals. L.A. will see elevated deliveries in 2015 at 8,800 units. However, the downtown area is quickly establishing itself as the place to be, pressuring the West L.A., Santa Monica and Marina submarkets, which are also in a repositioned play as the Silicon Beach. Playing host to new tech startups and satellite location for the Googles of the world, providing more affordable living options relative to its Northern California headquarters.","Orange County remained solid with 2,900 new deliveries slated for 2015. While job growth is broad-based, the majority of deliveries will be concentrated in Irvine, where job growth is 5x the growth of Orange County as a whole.","Jumping East, going to Boston, it will continue to be pressured in the financial district in Cambridge, as new lease ups come online. Concessions in the 2- to 3-month range are commonplace, but the net effective costs of the 12-month lease remains higher than stabilized well established product.","Occupancies remained healthy with 7,000 units absorbed year-to-date, with 5,100 deliveries slated for 2015. Seasonal demand is very pronounced in Boston, and we would expect moderation in occupancy and rental rate growth through Q1 of next year.","Now in New York, we are continuing to deliver solid and steady growth in Manhattan. And for definitional purposes, Manhattan also includes Brooklyn and Williamsburg, and we delivered a 4.2% for the quarter.","With elevated deliveries in both Brooklyn and the Jersey Waterfront, we would expect some moderation in Brooklyn, but significant pricing pressures in Jersey.","With continued strong population growth, well diversified job creation in Silicon Valley, Manhattan should be a solid steady performer for years to come.","Now it's no secret that South Florida is at it again with almost 11,000 deliveries for '14 and another 12,000 in 2015. With over 50% of the deliveries in the Miami Brickell submarket and the balance East of 95 from Fort Lauderdale North, the EQR portfolios should be well insulated both geographically and by price point.","Saving the best for last, Washington, D.C., thus far, continues to hold up pretty well. Renewals achieved remained above 3% for the quarter and through September. Over 14,000 units have been absorbed year-to-date and our portfolio continues to perform slightly better than our original 2014 expectations.","With another 12,600 units coming online in '15, we remain cautiously optimistic that next year's results will be similar to slightly worse than 2014.","More than half of '15 deliveries are located outside the Beltway, concentrated in the I-270 corridor and South on U.S. 1 between Pentagon City and South Alexandria.","The RBC corridor, Arlington and D.C. proper all have significantly fewer deliveries going forward and to date have been some of our better performing submarkets.","Expenses for the quarter increased 60 basis points year-over-year and are up 1.7% year-to-date. Third quarter expenses were favorably impacted by the adjustment for full year real estate taxes as a result of 2 significant appeals that we won in Florida. We just didn't expect to resolve those appeals this year, but those came through late in the quarter.","Continued reductions in property management costs as a result of efficiencies drive from the Archstone integration and restructuring as well as natural gas and electric costs continued to moderate with utilities declining 1.3%.","For full year '14, we would expect expense growth to be 2.2%. With year-to-date expenses of 1.7%, Q4 expense is expected to grow 3.6% will be driven by slightly higher utility costs, real estate tax of 5.7% and higher payroll costs as a result of stabilized operations from the Archstone integration.","Now as we think about 2015 and our preliminary guidance of 3.5% to 4.5% top line growth, we'll be making adjustments to our 3 buckets of market revenue growth. Washington, D.C. will continue in a bucket of its own with a revenue decline of approximately 1% again for 2015.","While D.C. has absorbed more than 14,000 units thus far, we are still at the midpoint of delivering a combined 30,000 units for this year and next.","Our middle bucket of 3% to 5% revenue growth will consist of Boston and New York. New York should produce full year results similar to 2014, while Boston will be closer to 3%.","Our plus 5% revenue growth markets continue to be led by San Francisco, Denver and Seattle. Los Angeles should be a solid plus 5% performer with Orange County, San Diego and South Florida crossing the 5% threshold early in the year.","For expenses, 2015 are built from the ground up. But as we think about them today, real estate taxes will have [indiscernible] handle and make up 34% of total expense.","We should see moderate growth in payroll as a result of diminishing returns from the Archstone integration. However, utilities should produce meaningful year-over-year reductions in costs, as a result of lower natural gas and electricity costs.","All combined, real estate taxes payroll and utilities make up almost 71% of total expense. With that in mind, we would expect 2015 expense to be modestly higher compared to 2014 with more color to come on our Q4 call.","So we are mindful that many markets will continue to have elevated deliveries. We believe that improved job growth is upon us and delays in marriage are creating additional demand. People of all walks of life are seeking a lifestyle in the city and renting by choice.","Owning a home is no longer a required variable in the calculus of achieving the American dream, and homeownership rates continue to decline.","Certainly, this must be a formula for outsized demand for quality apartments that should produce above trend revenue growth for some time to come.","David?","David J. Neithercut","All right, thanks, Dave. Now clearly, we remain excited about the strength and fundamentals we continue to experience across our markets. As David noted, really driven by an improving economy, steadily improving job growth and recovering unemployment rate, we remain confident that due to a very favorable demographic picture and the noted changing lifestyles, plus millennials staying single longer and they really are embracing the flexibility provided by high-density rental housing within close proximity to their friends and their favorite activities.","We've got a lot of run rate ahead of us for continued strong revenue and NOI growth, which will result in favorable growth in normalized FFO and our dividends payments as total shareholder return for years to come.","With the heavy lifting of our portfolio transformation behind us, our transaction activity today is more fine tuning in nature as we complete a few remaining market exits and redeploy that capital in the longer-term core market investments. We sold 3 non-core assets in the third quarter, 2 25-year-old garden assets in Florida and a 44-year-old asset 100 miles west of Boston, Massachusetts. We realized an 11.8% unleveraged IRR inclusive of management cost on those deals.","During the quarter, we bought one property, 308 units in North Hollywood, California that had been built in 2013.","Our guidance for the year remains to buy $500 million of assets and sell $500 million at a spread of 100 basis points, and that spread being the difference between the yield we are selling, and that which are buying. This suggests that we have $125 million of acquisitions yet to do this year and $300 million more in dispositions, all of which must be done significantly tighter than the 140 basis point spread realized year-to-date.","We're currently working on a couple of acquisitions that could get us to our $500 million target, we hope to close by year end at high-4 yields. And on disposition front, in addition to the nearly $200 million sold to the first 9 months of the year, thus far in the fourth quarter, we've sold a couple of yields in Orlando for $150 million at 6% yield. And we have a half a dozen other disposition candidates in various stages of the process. And several of these deals represent less desirable assets but in our core markets that will trade at yields in the low to middle 5s, which is significantly lower than those realized in our exit markets and will bring our weighted average disposition yield to somewhere near the high 5s by the end of the year.","And lastly, I'll reiterate that the disposition yields we provide are the forward 12-month yields that we are selling. The true cap rate, however, really that being the yield that the buyer acquired is significantly lower than our disposition yield when adjustments are made for increases in real estate taxes and insurance.","Now we're excited to commence construction in the third quarter on a 40-story tower in downtown Seattle on Pine Street, just 2 blocks from Pike Place market. This asset is expected to cost $200 million net of some additional air rights that we expect to sell at a later date.","The tower will be delivered in 2017, and produce a yield on cost in the high 4s on today's market rents, and it's expected to stabilize in the upper 5s.","This trend transaction brings 2014 starts to date to $829 million, which includes 2 high-rise towers, 1 in downtown San Francisco and that which we just started in Seattle.","It's also possible that 2 additional projects could begin yet this year, totaling $300 million, which are also in San Francisco and Seattle. But if they don't get underway yet this year, they most certainly will early in 2015.","We completed roughly $500 million of development projects this year, and we currently expect these new assets to deliver low- to mid-6% returns on current rents in markets where core product trades solidly in the 4s, such as downtown LA, Seattle and Pasadena. We also have another $830 million of projects underway that will be completed in 2015 and our current forecast are that next year's deliveries will yield in the low 6s. This includes 2 new towers in New York City and new product in San Francisco, San Jose and Seattle.","During the third quarter, we acquired one land site for the 2016 start of a 33-story tower in the financial district of downtown L.A. containing 428 units, for a total development cost of $200 million, mid-5% yields at current rents, and we'd expect that yield to stabilize in the mid-6s.","So before I open the call to questions, I'd like to give a little shout out to the entire team at equity for having recently been recognized by GRESB as the residential large cap sector leader in sustainability.","Sustainability is an important initiative here, one that is not only the right thing to do, but one that is having a strong bottom line return for the company and we're very proud of the work that Lou Schotsky and many others around the country have been doing to produce such positive results and favorable recognition. So, Pam, we'll be happy to open the call to questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Nick Joseph from Citi.","Nicholas Gregory Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","David, you talked about the strong multifamily fundamentals and clearly, we're seeing them in the results and the outlook. What's the largest risk to the strong multifamily outlook going forward?","David J. Neithercut","Well, look, I think that the demographic picture is very strong. We're certainly seeing the job growth in the markets in which we operate. I tell you, the things that we think about as sort of risks to us are safety and security of our center cities. But I think that's not an immediate concern. But that's something that we've talked a lot about. I'll tell you that I think one of the limiting factors on the growth of these and the long-term power of these center cities is public education. I think that's something that will send a lot of people to the suburbs. But I think that the demand for housing in these cities there today, the jobs are being located there, the companies are relocating back to the city, we're seeing here in Chicago on a regular basis. And we're obviously very optimistic about the long-term upside of the sort of this reurbanization of the country today.","Nicholas Gregory Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Then in terms of the balance sheet, you have $450 million on the line right now and $300 million of higher-coupon debt coming due in April. What are your thoughts on addressing those? And could we see opportunistic in the near-term given where rates are? Or is that more of a 2015?","Mark J. Parrell","Hey, Nick, it's Mark Parrell. I think even more as a 2015 thing. We have done some hedging in anticipation of that maturity as well, as some secured debt maturities we have later in 2015. So right now, our expectation is that we would deal with that in 2015, given that we have the protection on the hedges. But we'll watch the market and if something really changes dramatically, I guess, we could do something, but right now, that's not our expectation.","Operator","We'll go next to Dave Bragg from Green Street Advisors.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Last quarter, you suggested that there was a lot of product on the transaction market and seems to suggest that there was a possibility that you would exceed your acquisition guidance for the year. David, could you talk a little bit more about what you've seen over the last few months and the opportunities that may have not materialized?","David J. Neithercut","Well, we've certainly seen more product this year. And there's certainly more activity, transaction activity this year than a year ago. I tell you, there has been lots of things that have traded that we've watched very closely and decided not to bid on or bid this sort of stay in the process, but knowing that we would not get just given how aggressive pricing can be for the kind of product that we'd be happy to own -- add to our portfolio. There have been deals that have been shocked in portfolios that have been withdrawn because seller's expectation of the portfolio did not met. And they'll now, perhaps be broken up and be sold individually. And we may or may not transact on some of those individually. And frankly, I tell you, there are some portfolios that have been buyers or sellers expectations were met and they've just kind of been pulled from the market. So there certainly has been an increase. We've bird-dog kind of all of it. But we now think that we felt has been particularly opportunistic as you note. There are things we bought that have been in lease up. We're pursuing a transaction today that is in -- still under construction. So there might be some opportunities for us to sort of play here and there. But, I guess I'll tell you, Dave, that there's nothing out there that we need to buy. There's nothing out there that's hugely strategically important for us. And if we can find the right trade opportunity, the right things to buy, at the time we believe we're getting good value on what we want to sell, we'll transact. But if we can find that's, we won't.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And we noticed a pretty big increase in CapEx in the quarter on a year-to-date basis. You're up pretty meaningfully year-over-year. Can you talk about that and what the expectations are for 2015?","Mark J. Parrell","Sure. It's Mark Parrell. I think for '14, we'll be pretty close to that $1,700 number. Dave, we increased our [indiscernible] spend guidance a little bit. We are doing rehab at a faster pace, and we have teams working really hard and doing some good work for us. And building improvements probably a little lower. But that's just timing, that's just projects moving between the years. I would think next year will be similar to $1,700 number, which again, we think about also as a percentage of rent. So this new portfolio has obviously, much higher rents, much higher per unit values. And so we think the CapEx spend really matches up with that pretty well. And in terms of the changes from last year, last year's numbers didn't include the Archstone spend to the same store set. So the numbers you are comparing are a bit apples and oranges.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Right. So you're spending significantly more on the Archstone assets, legacy assets?","David J. Neithercut","Well, we're spending significantly more, I would say, on assets in general because we have these higher cost assets in higher cost markets. The Archstone projects or deals are getting a little more attention. But for example, rehabs were 2\/3 EQR legacy properties and 1\/3 Archstone legacy property. So that's about the right split between the portfolio NOI.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And the last question on that, what's the contribution that you've seen in 2014 to NOI growth from this activity? What do you expect in 2015?","David J. Neithercut","So again, we do leave our rehabs in same store because as a percentage of the value of the assets are pretty small. We do know others take rehabs in and out. And that's just not something we do, we leave them in. But it's still pretty modest as you look at the whole portfolio. So something on the order this year of 15 basis points would be the contribution year-to-date. That would be our expectations going forward, 10 to 20 basis points, Dave.","David J. Neithercut","Now I guess, the only other thing I'd add there is we're averaging 12 -- $10,000, $12,000 per unit spend and all those ideas of rehabs that can be $50,000, $60,000, $70,000 per unit. So it's a little different activity that we're conducting than what we understand in some of our peers might [indiscernible].","Mark J. Parrell","And just to finish that thought. I mean, the Breakwater, the Marina del Rey deal at Breakwater, which is looking on our development page, that was $100,000-plus unit rehab. It was an empty property we emptied out. That isn't the same store and never was. These other rehabs are often done when occupied. It means for us, it's appropriate to keep those sort of rehabs in same-store, and to take these big major rehabs out.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jana Galan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A question for David Santee, if you could please provide a update of rent as a percent of income and maybe highlight some of the markets like San Francisco that saw 12.5% year-over-year growth?","David S. Santee","Well, I think, we've kind of discussed this before in that we measure income one time when folks move in. And because we use the same qualifiers, I mean that percent of income really never changes. So when we look at San Francisco today, the median rent percent of meeting income is 24%; Southern California, 23%; Seattle is only 19%. So the numbers really don't change as people with higher incomes continue to backfill the people that move out because they can't afford the rent.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And you mentioned move out for homeownership were down about 90 bps. Can you provide steps and other reasons to move out?","David S. Santee","Yes, I mean, year in and year out, the #1 reason is really job change. Either people need to relocate or transferring, what have you, that always runs kind of in the 23% to 24% of move outs. Rent increases, too expensive, those have been really -- when you look back at the last 7 or 8 quarters, it's been 12% to 13%. Obviously, some markets are more dramatic than others. There for a while, San Francisco was 30%, 33% of move outs. And then bought home is typically the third. So as far as the overall makeup of move out. It's still pretty consistent with job change #1, increase to expenses #2 and then bought a home #3.","Operator","We'll go next to Rich Anderson from Mizuho Securities.","Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","So when you were thinking about your outlook for same-store revenue, it's 50 basis points higher this year than it was last year. And I'm curious what kind of were you thinking then versus now? Is it a rehab impact as Mark described? Or is there something more optimistic that you feel about for 2015 versus starting point last year?","David S. Santee","Well, I would first say that we kind of build this from the ground up. We start with embedded rent. So we start with the projected value of the rent roll in Q4. We look at turnover and know that in a lot of these markets we have below 50% turnovers. So you can pretty much count on the renewal increases to come through for you. And then it's just a matter of what you think rents are going to grow next year in the markets. I would say that we definitely have a higher degree of confidence in the Southern California markets to produce greater growth than we've seen in the past. I think we're probably a little more optimistic on D.C. than we were last year. That's not to say that DC is going to make some big turnaround. But certainly, it performed better than we thought. This year, we're just kind of taking the same assumption next year. When you put all that into the blender, that's how we get our range.","Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Okay. You mentioned, David, that the new supply happening in Florida, Southern Florida. On the topic of fine-tuning from a transaction and kind of portfolio pruning perspective, will Florida now kind of register in the market where you start to get in front of what could be some supply pressure in the next couple of years?","David J. Neithercut","Really, the focus will continue to be on the exit markets that we've been working on. And we've got, I think, desires to sell more kind of older noncore assets in some of our core markets. But no market is immune or off-limits from selling asset, we think we can trade those dollars into better performing other assets. But the focus will be on Inland Empire continuing in Orlando. Some far out in Western Massachusetts' assets, some maybe some suburban stuff in D.C., Inland Empire. I think the priorities will likely be there.","Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then my last question, do you have a statistics on the percentage of your tenants that are married?","David J. Neithercut","What we know is that nearly half of our units are occupied by single individuals. We know -- and units are occupied by 2 adults. We don't always know what marital status is.","Operator","We'll go next to David Toti from Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Just quickly, David, I want to go back to the emphasis on the urban renter and the urban product that the company has been focusing on for some time. We hear from some peers that actually they're concerned about urban locations given generally higher levels of supply delivery, and there seems to be a focus from some of your peers to be on more suburban assets. Could you maybe just comment on -- do you believe that's through that risk of supply is higher? And is there any way that you cut the portfolio performance relative to urban versus suburban if you looked at that on a go forward basis?","David J. Neithercut","We're certainly aware of what elevated deliveries have been maybe in D.C. and in Boston up in these urban markets. That doesn't change our long-term view that these are the best long-term performers, and will provide us with a higher long-term total rate of return. This increased density bring more people, brings more activity, supports more restaurants, more bars. I mean, it is very much a lotus of the lifestyle that we believe that our demographic would prefer. I think that these young people want to be downtown, they don't want to be in the suburbs. And I'm not suggesting that you can't build and lease units in the suburbs. We just -- we think that the impact, the long-term impact will be greater being downtown, notwithstanding some, what we believe are short-term elevated levels of deliveries in some of these markets. We think that the peak is here or nearly 2015. It will come down from there. The absorption that we've seen, for instance, in D.C., I think continues to give us confidence that this is where people want to be, and it will pay off for us over the long term.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Does it suggest then that perhaps, the suburban renter, if you're going to really aggregate that individual is older, perhaps married? And maybe a little bit less elastic in terms of rent and price tolerance?","David J. Neithercut","I guess, I think one can make assumptions like that. We've not done any real hard diligence on that. I guess my sense is, my personal sense is people that are renting in the suburbs want to be in the suburbs and likely be homeowners in the suburbs. And people that are renting downtown want to be downtown, and it will be long time before they're homeowners in the suburbs.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. I'm just trying to explore that, that sort of theory a little bit. Just one last question on the development pipeline. For the recent projects, are you seeing -- are you basically underwriting significantly lower yield expectations on these assets? Or has the yield generally remained pretty steady and maybe some -- if you just can quantify that to some extent, that would be helpful.","David J. Neithercut","I mean, as we -- as we're underwriting new deals?","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Yes.","David J. Neithercut","Yes, well, certainly, yields have come down. So, I mean, the product that we built in 2010, 2011 that is now sort of stabilized, they're stabilizing in the high 7s and the 8s. That product and lease-up today, which would've been started a couple of years ago are probably in the mid-6s. Things that are being completed soon will kind of be high 5s, low 6s. So clearly as construction prices have increased and land prices have increased, yields have certainly come down. And as I say, the things we're starting today, we think are low 5s to 6. So you're certainly getting better returns on that, which you started coming out of the recession, if you have had land priced at what you could buy at the recession. If you were carrying legacy land, you wouldn't be able to realize those same returns. But certainly, you're getting lower returns today than you were putting projects in service 4 years ago.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Nick Yulico from UBS.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of questions. Going back to the preliminary talk about expenses next year. I think you said, Dave, modestly higher than 2014. I wasn't sure if that related to the modestly higher than the 2.2% growth level this year.","David S. Santee","Yes. Modestly elevated compared to the 2.2%.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then turning to New York City portfolio. Can you remind us, I think, some of your assets there have 421 abatements, which will eventually be rolling off at some point. If you remind us how many of those assets have those and when those abatements might roll off? And how are you thinking about that process in relation to maybe looking at those assets as being good candidates for condo conversion, sales not doing it yourself.","David J. Neithercut","Well, I don't know off the top of my head how many are subject to 421A. But there are fair number of them. And they are all in many of them in the process of burning off, because they do burn off over an extended time period. And the impact on real estate taxes next year because of 421A burn off is what, David?","David S. Santee","That's 160 basis points.","David J. Neithercut","So significant percent share of our increase in real estate taxes next year is a result of the burn off of the 421A. And then your second question with respect to interest in kind of medium conversions of our properties, we're open-minded about selling things in New York city if people will pay us premiums for them.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. But I mean, you're not at the point now where you've identified several of these assets that you're going to be facing higher real estate taxes and you're thinking about bringing those to market to sell.","David J. Neithercut","There's no such activity underway at the present time.","David S. Santee","We have quite a number of 421A assets. Just sitting here, looking at the percent of tax, it could be 30% to 40% of our assets in New York. But we have -- because there's step-ups every 5 years or what have you over 15 or 20 years, we're experiencing step-ups pretty much every year to varying degrees.","Operator","We'll go next to Alex Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Two questions. One, what is your take for why we're seeing apartment fundamentals accelerating? I mean, if you look at the economy, it generally seems to be following the same trend. It's not like the economy has suddenly shot off the roof and job growth is through the roof, et cetera. And this supply picture hasn't dramatically just dropped. So why do you think that we're getting a sort of acceleration of apartment fundamentals when one would think that you'd sort of get maturation of the cycle?","David J. Neithercut","I think it just been a slow and steady improvement. I think that we've sort of seen this over the past 3, 4 years. It's just been slow and steady improvement. We're starting to create jobs and employment rate is coming down slowly, but surely. We'll get some economic activity happening. And the demographic picture is not impacted really, by what's happening in the economy. So there are still 4 million young people a year turning 21 years of age in this country. I mean, in formal households and we're seeing a lot of them move to the city. So I think it's just been a slow and steady process. And frankly, don't forget that we've under built housing in this country over the past half a dozen years. We certainly didn't deliver a lot of product in '09, in 2010. And so I think we're still behind, frankly, I think what a normal level of new supply might be. So I think those things all add up to just continued slow and steady fundamentals in the business that continued to look really good for us.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","So last year where we sort of had a pause in the second half of the year, so you wouldn't -- would you attribute that more towards sort of renter adjustments to the new levels? And now that everyone has accepted the new rents, it's just moving on? Or should we -- are you think that maybe next year, we see some perspective some of the increases we've seen this year?","David J. Neithercut","I guess I don't really have an opinion about that, Alex, I'm sorry. Again, David just mentioned we get through the highest occupancy, we ever had this time of the year. Our left to lease is low. So just basic fundamentals are good. I will tell you we get pushed back all the time from people about rental increases. Many of whom go out, shop the market, come back and accept the renewal offer. Others can't, as David noted the second biggest reason people move out is they can't afford it. But we've got people who will -- are happy to move back in, who move in with a higher income of the person that left. So again, I just think it's kind of a slow and steady event. I think that the interest in owning single-family homes is not there of our tenant profile. Again, nearly being half of our units occupied by single individuals. For those who might like to own a single-family home, down payments are stretched and getting financing is difficult. So I think all of those things add up to just continued slow and steady improvement in fundamentals and just a very positive outlook for us.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. Second question is given how the tenures come down and the demand for especially CBD real estate just seems to continued increase. Are you guys seeing more demand from institutions to own infill CBD apartments? Or are the cap rates still top for pension funds to digest?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I guess I'd say that cap rates relative to the 10-year treasury might be as positive and as wide as they've been in quite some time. We're still seeing interest in institutions owing these kind of assets. And a deal just traded in Seattle a half a block away from the deal that we're now building on Pine Street that traded like 3.5, and they're happy to have it. And they think they might acknowledge, there might be a 5% IRR up, but 10-year treasury level today, that's -- they think that's a very acceptable spread. I guess what I'd say is, there may be fewer of those institutions chasing those deals today. But there's still enough of them to get done at very, very strong pricing.","David S. Santee","And, Alex, that you were right last week. There's a lot of discussion, pardon me about foreign buyers and their interest in multifamily in these markets that they find these sort of core markets highly desirable. They like the return, they like it as a safety play and that folks across the country are seeing some added interest from foreign buyers that really weren't that common as buyers of multifamily in the past.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","And that is a shift.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Vahid Khorsand from BWS Financial.","Vahid Khorsand - BWS Financial Inc.","Quickly on the fundamentals, when the federal government came out last week and was talking about reducing the standards and making it easier for people to get home loans. How you see that impacting you going forward if that is instituted?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I guess if I own a lot of property in the lands in Phoenix, Dallas, I might be concerned about that. But we just don't see that as a risk to us. We, again, as I've said several times, it's a very large share of our units occupied by single individuals, a very smaller share, less than 10% are occupied by 2 adults with children. And it's also, I want to just impress upon you, it's a lifestyle choice. That not simply an economic decision. I think our residents want to live in high-density environments with proximity to public transportation, et cetera, and all the things one enjoys. I guess I'd ask everybody on the phone how many young analysts are now coming in your office, saying they're moving to suburbs because they didn't get a 93% -- 97% single-family home loan. They're not because they want to live downtown, they want to buy -- live near their friends, they want to live near where all the activity is. And I also suggest few that they really do value this flexibility of being a rental housing. I mean, just today, this morning, I got an email from my nephew in Phoenix talking about he think he might be taking a new job here in Chicago. I mean, this is a mobile segment of the population that at least at this time in their lives are not interested in single-family homeownership. We are also in markets today, where the cost of that -- those single-family homes as a multiple of incomes is significantly higher than the national average. So I would think that single-family home REITs and those who operate in lower cost markets would be more at risk of what their residents might do as a result of been able to get very expensive 97% loan value single-family mortgages.","Vahid Khorsand - BWS Financial Inc.","Okay. In the last quarter, you announced that you picked up in property in Glendale, and this quarter, you announced a property in North Hollywood and then a partial purchase in L.A. And I think it was 1 month or 2 months ago, you actually came out with a report that said they expect rents across Los Angeles to go up 8%. Do you see that actually happening? Is that too low an estimate for you? Can you give any thoughts on that?","David J. Neithercut","So I guess we won't give you any specificity about Southern California except to say that in David's earlier remarks, he noted that it was a very strong performing market this year and expected it to be a strong [indiscernible] market for us next year. So long term, we like Southern California, and are delighted with what we own and with the recent investments that we've made there.","Vahid Khorsand - BWS Financial Inc.","So if I could ask you then, do you have any impression from investors that there's a little bit of West Coast bias when it comes to your California properties because they have been surpassing growth expectation -- targets and no one seems to be taking that much notice of them?","David J. Neithercut","I'm not sure I understand the question. Certainly, Seattle and San Francisco have been some of the top-performing markets and we think David suggested that L.A., Southern California in it's top bucket. Joining those in the top buckets, so certainly the West Coast is expected to have better top line growth next year than the East Coast.","Vahid Khorsand - BWS Financial Inc.","Okay. And I guess and last question, for the property purchase, you said there was up 4.7% cap rate. Is that the stabilized cap rate? Or could you provide us with the stabilized cap rate?","David J. Neithercut","Well, that is -- it would be a stabilized cap rate, so there's still a little bit of lease up going on in that transaction, that would be a stabilized cap rate.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies.","George Hoglund - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","This is George on for Tayo. Most of my questions have been answered. But one thing when you talked about the increased turnover, it's mainly -- or the increases within the portfolio people moving to larger, more expensive units. Do you have any color on sort of what's the driver of that? Are these people who are making more money who want a nicer apartment? Or are these people who may be coupling up and instead of moving out to home, they're just getting a bigger apartment?","David J. Neithercut","We don't have that level of detail. I would suggest that it's probably all of the above. We know that if people get a promotion, they want to move up 10 floors and have a better view. And some people, who want to pair up with a roommate. There is no difference as bonuses don't come in as large that if somebody might have to downsize. But nevertheless, they still want to remain in the neighborhood, they want to be around the lifestyle that they have accustomed to. And I think they're willing to make whatever adjustments they need to accomplish that.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Salinsky from RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","David, if you mind just going back to the changes in the quarter. Obviously, you said a 6% renewal increase, was that -- that was -- what was the new lease on a lease-over-lease basis? And how is that blended actual change in the quarter? Just trying to compare that to the second quarter acceleration that you saw.","Mark J. Parrell","Okay, the lease-over-lease was 2.3 lease. Renewal was 6 and blended 4.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, so the blended change lease-over-lease was 4 in the quarter. Okay, that's helpful. Then, David, second question, just going back to, I think David Bragg's question, you talked about the acquisition opportunities. Just given the challenging acquisition environment, I think you said the $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion between '14 and '15. Is there any thoughts to maybe push forward a little bit more development surge into '15? Or you still comfortable with that kind of a $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion range?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I guess we're comfortable with what we talked about development being peaking this year and next year, and then kind of going back down. It's -- land sites are very expensive, construction costs are up. In places like New York City, San Francisco, you can't touch property given the strength, the strong bid from the condo builder. I guess, I mean, our instructions to our development team is we'll find a way to do whatever good development projects we can find. In New York city, for instance, that might be having to be done on ground leases as opposed to free simple. Or just finding other opportunities. And I guess I want to just emphasize sort of the word opportunities. I mean to us that means find things that we believe we can buy relatively cheap. And that's the challenge today, the guys who are working very hard bulk from the transaction group and the development group, they're trying find things that are really value creation opportunities. But it's a challenge given that the strong bid for land today, primarily from condo guys as well as the strong bid for stabilized streams of income that we're seeing from institutional buyers and the foreign buyers that Mark mentioned.","Operator","We'll go next to Nick Joseph from Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's actually Michael Bilerman. Just 2 quick questions. David Santee, do you know when you talk about the intra-asset movement, which is to press the turnover stats you showed. Do you have, I guess going back on an annual basis, how many of your residents moved either intra-asset and then intra-equity because in addition to some of the reasons you cite, I assume you as a landlord and how you treat your residence and what you're offering in your buildings and how the more urban nature of your portfolio likely means more shifts within the portfolio to an equity-owned building. And I said [indiscernible] numbers to support that thesis.","David S. Santee","Yes, we measure that. We've been measuring it for the last 7 or 8 years. It's, on average, it's about 500 residents per quarter that moved, that stayed within the Equity family. Sometimes, that's just a result of how we structured the ledgers on a building, Trump is the best example where each building is a separate entity, so to speak. So therefore, it's not a transfer, it's a move out, move in. But for the most part, we track the number of people that move from what market to what market. And for the most part, it's loyal customers that want to stay within the Equity family because they've enjoyed their living experience thus far.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And I guess with the increase in sort of mobility of the millennials, are you going after that more as people, if they do put up a notice of -- that they're vacating that, if they're moving to a different location, trying to get them to put Equity on the map. So if they're moving -- Neithercut talked about his nephew moving to Chicago, recognizing there's not a lot of downtown spike, but would you be able to work with that?","David S. Santee","Yes, we actually have a 1 (800) number specifically designed for that, that we have people in our call center that are referred to as relocation specialists. We recently, well, kind of, call it, back in May, we revised our transfer guidelines cost and we just made it more desirable from both an economic and ease of transfer for residence. And I think one, that's why we seen elevated transfers over the last quarter. But also, we're seeing more and more people stay within the Equity family. So we constantly look for ways to improve that experience and retain residence for a longer period.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then just a question for Neithercut. On the day [indiscernible] rate comes out at 64.4%, which I think is the lowest since early '95. Sam's on record saying, you think this is going to 55%. Can you just provide some color if that's the mindset, why Sam would sell share 2 million shares of EQR in August, $130 million?","David J. Neithercut","Well, it's not my place to explain what Sam has done, except to tell you that those in the first shares of Equity Residential stock Sam has sold in 23 years. And that they were done for some estate planning purposes. And we've been assured that, that's the end of it. So I think that this was last of call of homeownership, et cetera, and more just some personal financial things that needed to be taken care of.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. I guess as I think about EQR as an estate vehicle itself, if you believe that we are moving down to a 55% homeownership level, then we'll see continued growth in underlying cash flows, and hence, what will be dividend growth given the way you've tracked your dividend relative to free cash flow, it would just seem in congress to that sort of comment. So that's what I was trying to understand.","David J. Neithercut","I think the residual ownership interest that Sam has in Equity Residential speaks volumes about his long-term feelings about the company.","Operator","We'll go next to Buck Horne from Raymond James & Associates.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I just had a couple of questions. One, seems some time demographically talking about the millennial, but think about the other end of the spectrum right now, are you seeing any increases from baby boomers? And maybe the median age of your new renters, are you seeing any kind of empty nest renters looking for the downtown lifestyle right now?","David S. Santee","Yes. When we look at our average age in Manhattan, the average age in Manhattan is 40 years old. So we see these numbers pickup little by little. We've done some studies where we look at where people have moved out of some of our suburban communities, where they've relocated to. And you kind of see some minor directional hints that people are moving into the city. And one of the reasons -- when you think about -- I think about our own folks in Washington, D.C. We had our office in the suburbs, out in Tyson's corner, we moved our office right downtown DC. If you live in the burbs, even though you have public transportation subway, it's just not fully built out yet, and it could take you 3 hours to get from, call it, Fairfax into the city. So I think that's a big consideration as well, as companies continue to move their offices into the city, people don't want to deal with the traffic, so they move into the city as well and you have this outsized demand for in-town property.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And moving to South Florida, I just want to go back to South Florida for a second. Do you have any station between the deliveries you are seeing coming next year between how many are for-sale condos versus pure rental apartments? And maybe what kind of cap rates are we seeing in South Florida right now, both for in place asset and development deals?","David S. Santee","Well, the numbers that I quoted were for rent apartments. We build these from the ground up, a lot of people in the field validate and what have you certainly some of these could change. But David?","David J. Neithercut","Yes, I think that the good quality product in South Florida will trade at 4.5% to 5.5% cap rates today.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Marty McKenna. Please go ahead.","Marty McKenna","Thank you, Eduardo. Good morning and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's second quarter 2019 results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer.","Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.","Now I'll turn the call over to Mark Parrell.","Mark Parrell","Thank you, Marty. Good morning and thanks for joining us today. It is a good time to be in the apartment business. Very strong demand for our product has continued to drive absorption in new supply and our turnover continues to be at all-time lows, resulting in same-store revenue growth that is exceeding our expectations and leading us to increase our same-store revenue, net operating income and normalized FFO per share guidance.","The midpoints of all these new guidance ranges now exceed the top end of our original guidance expectations. After I discuss our investment activity in the quarter, I'll turn the call over to Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer, to give you color on our operating performance; and then to Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer, to give you some detail on our normalized FFO and same-store expense guidance changes and our balance sheet, and after that, we'll open it up to your questions.","On the investment front, asset prices have remained generally stable in our markets, but there are more assets for sale than earlier this year, just giving us the opportunity to trade-in assets that we believe have more desirable long-term return prospects. We continue to see good demand for the assets that we wish to sell. This is often coming from buyers with a value-add thought process. As a result, we have increased our transaction guidance for the year to $1 billion of both dispositions and acquisitions.","And during the second quarter we acquired three apartment properties. One was the 366-unit property in Rockville Maryland, built in 2016 that we discussed on the last call. The second is a 312-unit property, built in 2017, located in Castle Rock, which is a suburb of Denver that we bought at a price of approximately $92 million and a stabilized cap rate of 5% and a current cap rate of 4.7%. We are creating a property portfolio in Denver that has both suburban and urban exposure, but we expect that most of the portfolio will consist of assets in the urban core of Denver.","The third asset acquired is a 387-unit property in San Jose California that was built in 2017, which was acquired for approximately $180.5 million at a 4.5% cap rate. It is located in South San Jose, across the street from the Caltrain station and within an easy commute of Downtown San Jose and most Silicon Valley employers.","During the second quarter, we sold two of our wholly-owned assets, as well as two assets that were in joint ventures. One of the wholly-owned assets we sold was our 806th Avenue property in New York, which we discussed on our first quarter call. As a reminder, 806th Avenue was a rent-stabilized property that is part of the New York 421a program at substantially property tax step-ups for the next several years.","The second wholly-owned asset we sold was a 295-unit property in the Longwood Medical Area Boston. We sold this property for approximately $165.3 million at a disposition yield of 4.3%. The Longwood asset is a 1970 asset with dated floor plans and amenities. These sales generated an unlevered IRR of approximately 8.6%.","We also sold two properties that we held in a joint venture with an institutional partner. One was in South Florida and one in San Jose California. These totaled 945 apartment units for an aggregate sales price of approximately $394.5 million and a weighted average disposition yield of 4.7%. We received net proceeds of approximately $78.3 million from these sales and the joint venture generated unlevered IRR to us of 24%.","After the end of the quarter, we sold an additional property Park at Pentagon Row. It's a 298-unit asset, built in 1990. The sale price was approximately $117 million and we sold it at a disposition yield of 4.5%. The property is located one block from the new Amazon HQ2 location. We took the opportunity to capture the excitement around the HQ2 process to lower our concentration in the area, with the sale of this 30-year-old asset.","Now before I hand the call over to Michael, I want to make a comment on rent control. We agree that there's a shortage of workforce in affordable housing in many places in our country, but we disagree that the actions taken in New York and being considered in other states will help solve this problem. The new housing law in New York did not create any incentives to build new affordable housing. In fact, the recent legislation has created disincentives to build new supply at all.","We also think that over time it will lead to the deterioration of the existing affordable housing stock. In a moment, Michael Manelis will share our current estimate of the impact of New York's new law on our operating results. While we continue to work through the details of the New York legislation and its impact on our New York portfolio at this point we see the impact limited to caps on renewals for the approximately 3,200 rent-stabilized units in our portfolio as well as new limits on fees. Through our trade associations we will continue to encourage policymakers in California and other states to embrace actions like zoning reform and the removal of other regulatory barriers to new housing construction as well as programs that create incentives for private market developers to build the affordable housing units our city so badly needs.","Now I'll hand the call over to Michael Manelis. Michael?","Michael Manelis","Thanks Mark. I am pleased to report results from a strong leasing season with continued strength in demand for our product that resulted in acceleration of pricing power, reduced turnover and higher occupancy. All of our markets are doing well, but the East Coast market and Seattle continue to outperform our expectations. Sitting here today our portfolio is 96.7% occupied compared to 96.5% the same week last year. Base rents are up 3.7% as compared to 3.1% the same week last year. Renewal performance continues to be very stable with achieved renewal increases ranging between 5% and 5.2% for the last several months and we expect this trend to continue.","Let me provide you some context around the underlying assumptions of our revised guidance range of 3.1% to 3.5%. The new guidance same-store revenue midpoint of 3.3%, which is just above the high end of our original range, assumes that we maintain strong renewal performance around 5% and that we continue to enjoy good new lease rate growth and high occupancy, but both of these moderate as we transition into the seasonally slower part of the year.","The 3.3% midpoint of our same-store revenue range assumes occupancy of 96.3% for the back half of the year. This is slightly below our current occupancy due to the seasonal decline I just described but is still 10 basis points above what is a difficult comp period from the prior year. The 3.5% high end of the range is achievable if we do not experience the usual seasonal decline in occupancy later in the year, which is certainly possible given the strong demand that we are seeing but not typical.","The bottom end of our range is achieved if occupancy underperforms. So switching gears let me provide you some color by market. Boston clearly benefited from a pause in competitive new supply. We experienced a strong leasing season that delivered 3.25% revenue growth with growth in both occupancy and rate. Our full year revenue growth guidance for this market has increased to 3.5% from 2.8%. The pause in supply is only temporary. Competition will heat back up by the end of the year as a number of large buildings bring their first units to the market in the urban submarkets of Boston and Cambridge where we have almost 70% of our NOI.","The good news is that demand is very strong in this market, which will continue to aid the absorption of these deliveries. The New York market continues to demonstrate strength in overall fundamentals with a very strong leasing season. Foot traffic a proxy for demand is up 5.5% versus the same quarter last year and new lease change is up 70 basis points. The last time we posted a second quarter positive new lease change in New York was 2015. Our new lease occupancy and renewal growth were all better than expected.","We've revised our full year same-store revenue growth projection for New York to 2.5% from 1.8%. This reflects the overall strong performance of the market, but also includes the impact from changes associated with the rent regulation law that went into effect in the middle of June.","Let me start here by reminding everybody that we have approximately 9,600 units in the New York Metro area, one-third of which are not in New York City. Of the approximate 6,500 units that are in New York City about 3,300 are full market-rate and not impacted and about half or 3,200 units are rent-stabilized and are thus impacted by the changes to the regulation.","We estimate that these changes will reduce our overall second half renewal rate increase by about 50 basis points which will equate to about a 30 basis points impact on the full year renewal results in New York.","The changes in law also impact our ability to charge certain fees at all of our New York properties. We expect an $800,000 annual reduction in fees associated with new restrictions on application and late fees of which $400,000 will impact 2019. Combined these changes to the regulations will reduce our expected New York Metro market revenue performance by approximately 20 basis points in 2019.","We will continue to monitor the impact to our portfolio and we will likely find opportunities for savings on the expense side as we look to manage these units under the new laws.","Overall, there is good economic activity and strong demand for our products in New York. Companies continue to enter and expand their footprint in the market in order to attract top-tier talent. This top-tier talent wants to live at our high-quality and well-located properties.","Washington D.C. is producing better results than we anticipated. We\u2019ve increased our full year revenue growth expectations for this market to 2.6% from our original guidance of 1.4%. Elevated deliveries in the district continue to impact pricing power at our D.C. assets, but overall Class A absorption remains robust.","The recent news of what looks to be an agreement on a 2-year federal budget that will raise spending over current spending limits, will support the continued strength in this market. Most of the better than anticipated year-to-date performance is coming from Northern Virginia where we have about 57% of our market NOI.","The strength in this submarket is mainly attributable the fact that the overwhelming majority of economic growth in the region is occurring in Northern Virginia as opposed to Maryland and D.C.","94% of all of the jobs created in the Washington region during the first six months of the year were located in Northern Virginia. To share some perspective on the spread between submarkets, the district delivered about 1% growth in the quarter as compared to just under 4% growth in Northern Virginia.","Heading over to the West Coast; Seattle, continues to see well-established companies entering the market, as well as existing companies expanding within the market. The market's critical mass of knowledge workers attract these employers and drive strong demand for our products.","Foot traffic was up 8.1% on a year-over-year basis which fueled this market's ability to outperform with stronger occupancy and a marked improvement in new lease change.","We now expect our full year same-store revenue growth to be 3.2% versus our original expectation of 2% which given our current year-to-date performance of 2.5% demonstrates the current strength in trajectory for the balance of the year.","On the supply front, we're getting a break in the CBD and we clearly have pricing power in that submarket. We have some exposure on the East side, where the new deliveries are concentrated right now, but to-date we've seen good leasing velocity and are maintaining both rate and occupancy there.","Moving down to San Francisco, San Francisco continues to demonstrate tech-driven economic strength and job growth. At the end of May the Bay Area reached an all-time record high of 835,000 technology-related jobs.","We expect the full year same-store revenue growth to be 4% which is 60 basis points higher than our original expectations and consistent with our year-to-date performance.","We are seeing the strongest results in San Francisco and the Peninsula with some supply pressure in the East Bay and South Bay submarkets. At present this market is projected to deliver the strongest full year same-store revenue results in our portfolio.","Moving down to Los Angeles. Our performance year-to-date includes new lease change and renewal results which were lower than expected being offset by strength in occupancy and growth in other income categories like parking.","San Fernando Valley continues to be the submarket that is experiencing the most pressure and is running a little bit behind our original expectation. The rest of the submarkets continue to perform in-line or slightly ahead of our expectations.","Our updated full year same-store revenue growth projection of 3.9% is basically unchanged from the beginning of the year. Our full year guidance continues to assume a deceleration due to anticipated pressure from new supply that is back-half loaded.","Additionally, the occupancy comp from the second half 2018 in L.A. is challenging which means, we don't expect as much lift from occupancy for the balance of the year.","Orange County delivered second quarter results in-line with our expectations. Our full year revenue growth guidance is now 3.6% which was increased based on the lift we received in the first quarter gains and a slight out-performance on occupancy and renewals during this quarter.","We have a few properties that are experiencing a lack of pricing power due to deliveries in Irvine and Newport Beach. But overall, our Irvine portfolio is a diverse set of properties and not all of it is going to compete head-to-head with the 2019 supply.","San Diego is having a good leasing season, but just not as strong as last year. We expect our full year revenue growth to be 3.4%. This is down from our initial forecast. Overall demand is still good in the market. Occupancy is on track, but we're experiencing a little less pricing power due to the newer product downtown.","On the initiatives front, we've had a really busy quarter. We're making great progress toward the sales and service roadmap that we shared in our June investor update. On the sales front by the end of August, we'll have about 50 communities on our artificial intelligence, e-lead platform. We'll have deployed self-guided tours at over 45 communities.","On the service side of the business, we began testing our new mobility platform for our service teams and we expect to be fully deployed by the end of the year. We also remain on-track to have approximately 2,500 units enabled with smart home technology within the next 90 days.","Let me close with a huge shout out to the employees of Equity Residential. Their focus on delivering remarkable experiences to our prospects and residents is greatly appreciated. They have worked really hard to deliver strong results through what has been a very good leasing season.","I will now turn the call over to Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer.","Bob Garechana","Thanks Michael and good morning. Michael just discussed our markets and the upward revision to same-store revenue guidance. So let me take a moment to address our same-store expense revision, normalized FFO guidance and touch briefly upon our recent capital markets activity.","As you saw in the release, we've reduced the top end of our forecasted full year same-store expense growth range. We now expect same-store expense growth between 3.5% and 4% compared to the 3.5% to 4.5% range, we previously forecasted for the full year.","This improvement is driven by better than expected performance in all major expense categories but most notably in real estate taxes. Real estate tax expense which makes up a little over 40% of overall same store expenses grew 3.3% through the first six months of the year.","This was significantly lower than our original guidance back in January and is driven by lower-than-anticipated rates in Seattle which we mentioned in our first quarter earnings release, as well as the sale of the 421A asset during the second quarter.","This along with continued success in actual and anticipated appeals has reduced our real estate tax expense growth expectation to between 3% and 3.5% for the full year. This improvement is approximately 100 basis points better than original guidance.","On-site payroll, our second-largest category also -- performed better year-to-date than we originally anticipated. In order to maintain high levels of customer service, we've increased compensation and benefits to our field personnel in the face of significant competition for their services.","With the job -- while this job market has remained competitive, we believe we have adjusted fully to this new compensation marketplace and now expect modestly lower payroll growth versus prior expectations.","Like in prior years, we also continue to benefit from fewer losses related to medical claims driven in part by our continued focus on employee wellness. We now expect full year payroll growth of between 3.25% to 3.75% for 2019, also 100 basis points better than originally anticipated.","Finally our last two major expense categories are; utilities and repairs and maintenance which each make up around 13% of total same-store expense. Growth in utility expense is expected to remain contained in the mid 2% range for the full year.","Repairs and maintenance which was negatively impacted by storms and other weather-related items during the first quarter has normalized during the second quarter. We are not forecasting any additional outsized growth in repairs and maintenance for the remainder of the year and therefore expect a mid-4% range growth rate for the full year 2019.","Turning to normalized FFO, as noted in the release, we have meaningfully raised our guidance range for normalized FFO for the full year. Our new guidance range of $3.43 per share to $3.49 per share is up $0.07 at the midpoint, driven by the following items; a $0.04 contribution from same-store NOI based on the strong performance in our core business as highlighted by the new revenue and expense assumptions that Michael and I just outlined; a $0.03 contribution from the timing of our acquisition and disposition activity in both 2018 and 2019, and the minimal to non-existent cap rate dilution from this activity; a $0.01 contribution from lower interest expense due to lower-than-anticipated floating rates along with more favorable refinancing rates offset by $0.01 in other items including corporate overhead.","Turning to capital markets, as you saw in our release, we accessed the unsecured markets in June for a very successful issuance of $600 million in 10-year notes. The rate of 3% was one of the lowest 10-year coupons in both EQR and the REIT sector's history.","After quarter end, we used the proceeds from the issuance to repay a portion of $950 million in secured and unsecured debt that was maturing in 2019 and 2020. With these payoffs, we've effectively addressed all of our 2019 maturities and about half of 2020.","Finally, this new debt was financed at an effective P&L rate that was nearly 75 basis points better than that of the debt that was paid off. Our balance sheet remains incredibly well-positioned for the future given our strong credit metrics and limited near to medium term maturities.","With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions. Eduardo?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Nicholas Joseph from Citi. Please go ahead.","Nicholas Joseph","Thanks. Mark, appreciate your comments on New York rental control and Michael's comment on the impact to operating results. I'm wondering if you can talk about what you expect or what you're seeing in the market in terms of the asset pricing maybe both for market rate and rent control assets in New York City specifically.","Mark Parrell","I'm sorry Nick could you speak up just a bit. I think your question was on New York rent control and what we're seeing in other markets, but I'm sorry I didn't--","Bob Garechana","Asset pricing.","Mark Parrell","Asset pricing.","Nicholas Joseph","Yes. So, it's on asset pricing specifically. So, I'm wondering if you've seen any changes to asset pricing in New York City both market control and rent-regulated. And then when you expect to happen going forward given the new rent regulations?","Mark Parrell","Yes. Thank you for the question and for repeating it. It's just been six weeks since the new rules have gone into force. So, there really hasn't been a lot of activity that we -- or really any activity that we've seen that's priced assets at a size that we deal with. There was in the paper a reference to a deal that was priced before the rules. I think the buyer was trying to get out of the transaction, but that's a different kind of discussion. So, we have not seen any activity yet either direction.","Nicholas Joseph","And then what is your expectation for what this could do to asset prices in New York City?","Mark Parrell","Sure. I think it's going to take a little time for the market to just understand the rules. I mean we've got a great team here in Chicago and in New York really pored over that and really feel like we've got a pretty good handle on it, but even we're still learning. So, I'd say it's going to take the market a little while to understand the rules and apply it to what they think the pro forma cash flows are going to be going forward.","My expectation rent control in New York has always been there it's come it's gone. It was more acute in the 1880s and it's been less acute lately and now it's going to be a little bit more. So, I think this market is used to having some rent control in their calculation of future cash flows.","I think there's going to be a lot less supply built in this market which is bad for the city, in general, but probably good for cap rates and values for -- especially for the 3,000-plus market-rate units we own. So, my expectation is that this will take a little while to sort out, that there will be changes in people's perception not just of revenues, but of expenses.","And we -- Michael sort of alluded to that. I think we'll be spending less money on turnover cost because our turnover will be lower, less money on leasing and advertising, because again there'll be less need to fill the buildings so we occupied more -- even more highly than they are right now. So, my expectation is not to see big changes in cap rates. You could potentially see cap rates on market rate deals go down.","Nicholas Joseph","Thanks. And then just on updated guidance specific to the $0.03 related to the 2019 and 2018 transaction activity. Can you give more color on what's driving that? Is it the performance of the 2018 deals or is it timing of 2019? I know you changed the spread for guidance for this year, but that seems to only have a minimal impact on guidance.","Mark Parrell","Yes. I want to clarify a little bit more on the prior question as well. I -- my answer is limited to kind of the product we own. So, these rent-stabilized properties are relatively new. Some of the older rent-stabilized product might be more significantly impacted.","The market-rate and rent-stabilized stuff that's relatively new in vintage that's going through 421A is where I was focusing my comment. So, Bob Garechana and I are going to answer your question on that $0.03 difference. A part of that is just timing. We bought a lot a lot earlier in the year and that created this advantage where we have the disposition assets that will create NOI for us through most of the year.","So, as it relates to 2019, which is most of what's going on here, it's really driven by timing. And then of course the fact that we have almost no dilution. So, a few years ago we indicated you a lot more of our trading would be done flat or with very, very little dilution and you're seeing that evidence of this year. Anything you'd add Bob?","Bob Garechana","No. I think that sums it up. You'll see that corresponding or offsetting component of that is the slight increase in weighted average debt that you see in our guidance adjustments. And that's really just funding related to that change in timing. But I think Mark hit it on the head.","Nicholas Joseph","Thanks.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","All right. We'll take our next question from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank.","Trent Trujillo","Hi, good morning. This is Trent Trujillo on with Nick. So, just to go back to rate growth if you're seeing such strong demand across your markets, how much are you looking to push rates given occupancy is better than expected and turnover is at an all-time low?","Michael Manelis","Yes. So, I mean I think we actually moved rate a lot through this leasing season. And the fact that the rents are up call it 60 basis points more than where they were this time last year at 3.7% sitting here, that's actually pretty good growth. My guess is that we're going to see that kind of continue for the tail end of the leasing season. And then I would expect that while we'll moderate for the balance of the year, we just may not moderate quite as much as we've done in the past.","So, I don't -- it's hard to understand exactly how much of this gap is going to close between the renewal and new lease, but clearly, I think we're pretty pleased with the results that we posted for the second quarter and like the momentum that we have in place for the third quarter as well on the new lease side.","Trent Trujillo","Okay. I guess just a quick follow-up on that. Is it still fair to think about your confidence and your ability for new lease rate growth to narrow to about 150 200 basis points spread to renewals?","Michael Manelis","I think over a period of time. Yes, I don't believe that that's going to take place this year. I think the gap was just too wide when we entered the year to express -- to expect them to compress that quickly. But I think over time as you see strong demand and good pricing power, you will see that spread start to narrow back to that range call it between 150 and 200 basis points.","Trent Trujillo","Are there any particular markets that you're most enthusiastic about when you look forward?","Michael Manelis","Well, yes, I mean I like New York right now with what's happening. I like D.C.'s momentum that we have and Seattle. So, really -- I mean the only market that I would say is kind of that we're putting out there is the buzz or caution really points to Southern California right now where we're just trying to get the pricing power in check to understand for the balance of the year. But I don't think that that spread is going to narrow down in Southern California right now. The other markets I think still have potential to narrow.","Trent Trujillo","Okay. One more quick one I'm sorry. But you've spoken -- the team has spoken about the possibility of taking leverage up a little bit in the past. So, how much consideration did you give to recasting guidance showing Equity Residential as a net acquirer this year?","Mark Parrell","So, it's Mark, I think that depends on what more opportunities the team sees. If the investment team as we see on the ground are more deals for sale for right now Trent, we see more we like, we certainly are capable either with that $300 million of net cash flow that we've spoken of after payment of our dividend and CapEx every year we have, we can use a good portion of that to buy additional assets. We could certainly borrow more. So, we're open to that possibility. We haven't seen enough good stuff yet to justify taking leverage up, but we're certainly open to it.","Trent Trujillo","Okay. Thanks for time. Appreciate the comments.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","We'll now take over the next question from Rich Hightower from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Rich Hightower","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Mark Parrell","Good morning","Michael Manelis","Good morning.","Rich Hightower","I guess related to the first half performance, could you guys pin down maybe an estimate of where the supply is shifting from the first half to the second half or beyond? How that impacted your ability to push rents during the first half of the year?","Michael Manelis","Yeah. So this is Michael. So we really \u2013 this quarter, we're tracking supply in a couple of different ways from completions versus first unit hitting the market. We really did not see in this quarter any variations from what we expected to have take place in the second quarter from first unit hitting the market. I think what we could see as we get into the balance of the year you could see some of the typical markets start to show, the delays in deliveries and start shifting from one year to another. But at least for the second quarter, we kind of hit the markets to exactly what we thought was going to happen to us from a new delivery in the market. So I don't think we benefited from any kind of delays more than what we already anticipated.","Rich Hightower","Okay. That's helpful Michael. And then maybe going back to the comments earlier about the impact to overall New York revenue performance of I think you said 20 basis points for 2019. I mean, given what you said about still \u2013 not withstanding the people that have worked on it up until now but kind of still working your way through the law and the implications I mean how much variability around that 20 do you think could be possible whether for the remainder of this year or even into 2020?","Michael Manelis","We have a pretty high degree of confidence for the balance of this year that is not going to be materially different than that 20 basis points. We're benefiting a little bit because the law went into effect in the middle of the year. So it's half of the impact and you did a lot of your transactions before the law as well on some of the fee impact. But if this was a January 1, it would be a 40 basis point impact to this market for this year. As we think about next year, the difficulty is really trying to project where are renewal where were renewals going to be, because then you can figure in okay what are these restriction going to mean to you the fact that you can't achieve what would have been otherwise possible. So we still have a little bit more modeling to do and it's early to try to start thinking about 2020. But it's pretty clear, when you look for the balance of this year what the impact is going to be to us.","Rich Hightower","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Pawlowski from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","John Pawlowski","Thanks. Michael or Mark just following up on that question, I'm less concerned about 2020, but call it the next three years as you adjust your expense playbook as market demand supply factors adjust. Do you see the new rules as a net negative to EQR's NOI? Is it neutral? Is it a modest positive? How do you think longer term about your operating cash flow in New York?","Mark Parrell","Yeah. Thanks for that question, John. I think I'll start by saying, we definitively see it as a net negative for New York and for housing production in New York and for addressing the affordable housing issues that New York has. As it relates to us specifically, because we cannot own some of this older post-World War II rent-stabilized heavily regulated product that got hit the hardest the impact on us is less. I think it also creates uncertainty in the development and lending communities that may evidence itself in there being considerably less supply in New York than the already low numbers that market has. I think I can make an argument that New York has just become the most supply-constrained market that we operate in.","So I would suggest to you that we may do modestly better on our market-rate assets than we would have expected on revenue. And I think on expenses, we're going to have an opportunity as we figure out what our new turnover numbers are with these renewal increases. We contract out for a lot of turnover costs and we're going to have lower turnover so those expenses will go down.","In terms of capital, we've got to be very thoughtful about where we're putting our capital as well and we will adjust for that. So I \u2013 when you talk about a longer-term impact that's yet to be fully determined. But I think there are modest positives as well as \u2013 especially, to an operator of the kind of assets, we own including the fact that there's just not going to be much built in New York, because of this for quite a while. And if you own market-rate product in every year we're going to get 200 or 300 units more of market-rate product because our 421a rent-stabilized assets will transition as the burn-off period concludes into the market-rate assets, I think that's going to be to us an incremental positive.","John Pawlowski","Okay. But operating income for you when you put it all together the pros and cons, is the event of the new regulation in that modest net negative modest net positive?","Mark Parrell","I'd say either even or it could be a modest net positive, just because of the shift from rent-stabilized to market rate for us over time and the impact on supply in the market. But I can't emphasize enough how awful this is for the New York and as a housing policy matter.","John Pawlowski","Sure. Okay. And then a question \u2013 I know it's just one disposition, but a question about your broader exposure to D.C. I mean, it finally does seem like an improving market and there is job growth drivers to like more than we liked two years ago. So I guess why prune in D.C.?","Mark Parrell","Well, we've got some assets that are a little bit older in D.C. and we've got a big concentration in Crystal City around the HQ2 property. So that \u2013 for us, this was simply an opportunity to get rid of some older assets, I would say that in D.C. what's most exciting to us isn't just HQ2 it's Virginia Tech's new technology kind of Harper [ph] technology campus they're building, and the kind of jobs you're going to get in the district in and around the areas. So they won't be just sort of government-dependent, but there will also be a big technology \u2013 private market technology aspect there. So that's exciting to us. The supply, the continuation of relatively high supply numbers in D.C. which we do expect will go on is a net negative to the market.","So for us as we look at D.C. having a modestly lower exposure to that supply makes sense to us, but we'll continue to buy and build assets in that market to try and freshen the portfolio. But seeing modestly less exposure to that market given the supply considerations I just discussed. And the fact that this is the first time, I think we've talked positively about D.C. in four-plus years for us that \u2013 it seems like a sensible approach.","John Pawlowski","Okay. Thank you.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","All right. We'll now take the next question from Shirley Wu from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Shirley Wu","Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. So Michael, I did want to follow-up with your earlier remarks on L.A. So new leases year-to-date are trending at call it around 0.4% versus your initial guidance of 1.4%. And you mentioned that would continue to accelerate in the back half of supply and occupancy would get more challenging as well. So I'm just curious as to the color around you maintaining your revenue guidance for that market. Is that coming from let's say other income?","Michael Manelis","Yeah. So and I think I said in the prepared remarks, we outperformed a little bit in the first half of the year with occupancy so that was a boost to the number. And we definitely had other income, primarily parking that contributed to a little bit on the outperformance or mitigated the downside from the underperformance on new lease change and renewable. There is something on the new lease change that, I guess, I can call out, which is the one you drew the comparison of a 0.4% to our full year new lease change, but you got to remember, there's a lot of seasonality to that metric by quarter, so you need to understand what \u2013 where was that relative to last year.","So last year, we were running at a 2.3% new lease change in L.A. compared to the 40 basis points positive. A lot of that impact had to do with the fact that there is some anti-gouging proclamations that were put in place, and those proclamations really restricted our ability to obtain short-term lease premium in the market during the second quarter. So last year, we sold about 15% of all of our leases as short-term leases and those leases typically add premium call it anywhere between 15% and 30% higher than a standard 12-month lease. With the proclamation that was put in place that limits your ability to have growth greater than 10%. We chose not to sell short-term premiums, because the premium wasn't going to be enough for us to have those leases in place. So that's a lot of the dilution that you're seeing in the quarter numbers right now.","Shirley Wu","Got it. That's good color. I just had a second question for you guys on WhyHotel. Could you talk to your experience with WhyHotel at 100K in D.C.? Maybe some of the things you've learned from that experience? And if you would consider using their platform with any of your projects currently under development?","Mark Parrell","Sure, it's Mark. Yeah, we had a very good experience with WhyHotel. We know that we were sort of first out of the gate working with them the bigger public companies and others are considering or planning to do things with them. So we had a good experience. And I think it's a great way to mitigate that lack of income on the lease-up of a project and we'd consider using them again.","Shirley Wu","All right. Thank you.","Mark Parrell","Thank you. ","Operator","All right. We'll take our next question from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","John Kim","Thank you. From recollection of a couple of years ago, when the market was softer, you guys were signing more two-year leases with the second year essentially flat. And I'm wondering what that dynamic is now? How many two-year leases are you signing? And what's the embedded growth in that second year?","Michael Manelis","So I don't have that with me. I will tell you, we looked at that specifically in New York, where we did do a lot of two-year leases several years ago. It's something that's common in the marketplace. We actually had increased turnover in New York this quarter and on a year-to-date basis. And a lot of that increase was due to the fact that we had two-year leases expiring and we were not selling quite as many two-year leases going forward. So we're seeing it drop down, but I just don't have the stats in front of me to quantify.","Mark Parrell","Yes. It's not terribly material. I mean, you have to offer two-year leases in New York statutorily, but we don't have a lot of two-year leases not -- frankly non-12-month leases on the portfolio.","John Kim","So outside of New York, that dynamic doesn't exist?","Mark Parrell","No.","Michael Manelis","No.","Mark Parrell","It's uncommon.","Michael Manelis","Yes. Very limited.","John Kim","Michael, in your prepared remarks you discussed the bifurcation between Northern Virginia and the rest of D.C. Metro. Do you see this as a longer-term trend given HQ2 and the other tech companies growing in the market, or do these submarkets tend to revert back to the norm?","Michael Manelis","Well, I think, a lot of that too is just the pressure on supply in the district could mitigate some of that future revenue growth. No, I think, Northern Virginia has got a lot of good things working in its favor to demonstrate strong revenue growth for the future. And I think, there will be some spillover into the district in the other areas, but probably not at the same pace.","John Kim","Great. Thank you.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","All right. We'll now take the next question from Drew Babin from Baird. Pleas go ahead.","Drew Babin","Hey. Good morning. I was hoping to hit on the\u2026","Mark Parrell","Good morning, Drew. ","Drew Babin","Good morning. The moving parts of the expense guidance change, kind of, what's implied for the second half of this year? I was hoping you could talk a little bit just based on the visibility you have, with the cadence of expense growth in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter from an ease-of-comps perspective, and also anything that might kind of be lumpy that's in there?","Bob Garechana","Yes. It's Bob Garechana, so I'll take that real quick. So for year-to-date, we've produced 3.9% growth and we're guiding at the midpoint to 3% and 3.25%. I cautioned on all expense growth that $750,000 equals 10 basis points, so it can be volatile. But at the moment we don't anything.","We expect the back half to be the slightly better than the front half. A lot of that is due to expectations that in the fourth quarter we won't see any anomalies like we saw in first quarter related to repairs and maintenance. But otherwise things are pretty much in line for the back half relative to the front half.","Drew Babin","Okay. That's helpful. And one more question that's maybe a little more conceptual. A lot of our third-party research that we've read suggest that cap rates in secondary locations, B-class properties, have converged quite on urban A cap rates, so there's still some spread, but it's historically very narrow.","Does EQR look at this and think that, maybe it's time to double down or maybe even look at issuing common equity at some valuation to kind of double down on urban A-type properties, with this better long-term growth prospects, or do you look at that data and say maybe this is just a rational pricing on the B and secondary product? We'll just still continue to do what we've been doing.","Mark Parrell","Yes. I think we do think about continuing to do what we're doing. I mean, I think you hit the nail on head in terms of where the value is. The fact that there's been this convergence is mostly as a result, in our opinion, of some of these secondary markets being overvalued, because they're just a higher yield. They're just a slightly higher yield. They're more suitable for leverage. And there's just a lot of money chasing apartment products. And if there's any way you can talk yourself into something being mid-5 cap rate, you're going to do it.","So you've got a lot of money hitting markets and doing things that we think are going to be difficult. Because a lot of these secondary markets aren't feeling the housing -- single-family housing pressure right now; that they're probably going to feel at different points in the cycle and we don't think we're going to feel that on the urban end.","So we continue to look at the suburbs in our markets too true, like, the dense parts of our suburbs, like the Rockville deal you saw us do. So you'll see us buy suburban product where we see the customer base the same as our urban product. But to use the ATM to go hit that really hard at this point, it does not seem like that opportunity is as of yet so compelling, but we'll keep our eyes open.","Drew Babin","Great. Appreciate the color. Thanks.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take the next question from Richard Hill from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ronald Kamdem","Hey, you've got Ronald Kamdem on the line. Just two quick ones for me. The first is just on sort of show of the technology. Where are you guys in terms of getting maybe smart lock and smart home technology? And in terms of just, on the operating side, what sort of opportunity is there to sort of reduce either overhead or manpower through technology? And curious if it's millions, tens of million, how you guys think about that?","Michael Manelis","Yes. So this is Michael. So I opened in some of the prepared remarks just around some of the stats that the things that we were doing on the initiatives front. So we're on track. We'll have about 2,500 units with smart home technology in the next 90 days. We've got about 50 of our properties up and running with both kind of artificial intelligence, e-lead platform and self-guided tours. We got mobility on the service side.","I think \u2013 and I stated this last quarter and we talked a little bit about this at NAREIT which is, from our standpoint on these initiatives, the focus has really been around transparency, control, convenience and flexibility to our customers.","We've done a lot of de-centralization and eliminated roles on-site in prior years. We're not saying that we're not done, but I know that we're going to need to see the technology platforms enabled through our portfolio, just to see and understand what efficiencies and opportunities we're going to create.","So we're excited about the momentum that we have in place and I think as we get closer towards the end of the year, we'll be able to put some numbers to it. I mean each one of these right now were in these initial pilot phases. But I can point to on a standalone basis, we'd look at like the mobility platform, we have initial expectations that is worth a couple of million dollars to us, could be worth more from reduction in dependence on third-party contractors and overtime and things like that.","So, but we want to see these up and running for a little bit. We want to make sure that the results that we see are sustainable over a long period of time before we start putting numbers into the results for you guys.","Mark Parrell","And it will take a while in any event to evidence itself. I mean, 2019 is about implementation and putting these things out there. And 2020 and thereafter is more about seeing results. And some of the stuff will work great and some of this stuff won't and we'll be very open in both direction. And we'll use the entire 80,000-unit platform to leverage any technology that we do like.","Ronald Kamdem","Great. My second question just -- I love to talk a little bit about affordability, maybe as you think about your markets East Coast, West Coast sort of how that's trended and what you think the outlook of that is for the next three to five years?","Mark Parrell","Sure. So you did ask about markets, but I want to talk about company first a little bit on affordability. We have -- our residents -- our average household customer income is $155,000 a year. They're paying us $2,800 a month in rent which means they're giving us about 19% of their income in rent.","So our customer, just specifically the Equity customer is not terribly distressed. They've done well, they've gotten raises. We see that in the statistics that we have. So we talked about affordability of the rent check they're paying equity now, we feel really good about that.","We do recognize the bigger affordable issue in our markets that I think on the workforce side is pretty common. We think that a lot of the things being done for example in Minneapolis and were done in part in Seattle that were done with the old 421A program in New York, where you encourage and incentivize developers to create both more market-rate and affordable housing, where you reduce zoning barriers.","I think this -- the answer is housing production to address this affordability issue you're bringing up. And for that to occur, the government's got to both I think, encourage private industry to work as an actor to create these units and I think to some extent get out of the way on some of the things that it does that create barriers to that.","So again there's a great article on Minneapolis that came out just today, I think talking about their new zoning system that effectively got rid of single-family housing zoning in Minneapolis and it's likely to encourage a lot more production of housing.","Ronald Kamdem","Great. If I could just follow up on that, if I may? Just trying to get a sense of -- obviously you've been in the industry for a long time, as these conversations are coming up over production of housing and sort of you mentioned, do you feel like the conversation are maybe more productive today than they -- with regulators then maybe they were three or five years ago, or do you still feel like there's still a little bit of education or hill to climb? Just trying to get a sense of the tealeaves? Thanks.","Mark Parrell","There are still things we need to do with the policymakers. We're pretty active through our trade associations having these conversations. A lot of rent control to us is a bit of well-intentioned, but misguided attempt, so just relieve these rent pressures on people. But it's not going to help in the long run.","So to answer your question directly, I think the industry needs to continue to push on the education front both with policymakers and with the public. And cities like Sydney, Australia and Toronto repealed rent control a few years ago and they're seeing in Toronto lower rent growth than they did before, now that they've repealed it. ","In Sydney, Australia they're seeing rents actually go down on high-quality and workforce housing because they've produced so much housing. So it isn't like the industry doesn't have facts to back up its position. There are very few, if any economists that tent rent control is a good idea.","So I think we just need to keep -- putting your message out there. There's tough cycles and there will be a time when they sort of stop doing this and get rid of it like they did in the early '90s, when all these preemption measures came across all the states that didn't allow localities to do rent control and when New York started to liberalize its rules.","Ronald Kamdem","Helpful. Thanks so much.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","Great. We'll now take our next question from John Guinee from Stifel. Please go ahead.","John Guinee","Great. Just a couple of balance sheet questions. You sold out your unconsolidated JVs, but you still have $52.9 million of unconsolidated entities on the balance sheet. What does that refer to? And then second -- and if this information is somewhere else let me know, you $281 million of lease liabilities are those ground lease obligations?","Bob Garechana","Yes. It's Bob Garechana. I'll take the second question first and then talk about the investment on consolidated. The ground, the ROU or the liability and the ROU on the balance sheet are predominantly related to ground leases. So we have 14 ground leases, but there are also corporate leases etcetera. I think in the Q we probably do a very specific job or kind of outlining that they are predominantly ground leases.","On the investment and unconsolidated, there are some non -- there are some unconsolidated investments. There is a predominant -- $40 million of that $52-odd million is related to a unconsolidated condo kind of joint investment structure related to one asset that we own that is there as well as our private equity technology investments that we disclosed previously and that makes up the balance of that $52 million. But there are no true operating assets that are unconsolidated anymore post the sale of the two that we mentioned in the release this quarter.","John Guinee","Okay. And then are you also -- are you providing any information anymore on your consolidated joint venture? I think maybe you have a partner who has a 20% interest in that?","Mark Parrell","Well that -- those were the two that were sold this quarter. So that's gone away.","Bob Garechana","Those are the unconsolidated. So the other piece we have is -- which I think is also in the Q there some, we do have some consolidated ventures that have minority interest in them. There is, I think, 17-odd properties or so that have limited partnerships that we refer to as group B stuff. There is another asset that is in the D.C. market that is -- got a 25% minority interest. There is some disclosure in the Q and in the K related to that.","John Guinee","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Rich Anderson from SMBC. Please go ahead.","Rich Anderson","Hey, thanks. Good morning. As part of the education process with regard to New York rent control, the ability for existing stabilized units to graduate to market and if that -- is that perhaps like a -- sort of an unintended impact to all this? And could that actually help you again given that you have a lot of market rate in New York?","Mark Parrell","I may not have followed your question exactly. Is it that we need to educate policymakers or continue the conversation about the conversion in market rate not that...","Rich Anderson","Yes I'm sorry will that process be impacted by all this in a way that it's not understood quite yet?","Mark Parrell","Yes. I think there are probably a significant number and in the prior question on this I probably hit on it. There's a significant things we don't understand and unintended consequences the policymakers have triggered. So they're going to -- they have to figure some of those things out. I think, again, they have created disincentives to certain types of conduct like investing in some of this post-World War II product that is I think the backbone of New York's workforce housing supply.","So I think there is this conversion part they may not fully understand and they just may be very happy not to have those rental rates go up. But they've also done is discourage people from putting money into those deals.","Rich Anderson","Right","Mark Parrell","So that's going to have that impact on deterioration. So there's probably more to come here I would think over time in terms of once they start to see this negative impact hopefully the policymakers react to that and change some of the rules.","Rich Anderson","And how would you compare and contrast what's going on in New York with what may or may not happen again in California Costa-Hawkins part 2? I mean would you say that that's a little bit more of a fluid situation from your perspective, just curious how you're approaching that.","Mark Parrell","Yes. Thanks, Rich. I think the good news in California is that the dialogue is much more public. So the activists of the industry have a seat at the table they're talking to policymakers there's a lot of back-and-forth. We all know about the Assembly Bill AB-1482 that has cleared the assembly. And once the senate comes back from recess in a couple of weeks will be discussed there and we think that that is again not the right direction to go but at least we are involved in the conversation again as our activists in the public in general.","What happened in New York seemed to happen in dark of night. And I think it's going to have a lot more unintended consequence because it wasn't carefully vetted and thought through. And so I can't speculate as to how California will end up, but the quality of the conversation so far to us seems pretty good.","Rich Anderson","Okay. Last question. You mentioned dense suburbs and looking in that direction. Do you feel like there's a lot of talk about how the suburbs have outperformed urban core up to this point. Maybe you don't see it that way but a lot of people have said that. Do you feel like EQR has left some money at least temporarily on the table by virtue of the fact that you have this sort of urban-centric model?","Mark Parrell","Well, coming out of the Great Recession we're leaders with the urban portfolio. The demand we see and the resiliency of that demand we think what happened in the suburbs and the positives was mostly about just the dearth of supply. And when you do see supply and Michael Manelis has spoken to this and for example the San Fernando Valley, not a lot of important drivers there. Now we've got a bunch of supply and we're having a tough time at it. Whenever we see supply fall on to a suburban submarket, we see a lot more dire consequences where these urban submarkets just work through it because the more that's built in these urban submarkets the more appealing those areas become. And so they draw in even more people and it serve this virtuous circle and that would hurt us for a while in our numbers.","In the long run, we're in a lot of these properties at a very low basis on a relative scale compared to what people bill to, and it's a \u2013 we feel like in the long run our NAV growth and our IRR and our FFO growth will be better. So I think our emphasis on the dense suburbs is just more a bit of a slight shift. I mean, we're looking for the same kinds of customers so the guys we usually use the folks that usually are in our units in D.C have $120,000 household income numbers per year and the folks in Rockville they average about $110,000. These are the exact same customers they just drive to work, because of the nature of that location as opposed to take transit. So we want to find more people like that Rich. We think those areas are good investments. But just to be in far suburbs hoping there will be no supply, the minute there is some supply your product is obsolete and you struggle for a long time.","Rich Anderson","Okay. Great color. Thanks very much.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","All right. We'll now take question from Hardik Goel from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.","Hardik Goel","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Not to beat the dead horse, but this New York regulation theme that I think I understand the moving pieces please correct me, if I'm mistaken. Of the assets that are currently stabilized, can you tell us how many of those are actually under the 421a development plan and will at some point become market-rate units? And maybe a little bit on the cadence of when you would expect to see them become market-rate units since I know the structure is going to be quite different.","Mark Parrell","Yeah. I think it's effectively all of them. Thank you for that question. And it's \u2013 one way to think about this is from now till 2028, so it's a long period of time somewhere between 150 and 300 units a year and that's because it's chunky, because it's properties. So we have a property that in the last few weeks moved into this category. We leave the rent-stabilized world and enter the market-rate world. There are transitional rules, it doesn't all happen in a day in terms of the change in our ability to grow revenue at that property, but it happens. And so I think that's \u2013 again a built-in advantage of the kind of owning the kind of assets that we own in these markets that these sort of properties are in the market that's going to have even less supply, we're going to have more market-rate units created with no incremental developmental risk every year for the next nine or so years.","Hardik Goel","Got it. Thank you. That's really helpful.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","All right. We'll take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hey, good morning. Good morning in Chicago. Just two questions, first just continuing on the 421a theme, what are your thoughts on keeping \u2013 for a while you guys have been selling your 421a especially to avoid the increased real estate taxes as abatement burns off. And saw on a local publication you guys are marketing Ten23 which I think is a 421a. But what are your thoughts on retaining the remaining 421a assets and accept the higher real estate burn-off pressure on OpEx for the advantage of owning those market-rate units longer term? Which Mark I agree with you they're going to be vastly more valuable given that housing stock in New York is going to go down and those units are going to be more in demand. So what are your thoughts on keeping remaining 421a versus this selling that you've been doing?","Mark Parrell","Yeah. Thanks for that question, Alex. So I'm not going to comment on any specific asset. But I think you'll see us continue to sell a few of these 421a assets that have just begun their burn-off period. That are 6, 8, 10 years from entering and sometimes even longer. It isn't always true that the end of the tax abatement period is the end of the affordable housing period. So that's an important thing to keep in mind. For us everything, I've told you is the case, but assets we've sold lately some of them at the abatement end and their requirements to see affordable go another 10 years or more.","So we are going to be thoughtful about this. We have assets where we think cash flow growth over the next 6 to 10 years is almost certainly negative. It's going to be very hard for us to hang on to those assets taking a 10-plus year's from now there's a payday. But asset that are anywhere near their expiry date I agree with you those assets have probably a special and different value, and those are probably assets we're even more interested in holding onto than we have been before.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And have you guys \u2013 I know, it's early on, but given that asset values are going to be negatively impacted by the regulated units presumably your tax assessment pushback is going to grow. Do you see this as a potential significant savings of reduced real-estate taxes because of the value of the buildings has gone down?","Mark Parrell","Yeah. Well, I'm not sure the values of the buildings are going down or not. Like I said earlier, we're just not sure about that. But we intend to be more aggressive. And absolutely you show your income and expenses for the accessory have these discussions Michael is a pro at this. He has a team that works with the investment group that does this for us and we're all over it. So you can be assured that we'll be on top of any appeal opportunities this presents.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then just finally, bigger picture on the back half of this year, it almost sounded like when you're talking about more supply coming in Boston the negative headwinds on lower New York revenue growth and it sounded like there were few other markets in there which may have some supply. It sounds like there is some increasing pressure in the back half yet your guidance increase obviously suggests that things are pretty healthy. So, did I mishear or are there few markets that are going to be some headwinds in the second half of this year?","Michael Manelis","No, I think that's absolutely correct. I mean I'll just point L.A. L.A. is a very pronounced back-half loaded on the delivery side. But I think what you've got to remember as that pressure starts to come in towards the later part of Q3 and Q4, the volume of transactions less the impact on the full year revenue numbers is less because you're only being impacted for that stub period for the balance of the year.","But supply definitely in several of the markets is back-half loaded and we are just going to see if demand stays strong, it's going to be absorbed and we'll be just fine and if demand softens a little bit, it's just going to basically play into our next year's forecast and what's going to happen to our embedded growth next year.","Mark Parrell","Yes. That the important point the embedded growth as Michael and I have been talking over the last few weeks. We're going to roll into 2020 and we are not given guidance on the call, but it is important because your question is forward-looking. We're going to have much better embedded growth likely going into next year, but tougher occupancy comps.","Some of the supply pictures for some of these markets like New York and L.A. will be better in 2020 that it is even in 2019 and a lot of the others will be about constant. So, we feel terrific about the back half of the year, the usual seasonal variability is going to occur. But there isn't some like particular risk that's coming in. I mean you're going to have -- we could easily end up at the top end of the range if occupancy just doesn't moderate and that's happened as recently as last year.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. Thank you.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","All right. We'll now take our last question from Nicholas Joseph from Citi.","Michael Bilerman","Hey, Mark, it's Michael Bilerman here with Nick. I recognize John was -- he was asking about the operating income relative to New York and whether there was a modest net positives negatives or even you sort of came out and said it is probably even to modest net positive.","So, I guess I step back from that. If that's the case why are you spending so much time, money, and effort in fighting all these regulations? Is it more altruistic about the impact it could have to housing in your core markets? I am just trying to put those two things together?","Mark Parrell","We are certainly charitable folks here at Equity Residential, but I'm not sure we are motivated in or act with politicians through altruism. I think we don't know what they'll do and what they won't do. And so when we enter into these conversations I think on our own behalf and on behalf of what we think the greater good, we want these cities to thrive.","We think this policy even though it didn't hurt us is bad for the city as a whole. And in the long run as citizens of New York City because we're enormous investors in that market and we have employees that live in that market and residents we think good policy is better for us.","So, listen they could easily do some things that would be bad for us and we just need to stay in front of them and keep that education process going. So, I guess for us having more political interaction is probably the way it's going to be from now on at least until all this pressure kind of moderates across the country.","Michael Bilerman","So, you're saying in the long-term potential detrimental effect to the city in terms of rent control and what that may do in terms of people wanting to live here and do things that ultimately will drive and thrive for people that are multifamily assets and if that is going to disrepair, it has impact on the quality of life and the quality of the city and so even though it may not have a direct -- a large negative impact to your values or income, you -- rather the city being more prosperous?","Mark Parrell","Yes. And I think just as citizens we should help that. These big great cities like New York and San Francisco are creating all these great jobs. They don't places for people to live. And so you are unable -- I mean a lot of the job growth that may be slowing in places like San Francisco is just because no one else to employ they have nowhere to live. So, I mean there's a lot of studies that GDP growth in United States and average earnings per family would all be higher if we are able to house people more effectively in all these cities. So, I think you've hit it precisely.","Michael Bilerman","Thank you.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Mark Parrell. Please go ahead.","Mark Parrell","Well, thank you all for your time on the call. Hope everyone has a safe summer and we'll see everyone around the conference circuit in September."],"8660":["Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) Q2 2012 Earnings Call July 26, 2012 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Marty McKenna - Spokeman","David J.

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded today, July 26, 2012. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Marty McKenna. Please go ahead, sir.","Marty McKenna","Thanks, George, good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's Second Quarter 2012 Results.","Our featured speakers today are David Neithercut, our President and CEO; Fred Tuomi, our EVP of Property Management; And Mark Parrell, our Chief Financial Officer. David Santee, our EVP of Property Operations, is also here with us for the Q&A.","Let me remind you that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Law. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain to economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.","And now I'll turn the call over to David Neithercut.","David J. Neithercut","Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everyone. We're very pleased to report what has not been a terribly well-kept secret, and that is that the operating fundamentals in the multifamily space continue to be very strong. And based on the activity we're seeing today across our portfolio, we see no reason why strong fundamentals shouldn't continue for quite a while.","As reported in our earnings release and supplemental last night, we delivered second quarter results, which came in very much in line with our expectations and which produced results for the first half of the year of 5.5% same-store revenue growth and 7.5% same-store NOI growth, numbers that are right on top of the midpoint of the full year guidance that we gave in February for both of these metrics. So all in all, the year is shaping up pretty much as we have forecasted, and Fred's going to take a minute now to share a bit about what we're seeing as we begin to wrap up our primary leasing season.","Frederick C. Tuomi","All right. Thank you. As David mentioned, we are very pleased with the first half of the year, and we're confident that the full year 2012 revenue growth will be very close to the midpoint of our original guidance, which was 5.5%. So far, the peak leasing season has shown very strong demand, allowing us to build occupancy and grow rents across all of our markets. The fundamentals of our business are solid, and the outlook for the future remains very positive. And I'll now give you a quick update about each of the drivers of our revenue.","First is turnover. As we continue to grow base rents through this cycle, an increase in turnover is expected and especially from those moving out due to rent increases. However, we're still able to offset this turnover by refilling vacant units with qualified residents at higher base rents. The markets with the greatest increase in turnovers still includes San Francisco and Boston where we have had very strong rent growth, and not surprisingly, the greatest level of move-outs due to rent increases.","Denver is another market where we have seen a significant increase in turnover lately. Denver is interesting in that it recovered earlier than most markets and has seen over 2, or really 2.5, consecutive years of very strong rent growth, and its single-family market is very healthy. So Denver may actually be an indication of other markets in the very near future. So Denver, we're now seeing more price resistance on renewals and coupled with an increase in home buying. Now the good news is we're refilling these move-outs very quickly at current base rents. And today, Denver is 96.2% occupied, the highest occupancy in several years, and 6.1% left to lease, the lowest level of left to lease in several years, while still growing base rents at a nice 10%. So clearly, this is an example where there's ample demand in Denver to refill vacancies due to rent increases and home purchasing at the current high base rents.","At the entire same-store portfolio, move outs due to rent increases grew 50 basis points in the second quarter to 14.7% of move-outs. And notably sequentially, it actually declined from first quarter by 10 basis points. Move-outs due to home buying again picked up slightly to 12.9% for the quarter which is still well below past normal levels. So for the full year 2012, we now expect same-store turnover to finish about 200 basis points over 2011, which should be around 59.5%.","Next is our occupancy. At the end of Q2, our year-to-date average occupancy is 95.1%. And this compares to 95.2% for the same period year to date in 2011. We've had very strong occupancy gains across all markets over the past 90 days, which spans the end of the quarter, reaching to 96% occupancy as of today with a very healthy 7% left to lease. For the full year 2012, we still expect occupancy to be 95.2%.","Next takes us to base rents. Due to higher turnover and vacancy experienced in the first quarter, we held base rents basically steady through April and began pushing rates again in May as the leasing season demand kicked in and occupancy grew. So as of this week, this week, base rents are up 7.5% since January 1 of this year, and they're up 4.2% year-over-year compared to the same week in 2011. And by the way, that happened to have been the peak pricing week that we experienced in 2011. As expected, the year-over-year growth in base rents has moderated since Q1 due to tougher comp periods. We still expect base rents to average 5.5% over 2011 levels over the entire year.","Our strongest base rent growth continues to come from the Northwest. And again, as of this week, San Francisco is up 16% year to date, meaning from January, and 11% versus the same week last year, year-over-year. Denver is up 12% year-to-date and 10% year-over-year. And Seattle is up 10% year-to-date, 5% year-over-year, with the CBD and Eastside submarkets significantly higher than that. The Southwest continues to lag. However, Los Angeles and Orange County are finally improving both in occupancy and rent growth.","Now regarding new residents' willingness and ability to pay these higher rent levels, we experienced very strong leasing velocity as base rents began to accelerate late May and into June, indicating a willing acceptance of these new pricing levels, and many of which now are above peak levels of mid-2008. The average rent as a percent of income remains steady at 17.2%, and this, I think, still remains a very healthy level. So all income and credit quality indicators are keeping pace with the rents of our portfolio.","Finally, renewals. Renewals remain strong and in line with current base levels -- base rent levels. Recent achieved renewals have been April, 6.9%; May, 7.0%; June, 6.4%; July, 5.8%. Because we price most renewals at market levels, renewal increases will track closely to the year-over-year base rent growth. This means renewal increase percentages will also moderate as we enter tougher comp periods but still average around 5.5% for the full year.","So overall, the fundamentals remain solid and right in line with our original expectations of a narrow range around the midpoint of our guidance of 5.5% total revenue growth for the full year of 2012. David?","David J. Neithercut","Thanks, Fred. So as noted by Fred, the strong performance we're delivering is really the result of continued demand across our core markets today. And despite continued concerns about job growth, I can tell you that we're not seeing any reduction in demand for these apartment units. We're certainly seeing, as Fred noted, more people moving out today because they're unable to afford higher rents, but at the same time, seeing no slowdown in new prospects able to pay market rents and willing to take immediate occupancy. That said, longer-term, we're certainly mindful that rents could be rising faster than incomes, particularly given the level of high unemployment in the domestic economy today. But we remind you that unemployment rate of the college-educated is only 4%. And as a Fred noted, our average rent to household income ratio is currently only 17%. So we think we have plenty of runway yet on this particular metric. We're also mindful about the risks of new supply to longer-term performance. And while starts will certainly be up this year and next, the numbers seem to be bigger when looked at on a percentage basis, than they really are when looked at on an absolute basis.","We've done a lot of work looking at new supply, not on the top line national numbers, of course, but by focusing on our specific submarkets within our core markets across the country and by looking at it on an absolute basis. And what we've done is by starting with our teams across the field in these markets and others' forecast for actual deliveries over the next 3 years, focusing on projects that are actually under construction today. And we compare that to new supply -- that new supply to the expected marginal rental demand in those markets. And we get there by looking at projected household growth in these markets and applying it against that a conservative multifamily capture rate of about 20%. And that helps us come up with an estimate for incremental future demand.","And in general, when we compare future deliveries to that expected incremental demand, we see markets able to absorb this new supply with no long-term disruption to the marketplace. Now that's not to say that if we operate an asset near a new delivery that we won't feel the impact of that new supply. But we think that absorption will be quick, and overall, our markets will remain healthy, allowing for continued strong growth in rental rates.","Turning now to our transaction activities. In the first half of the year, we've acquired 5 existing assets for $670 million. And much of that activity occurred in the second quarter with 2 very large acquisitions for $511 million. The largest of these 2 acquisitions was the Beatrice, which was pictured on the front of last night's earnings release. This represents 301 units on 6th Avenue in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. The project was built in 2010. And what we acquired was the top 30 floors of a 54-floor high rise. We acquired that in a condo structure, and the other condo user, representing floors 1 through 23, is a very popular hotel named Kimpton hotel named the Eventi. We acquired our 301 units for $280 million, which represents a purchase price of $930,000 a unit and $1,340 per square foot. And that asset was acquired at a 4.76% cap rate. Rents in the building currently average about $7.25 per square foot, and this is really truly an exceptional asset with great location and unparalleled views.","This quarter, we also acquired 510 units in Chevy Chase, Maryland, in an asset built in 1996. This was acquired for $231 million or $450,000 a door at a cap rate of 5.2%. During the quarter, we sold 9 assets for $130 million totaling 1,662 units. We sold 2 assets in Phoenix, 2 in Atlanta, 1 in Orlando. And we also sold a portfolio of 4 properties in various suburban Boston markets, which were encumbered by highly structured debt from the Massachusetts Housing Finance Authority.","We've kept our transactional guidance for the year at $1.25 billion of acquisitions and $1.25 billion of dispositions. Now despite a competitive marketplace, we're about halfway towards that acquisition goal. Clearly though, with respect to dispositions, we have some ground to cover. But we sold $385 million of product year to date. We have another $320 million of product under contract and several hundred million more in various stages of marketing.","We'll have no issue meeting our disposition guidance if we can find suitable reinvestment opportunities because the demand for the assets we would sell to fund reinvestment into core assets remains very, very strong. That's the good news. The bad news is that this demand for these noncore assets is a function of how competitive it is to acquire the core assets, say, that we'd like to buy because there remains a great deal of capital chasing very few core deals in our markets today, which is creating a very competitive acquisition environment.","Development side of our business, we continue to look for new opportunities. Yet we've only acquired 2 land parcels this year, both in the first quarter that were each fully described on our April call. So while we did not acquire any new land sites last quarter, we are moving towards closing on 3 sites this quarter, 1 in Southern California and 2 in Seattle. And we have several additional sites that could close yet this year.","For the full year, we've reduced our expected starts to about $525 million. This is down about $225 million from expectations at the beginning of the year because we've had 2 potential starts that will not likely go forward this year because we've created much of the expected value in getting these sites fully entitled and we might simply monetize that value without taking any additional risks.","Our core underwriting of our development deals, those both underway and proposed, suggest yields on cost in the high 5s and low 6s on current rents and the mid-7s on stabilized rents.","So I'll turn the call over to Mark.","Mark J. Parrell","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call.","This morning, I'm going to cover 2 topics. I'm going to give you some detail on our same-store operating expenses, and I'm going to explain the changes to our full year normalized FFO guidance.","So first on the operating expense side. Year to date, same-store operating expenses are up about 1.9%, which is right about in the middle of our 1.5% to 2.5% guidance range that we put out in February. We still expect expenses to grow at about a 2% rate, so we have not changed our same-store expense range. And this is just a terrific number on its own, but its especially impressive on top of the modest 0.6% or 60 basis point increase in same-store expenses we had in 2011. However, we have had some additional pressure on the real estate tax side since we've set guidance in February, which has been offset by utility and property management cost savings. And I do want to give you a little color on those 3 important line items.","First on the real estate tax side, we have said for some time that we expect property taxes to rise more sharply as assessors recognize the recent improvements in apartment values, and that time has certainly come. We originally anticipated our property taxes to be up about 4.5% this year. We have seen rates and values come in higher than expected in some markets. And as a result, we now expect our property tax expense to be up about 5.5% for the full year. We have, however, benefited on the utility side to offset some of that property tax increase. We now see lower utility costs, and we see them as flat or slightly negative year-over-year, and that compares to the up 1.5% to up 2.5% thought we had on utilities back in February. This year, we decided not to hedge our natural gas costs, and that certainly ended up being a good decision. And as a result, our energy costs, especially these natural gas costs, should be modestly lower than we thought back in February. But we do continue to feel some upward pressure on water and sewer costs.","Another favorable expense variance is the important property management expense line item. And there, we continue to benefit from our efforts to centralize bookkeeping and our other property accounting functions. So when you put all this in a blender, same-store expenses are well under control and about where we thought they would be back in February.","And also just a quick note on the changing makeup of our same-store expenses, property taxes are becoming a bigger slice of our expense pie. In 2009, property taxes were 27% of our operating costs. That now is 30% of our operating costs. And because the growth rate of taxes will be higher than that of our other expense line items, the share that real estate taxes take of our operating expenses will continue to grow.","I'm going to chat for a moment about our normalized FFO guidance. Our normalized FFO guidance range for the year is now $2.73 per share to $2.78 per share, meaning we've moved our midpoint up by about $0.03 per share. I'll quickly highlight the 3 major variances from what we thought back in February when we gave you our original guidance.","First off, we see property NOI, or net operating income, is about $0.01 higher than we thought in February. It's mostly due to lease-ups and other non-same-store activities. We see interest expense is $0.01 lower than we thought back in February, and that's mostly due to our application of the $150 million in Archstone-related termination fees to our revolver balance. We currently expect outstandings on the revolver to be $700 million at December 31, 2012, if we do not transact in the debt or equity markets. As always, we will be opportunistic in accessing the capital markets with an eye towards minimizing our long-term cost of capital.","Final reconciling item is the series end preferred redemption. On July 20, we called for redemption of the $150 million of this outstanding of our 6.48% Series N preferred shares. Our guidance assumes the funding of this preferred redemption using the line of credit. This will increase 2012 normalized FFO by about $0.01 per share. We will take a $5.1 million noncash charge in the third quarter for the write-off of the original issuance costs. This charge will run through EPS and FFO and will not run through normalized FFO.","And while we're on the topic of accounting, I want to provide a quick housekeeping note on the Archstone fees. While we have previously disclosed that we received $150 million in termination fees in connection with our pursuit of Archstone, all or part of the fees must be returned if we acquire all or substantially all of Archstone within a 30-day period. And that 30-day period applies to the $70 million we received from Lehman Brothers or a 120-day period, and that applies to the $80 million that we received from Barclays and Bank of America. And all those time periods are measured from the June 6, 2012 date, that Lehman acquired the Bank of America and Barclays interest in Archstone.","Because this condition was not satisfied by the end of the second quarter, meaning that we were not yet at the June, July 6 date that we would have fully earned the Lehman $70 million fee, the entire $150 million in termination fees were recorded as deferred revenue in our second quarter financial statements and placed in the other liability section of our balance sheet. And that's why you see the large increase in other liabilities. The time period for that first $70 million fee portion from Lehman Brothers has passed, and those funds will be recognized in our third quarter financials in interest and other income, and we will relieve our other liabilities down by $70 million. We will recognize the remaining $80 million fee from Barclays and Bank of America in the fourth quarter, assuming no transaction occurs. Neither of these fees will be included in normalized FFO.","I will now turn the call back over to George, the operator, for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citi.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just wanted to make sure I understood the point you were making on Denver and how that could be the model going forward. I think you were basically saying that even though you expect turnover due to home purchases and financial reasons and everything to keep moving up, that you're confident you can replace those tenants with rate increases. Is that the point you were making?","Frederick C. Tuomi","Yes, this is Fred. That's exactly the point we're making. Looking at the kind of metrics across our portfolio, Denver just kind of popped up. On one hand, it was worrisome in that the -- in its high turnover. It was growing. It was due to rent increases that are due to home purchasing. But then on the revenue side, it's one of the top performers there as well. So we have great rent growth but then also very strong leasing velocity through to this leasing season, high occupancy, low left to lease, and it just continues to grow. So it looks like even though that market has recovered, the single-family is healthy, people are buying homes, there's plenty of demand for our product from our profile, and they're ready, willing and able to lease apartments at the current rents, that continue to grow and refill those vacancies.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got you. Understood. And so I guess also as part of that, we should probably expect to see turnover keep rising in your markets. I mean, is that an expectation that we should have? Or is that just sort of you're saying we might see this in isolated cases in certain markets like Denver?","Frederick C. Tuomi","I think clearly this year, you're going to see turnover increases over last year. In the last couple of years, it's been kind of low. It will normalize, probably, I would say, probably after next year. But yes, turnover will continue to grow from increased rents and from home buying. And Denver just happens to be an example where we're seeing both at the same time. Other markets with big increases in turnover like San Francisco and Boston, we're not seeing home purchasing. They're too expensive or they're hard to get. And other markets where home buying is picking up, the rents are low and we're not having the increased pressure.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got you. All right. That's helpful. And just last question. You also made the point that your rent-to-income ratio is only 17%, so you're pretty confident you can keep raising rents. But I guess if you only have 17%, why would turnover trend up? I mean, I would think that if people are only paying 17% of the income out in the form of rent, that they would be more inclined to stay where they are and renew their lease. I don't know if there's a different dynamic going on there, but that would just be what I thought what happens.","Frederick C. Tuomi","Well, the situation on that, that 17% is the marginal resident. Those are the residents who have moved in. The actual residents who've been there for a few years, we don't have way of keeping up with their income after they moved in. So I think a lot of the turnover you're seeing now because of rents are being too expensive. One of them is just really just the reaction to 2 or 3 years in a row of big rent increases. Then the other is during the downturn, when rents were down 10%, 15%, 20%, a lot of people were able to afford a nicer apartment at the same rent. So as that rent recovers back to a normal basis, they either are going to choose to or not be able to pay that rent, and they will just go to a less costly housing alternative.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got you. So the 17% is the incremental renter, not the average renter?","Frederick C. Tuomi","Yes, it's not the entire install base, correct. Because, someone who's living there 5 years. We have their income as of 5 years ago. We don't have recertification of income each year.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","You guys were pretty clear about markets that you sort of find attractive for various reasons and markets that you're exiting like Chicago. Strategically, what are your thoughts on markets like Vegas and Phoenix in particular? Counter-intuitive markets that offer higher cap rates and potentially [ph] higher rent growth? Is it hard to get into those markets?","Frederick C. Tuomi","No. We've not been in Chicago for quite some time, and we've not been in Vegas for quite some time. But I think that you should continue to expect our investment activity to track very closely to what you've seen us do over the past half a dozen years. We think that focus has served us well and notwithstanding the fact that we may be getting better going-in cap rates in some of those markets today. We think those are more trading markets, and it's difficult for us to kind of play that game. We think our total return will be better achieved in the markets that we've been focused on.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","You guys mentioned the OP usage in the period. Is that just an aberration? Or is that something you think we're going to see more of in coming quarters?","Frederick C. Tuomi","Well, I guess it's in aberration because we haven't done it in quite some time. And frankly, I've been surprised about that. But this was just a situation with a family selling an asset that they had owned for many, many years for tax planning purposes. Taking OP units made sense for them. But I have expected for some time, and I have been wrong, frankly, in this expectation, that the OP units would be a security that we use in more acquisitions. But so far, I've been surprised that we haven't. But I would have an expectation, particularly in a rising tax rate environment, that we could see more OP unit issuances. And frankly, I've been surprised that we've seen so little thus far.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Yes. I was thinking in the context of, potentially a political change that, that would have some effect. David, just quickly, my last question, how was the residential [ph] performing in the last couple of quarters. I know we haven't focused on it much because the market's been strong. But how does the performance compare today versus, let's say, if we go back to 2007? What are the primary differences in how [indiscernible] is performing?","David S. Santee","This is David Santee. And the first obvious answer is, I mean, it works the same day in and day out, whether it's an up market or a down market. I think it's more about what levers we decide to pull, how much we decide to intervene from a strategic position. We have executive level reviews, myself, Fred, a couple of other folks every other week. And that's where we kind of determine what levers we want to pull to achieve specific goals in specific markets. So I would say that historically, we have intervened more and being aggressive with the rate increases that LRO has put out. And I would say that at this stage of the game, we're probably letting LRO run more independently and letting it address the various markets.","Operator","And our next question comes from Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","You made a previous comment on turnover, moving up, et cetera. Can you get into the lower foot traffic environment going forward? Does that sort of force you to reign back on the rental rate increases?","David S. Santee","Well, I guess what I would tell you is, is that foot traffic has remained fairly constant. It was up 5% in Q1. Again, it was up 5% in Q2 over last year. The difference is really the outcome of that traffic, whereas in Q2, we saw a result of 7% more applicants. And then those 7% more applicants turned into 9% more move-ins. So that's how the numbers work for Q2.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","But I guess in terms of the sort of overall operating strategy, I mean, normally apartment companies, once you start getting into the fall or trying to hit the fall with a higher level of occupancy, it starts reigning in rental rate increases anyway. Does this cause you to have to start that process a little other sooner than you otherwise would have?","David S. Santee","Well, I would say that there's just a natural seasonality in our business. A large percentage of our leases don't make it to term, people get transferred, what have you. And when that happens in Q4, so to speak, you're throwing unexpected supply into the market. And your less sophisticated operators, people that don't have LRO, smaller operators, they're just going to kind of turn to the concession or drop rate because perhaps their ownership structure just requires a higher occupancy, which really just puts a whole pressure on the market. And so I would say that every year, since we've been operating LRO, we've seen that seasonality and that seasonal softness, and so it's really just a matter of to what degree that impacts our business in Q4. Obviously, we want to be in a position, especially in the northern markets, Boston, New York, where people just don't choose to move. People that are moving in those markets in Q4, Q1. Those are people that have to move for some reason or another.","David J. Neithercut","I guess the only thing that I would add to that, Rob, is the fact that notwithstanding this increase in turnover, our net exposure, our left to lease is still reasonable at this point in the season.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then, David, given your comments on the difficulty in the acquisition market and the ability to still sell significant amount of assets, I mean, how willing are you to see the spread in terms of gross dollar valuation -- dispositions and acquisitions, widen? Given the fact that you may sell some development sites and you're not spending as much on development these days, is there a tolerance to do $1.5 billion of dispositions but not do any more acquisitions and just take the dilution on the near term on that?","David J. Neithercut","No, Rob. I mean, I guess what we look at, and we talked about it in our weekly investment committee meeting, is the trades that we're making between selling certain assets and having the opportunity to reinvest that capital into other assets. So there's no magic in our minds as to what that going-in delta might be, but rather, what's the long-term total return and how do we feel about selling certain assets and rotating that capital into other assets. I tell you, as we look at the assets we're selling today and look at what the prices per door are today and what those yields are, we don't believe we're in a position where we're terribly concerned about those values going forward. So selling those assets today at a high 5 and low 6 and putting the money in the bank and taking that dilution doesn't make that much sense because at an absolute dollar basis, absolute price per pound basis, we think that those values are solid, and we can always sell the asset next year if it takes until then to find an appropriate reinvestment opportunity.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Bragg with Zelman & Associates.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Can you talk about the trends on new move-ins during the course of the quarter and in July?","Mark J. Parrell","Yes. David, what do you exactly mean by new move-ins? You're talking about the rates?","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Yes. So you're percentage gains on new move-ins over the prior lease on the same unit so that we can compare those to renewal gains?","Mark J. Parrell","Okay. Like the new lease replacement rent? Yes, basically, the way we look at that is the most important thing to look at is what are your base rents doing? What are you getting on new people coming in? And like I mentioned, we're still going to average 5.5% for the year. We are at 6.5% for Q1 and about 4% in Q2, and we are at 4.2% today, and which matches up with the peak of last year. And because we price pretty much at the market, that's really what we look for. So we're at 5.5% for the year, 6.5% first half, 4% right now, and that might grow up a little bit through the end of third quarter. So that's really what you're going to see it grow to. That actual statistic, it moves around a lot. We've talked about that before. There's a lot of noise in that actual measurement. So really, we like to look at just what are the base rents doing, and you're going to -- right now, we're at the 4% range.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Okay. So that 4% is specific to July?","Mark J. Parrell","That's 4.2% right now, this week. It was 4% for the quarter. And I think Q2, we're at 4.2% today. So basically, in theory, if someone moved in exactly last year and paid market rent and they moved in, they moved out and somebody moves in, that same apartment, identical apartment, at the same point now a year later, you're going to see a gain of 4.2%. But noise in that number comes if they're different units, different unit types, different lease terms, different amenities on the units. There's lots of other noises in that statistic.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Right. Understood. Just trying to think about your same-store revenue growth guidance range for the year. It's very precise. So I want to make sure that we understand some of the components of that. You touched on many of them. But I was surprised that you expect occupancy to dip back down to only average 95.2% over the course of the year. Is that accurate? Or do you expect a big dropoff in the fourth quarter?","Mark J. Parrell","Well, we expect some dropoff in the fourth quarter. As David just mentioned, there's definite seasonality to this business. Right now in the moment, in this leasing season, things are a little bit hotter than we kind of expected, but it's not over yet. So we're, like I said, we're 96% right now, 7% forward exposure, very healthy numbers. So could that number be higher? Yes, it could, it could be. But we're not going to let it get too high because we're going to -- our bias -- and our company is biased towards rate versus occupancy. So we're not going to -- you're not going to see us kind of post these big, giant occupancy numbers over a long period of time. So could it be more than 95.2% for the year? Yes. Will it be significantly more? No because we\u2019re going to crank up rates to manage it.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Right. Okay. And then on leases expiring in September, October, what are the renewal increases that you're asking for?","Frederick C. Tuomi","Okay. For, let's see, August, we ask 6.8, got a 5.2; September, we asked a 7, and we'll probably achieve north of 5. In October, it's really kind of early to talk about October, but we're going to probably quote in the high 6s and probably get in the low 5s, I would say. So too early for that. Just a few have been put out so far.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Okay. One final question. David, you mentioned an interest in analysis or study in your opening comments. And could you just talk about how the results of that compared to your investment decisions? For example, you're selling assets in Orlando and Phoenix, but those happen to have very strong job growth in very little multifamily permitting activity right now. I'd have to imagine that they stack up very favorably as compared to your markets as a whole.","David J. Neithercut","Yes. But that's also -- those are very easy markets in which to start new product. And they're also marked, so I think there are far more risks to single-family home, right? So we've not really done much of that work on those assets -- on those markets that -- more commodity-like markets, but the focus has been on the high-barrier markets.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Okay. So it's a much longer-term perspective that you're taking than maybe a favorable relationship over the next couple of years?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I mean, we have a long-term bias for the higher-density, higher-barrier markets. But the analysis we've done here is just a 2- or 3-year analysis really focused on the starts that we know are the -- the developments that we know will actually take place.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jana Galan with Bank of America.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Thank you for the earlier remarks on how your thinking about future new supply and absorption. I was wondering if you could comment on the D.C. market in particular and if the spring, summer leasing was better or worse than you had actually budgeted or expected?","Frederick C. Tuomi","Yes, Jana, this is Fred, Fred Tuomi. D.C., kind of as reported in the first quarter, continues to surprise us on the upside. I mean, we had lower expectations. We thought things would be moderating consistently and maybe a little bit faster by this point of the year. And good news is, it's not. I mean, we're 96.8% occupied in D.C. today, 8% left to lease. Rents are up from the beginning of the year over 10%. And they're about 4% year-over-year right now, and renewal is at 4.5%. So we're in a very healthy state right now in D.C., and we kind of cover all the good submarkets there. Now I'm still concerned because of 2 things. One is just the job picture there. In the moment, the jobs are great. I mean, we still have job growth last year and this year. Unemployment is at 5.3%. That tells you something about the federal government. They're going to take care of themselves. So it's looking very good. Demand is high. Labor market is still growing, although there's still a lot of uncertainty and anxiety about what's coming next. But that shoe has not started to fall yet. So in -- well, with respect to supply that we kind of worry about it. We know it. So there's significant supply coming in D.C. Everybody knows that, 8,000 units this year, 10,000 in 2013. And then the pipeline shows, if everything gets delivered, which it won't, you could have about another 10,000 coming in, in 2014. And most of that is clustered in the good areas, Mt. Vernon Triangle, NoMa, Silver Spring, RBC Corridor [ph], Carlyle, et cetera. Very competitive with our portfolio. So today, what we're seeing, which is encouraging on this, the leading edge of the supply wave is coming at us right there in the district. We've got several high-profile lease-ups, but they're doing extremely well. Those lease-ups in the Mt. Vernon, NoMa markets are doing 40 units a month, each, of absorption. That's very strong. So the absorption -- D.C. has always proven to be able to absorb a lot of units quickly. So if we don't see a big reduction in government employment, a big reduction in defense employment, I think we could moderate through these next couple of years with very little disruption and through strong absorption. But time will tell. So far so good, I would say.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I want to ask a little bit about the 14.7% of move-outs because of rents being too high. It seems -- it occurs to me that, that's a really big number. And then -- and so isn't that so kind of beginning, not the end, but at least some kind of deceleration in rent growth? I mean, that has to happen first. I mean, that's the kind of way we're looking at it. And then you tack on 13% of home buying as just being the turnover, so those are your 2 kind of kryptonites, right? So like should we -- is it fair to say you're taking your foot off the gas a little bit, David, by not starting those 2 developments because of these 2 factors?","David J. Neithercut","That's not what's driven this development decision, whatsoever, Rich. But I guess I'll just kind of go back to Fred's comments about Denver. Yes, we have seen an increase in people moving out because of pricing and it's higher than it's been at a historical context, but it's not a crazy number though. And we've noted we're seeing some people move out, an increase and people buying single-family homes. And as a percentage, that might be high, but it's still low in historical context. And then just again, using Denver as that example, notwithstanding increases in both of those areas, we see Denver at the highest occupancy that we've seen in last several years and the lowest left to lease in the last several years. So I guess what we're sort of suggesting to you is we think that the incremental demand is there, that these markets can absorb this activity.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Right. But how long can that shell gain last, right? I mean, you are, in fact, growing successfully, but I mean, how long would this typically go on? There is this demand to stop up of all these people moving out because the rent is too high.","Frederick C. Tuomi","Rich, this is Fred. A #1 reason for move out is people's job situation changes, job change, job transfer. And that continues to be #1.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And how big is that?","Frederick C. Tuomi","And that's in the 20 -- 20 range.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And then you have -- the top 3 have always been job change or job transfer, home purchasing, rent increase. And then it drops off significantly from that from a myriad of other reasons, okay? So depending on where you are in the cycle, we're going to be jockeying for position for what's going to be #2 and #3 because #1 is always going to be job change and job transfer. It used to be home purchasing was up in the 20 range. Now it's down in the 12, 13 range. So naturally, it's going to be the rent increases is going to be floated up to #2. So really, it's kind of a mix of what people give us as a reason of moving. And don't forget, we had a lot of people move in to apartments that got really good rates during the downturn, and now they're going to reach a point where they're going to think you know what, I think I'll just do something different. So I think it's a healthy sign of the market that people are moving out because of rent increases. If it ever slows down and our absorption slows and leasing velocity slows, then we'll back off, and you'll see that number kind of shift back. And the other thing we look at is the fact that people are moving out consistently because of job opportunities. That's a good sign of our resident base, that they're employed, they're active and they have job opportunities.","David S. Santee","Just a little color on -- all of these are not due to rent increases. I mean, some of this is a result of life changes with people. If you remember, we talked about we only measure people's income when they move in. So I mean, when we see this activity spike in a market, most of you know we go right down to the transaction level, and we can see that, yes, someone did get an increase, but it was a 2% increase. But their life circumstances just changed and perhaps they had -- got a new job in the last 2 years that doesn't pay as much. So this isn't all about rent increases. It's probably 50-50 about changes in their life circumstances.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then just one last question for David or anybody. Renting single family, that's kind of become in vogue with a lot of participants looking to get involved in that opportunity. How do you see that as a trend for opportunity for EQR? Or is it kind of a non-issue at this point?","David J. Neithercut","Embedded in that question, perhaps, is 2 separate questions. One is what kind of threat do we see these single-family homes being acquired by investors and being offered for rental? What kind of threat do we see those -- that to our business? And we don't see it as a terribly big threat. We think that those units are occupied by people who have already elected to make that sort of lifestyle change. And most likely, those homes are now be rented by people who have been dispossessed, perhaps, of the home that they had previously owned. And then with respect to any involvement or participation we might have or interest we might have in being that owner, we work very hard to really narrow our focus and operate very efficiently by sort of gaining size and scale in smaller footprints. And I think that it's going to be a challenge for these investors to operate these properties the way that they had hoped, and I would not expect us to have any interest in being involved in purchase and ownership of single-family homes for rental.","Frederick C. Tuomi","Yes, this is Fred. I'll add that just from a feedback from our site people, it's not even in our radar. You never hear about it. And in the markets where you think you would like Orlando, Atlanta, Phoenix, Inland Empire, San Fernando Valley area, perhaps. If it comes up in conversations at all, it would only be 3 bedrooms. That segment that is a very small piece of our unit base.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Schaffer with Sandler O'Neill.","Andrew Schaffer","I have 2 questions. First, in regards to Beatrice acquisition, I was wondering how much the going cap rate is affected by the 421a tax abatement?","David J. Neithercut","The 4.7% -- 6% or so cap rate is impacted by that. I would tell you that -- and our guys would suggest to you that if that property did not have that tax abatement, that would easily sell with a 3-handle.","Andrew Schaffer","Okay. And then secondly, going forward, are you looking to do additional deals with the home builders or hotels? And do you see value in that structure? Or is it just another way for you guys to mitigate your risk?","David J. Neithercut","We didn't build this deal with this hotel operator. It was built by a third party and built with it -- with the 2 different uses themselves. And we were willing to acquire the apartments with the hotel below because we do have experience operating a mixed-use structure like that. The only deal that we have done -- well, I guess we've done 2, one in Jersey City in which we did a joint development venture with the K. Hovnanian company. And then most recently, we'll start construction soon on a property in Park Avenue South in New York with Toll. I think in very expensive product, mixed-use product, if we believe we can make a smart investment and lay some of that off to someone like we did with Toll or work in venture with Toll, I think that we'll be happy to do that. But you'd seen that in markets in which the cost for land is so expensive that hedging that risk, ensuring that risk is smart to do. I would think that there's some conversations, perhaps, about doing something similar in Boston today. So I think in those very high-density, very costly markets, you could see us do that kind of thing, Bob. And I would say, I mean, it's not a focus, but again, if there is opportunities to build the right product, the right market, and it makes sense to do so with a third party, we'd certainly consider it.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Andy McCulloch with Green Street Advisors.","Andrew McCulloch - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","A question -- on the 2 acquisitions, what are the unlevered IRRs?","David J. Neithercut","We have an unlevered IRR expectation on the Beatrice in the high 7s. I'll tell you, I would expect to achieve better than that just because that $1,340 per square foot for the units on such high levels of those floors with the views that they've got, retail condo product sells well in excess of that today. On a pure rental value, we've looked at it in the high 7s, but I think that we should exceed that. On the property we bought on Chevy Chase, we're in a low 9s. That is a property that we will do some significant investment into for some rehabs, and we'll get some benefit from that. So high 7s on the Beatrice, and the low 9s on the deal on Chevy Chase.","Andrew McCulloch - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","And then just generally on unlevered returns that you're targeting for your kind of core deals in the markets that you're going after, have those moved around all that much?","David J. Neithercut","No, no. We've continued to -- on most product -- be in that high 7 range, really, as a floor. Mostly -- frankly, it's been mostly 8s and above. And the Beatrice, I think, it has -- given the fact that it's a brand-new product, it had -- it would be high-floor product. But that was something that maybe got us a touch under 8 on an IRR basis. But generally, everything else has been plus 8%.","Andrew McCulloch - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","On Archstone, are there any blocks of assets that are being marketed?","David J. Neithercut","We've heard about assets for sale that Archstone has got out there. And perhaps -- but there may be more coming.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Philip Martin with Morningstar.","Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I'm interested in the change and the nature of the underlying credit and what the household makeup in your community is the last several years certainly given what's going on and has gone on in single-family housing and et cetera. I'm interested as to what this may mean for future CapEx gains. Are your tenants and households demanding something a bit different than they have historically because of the change in the household makeup within your communities?","David S. Santee","Well, I guess I would first start by saying that half of our apartments are really occupied by one person. So it's not like a lot of families are flocking to our communities. I mean, we -- our supply of 3 bedrooms are very minimal across the portfolio. And as we continue to shift to our core markets, the percentage of studios and smaller one-bedrooms really don't accommodate families. On the credit side, again, much of this could have to do with our portfolio shift. But we continue to see the percentage of people with credit scores above 720 increase each and every quarter. And then those folks below 500, that number is decreasing. So it's definitely a sign. It coincides with what we're saying in that we have good, qualified residents coming to backfill those that are moving out. They have higher incomes. They have higher credit scores. And that's the goal that we're trying to accomplish.","Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","So from a higher income profile, I'm assuming maybe a high -- an older tenant and obviously paying higher rents that may be competing more closely with single-family home ownership in the future. Would you expect to see your CapEx demands potentially go up if you're dealing with a tenant that's wanting more amenities in the unit or at the property, community level?","Mark J. Parrell","Your question has both sort of long-term and near-term aspects to it. But the near term aspects to it are we left our CapEx guidance alone on Page 22. And we expect to spend $1,225 a unit all-in, and we spent about $1,200 last year in that the same area. And certainly, these are higher-touch properties we're purchasing, and our residents have a very high expectation of us, consistent with their higher rent. But I'll also point out that a lot of these high rises operate very differently than our garden-style apartments in terms of the kind of capital we spend money on. And the rent ticket is just so much higher that CapEx as a percentage isn't necessarily going up.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Dave, could you give a little more color on the developments specifically which ones you guys have looked to cancel? And also just an update on what you guys expect to spend, total for the year on development given the land parcels that you mentioned?","David J. Neithercut","Well, the deals we have contemplated in starting this year that we do not expect now to start were a couple of land parcels in South Florida. Again, I think we've made considerable profit in the entitlement [ph] work that we've done down there. And rather than complete that, we decided we think we might just explore going and monetizing that value today. And what I talked about in starting $525 million of starts this year, but just in terms of land acquisitions this year, will be about $42 million -- incremental from this point forward.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Second of all, just going back to leasing, what's the average lease duration? Have you seen any change in that? As you're pushing the rent and that [ph] pricing is it still running at 12 months? Or have you seen kind of a pullback on that?","David S. Santee","Well, our typical lease term, probably 87% of our leases are 12-month leases. In New York, we have a larger percentage of 24-month leases as those are required by law. And then really all the rest are just a function of how LRO prices. I mean, there could be some days where a 10-month lease is less than a 12-month lease. But the bulk of our targeted leases are 12 months. As far as people staying with us, we continue -- even with the turnover, we continue to see our average length of stay increase. So in Q1, our average stay was 1.8 years. That's what it had been in the previous 2 or 3 quarters, I believe. And then in Q2, we saw that inch up to 1.9 years.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. Then the final question just in terms of as you're looking at underwriting today, obviously, you've captured quite a bit of the pent-up rent growth there just to get back to market. You expect rent growth to remain above average, I think, in your comments you put in the press release there. But when do you expect to start to see -- as growth rates slow over the next couple of years, when do you expect to start to see cap rates rise? Are there any markets today where you're seeing upward pressure on cap rates?","David J. Neithercut","I guess no. I think in our markets, we're either seeing, generally seeing, cap rates in our core markets really sort of stabilize. So we've not seen them continue to go down nor are we seeing them reverse. And I think what it sort of suggests then is we just think that absolute value continues to increase, that the absolute price per pound continues to increase.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So you're seeing more price per pound than underwriting on cash flow?","David J. Neithercut","Well, no. What I'm saying is that if cap rates are staying consistent and bottom lines continuing to grow, then valuation can continue to go up even though cap rates don't continue to compress. So even though cap rates have been fairly stable across our markets for the past 6 months, values have continued to increase because bottom lines have continued to increase.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So you haven't seen any changes in actual underwriting, the growth rates being underwritten are still the same?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I guess we continue to expect, in the next several years, better-than-trend bottom line growth, certainly top line growth. But in every pro forma, we'd expect to sort of trend -- get back to historical levels somewhere in the 2 or 3 years out. But again, I have an expectation that we could continue to run above trend for a while, but we'll get back to what we think trend would be in the marketplace. At least in our pro formas, maybe by year 3.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Seth Laughlin with ISI.","Seth Laughlin - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question on revenue guidance. When you guided this year in February, I guess we were looking at [indiscernible] and compare that to today, the last 3 months have been under a hundred thousand. Is that original guidance just conservative on your part, allowing for a possible slowdown in the economy? Or is it really a matter of your markets just holding up much better than the national average for that?","Frederick C. Tuomi","Yes, I think I heard that. Just talking about the expectations of job growth has moderated. And I'm sure everybody gets the same or similar economic reports. And overall, the expected job growth for 2012 has been reduced in many markets. But most of all, it's been shifted into 2013, so the 2-year total is very close to the same. But you have to look at it market by market and really kind of core area by core area. And some good -- for example, New York. New York had -- lately has been a job production machine. I mean, that was revised dramatically up, not sideways or down. And in fact, New York, New York City is back above its peak employment of several years ago and back above peak population, right there in Manhattan. So other markets, San Francisco, very strong on the job front. Boston is very strong on the job front. We had good revisions up. Other markets like maybe -- I think it was L.A., revised down. Orange County, revised down but still positive. So it's a mix. You really have to look at it market by market. But we are blessed with the portfolio that is heavily weighted on the economic centers that continue to produce jobs and employ people who are college-educated in the urban core who want a rental lifestyle that we deliver. So it's really kind of on that basis versus the macro overall global or U.S. economy.","Seth Laughlin - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Understood. And then in the interest of time, just one quick one that I had. Is there a formulaic relationship between your turnover and expenses, in other words, a relationship where 100 basis points of turnover equals x percentage of expense growth?","David S. Santee","This is David. Turnover, all of our L&A spend for the most part is Internet-driven. So I'm to the point where I kind of look at that as a fixed cost. And then our turnover, the actual painting, the cleaning, the shampooing of carpets, what have you, I mean, that averages $234 of move-out in our portfolio. So even though we do see increased turnover, the impact on expenses ends up being very, very minimal.","Operator","And I'd now like to turn the conference back to management for any closing remarks.","David J. Neithercut","Thank you very much for your attention today, and we look forward to seeing everybody in the fall."],"8858":["Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) Q1 2019 Earnings Conference Call May  1, 2019 11:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Marty McKenna - Investor Relations","Mark Parrell - President and Chief Executive Officer","Michael Manelis - Chief Operating Officer","Robert Garechana - Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc.","Shirley Wu - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Nicholas Yulico - Scotiabank","Stephen Sakwa - Evercore ISI","John Pawlowski - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Marty McKenna. Please go ahead.","Marty McKenna","Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's first quarter 2019 results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; and Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer is here with us for the Q&A.","Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.","Now I'll turn the call over to Mark Parrell.","Mark Parrell","Thank you, Marty. Good morning and thanks for joining us today. We are pleased to delivered growth in our same-store revenues, net operating income and normalized FFO that exceeded our expectations for the quarter. 2019 is off to a strong start with demand for our product remaining deep and new supply being absorbed well across all of our markets.","We are also benefiting from a sizable dropping new competitive supply in both in New York and Boston markets. This strong demand across our markets is creating high occupancy which is allowing us to push rate. We're just beginning the primary leasing season, but if these trends hold we would expect to deliver same-store revenue growth and normalized FFO growth near the top end of our guidance ranges.","As is our custom, we'll wait until our second quarter call at the end of July to revise our full-year guidance. After I discuss our investment activity in the quarter, I'll turn the call over to Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer to give you color on our operating performance. And after that we'll open the call up to your questions.","So, switching to investments on the acquisition side on the fourth quarter call, I gave you details on three apartment properties, we acquired early in the first quarter of 2019. We acquired no other assets in the first quarter, but after the end of the quarter we acquired a 366 unit apartment property in Rockville, Maryland that's a suburb of Washington D.C.","This property was built in 2016 and is fully stabilized. The purchase price was approximately $103.5 million and the acquisition cap rate was 5.3%. Our investment strategy for over a decade has been to acquire and develop urban and den suburban properties in our markets, while we have acquired and develop more urban assets of late.","We also continue to seek well located product in the suburbs that share certain characteristics with our urban assets like being proximate to high wage employment and other positive drivers of apartment demand having high household incomes and where the rent to income ratio is similar to our other assets in the market.","By that, I mean that the rent to income ratio is relatively low. Assets that are walkable are very convenient to amenities by car and we're single family owned housing is less affordable compared to rental apartment housing. The Rockville asset checked all these boxes, we owned other assets in this submarket and think this property complements the existing portfolio.","You should expect us to continue to look for opportunities like these in our markets. We did not sell anything in the first quarter of 2019, but subsequent to the end of the quarter, we sold our 800 Sixth Avenue Asset in Manhattan for approximately $237.5 million. This property is subject to the New York 421A program and its sale will reduce our property tax expense growth rate and improve our NFFO growth rate over time.","We continue to look to acquire properties in Manhattan and elsewhere in the New York area that meet our acquisition parameters. Our guidance continues to call for $700 million of acquisitions and $700 million of dispositions in 2019. The number of assets that we're marketing in the first quarter that meet our acquisition parameters were relatively low.","We expect the number of suitable assets for sale to grow as the year goes on. Overall cap rates are holding steady in our markets and values are increasing modestly with growing NOI. There continues to be considerable demand own high quality apartment assets in all our markets.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer.","Michael Manelis","Thank you, Mark. So strong demand, better pricing power, lower turnover and record high levels of customer satisfaction continue to deliver strong momentum on the revenue front. Occupancy and renewals were slightly better but mostly in line with what we expected.","Gains on new lease change were stronger than we expected which was a result of both better pricing power and having fewer units turnover during the period. In the earnings release, we have included a new schedule on Page 13, that shows pricing trends for the quarter.","As I've stated in previous calls looking at these trends for any given quarter will not tell the complete income story, but they assist and understanding the relationship to previous year comp period and the potential momentum of the market. We included our full-year revenue assumptions by market in the March Investor Presentation posted online.","Sitting here today, our portfolio is 96.6% occupied compared to 96.3% the same week last year. April's achieved renewal increase was 5.1% and we expect May and June to be approximately 5%. If our current momentum continues for the next couple of months we would expect our full-year revenue performance to be towards the high-end of our guidance range. This will mostly be due to stronger new lease pricing and a slight gain in occupancy. It is also important to note that our comp periods for the remaining quarters are more challenging than the first quarter.","So let me provide you some color by market. Boston had a strong first quarter which was in line with our rental income expectations with stronger pricing power, gaining steam throughout the quarter. While increases in parking and retail revenue contributed to our results this quarter, our portfolio is benefiting from a pause and new competitive supply with the 2900 units expected in 2019 coming online later this year.","Today the portfolio was demonstrating more pricing power than expected with base rents in Boston being 4% greater than they were the same week last year. The Boston portfolio is 96.6% occupied and the achieved renewal increases for April are 4.7%. So while we expect competitive supply to increase in 2020 the overall demand fundamentals for this market are very strong and the absorption outlook is positive.","Moving to New York, the 2.4% reported revenue growth was better than expected and was driven by strong consistent occupancy at 96.5% and improved pricing power. This market also had a 7% increase in foot traffic for the quarter which was the highest year-over-year gain amongst all of our markets. Market pricing remain disciplined which will allow us to continue to use concessions at a very targeted level.","During the quarter we use 50% fewer concession dollars than in 2018. The new supply and our competitive footprint is approximately 50% lower than an 18% with expected deliveries just under 10,000 units, the deliveries are concentrated in Long Island City and Brooklyn and to-date our operations have not been negatively impacted from this supply. In fact, our Brooklyn submarket delivered some of the best revenue results in the market.","The New York portfolio is 97.1% occupied and April achieved renewal increases are at 3.9%. So Washington D.C. had a really strong quarter strength and occupancy and pricing power during the quarter was definitely greater than what we expected. Although, the rate of job growth has declined from last year, unemployment remains below the national average.","Professional and business services was a bright spot posting a strong gain of 18,000 jobs or 9.6% increase over the same period last year. Our Northern Virginia submarkets are strong which is likely being fueled by procurement dollars being spent on defense as well as growth in technology employment.","We were forecasting very limited pricing power for 2019 due to the quantity and concentration of new supply in our submarkets and potential slowdowns in absorption. We continue to be cautious about further improvement in this market. Today, our portfolio is 97% occupied with April renewals at 4.3%.","Moving over to the West Coast, Seattle also delivered stronger pricing power during the quarter than what we expected. Seattle supply is being absorbed as the deliveries are shifting from the CBD to the suburban Eastside. Recently, several articles have stated that the Seattle area is filling up new apartment faster than any region in the country.","Strong demand fueled by tech employment appears to be keeping pace with the high levels of new supply in this market. Large employers also continue to show strength and commitment to this market. Amazon has over 10,500 jobs posted in Seattle and another 500 now posted for Bellevue. Facebook also started moving into a new South Lake Union location which is directly across the street from one of our recent acquisitions.","Overall, the next several months to present an opportunity to capture the strengthen demand and grow both rate and occupancy in this market. We are 96.7% occupied with April renewals at 5.6%.","Next step in San Francisco, with jobless rates below the 3% mark, companies are running out of workers to hire and it is not a surprise that the pace of job growth is slowing. That being said demand for our product remains very strong. We had a 6.3% increase in foot traffic for the quarter which was the second highest year over year gain amongst all of our markets.","Our Downtown portfolio which represents 22% of our income in this market, delivered the strongest revenue growth amongst all of the submarkets in the Bay Area. This is in contrast to our East Bay portfolio which produced the lowest revenue growth and also had a reduction in occupancy and foot traffic year-over-year, during the quarter. We are confident that whatever short-term pressure may be placed on our portfolio from deliveries in Oakland and the rest of the Bay will more than offset by the insatiable demand for housing in the Bay Area.","Our San Francisco portfolio is 95.8% occupied which is about 20 basis points less than it was last year, with gains in most submarkets being offset by declines in the East Bay. April renewal increases are 6% and we continue to see strong retention results.","Moving down to Los Angeles. LA performed as expected during the quarter. On the supply front, we continue to see delays in new supply deliveries due to labor shortages on the construction side of the business and we expect that trend to continue. The Downtown Metro submarket for us is a large area stretching from the core Downtown area through Mid-Wilshire Koreatown and over to the Hollywood area. With almost 20% of our revenue in this market, we saw over 5,000 units delivered last year and are currently tracking about 5,500 additional units for 2019.","Concessions of 6 weeks to 8 weeks appear to be the norm for projects currently in lease up in the Downtown Metro. Our Downtown Metro portfolio is performing well, but 96.1% occupancy and 3% revenue growth for the quarter despite the pressure from the supply. Many of our Downtown Metro assets have a boutique like feel and are typically at a price point below the new highly monetized assets.","In addition to Downtown we believe that supply pressure will continue throughout the year in both San Fernando Valley with about 15% of our overall market revenue and the West LA submarket with about 25% of our market revenue. The major difference between the two being absorption in West LA will be higher given the strong job growth from online content companies. The LA portfolio is 96.4% occupied as compared to 96.1% the same week last year and our April renewal increase was 5.8%.","Moving to Orange County results for the quarter were slightly better than expected driven by higher occupancy. Base rents in Irvine had been decelerating since January as expected due to the pressure from new supply. Job growth is slowing but the overall outlook for this market remains positive with 3% plus revenue expectations. Today we are 96.5% occupied and have achieved a 5.7% increase on April renewals.","And last but not least San Diego. Military spending remains strong, we experience some supply pressure downtown that resulted in limited pricing power and lower than expected gains on new leases, earlier in the quarter. But we have seen momentum pickup in late March and April and as of today San Diego is 96.6% occupied and achieved increases in April are 6%.","On the initiatives front, we are focused on creating the right overall digital experience for our prospects residents and employees. During 2019, we are launching a number of new initiatives to further enhance self-service and on demand functionality in the sales and maintenance side of the business, including but not limited to a new resident portal, self-guided tours, mobility for our service teams, testing smart homes and introducing our prospects to LA, which is our artificial intelligence leasing a system.","Impact from operating efficiencies gained will likely be in 2020 and 2021. These are exciting times for our industry from a technology standpoint and we are confident that redefining the digital experience and leveraging new technology in our industry will create operating efficiencies for the years to come.","Let me close with a huge shout out to the employees of Equity Residential. We continue to have strong momentum as we enter the leasing season and their focus on delivering remarkable experiences to our prospects and residents is greatly appreciated.","Thank you. And operator we are now ready to go to the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi.","Nicholas Joseph","Thanks. Mark, you sold the New York City asset in April. As you marketed the asset, what did you learn about the current transaction market in terms of interest or buyer pool given the potential uncertainty surrounding New York rent control?","Mark Parrell","Thanks for that question Nick. Listen the buyer pools generally have been smaller now than they were a few years ago, but sufficient and certainly this asset cleared with relatively no difficulty, I think the asset underwriting process with 421a is a little bit different, everyone knows what those numbers are and what those increases are. But, I think folks that aren't public reporting companies like us have a little bit of an advantage because they are deals that you have very good IRR on.","I mean between the two 421a assets we sold. So that's the 101 West End deal last year and this asset which together, the 806 asset which together about $600 million of sale proceeds. We've got a 10% annual IRR on those assets unlevered, so we did very well. So I think the private buyers are very happy with those sorts of returns, very comfortable with those escalations because they understand that the assets kind of accumulating value for the mark-to-market at the end, and again the asset, these are generally saleable assets and not with a great deal of difficulty.","Nicholas Joseph","Thanks. And you talked about EQR's investment strategy, are you seeing a pricing or IRR differential between urban assets and well located suburban assets that make one more attractive right now?","Mark Parrell","Yes. I know your questions about IRR, but I'll start by saying cap rates in general across both markets and between markets, between coastal and secondary markets have really collapsed on each other. I mean a lot of stuff is trading in the forces that didn't trade in the forces before. So there's just a real compression of cap rates going on. I do think that some of the urban product trades at a lower IRR because it has a lower cap rate because it's got less risk associated with it.","But generally speaking, the value add trades again our trading continue to trade well, but maybe a little bit less demand there. But between urban and suburban right now again it's so competitive that there's not a great deal with difference between IRR demands. But I do think IRRs are still generally lower on the buyer side when you're buying an asset in an urban center city location.","Nicholas Joseph","Thanks.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Shirley Wu with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Shirley Wu","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions.","Mark Parrell","Good morning.","Shirley Wu","Good morning. So given the political climate around housing affordability, I think I'd want to carry it back to what you're hearing regarding, let's say, rent stabilization in New York and even other housing markets across the country, like California. So just your latest thoughts on those prospects?","Mark Parrell","Sure. Thanks for the question Shirley. So just generally, I mean there is rent control discussions going on in many of our markets through various trade associations we belong to we're very active. We're able to discuss these things with policy makers and just get the point across that solving affordable housing \u2013 the affordable housing crisis in our various markets is not about limiting new supply of workforce and affordable housing, but encouraging that sort of supply whether it's through zoning reform, regulatory reform programs like the old New York 421a deal.","So we feel like we've got some real traction in that conversation and we'll continue to press it. As it relates to New York which was part of your specific question, that's a very complex rent control regime and there are a lot of things going on. It does need to be reauthorized by mid-June and so we're in the middle of those conversations again through the various trade associations. But we just have to try and get the point across that continuing to limit the incentive for the private side to create new housing will not solve this problem. So that's the message the industry has that we continue to sort of advocate.","Shirley Wu","Got it. And so on the other side, I'm going to switch to supply. So on your previous calls, you've mentioned that it\u2019s safe to say, Oakland submarket as well as downtown and West L.A., there's been markets that are probably a little bit more challenging and that could potentially impact your production. And we're hearing is that there's been some weakness in overseas as well. How do you balance this in your revenue projections, again, let's say a stronger markets like New York that's outperforming. And how do you think that's going to impact the projection going into 2Q?","Mark Parrell","I want to make sure, I understand your question does it get a little garbled, but you're talking about supply production in Orange County as well as in the bay area specifically in East Bay and sort of comparing them to the performance in some of the East Coast markets. Did I catch that correctly?","Shirley Wu","Yes. And how you think, let's say, the rest of the year is going to play out?","Mark Parrell","Sure.","Michael Manelis","Okay. So this is Michael, I think I can address that. So I think on the last call, we talked about slowness that we were seeing kind of in Orange County and our full-year projection actually had lower revenue projected for 2019 versus 2018. We kind of see the supply that we're tracking. I think just under 4,000 units for Orange County in 2019 and a very consistent competitive standpoint of what we experienced last year, we actually did a little better than what we thought in Q1. But again, that was off of a reduced kind of run rate knowing that we were going to be facing the competition.","Moving over into the Bay Area, I guess I would say, we're seeing pressure on East Bay. I don't necessarily point that to the deliveries coming online in Oakland yet. I think that's still TBD as to what that poll is going to be whether that's going to attract from downtown San Francisco. But when we built our full-year, we kind of anticipated and we look at when are these deliveries coming to market. So I don't really see any kind of change right now.","I will tell you the momentum in Q1 in San Francisco outside of the East Bay may mitigate any impact we're going to have from that supply. And as you move over to the East Coast and you think about New York, we see the reduction in supply in New York. We thought we were going to have better pricing power. We were expecting that the momentum is stronger than what we thought.","So I think as we play out for the balance of the year as I alluded to in the opening remarks, if these trends continue that we're seeing in these markets for the next couple of months as we start writing more and more leases that is going to put us to the high end of our income range.","Shirley Wu","Got it. Thanks for the color Michael.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.","Nicholas Yulico","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I understand waiting until the second quarter to adjust guidance, but perhaps you can just tell us what would be the negatives that could reasonably happen between now and then that would prevent you from raising same-store guidance. I mean which markets are the risk here?","Mark Parrell","Sure. It's Mark and then Michael may supplement this. I mean over the next few months as you know with leasing season, we have approaching half of our leases turning over in the span of a few months. So you've got variables in rate, you got certainly variables in occupancy that are very relevant. So it's just there's and we're talking about pretty fine numbers. When you start talking about whether your growth rate is \u2013 the midpoint of our guidance being 2.7, 2.8 those are very small differences in the level of precision we're talking about here.","So what I'd say to you is what can change push you up or down there's things as simple as a temporary occupancy blip maybe some undisciplined supply in one of our submarkets things like that that could push those numbers down. That don't mean that anything systemic has happened in that market, but that Nick you're going to miss \u2013 we're going to miss the very, very top end of the range by something, by some factor. So what I would say is you've got all of that that you need to consider and that's effectively impossible for us to predict at this early point in the leasing season.","Michael Manelis","Nick, the only thing I guess I would add to that is just from a downside risk perspective, it's really watching southern California just to see if there's any additional softening. Because to me that's where the risk sits right now. The other the trajectory of these other markets, it will be remote that all of a sudden we see a very sharp pause that then dilutes our occupancy so quickly. But I think in Southern California right now it's where we need to kind of keep our eyes on it.","Nicholas Yulico","And just falling up on Southern California, I mean I think you said that labor shortages in LA are leading to some construction delays. Can you just talk about that because I know you're all kind of worried about the supply impact in LA.? I mean is this a scenario were some of that supply maybe gets pushed later this year into next year.","Mark Parrell","I think that is what we will see, right. So we saw a shift from \u2013 in 2018 what we were projecting for 2019, we saw a shift occur a lot of the 2018 deliveries got moved into 2019 and it pushed the number up through I think 14,000 units expected in the market. We expect that trend is going to continue. I think in the first quarter we saw about 15% of the expected completed shift and get deferred out. So I guess is, every quarter we are going to keep seeing some of that shift occur.","Nicholas Yulico","Okay. Thanks. And just last question on the new data you are giving on new lease and renewal rates. It's helpful. On the new lease numbers, I guess, I\u2019m wondering would those numbers be that much different including concessions.","Mark Parrell","No. I guess that would be better right now in New York as we are doing about 50% fewer concessions in the first quarter of 2019 versus 2018. I mean we really don\u2019t do a lot of concessions in the portfolio. And so I look at this and outside of New York, New York would be performing a little bit better than what's on the page.","Michael Manelis","Yes. I think new lease concession for us are like $0.50 million or something. I mean, it's just not a material number on $2.6 billion in revenue.","Nicholas Yulico","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore.","Stephen Sakwa","Hi. Just a couple of quick questions. I wanted to just talk about the margin opportunity and some of the, I guess tech initiatives that you're sort of doing the self-guided tours and some other things like that. How big or how much of a benefit do you think that could be to margins and sort of over what timeframe do you think we could expect to see that?","Mark Parrell","So I think it's probably too early to know the exact impact from all of these initiatives put together. You need to remember that we've done a lot of centralization and eliminated roles onsite in previous years. So for us our opportunity is figuring out how to leverage this technology to create new operating efficiencies. What's probably most exciting for us and we'll probably see the bigger return is that we got an amazing portfolio of assets that are highly concentrated in very desirable locations.","So this close proximity when we start thinking about self-guided tours, where we start thinking about kind of potting our kind of onsite folks. We will have less windshield time, which is going to allow us to have greater staff efficiencies in both sales and service. And it's also going to allow us to reduce our reliance on contractors for many of the tasks that are getting completed today. So I think the benefit really comes more like 2020 and 2021, as we start deploying this technology and start to see the compounded impact of all of them coming together.","Stephen Sakwa","I guess, how much beta testing have you done on the self-guided tours and what sort of pluses and minuses have sort of come out of that?","Mark Parrell","So we've done a lot where we have concierges, right, where you don't need the technology in place. And remember a lot of our buildings we have concierge so we have staff there. We're now just getting ready to deploy the technology in place so you have the locks in place. You can do self-guided tours at properties after hours where you don't have kind of onsite personnel. We've been testing for, I would say probably about nine months.","On the smart home technology, we've done probably a little bit over a year. We\u2019ve narrowed it down. We'll have about 2,000 units up and running. On the self-guided tours, we've done this at a handful of properties. We really need to kind of market it better to really see the upside potential of it. But it's big, right because a tour takes 30 minutes of time. So you start eliminating those tours that equals a huge efficiency in your staff.","Stephen Sakwa","And just last on the smart home technology. Can you just sort of give us a rough idea of the cost to put all of the things in the home and the sort of the returns that you might expect on that?","Mark Parrell","Yes. So I mean that's a tough one. I guess, I'll just throw out an average per door of about $800, but it does swing depending on what kind of lock you're putting in. If you've got a mortise lock, it's more costly than if you just have a standard lock. As far as the return goes, I think we've been out in the industry the $30 a month premium getting charged. On yield management, it's hard to say that that's really a sustainable kind of return that you're getting on that. So I think we need to get more concentration of these in the portfolio to really be able to answer that question to tell you what we expect from it.","Michael Manelis","Yes. Steve, I\u2019d add some of this stuff is going to get to be table stakes in some of these markets where people just demand this sort of stuff. So it's really hard to tell what it is and it'll vary a little bit. And some markets will install one thing and some will install another. But it's certainly an opportunity for us to the positive.","Stephen Sakwa","Okay. And then last question for Mark, maybe just on strategy I mean as you kind of hear about these coastal markets and these rent control initiatives. I know you've tried to move back in the places like Denver and some other markets, do you sort of think about the footprint of the portfolio any differently moving forward?","Mark Parrell","Rent control is a risk, just like climate change just like the financial strength of our various municipalities we operate in, Steve that we have to take into account. We've managed that risk very well. New York\u2019s had rent control the entire time we've been in that market. So it's certainly something we're aware of.","But again we hope to have these and continue to have really good dialogue with policymakers and hope to have a conversation that really involves more workforce housing, not just regulating prices and ending up with less workforce housing, less housing in general and kind of a worse problem. So do we take it into account? Absolutely. It\u2019s compelling us to move in other markets. The reasons we're not in those other markets and a lot to do with the quality of demand and the type of customer you have and the ability to build in those markets, and the fact that rent control maybe isn't a threat in those markets. I'm not sure offsets the other disadvantages we see.","Stephen Sakwa","Okay. Thanks. That's it for me.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.","John Pawlowski","Thanks. Just sticking with New York rent control, curious your political contacts there in Albany, what's your base case scenario for what does change on the ground come middle of this year.","Mark Parrell","Yes. Thanks, John. That's really hard for us to guess that. There are so many proposals that are active right now. The governor's talked about a number of things, other legislators have talked about a number of things. Just to be honest with you, impossible for me to tell you that we have a good handle on the exact proposal that's likely to be enacted. When something does seem close then we'll have a firm review.","John Pawlowski","My pushback is it's getting close and I mean there's hearings this week and I know legislation can change. But there are details being crystallized. So just curious maybe not base case, but is there any risk to your portfolio NOI these next three to five years as you see things playing out today?","Mark Parrell","Well, not only does it depend on the category of the change because there are broad \u2013 I don't disagree with you there are broad things being discussed some of which like capital improvement changes aren't particularly relevant to us, but if you change the preferential rent scheme, it depends how you change it. And I've heard so many different variants that it's really hard for me to react and give you a view.","I'll tell you that a good portion of our portfolio in New York City isn't rent controlled at all, it's market rate units. Those units maybe benefited from all this additional controls. So I appreciate the desire to get to some underwriting number right now, but until we have more certainty, it's just hard for us to give you that kind of answer.","John Pawlowski","That's fair. And then Michael on D.C. and just the supply dynamic across various submarkets, permitting is starting to pick up meaningfully which I won't hit for another few years, but as 2019 and 2020 unfold where are the pockets of oversupply come in and where are the pockets of relief coming for your portfolio?","Michael Manelis","So I think really we're looking at this supply kind of concentration on top of us in these submarkets in the district and in Virginia. And really this market is delivered almost 4,000 units a quarter. And we kind of anticipate that to continue. So from a concentration standpoint, I would say, it still sits on us in the district, it still sits on us in the Northern Virginia. We expect that to continue. We're performing better than what we thought despite the supply sitting there.","Mark Parrell","I don\u2019t know John was your question only D.C. or was it broader than that, I apologize.","John Pawlowski","Sorry, D.C. I know there's a bunch of waterfront revitalization project. And just wondering, because permitting is accelerating, where are the big supply shocks hitting. Not necessary 2019, but beyond this year where the big supply shocks hitting across the metro?","Mark Parrell","Well, D.C. is a market that has the ability to deliver rapidly in new areas. I mean again you talk about the waterfront in this Union Market area is certainly going to get a lot of supply as well. So these new areas are terrific in the sense that they're making the district so much more livable, much more dynamic place, there are a lot of reasons for people to live there more reasons than even before, but these areas do draw these new areas.","So I'll tell you, it could spring up in a lot of places and I wouldn't be surprised if we're not talking in two years about the amount of supply in Union Market, because of all of the stuff going on there. I also think you can deliver in Arlington pretty easily and you may see a little bit more delivered in and around the concentration around HQ2 at Amazon. So, I exist everywhere. I mean honestly.","John Pawlowski","Yes. Thanks so much.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley.","Richard Hill","Hey. Good morning guys. Maybe just following up on that question in a broader context, recognize that you're focused on so-called near-term, I want to see how that plays out until you do take any action and guidance.","It sounds like New York City is rebounding pretty nicely here, but as you look out over the next two to three years, what markets get you the most bullish in and maybe what markets do you have a little bit of maybe more caution on either because of supply versus demand technical?","Mark Parrell","Hey, Rich. It's Mark. So sort of three inputs demand supply and I'll call it other. When you think about the supply picture, it's probably I would say slightly more discouraging in Washington, D.C. and the ability as we just talked about in the prior question and deliver in many submarkets and in brand new submarkets, large amounts of supply in relative short order, makes that market a little more difficult than some of our other markets on the supply side.","Most of the other markets have \u2013 I think a little bit more in terms of structural limitations or land limitations on supply. In terms of demand, we like the picture across all the markets New York feels very good. We feel very good about very bullish on New York long-term. I mean the financial services employment sort of headache is over we think. I think that the city has reborn with an emphasis on technology and new media","And we see that it costs our resident base and the amount of demand we like New York a lot. We like Boston, a great deal. We're building a big tower there. So we feel terrific. The West Coast markets have done very well. We like the demand picture across the board including in D.C. A lot of our better D.C. numbers are because frankly the supply was there and we knew it would be, but the demand is just terrific.","And then other which I define as both the rent control concerns, we've discussed on the call and then just thinking about whether our jurisdictions are investing in their infrastructure. And that point, the D.C. is to be commended because they just got a new package of reforms in place to fund the renovation of the Metro system, which is badly needed and now they have you know funding assured funding from the three governments to do that. So again we see a lot of good things in our markets across the board. And I would say that the picture and supplying in D.C. is just a little bit more challenging than any other markets.","Richard Hill","Got it. And one follow-up to that on the demand side. There's obviously been a lot of talk about the aging millennial population. We've been talking about the Gen Z population that\u2019s coming behind that's even bigger. Do you have these thoughts on the millennial and disease propensity to rent versus own and do you expect that they're going to rent more than own or is it too early to tell at this point?","Mark Parrell","Well, I've got a couple Gen Z living with me so I speak something to that. I think we continue creation of jobs in dense and dense suburban and urban settings in these cities that we operate in. I don't know why that dynamic changes. I don't know why people don't want to live there like I can't see what that inflection point would be again provided these cities continue to invest in this attractive infrastructure of parks and transit and the like.","So, I mean we're very optimistic. I'd point out that our average resident is a little bit older at 33. So, we haven't even seen the height of the millennials yet through our system. I think the biggest core. It might be 28 years older, so now, so we're going to continue to feel good tailwinds from the millennials, and no reason to believe that the Gen Z wouldn't act similarly. But they are just entering college when they're just coming out of this is a young group yet and I guess to be fair, we haven't really seen their preferences in housing expressed very well yet.","Richard Hill","Got it. Okay. That's very helpful guys. Thank you. Congrats on a good quarter.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","Thank you. Michael gave some pretty interesting data on foot traffic by market. I'm wondering if you found this to be a good indicator of new lease growth rates historically. And then specifically to New York, what is driving the 7% increase, do you think? Is it broad based or is it specific to some of your submarkets?","Mark Parrell","No. So, I would say it was pretty consistent across the submarkets just the being strong. I think foot traffic by itself is not the only thing you would look to see demand, because there's things that we could do based on how many available units we have to sell how much advertising dollars we're putting in there that can influence those numbers.","I think for us we were fairly consistent in our marketing strategy and you can see these areas that had the kind of strongest growth on a year-over-year basis allowed us to kind of get in a position where we can grow occupancy versus the prior year and then start pushing right, a leading indicator.","John Kim","Okay, a couple of questions maybe for Bob. Was your same-store revenue this quarter or this year will there be any benefit from the accounting change as far as unelectable least revenue being moved up to revenue.","Robert Garechana","Yes. So there's no change. We've always accounted for our bad debt expense as a contrary avenue. So, the lease accounting implementation didn't impact the income statement in any regard.","John Kim","Okay. And then looking at your second quarter guidance, this is more like the area in FFO not the normalized, but the narrowed FFO is coming down the second quarter versus first quarter. Is there any one-time items or debt extinguishment cost like respecting the second quarter?","Robert Garechana","Yes. There's one debt extinguishment costs, which is fairly sizable. Its non-cash, it actually relate to the payoff of some tax exempt bonds on the sale of 806. We acquired that property as part of our stones so that that was mark-to-market. So there is a fairly sizable discount that had to be written off when we paid off that debt in conjunction with the sale.","John Kim","And then finally, I know it sounds like revenue is going to come out at the high end of your guidance for the year, expenses have also come in at high-end of your guidance range in the first quarter. Do you expect that to continue for the remainder of the year?","Robert Garechana","Yes. So we're comfortable with the kind of call at the midpoint of our guidance range on expenses. We always assumed that the expense growth would be front end loaded in our original forecast. So we're comfortable kind of where the range that's kind of around the midpoint right.","John Kim","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Stevenson with Janney.","Robert Stevenson","Good morning guys. Turnover was down pretty meaningfully again year-over-year. Anything in particular driving the continued decline overall and how much of an impact is that having on an NOI versus 100 or 200 or 300 basis points higher?","Robert Garechana","So yes, I mean it was 9.9% for the quarter, it was roughly just over 600 fewer units turned over in Q1 of 2019, over Q1 of 2018. So from an NOI perspective, I mean the cost \u2013 the actual physical cost to make ready a unit is not significant.","So I don't think that's a big driver to the NOI. The benefit for us is we reduce our vacancy loss on those units. And we also right now you have more people renewing right and renewals were coming in at a 4.9%.","So that to me is a lift that we're seeing kind of into the NOI contribution from that. Of the drivers to that, I think is very consistent to what we've said in the past, which is we are delivering strong customer service to our residents.","Our satisfaction scores are at the all time company high. And that's being fueled with people out there deferring life changing decisions for later years and marrying later having children later. So, I think we're benefiting from all of those things coming together. How much lower it goes. I don't know.","Robert Stevenson","Okay. Orange County was the one exception was up. Anything that sticks out about that market or is it just noise at this point.","Mark Parrell","Yes, it was up and it equated to 27 more move outs during that first quarter versus the first quarter of last year. It's something that we're watching right. We knew we were facing some pressure into that market. We forecasted that in our guidance but it was down and it's something we just need to walk.","Robert Stevenson","Okay. And then San Francisco and L.A. had positive new lease growth in the first quarter as per your new schedule. What markets, I assume that those markets are likely to have positive rent growth for the full-year. What other markets besides those two could flip and be positive for the entire year. When you when all is said and done on a new lease basis?","Mark Parrell","Yes. So we've put the guidance out there for in the March Investor Presentation for the full-year. So you kind of get a sense. I will tell you sitting here right now. San Francisco, New York and D.C. are probably the three that have really outperformed the first quarter from a new lease change perspective and I think you could just look at the March guidance and kind of understand that would impact those full-year numbers, the rest of this stuff. Its call it 20 basis points, 30 basis points better than what we expected in the quarter. And when you stretch that out over the full-year and you put in all of the quantity of new leases that we're getting ready to write, it's just not as meaningful.","Robert Stevenson","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Guinee with Stifel.","John Guinee","Great. Thank you. A few quick questions, first is the $800 new unit digital and digital experience are smart tech spend included in your 2,600 per unit CapEx guidance.","Mark Parrell","Yes.","John Guinee","And then second, any\u2026?","Mark Parrell","Yes.","John Guinee","Okay, great. Then second any change in asking or taking rents in your assets contiguous to Amazon HQ to headquarter location yet?","Mark Parrell","No. I think they actually \u2013 they just announced that they're going to start putting some employees in there in June and some temporary office space. To me that HQ2 and I think what we're seeing it's a psychological lift right. It's good for long-term fundamentals for those submarket and I think what you're going to see as the year progresses and more and more jobs you're going to see the demand number go up and you'll probably see pricing power strengthened from that.","John Guinee","Okay. And then last Boston tower under development 850,000 per unit refresh our memory as to expected yield and then rents on a per square foot basis needed to hit those yields.","Mark Parrell","Right. There with me for a second here. Yes, so the tower where we expect to stabilize that is about a take a little over a 6% yield. The current yield on current rents and current construction costs would be bit over 5%. But just to give you a sense of that. I'm not sure I have here the actual rent I don't have the underwriting for that asset here with me and we could certainly talk through that with you at a later points.","John Guinee","Great. Nice job. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Hardik Goel with Zelman.","Hardik Goel","Hello? Do you guys hear me?","Mark Parrell","Yes, we can.","Hardik Goel","Hey thanks, Mark. Thanks for taking my call. I just had a question on some of the comments you made on D.C. and L.A. supply. So we know that D.C. hasn't typically an issue with delays and supply comes on they're pretty healthy clip and at the same time we have markets in California where supply is really difficult even ones that started to kind of deliver on time and what's driving that difference really? How much of that is just people looking at construction costs and having to revise the capital stack versus labor and just if you could add some color and insight into what's going on?","Mark Parrell","Sure. Well a couple of different things are going on. One is similar. There are new neighborhood, I mean Downtown L.A. is a new destination of sorts so you see a lot of construction there and there's not as much entrenched opposition. When you go to DC, there's a lot less effective entrenched opposition to these new neighborhoods like again the area by the ballpark and you see very significant amounts of construction. It\u2019s relatively easy to build in Northern Virginia.","Maryland is a little more difficult, but it is relatively easy. So I would say to you that generally speaking in terms of governmental restrictions land availability in D.C. of a good sized subcontractor base all of that is easier. I would say to execute on in D.C. than it is on the West Coast, we have maybe more limitations in terms of local government rules and regulations you need to work through. We have more significant land limitations, maybe a more effective NIMBYs view on additional units. So I think it's a combination of all those things.","Hardik Goel","What about just to the quick follow up. What about wants to use already approved and started. Is there a difference in how long it takes to just complete the unit and get it done on time? Does the regulatory environment affect that as well you think?","Mark Parrell","I don't. I've not heard that to be the case, it's more what you're building a high rise or you're building a mid rise wrap product, you're building garden what are you constructing. So if you're building a high rise it's going to take longer. And so a lot of our supply numbers, we think they're pretty accurate when we have markets like New York where everything's high rise and when markets like D.C. where there's a lot of garden, a lot of mid rise it takes less time.","So, I have not heard that there's a material difference once construction starts, in say the completion of a mid rise in the L.A. area and the completion of the mid rise in D.C. If there is it's probably whether related or those sorts of things, but I've not heard a great deal of difference.","Hardik Goel","Got it. That's very helpful thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Good morning. Mark, just going to New York for a minute, you mentioned that the majority that most of your New York assets were market rate not rent control but could you just maybe on a percentage basis, your New York portfolio that's either for 21 a or you know pre 1974 Brent rent stabilized units. What percent of your New York portfolio would fall into either bucket?","Mark Parrell","Sure Alex, I give some general numbers and I'll admit that this is all very technical, it's a little bit subject to correction here as we some of these properties are shifting for example, they're completing their rent stabilization period and they'll move in the market rate. So, we have 9,500 units in metro New York, call it 3,500 or so aren't even in New York City proper.","So, they're not part of this conversation we're having right now, call it 30,300 units and that number is going down shortly because we have some deals moving out of the rent stabilization category, so maybe 30,300 units or so, our rent stabilized in one fashion or another. You know as a New York or there's a lot of variations on what that means and whether those restrictions are very significant or less so but effectively 30.300 and the remaining call is 3,000 odd units.","Robert Garechana","Our market rate units, and the number of market rate units from now to call at 23 is going to keep increasing as we burn through some of these rent stabilization periods and its 421A assets go through their cycle.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. So just to clarify the 3,300 includes units that are subject to preferential rate rents, the legal caps as well as the rent stabilized units correct?","Mark Parrell","Yes.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then second question is I don't think I've heard you guys talk about the new energy initiatives that were just passed in New York, but maybe if you could just talk about I know they're recent but how you view your portfolio is measuring up against towards the city council in the mayor assigned both on the 2024 mandate and then the 2029.","And then just reading the way it looks is that buildings with regulated units are exempt, but the market rate units \u2013 market rate buildings are not. So maybe you could just talk about sort of how your portfolio lays up again against for 2024 in the 2029 threshold?","Mark Parrell","Sure. So, let me just get a little bit of context. So really the bill is trying to measure those greenhouse gas intensity. They've come out with a calculation that has kind of a mandate for 2024 and then another decline really beginning in 2030 I believe. So, I think just looking at the portfolio and thinking about where we have properties rolling off kind of the 421A that won't be subject to this stuff we're anticipating about 4,500 units or about 70% of our Manhattan and Brooklyn unit.","In 2024 we will only need to take prescriptive measures as they will still be subject to some form of kind of rent stabilization. So that being said, I would say the company we've always been focused on energy consumption and efficiency. So we're not \u2013 we're still working through with a consultant to understand our baseline but we're not as concerned about this 2024 requirement. But it looks like it's about a 40% reduction in their calc as to where this benchmark is for 2030.","And I would say that reduction is going to take some work to achieve, but we're just we're up for the challenge but we're not really sure yet how much work we're going to have to do to be able to hit that benchmark.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. But basically for the initial part 70% of your portfolio is effectively shielded because...","Mark Parrell","Yes. I mean, but you still need to take prescriptive measures in there. So yes, you're shielded from the actual calculation or the penalties from it but there are still things you're going to need to do. But we have a lot of confidence just given our focus over these years that we've already done most of those.","Robert Garechana","Yes, we've got a lot of cogent that we do in New York we've got a lot of \u2013 with the sustainability and efficiency initiatives we've done a lot of work on these assets already that you know is gone well for us. You'll see us do some work. A lot of that Alex, I bet you we would have done anyway.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. Thank you, Mark.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.","John Pawlowski","Thanks. One quick follow-up on the New York City disposition. The 4.4 disposition yield, could you share the like the sellers cap rate what the impact from burn offs of 421A would be on a cap rate basis?","Mark Parrell","Yes. We try to based on what the sellers or buyer pardon me is willing to tell us John. Understand what their cap rate is. We think it's about the same as ours initially that there might be you know about the same thought process. Again, we all know what the renovation thought process is. So I don't know \u2013 I don't have right now with me the step up schedule for that specific asset. We certainly could have that conversation with you later. Bob, you got any detail on that specific asset?","Robert Garechana","Yes. The only thing I can say is as it relates to our own kind of rate of growth from 2018 to 2019, it was about $900,000 was the step up from the real estate tax piece, but that's all the color I have at the moment.","John Pawlowski","Okay. That helps. Thanks.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn it back to our presenters for closing remarks.","Mark Parrell","All right. Before we end the call, I want to give a very special thank you to John Lennox, our Senior VP of Financial Planning and Analysis who is retiring today after 35 years with our Company. John has been a valued friend, colleague and teacher to so many of us in our Company and a mentor to both me and Bob Garechana as CFO's. We wish him the very best in his retirement. So thank you all for your time today and have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's presentation.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead, sir.","Marty McKenna","Thank you, Angel. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's first quarter 2018 operating results. Our featured speakers today are David Neithercut, our President and CEO; David Santee, our Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Manelis, who will take from David on July 1 as COO. Mark Parrell, our Chief Financial Officer is here as well for the Q&A.","Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.","And now I'll turn the call over to David Neithercut.","David Neithercut","Thanks, Marty and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for today's conference call. Now as announced last night, the first quarter came in pretty much in line with our expectations. Thanks to occupancy levels are remained quite high, another quarter of very strong retention and having achieved very impressive renewal rates during the quarter, all of this, despite significant new supply across most of our markets.","Now this performance, as a result of the relentless focus on our prospects, residents and properties by our property management and operational teams and everyone across our enterprise that supports those teams. Because notwithstanding, it was very deep and very resilient demand for apartment living in our urban and highly walkable suburban markets.","We\u2019re facing peak new deliveries in many of our markets this year, which means it is a very competitive marketplace for new perspective residents and our existing residents have a lot of options from which to choose when they lease with us comes up for renewal. So I cannot emphasize enough of the benefits revised from the remarkable cost and service delivery each and every day by our dedicated teams across the country.","Now as far as line, I can remember these efforts have been led in part by a Chief Operating Officer, David Santee, who has most of you know is stepping down as our COO on July 1 and he will retire from Equity at the end of the year. Since join the company 23 years ago, David has had a profound impact on all aspects of EQR and it is hard to imagine the company without him. But among a long list of David's accomplishments is a fact that Michael Manelis is ready to step in his role and move us forward without missing a beat.","Now everyone will miss David, and I can tell you, it sure as hell won't be the same without him. But thanks to the work he has done in planning for this event. We will carry on, it only get better from here. So I'm happy now to turn the call over to David for what could be his final quarterly earnings call. The preparation for which I know will be one of the things he will miss most when he's going.","David Santee","Okay. Thank you, David. Our reported Q1 results leave us very well positioned as we enter the early stages of our peak leasing season. With the elevated delivers across all of our markets, we are pleased with our quarter played out.","Revenue growth of 2.2% was a result of achieving our goals for both rate growth and improved occupancy. Renewal rates achieved for the quarter were 4.6%, which is equal to or better than 2017 quarterly results. Our turnover increased 20 basis points year-over-year, Q1 of 2017 was one of our \u2013 one of the best in our history, creating a very tough.","Most of our markets were almost flat or down with most of the increase turnover occurring in Seattle. Moved outs to via home continues to be a non-event declining to 11.2% of move out from the 12.5% in Q1 of 2017.","A while we've had a good quarter on the books, we know that this leasing season will see more new deliveries in a years past. And like last year, we know that is critically important that every team member at every community knows our operating strategy and the role that they play in renewing and retain both residents and employees.","Next week, I\u2019ll join our senior property management leaders to meet with every employee in every market. This is a matter of strategy, communicate our support and learn how we can continue to be faster and better in a very competitive environment.","And before I pass it over to Michael for the market commentary, I'd like to take a minute to first thank all of you in the investment community, with your support and believe in Equity Residential more importantly me. It's been one hell of a ride. We all have our own expectations of ourselves in our careers and I feel lucky and bless to have been COO of the best public multi-family company in the world.","And to all my friends and family at Equity Residential both past and present, I've always been humbled by your passion and commitment to our company and extremely grateful to the tremendous support that you have given me over the past 23 years. It's been passed at times, it's been furious at times, but it has always been fun.","Now many of you on the phone have met Mike over the years. And he and I have spent the last 18 months planning for today. I know I speak for many when I say congratulations and tell you how excited and confident we are in you taking us forward. Michael?","Michael Manelis","Thank you, David. So you have been an outstanding teacher for us and friend for the past 18 years. I'm very excited by the opportunity to be this great company\u2019s next Chief Operating Officer. And I truly appreciate all that you have done to prepare me for this floor.","So now onto the market. So let's start with Boston. Boston\u2019s residential portfolio performed as expected with occupancy at 95.5% for the quarter and renewals at 4.5%. Our reported first quarter revenue modestly benefited from strong parking garage income.","As we moved into March, demand in occupancy were improving in every submarket, this gave us the confidence to start pushing rate in advance of the peak leasing season. But with 61% of the new deliveries begin in the city of Boston and Cambridge where we have 72% of our NOI. We will be watching our occupancy closely.","Fortunately, job growth remains strong and continues to support the absorption of new product being delivered. Boston, with its well educated workforce continues to attract large corporate expansion and relocation, especially into the Kendall Square and Seaport areas. Reebok recently stated that they already have 750 employees working at their new Seaport location and recent announcements for Max Mutual and Amazon will continue to strength.","As of this morning, I could tell you, we are positioned exactly where we want to be in Boston. Our baselines are up 50 basis points year-over-year, compared to the same week last year. And our occupancy is 96.7%, which is up 40 basis points over the same period last year. Renewal performance remains strong with expected achieved increases for April at 4% and May at 4.2%.","Onto New York which has been the focus of many conversations given the elevated supply in 2018. Overall pricing remains disciplined. Our operating metrics were slightly better than we expected with occupancy at 96.0%, renewals up 2.9% and our use of concessions being lower than we expected for the quarter. And a market with elevated supply, it should be no surprise that you read a lot of headlines about increased concession use.","We remain focused on competitive net effect of pricing and the use of concessions with our stabilized asset is very targeted and primarily used as a marketing tool for a given unit type or even a specific unit. With yield management in place, the introduction of a concession is not always equate to an exactly reduction in net effective price.","During the first quarter, 20% to 30% of our weekly applications received so form of concession. This is compared to a similar percent of application receiving concessions in Q1 of 2017. Today, our occupancy in New York is 96.7%, which is 60 basis points better than the same week last year.","Base rents are flat. And for the past several weeks, we have issued concessions to less than 10% of our new application. Renewals remain strong with 2.5% expected for both April and May against quote that we\u2019re just a little bit over 5%. Bottom line is that we are well positioned, as we enter the peak leasing season, where the majority of our transactions will occur.","New York employment is at an all time high and we continue to hear stories about companies revving up hiring an increase in compensation. We're going to continue to balance rate and occupancy in strategically utilized concessions only where needed.","Our position today is better than what we anticipated when we gave guidance. But we are still early in the year and have two of the largest quarters of deliveries coming out. The results for the next 90 days will have a significant impact on a full year revenue performance and our local team is highly engaged and ready to perform in this peak leasing season.","So moving to DC. The main headline for DC is absorption. And we're off to a promising start. DC\u2019s apartment market has absorbed more Class A units over the last 12 months than any time in its history. The positive economic conditions that helped maintain Class A absorption at a pace well above its historical average. However the elevated level of new supply continues to have a moderating effect and rent growth. Our first quarter revenue growth was consistent with our expectations, occupancy was 96.1%, which was 20 basis points higher in Q1 of 2017 and renewals were up 4.0%. Today our occupancy in DC is 96.4%, which is 70 basis points higher than the same week last year.","Building up the occupancy in advance of the leasing season was absolutely part of our operating strategy and has allowed us to maintain growth for our ninth consecutive week in a row. Today our base lines are 80 basis points higher than they were the same week last year, we achieved \u2013 we expect to achieve a 4.1% increase on renewals in April and are trending to a 4.0% increase in May. Again this is a market where we are well positioned, but we are still early in the leasing season and have consistent levels of new supply and almost 3000 units per quarter coming out.","Moving over to the west coast. Overall the first quarter revenue results in Seattle were as expected. On our last call, we told you that we experienced moderation in the fourth quarter of 2017 and expected that moderation to continue into 2018 and it has. Occupancy for the first quarter was 95.7% which is 10 basis points less in Q1 2017, and renewals average 5.7%. Well, it\u2019s still early in the season our ability to grow rate is somewhat less than we expected.","The good news is the vibrancy of the job market in Seattle remains strong. Amazon continues to show strength and the initial pause from HQ2 had announcement last year is definitely in the past, as today we see over 5,400 open Seattle positions under website. Today our occupancy in Seattle is 95.9%, which continues to be about 10 basis points less than last year and our base rents are down 1.6% as compared to the same week that year. We expect our renewals for April to be 5.8%, and May is trending towards 5.6%. Demand remain strong and the current moderation of pricing power is something that we will continue to keep a close eye on as we move through the leasing season.","Moving down to San Francisco, we said on the earnings call in January that this is the market that has the most potential to outperform, our same store revenue growth expectation for the year and we still believe that to be the case. We continue to see positive news about employment growth in announcements of new job creation. The tech giant\u2019s expansion continues unabated and venture capital spending is on the rise with $6.4 billion being placed in Q1, which was up 23% from Q4 2017.","Our Q1 result in San Francisco were better than expected, primarily driven by our ability to grow occupancy early to gain modest pricing power in advance of the leasing season. We averaged 96.4% occupancy for the quarter, which was 60 basis points better than Q1 of 2017, renewals were up 4.2%. The Peninsula and South Bay are performing the best, South Bay is benefiting from a low and new supply at that sub market is back half loaded with deliveries. Today we are 96% occupied in San Francisco, which is 30 basis points better than the same week last year, and our base lines are up 3.9% versus last year.","This week will mark the eighth consecutive week of incremental increases through our base rents our renewals for April are up 5.5% and we expect May to be up 5.3%. Trends up being positive, but it is still early and I look forward to adding additional color on this market in the July earnings call.","As we\u2019ve discussed prior calls, Los Angeles is a market with significant increase in supply and while it's a large geographic area almost 60% of this new supply will be concentrated in the downtown metro area where we have 18% of our NOI.","Employment growth is diverse and remain strong. Jobs related to online content creation continue to ramp up with Netflix, Apple and Amazon making investments into the area from Hollywood to Culver City. This along with continued strength and expansion of Silicon Beach are aiding in the absorption of the new supply. But we know that the volume of new supply may become a pressure point against our pricing power in 2018.","And that is our ROI guidance was a strategy of increasing occupancy early to position us to raise rates beginning in March. For the quarter, we had 96.1% occupancy which was 40 basis points higher than Q1 of 2017 and renewals were up 5.6%. Overall our results were marginally better than expected, but we are still early in the season and the ability to maintain pricing power will be challenged. Our occupancy in LA today is 95.9%, which is 30 basis points better than the same week last year. Our base rents are up 4.6% year-over-year and we expect a 5.9% increased on renewals in April and are trending to 6.1% from May.","Moving for Orange County, first quarter results were in line with expectations. Occupancy for the quarter was 96.2%, which was 10 basis points higher than Q1 of 2017 and renewals were at 6.3%. Today, we are experiencing pressure on pricing and occupancy at a level greater than we expected for April. And it's being created from the lease-ups in Irvine area. Our occupancy is 95.5%, which is 80 basis points lower than the same week last year. Our base rents are up 1.7% and our renewals are up just over 5% for both April and May. Demand remain strong and this trend does have a potential to recover through the leasing season.","And last, but not least San Diego. Our results for the quarter were slightly less than expected, almost entirely due to the occupancy of 95.8%, which was 30 basis points lower than last year. Renewals in the quarter were up 5.7%, military spending remains strong in the area, but we are also facing several lease-ups in the downtown area. Qualcomm, Dan Diego seventh largest employer also just announced that they will be cutting just over 1,200 jobs in the market. And while this news is a negative for the market a quick search of our residence with suggests the impact of our portfolio would be minimal. Today our San Diego occupancy is 96.2% which is 30 basis points higher than the same week last year. Our base rents are up 3.9%, our renewals for April are at 6% and May is trending towards 6.0% ","So to summarize all you sitting here today, we continue to see strong demand and we are well positioned but leasing season. We have New York and San Francisco trending modestly ahead, Seattle and Orange County a bit behind and the rest of the markets on track and performing as expected.","In closing, I want to give a quick shout out to the entire equity team. Their excitement and readiness for this leasing season is felt throughout the entire organization. Their ability to deliver remarkable experiences to our residents is evident through our strong renew results, and tens of thousands of survey results received. Renewing our residents in the face of elevated supply remains the team's number one goal. Our sincere thank you to each of you that the work that you do each and every day. Thank you, David? ","David Neithercut","Thank, Michael. Angel will open the call for Q&A now please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go ahead for first question from Juan Sanabria of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Juan Sanabria","Hi, Good morning, thanks for the time. Just on the same store revenues, which you expected to trajectory some here throughout the rest of 2018, do you still see the decline in the second and third quarter mainly due to supply and when do you think same store revenue growth on a year-over-year basis will stabilize?","Mark Parrell","Hey, Juan its Mark Parrell. So the answer to that really depends on how the leasing season goes. And as Michael Manelis and David Santee just said, we're well positioned going into the leasing season, and so we would hope that our quarter-over-quarter number for the second quarter would be just modestly lower than the number we just reported and then the rest of the year to be approximately equivalent again if we have a good leasing season. If the leasing season is less strong than the numbers will decline towards the back half for year quarter-over-quarter.","Juan Sanabria","Okay. And then they declined is \u2013 quarter-over-quarter decline and you're saying is down on the year-over-year numbers 2018 versus 2017?","Mark Parrell","Yes.","Juan Sanabria","Okay. Got you. And then just on the upside and downside risk for the 2018 same-store revenue numbers, where is that risk is in a concessions in New York or with all Long Island City and Brooklyn supply. And if you could speak to that or what\u2019s more it represents to downside risk from here to the numbers? What will have to happen?","Michael Manelis","Yes, well. This is Michael. So I guess I would tell you that just based on the commentary, I mean, we have markets with elevated supply coming at us and we\u2019re entering the peak leasing season in the position were Orlando would be \u2013 but our risk clearly, I mean, we denoted that I think on the last call is New York. We also have LA with \u2013 as elevated supply and while it\u2019s doing well in the absorption and we\u2019re positioned well. Those are markets as we go through the peak leasing season that can have a lot of weight on a full year performance.","Juan Sanabria","Okay. How is New York and Manhattan being insulated as it is from supply in Long Island City and Brooklyn?","Michael Manelis","Yes. So again, we kind of look at this in a couple different ways \u2013 so we know the elevated supply is concentrated with 11,000 of the 19,000 units being in Brooklyn and Long Island City. And as we think about kind of that performance, we\u2019re looking at former residents, the forwarding address that they give us and I think, we said to-date, we have not seen any impact from Long Island city supply. We did a trailing 12-month view back in February and at that time, we had less than 1% of our move-outs, providing us with forwarding address in Long Island city. And we just updated that from a year-to-date basis that trend has continued with less than 1% of our move-outs having that address.","So to-date I would say, the absorption in both Brooklyn and Long Island city is better than what we expected. And it is not impacting the performance in Manhattan and even in our Brooklyn portfolio. Sitting here today for the quarter, we have better position than what we would have thought given the amount of elevated supply that we are facing.","Juan Sanabria","Thank you.","David Neithercut","You\u2019re welcome, Juan.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nick Yulico of UBS. Please go ahead.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. David Neithercut, I guess question on supply in 2019. I think you and a lot of others in industry have \u2013 as point to supply showing off in 2019 at some point, in terms of delivery, part of the data providers is showing that as well. However, we got some senses your update to national level that shows supply permits and starts from multi-family still doing a bit high since last week. So I guess, yes, how are you thinking about that latest as they came out, as it post some risk on the supply picture still being elevated through 2019.","David Neithercut","Well, I think that the data you\u2019re referring to \u2013 Nick is national data and the data we give you is that which we see where specifically not just on markets. But in the footprints that we believe compete with our assets. So nothing\u2019s changed from our perspective, with respect to supply we do seeing generally, significantly in some markets like New York. But generally, across our footprint notwithstanding what may be happening across the entire country.","Nick Yulico","Okay. And then just question on capital use, as I think, you had recently or are in the process of having your annual board meeting, where you talk about where you think NAV is for the stock and how that would take your capital strategies and I guess latest thoughts on how you think about it as some of the development pipeline is really slowed in spending as slowed as well. You reserves \u2013 the excess free cash flow there whether it goes to upgrade or did it then grows to stock buyback, other uses, how should we think about your order of priorities, right now?","David Neithercut","Well, let me first say it, that\u2019s not an annual conversation, it\u2019s a quarterly conversation with respect to my deployment of capital. And we did in fact have that in our most recent meeting in March. And Mark went through just the cash flow and as know the fact that their cash flow allocated to development is coming down considerably, which it does create some more optionality with respect to where to invest that. And we\u2019ve taken them through the choices and all those conversations are ongoing. Nothing is changed at the present time.","I think it\u2019s a \u2013 as I shared with the investment community on this call many times over the last year or so. We\u2019re certainly aware of where we trade relative to what the Street things and then what we think are NAV is. We have watched stock back in the past. We won\u2019t hesitate to do so in the future. But it\u2019s our belief of where kind of that discount needs to be relative to many others, as just a wider discount. So we would continue to have 13 million shares available under our announced plan and at the appropriate time, we won\u2019t hesitate to take advantage of that.","Nick Yulico","And I guess just following up lastly on that is, I mean do you think at some point of \u2013 if the stock had discount NAV, I mean, does it \u2013 do you think about selling even more to capitalize on what seems like so strong pricing in the private market versus where the stock is trading. And then also do you think about looking at perhaps some of the newer development you delivered where you don\u2019t have as much of a tax gain to deal with? And so perhaps that could be more attractive to sell some of the development, you delivered in New York City over the last several years for example.","Mark Parrell","Yes. Hey, Nick, it\u2019s Mark. I appreciate you starting by noting that assets we\u2019ve owned implicitly room for a while have a great deal of tax gaining in fact the $300 million or so. We sold in the first quarter, I have about $210 million of gains just to give you a sense of \u2013 when you own assets, you buy right, you hold them for a while, you do have quite a bit again in them as well as our frequent use of 1031 exchanges. In terms of selling newer assets, whether it\u2019s New York or San Francisco, I mean those assets we think are the ones that will drive long-term growth for the company and its shareholders. We feel at some extent that you\u2019re selling your seed corn. We\u2019d suggest to you that if we sell these better assets in bulk and that would affect our multiple at some point as well. So again, it\u2019s not something as David said the board are financially teams are willing to give, but it just isn\u2019t costless either to sell even the newer assets that have less been in them.","Michael Manelis","Yes. And I guess joining, I add to that. Nick is that the development that we\u2019ve done coming out of the great recession has been extraordinary profitable and notwithstanding the fact that it\u2019s brand new, we\u2019ve made a lot of money on those and there\u2019s a lot of built in gaining those assets as well.","Nick Yulico","Thanks everyone.","Michael Manelis","Thank you, Nick.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pawlowski of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","John Pawlowski","Thanks. Mark, I think last call you mentioned that 421-a burn-off in New York, it was got an increase 18 same-store expenses by 170 bps. Can you give us an update on what think were earn in that burn-off across your portfolio and will that impact a grow moderate or stay pretty consistent over the next couple years?","Mark Parrell","Hey, John thanks for the question. Just to clarify the 1.7 percentage points of the fact is to real estate tax number, not for overall same-store expense growth, so just to give you a sense of that. That outcome will persist for a while. We have about 1.7 to 1.8 percentage points for the next three, four plus years in terms of these abatements burning-off. Again as I noted in the prior call, every increase in net abatement does certainly hurt us on same-store expense growth. But the assets become more valuable, the cap rate declined. So it\u2019s like you\u2019re paying off, any expense of loan of sorts. You are creating value in these assets. It\u2019s just not as visible to the P&L.","John Pawlowski","Understood. And moving on to the Boston development, right across the street in TD Garden is that stated to still start this summer. And then could you \u2013 if it\u2019s \u2013 could you just remind us late 2021 delivery, I think you mention a low 6% stabilized yield. What kind of rent and construction cost growth rates are you underwriting between now and then?","David Neithercut","You\u2019re correct on all that, John. And we\u2019re in the process of starting at, it will likely \u2013 I\u2019d expect that to be on the development schedule at our second quarter call. So we\u2019re now in the process of preparing the sites, the demolition of the garage. So we\u2019re for full steam ahead on the second quarter. So that is a $410 million of project. It is a \u2013 we do expect it will delivered in late 2021. And as you note, it is currently a low 6 or so \u2013 low 6% yield. On the construction costs, we are all sort of bided in. So we\u2019re not facing any meaningful \u2013 a lot of risk with respect to the construction cost and so I don\u2019t have at my fingertips, what we might be projecting for revenue growth there we feel very good about the market as Michael said in his opening remarks. But we\u2019re quite comfortable with that low 6% number.","John Pawlowski","Okay. And then I know you\u2019ve been working on a deal for the better part of a decade. So is that could fall in construction cost of fully loaded number of that contemplates, all of the LIBOR corresponding to the deal?","Mark Parrell","That contemplates all the capitalized costs that we\u2019ve been incurred during that timeframe. Yes, I bet your question.","John Pawlowski","Okay. Thank you.","Mark Parrell","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And your next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. David, you guys were active in the first quarter in terms of acquisitions and dispositions. Just wondering, if you\u2019re seen any change either in cap rates or buying interest across multi-family.","David Neithercut","No, Nick. We continue to see a great deal of demand for the product we\u2019re willing to sell as well as for the product that we\u2019d be willing to buy. There may not be as many bidders but there\u2019s certainly sufficient number of bidders to continue to validate the pricing in the valuations that we\u2019ve been looking after quite some time.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. So then guidance assumes 50 bps spread between the acquisition and disposition yield, most actually inverted I think 20 bps the other way in the first quarter. Was that something you need to the assets, if you sold relative to what you\u2019re expecting to sell remainder of the year?","David Neithercut","Yes. We sold a deal in the Upper East side of Manhattan had a sub-three cap rate, which had a big impact on the weighted average cap rate for all the dispositions for the quarter.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. And just finally on the good development that delivered, you increased the cost by about $20 million for amenity in apartment improvements. I just want to get your thoughts on why you did that and what the additional benefit of kind of increasing the scale of that loss.","David Neithercut","Well, we just felt that putting the hard surface flooring and upgrading the kitchen cabinets, doing the countertops rather, I think stepping up the overall quality of some of the amenities all made sense to continue to have some cost relative to the late addition of air conditioning into that property. So they were all things that we felt made a great deal of sense for that property just given more pricing, it is there today.","Nick Joseph","Thanks.","David Neithercut","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your question comes from Rich Hightower of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Rich Hightower","Hi, good morning everybody. First really quickly just to congrats the David Santee on a long successful career at EQR, just wanted bring that up. It\u2019s been a real pleasure working with you. So on to the Q&A here, really quickly within the embedded guidance for the year, where do new and renewal rents factor into the guidance range. What are you assuming for those metrics?","Mark Parrell","So for the full year, for the portfolio, the new lease changed guidance was at negative 60 basis points. Renewals were up 4.2%.","Rich Hightower","Okay, perfect. And then just back to the question on discounts in NAV and share repurchases. So coming out of the fourth quarter earnings call and then coming out of the Citi Conference. The stock was much lower than where it is today. I think the commentary was a little more forceful in terms of the discounts NAV, there was a board meeting coming up. If you don\u2019t mind give us a little sense of maybe if any thinking at the board level change from one-time period to the other in the fact that no shares were repurchased in the interim period. Just help us understand the thinking there.","Mark Parrell","I don\u2019t think there was any change in thinking Rich. Look at the board, I think very appropriately looks at the capital, Equity capital is very precious resource and while I understand the arithmetic just believe, again, that we\u2019ve done it in the past. And I think what we did in some of the stock we bought back in all 10-plus years ago. We were buying at 30% and 40% discount to replacement cost. That one only get limited opportunities as we\u2019ve talked about limited by sort of bites at this apple and we just felt like it was not appropriate at this time. I don\u2019t want for a minute to have anyone believe that we're unwilling to. I'm not sure anybody bought more stock backs than we have over the history of the company. As you know we returned a great deal of capital back to our shareholders in the big disposition strategy that we undertook in 2016. So these are \u2013 just there's not an unwillingness on our part, is just an \u2013 I believe that this discount needs to be greater than what it is today.","Rich Hightower","Okay. Thanks for that guys.","Mark Parrell","You're, welcome. Thank you, Rich.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Rich Hill","Hey, good morning guys. I'm sorry if you've disclosed this previously. Obscure fresh on what your rent to income ratios are across your portfolio?","Mark Parrell","Yes, we can. The number has been fairly consistent David.","David Neithercut","Yes. I mean \u2013 over the years we've always used kind of the same multiplier. So the percentages don't necessarily change over the past two years the most notable change that we've seen was in Seattle, where rents had grown but the absolute level of grants have been lower, but you've seen this influx of high paying tech jobs. So over the past two or three years Seattle was kind of come down in near \u2013 New York City which is our lowest at 17% of rent to income. Everything else is kind of in the 20s and we're at 22% rent to income to that.","Rich Hill","Got it.","Mark Parrell","That\u2019s been pretty consistent for quite some time. And in the low 20s given the portfolio we have today.","Rich Hill","Got it. And so when I hear those numbers, I don't see any issue with continued pressure to push rents you would agree with that?","Mark Parrell","Well not from an income standpoint.","Rich Hill","Yes, correct.","Mark Parrell","From a supply chain, but not from an income standpoint now.","Rich Hill","Got it. And one more question on the job front you guys have a really great chart. I guess on Page 27 on one of your recent decks, illustrating that your medium resident age is 33 and primarily focused on millennials. I'm curious how much is population migrations factoring into some of the job growth that you're seeing. You mentioned Boston, is it really job growth that\u2019s driving this or jobs becoming \u2013 or jobs coming, because you're seeing population migrations to certain markets. I came to think that given your millennial population you're in a really interesting position to maybe address that question?","Mark Parrell","Well, I guess my question will difference that makes. A lot of the businesses are going to the talent, and the talent is going to these high densities urban environments and so therefore the companies are having to go there. So \u2013 I mean we're just seeing very. very, very strong absorption of this new supply it negatively impacts pricing power, we believe that the tide will turn from 2019. But we're seeing an extraordinary absorption of this new product, certainly from millennials having and profound impact but as I \u2013 we have mentioned a lot of the our nearly 20% of our residents are 50 years of age and older. So we really do believe that we have appeal to anyone who's interested in living that sort of high density urban lifestyle.","Rich Hill","Got it. And so maybe putting on inside, are you seeing these signs of population migration out of New York City? We've heard anecdotally some of that, but we personally haven't seen a lot of evidence of it yet. Are you seeing any signs of population migration out of high cost areas?","David Neithercut","Well, I guess people try, if you look at the larger SMSA that may be the case, but that doesn't mean that you're not adding population in the urban core, but you may be losing population in some of these markets within the entire footprint of SMSA, but we continue to see what we think is increases in households in density in the urban core. I think Washington State is a perfect example. I mean much of the new construct has been in the district to district is now providing a lifestyle, but it not been available for a long time and you're seeing extraordinary growth within the urban core of the of the district.","Rich Hill","Got it. Really, really helpful guys. That\u2019s it from me. Thank you.","David Neithercut","Thank you, Rich.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","John Kim","Thanks, good morning. In New York the 32BJ, union of workers\u2019 strike was recently inverted have an agreement on salary increases. And I'm wondering how much of the Union impacted in your New York portfolio and also if you could just give us an update on what you think labor cost growth over the next couple years?","David Santee","This is David Santee. Yes. We\u2019ve seen \u2013 we renegotiated contract best part \u2013 if you want to call it elevated payroll growth for this year. We have a very good team that works very closely with 32BJ, hence lot of these 421-a buildings require unionized labor. As far \u2013 what was the second part of your question?","John Kim","Do you see this issue in other markets are there in New York?","David Santee","Just overall labor. I mean well \u2013 if you look \u2013 overall our labor costs in our industry we've talked about this for the past couple of years, but when you're building 10,000 units, 20,000 units in New York, you\u2019re creating tremendous numbers of jobs in our industry. I would tell you that with the impact of retail our ability to attract and retain our office folks has been fairly reasonable. But on the service side with levels of construction, some of the immigration issues, some of the high costs in some of these urban cores it becomes more challenging do to attract and retain the service side of the equation. So when you look at our overall salary growth this year I mean office, administrative function is very much in line, but we're seeing the elevation on the service side.","Mark Parrell","And John just to give you some more detail, it's Mark for New York. If real estate taxes were really driving. So New York reported a 5.3% quarter-over-quarter number. They did an exceptional job managing payroll in New York and it was flat for the quarter. It was really about real estate taxes being up 13% and dragging that number up.","John Kim","Okay. Thank you for that. And then turning to the development pipeline, it\u2019s now stands at $1 billion which is less than half, it was the couple years ago, and it\u2019s very consistent with what your guys saying. But how low are you comfortable with the pipelines going to give the core confident competency, but development cost remains elevated.","Mark Parrell","Well. Its $1 billion pipeline, but what is truly under construction is meaningfully less than that. I mean we're comfortable having that development pipeline be whatever it needs to be. That allows us to commit capital in appropriate sort of risk adjusted manner. Development remains core competency, we've got terrific group of development folks in each of our kind of core markets they continue to look at product for us, and it\u2019s difficult to actually justify any sort of transactions today. They do other work for us, they've been involved in capital projects deals, and they even work underwriting potential acquisitions. So it's a group of people of resource that will retain, and we'll look forward to building that business back up, but only if we want to make sense to do so. We're not going to change products just because we've got folks who would like to be building it. We put those folks who work and doing some other things in addition to them underwriting product and all the time will come and we\u2019ll look forward to doing that business backup.","John Kim","Great. Thank you.","Mark Parrell","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Alexander Goldfarb","Thank you. Yes, David discussed, best in your next and the assume that your handicap will improve. Just two questions. First, David Neithercut you mentioned the Sub 3 on the UPREIT side which sounds like that asset had a lot of growth in it. So if you can comment on how you think about selling assets that may have a lot of embedded growth and how that effects FFO growth for the company, but also given \u2013 I would assume the desire to have a mix of assets in your markets of As and Bs. How selling an asset like this fits into that strategy of trying to straddle a number of price points to maximize the portfolios performance.","David Neithercut","Well. I guess you presumed there's a lot of growth in that because of the cap rate. Obviously we feel it was less a growth in that \u2013 and that the asset and perhaps the buyer did at. I think that there's a great deal of demand across the space today for \u201cvalue add product\u201d and I think this fits squarely in that. While we're certainly capable of undertaking that work ourselves, oftentimes we think someone will pay us a nice premium to take better risk and work on them and this is one of those situations.","And then just, I mean take an example of the kind of trading that we've communicated the street that we're \u2013 they should expect us to be doing by selling assets that we believe will be slower growth and reallocating that capital hopefully assets that will be higher growth. And it be interesting to note that we were under contract to buy another asset a much newer asset in the New York metropolitan area, not in Manhattan specifically but in the New York metropolitan areas. So it's not a retreat from New York but it\u2019s just the reallocation of the capital in New York. And what we own properties across sort of the spectrum in terms of quality, we're not \u2013 I like to consider ourselves as agnostic in that regard, well certainly we've got a lot of very good quality property, we also do have these and perhaps even a season where the process of bringing to be. So we're happy to invest across the spectrum.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then the second question is. You guys have 25% of your exposure in California the rent control proposition seem to be gaining steam. So if you could just comment one on how you guys are viewing it, efforts and your thoughts on if this does succeed how this impacts the growth profile of your California assets?","David Neithercut","Well. California does represent a meaningful share of our invested capital one of our revenue and net operating income and we were working very closely with the group that includes other public reach and other large private owners of multifamily. To address this referendum to appeal the cost of Hawkins' law. And for those who are unfamiliar with that, cost to Hawkins's is the law in the state of California that limits rent control only up to be delivered before February 1995. And it restricts, it actually requires vacancy decontrol on those properties are subject to rent control. So it's important to note, the rent control exists in California today, and municipalities can adopt rent control today, it is just subject to cost of Hawkins.","So while we certainly don't think the repeal cost of Hawkins's is a good thing, we also don't think that it's a disaster, because you can have rent control today many, many, many municipalities have decided or opted not to. And in those that have actually been on the ballot measures over the past several years many, many of those have actually been defeated. So it's certainly something that we're watching very closely. We\u2019re aligned with the our peers and others that have got to significant investments in multifamily in California and also to see where it goes.","Alexander Goldfarb","But you have a view on what do us with the rent profile? Your growth?","David Neithercut","Well, again may cost to Hawkins is not introducing rent control. So the fact that cost to Hawkins is repeal does not mean every municipality which we operate will automatically adopt rent control. So most of our cost to Hawkins has to be repealed and then municipalities have to decide whether or not they want to adopt some form of rent control an option that they currently have, but again I mentioned many of them don't. So it's very difficult to sort of tell you what the impact would be. I could tell you if you wanted to ask them keep a particular municipality adopted rent control what that impact might be, but this sort of suggests would be an entire state would be impossible.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Omotayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Omotayo Okusanya","Yes. Good morning. Two quick ones from me. First one I just wanted to confirm for the quarter interest in other income was about $5.8 million. It seems to be like someone time item and then could you just let us know what that was and whether that being backed out of normalized FFO per share?","David Neithercut","Thanks, Tayo. Here is a schedule we prepare for that on Page 22 and those are lawsuitsthat were settled in our favor relating to some development activities, but we do take those out of those recoveries in our favor out or normalized FFO and that is on Page 22 that $5.3 million almost all of that is really that nature.","Omotayo Okusanya","Okay. All right. That\u2019s helpful. So that\u2019s number one. And then number two, heading into spring leasing season. I know it\u2019s just a April assets point, but any insight assets point, that you can give into a new lease rent growth. I mean its sound like it was negative again in 1Q and just some sense of if it\u2019s possible for it to turn positive in 2Q or given the supply constraint just to kind of processor making that\u2019s a statement.","Michael Manelis","Yes. So this is Michael. I do want to started out and I wanted to share \u2013 I do not believe that looking at the results for just the first quarter is the best way to think about, there\u2019s new lease change metric. I will tell you that every market others in Seattle and Orange County was on track or slightly ahead with our Q4 \u2013 Q1 forecast, even though those were negative numbers. And really there has been no change to our full year new lease guidance assumptions that we shared in the investor presentation back in March.","I can also tell you that Seattle and Orange County, which we talked about. We\u2019re also offset by greater than expected performance on the renewal side. And since the volume of transactions during this quarter is low, a lot of this stuff can change on us. We start moving through the leasing season. And I think what you just alluded to if you just go back to some of the commentary for each one of these markets. We are on like our eighth consecutive week of incremental rent increases, week over week over week and that absolutely manifest itself into improvement in this new lease change.","But sitting here today like we look at that every single week, this last week we were positive. Doesn\u2019t mean that that friend old, it doesn\u2019t mean that it can\u2019t get even more positive, but that those are the kind of indicators that we have right now in the fact that rents have been moving up, kind of do help fuel performance on the new lease change metric.","Omotayo Okusanya","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","David Neithercut","You bet, Tayo.","Operator","Your next question will come from Dennis McGill of Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.","Dennis McGill","Hi, thank you guys. First question, so just carrying forward on the new lease questionnaire, I appreciate the clarification. But do you have what the new lease \u2013 in the first quarter and then how that spans across markets.","David Neithercut","Yes, sure. So I\u2019m just going out kind of rattled off I will tell you for the entire portfolio same-store we were negative 2.6%. And I\u2019ll just move kind of market by market real quick. So Boston was down 4.2%, New York was down 5%, Washington D.C. was down 4.8%, Seattle was down 4.5%, San Francisco down 1.5%, Los Angeles was positive 20 basis points, Orange County was negative 40 basis points, San Diego was positive 50 basis points. And again I just want to make sure everybody realizes that standalone quarter is not a really good indicator and I think we\u2019re more relevant as whether or not the assumptions for the full year are changing based on what has occurred in the first quarter and outside of that trajectory for Seattle and Orange County, I will tell you these are exactly where we expected them to be.","Dennis McGill","That\u2019s very helpful. And just for comparison sort of minus 2, 6 across the whole portfolio that\u2019s comparable to what you just referenced has been slightly positive in the most recent week.","David Neithercut","Yes. So I don\u2019t have that in front of me, but I think we were positive 20 basis points for the last week for the entire portfolio and that will be saved metric.","Dennis McGill","Okay, thank you. And then second question, can you maybe to share what you\u2019re hearing and seen with respect to capital availability for the development side.","David Neithercut","Well, I think everybody just only has sort of anecdotal sort of things about that. Dennis, I can tell you that we have received \u2013 so our investment team has received inquiries about our interest in providing some equity capital for developments from sponsors that never would have called us 12 or 18 months ago. We\u2019ve just \u2013 we\u2019ve seen, we\u2019ve heard about things being marked all and things being put on the back burner et cetera. Now that doesn\u2019t mean that well capitalized people can\u2019t find the capital. Can\u2019t find the institutional partners, we\u2019ve heard of some big institutions sort of stepping aside. Mark can you talk about maybe other debt side.","Mark Parrell","Sure. So what we\u2019ve seen is generally steady, ability of developers who are able to obtain equity to finance themselves in the debt market. At this point, we see some banks for example, Fifth Third just announced that they are reducing their multifamily lending, the other banks we survey generally say they\u2019re going to be in about the same places, they\u2019ve been in the recent past. There may be a touch more focus on suburban deals that are tending to pencil better.","So that they're doing a little bit more development in the suburban areas that are being financed, but it doesn't seem that the banks are the restrictor at the Equity. Because the banks are only loaning it, 50% to 60%, so it's easy for them to make that loan and feel confidence, the Equity that set material risk. It get us really quickly. I mean, if you just have a situation where development costs continue to rise, rental rates continue to be pressured, yields, note to yields getting compressed and adjusted. We just think it's going to a point, where a lot of equity is having their sidelines.","Dennis McGill","Okay. And just follow-up with \u2013 if you look at the non-bank resources. Is there anything that would vary from what you just talked about sort of this stable availability?","David Neithercut","Yes, there is more. And there is certainly more involvement from them. But they're capital so expensive that they're more of a substitute for that for the equity than they are for the deck. And again, they are pretty pricey alternative. So again, well the cost pressures, we just see this general cracking down of yields and IRRs in with revenue growth being modest across the country. We do just generally feel like those numbers are just not going to add up and we would expect them to decline over time.","Dennis McGill","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Wes Golladay","Hi, guys. Just a follow-up to that last question. Have you expect to see a meaningful uptick in current developers getting in trouble, the whole backdrop are right in cost, higher financing costs delay. What you seeing on the ground?","David Neithercut","I guess we've not seen much, really if any of that at least at this juncture. As we mentioned earlier, the products, projects that have been delivered are being absorbed. They may not be achieving the rental rates that they might have expected. But they're being absorbed and my guess is that there being they're far from being in distress. They may not be making their every return that they had hoped. They may not be able to refinance out every sort of nickel of construction loan that they had had hoped. But I mean, we're a long way fighting from this distress in the space, just given the \u2013 a very, very strong demand that we're seeing for good quality multi-family today.","Wes Golladay","Okay. What if we fast-forward, call it two years from now, if you\u2019re having a hard time penciling in developments and I\u2019d say you have a purpose superior to your cost of the capital, you just raised that around 3.6 pertained to your money. You see the people are going to bode down the date getting that any issues?","David Neithercut","I mean, again, if they're breaking ground today and they're being finance, as Mark said, it 50% or 60% there. They're not going to be distressed, they may not achieve their equity returns. But they will not be in distress.","Mark Parrell","Yes, just to give a little color around that. We're seeing spreads of 250 to 300 basis points above LIBOR. LIBOR is around 2%, we call it 450. You imagine that rates are up 2%, you could have a situation where the debt rate of developer is staying at 6% and 6.5%. That said, there are underwriting the debt yields of 7% or 8%. So I think the lenders are \u2013 at 50% leverage are probably okay. I think the equity, we will get pinched at some point and you feel it. But I think the lenders at this low leverage. Frankly, as David said, probably in adequate position or coverage.","Wes Golladay","Okay. And then looking at the deliveries for the peak leasing season, that share many of the markets. Do you see any risk at least \u2013 at some markets, where it will be \u2013 can be pushing at the back half of the year, where it's not ideal?","David Neithercut","Any of the new product being pushed in the back half of the year, there is plenty of product being delivered every quarter, that it's \u2013 whether or not something's opens their doors, 30 or 60 or 90 days later than expected is not going to be a windfall for the states. I mean, there's just \u2013 a lot of product kind of coming and when something opens its door, I\u2019m not choosing have much of an impact.","Wes Golladay","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks. Obviously, you guys are reforming the portfolio from a geographic perspective last year. And I\u2019m just curious, if you\u2019re the board had any thoughts about reconsidering markets. Are you pretty contend on kind of the markets you\u2019re currently in?","David Neithercut","I think the board asks us Steve, on a regular basis to sort of test our thesis and it have asked us repeatedly, if you were to add some additional markets, what might they be? And why are you not entering those today? If you look at the heat map, we've shared in all of our brochures that there are certainly some markets that on some characteristics. Look I think very attractive for one reason or another either too small or single-family home ownership is price of single family homes as is too cheap or whatever. But we are not committed, we\u2019re not choose to lose stone, where we are if it makes sense for us to add another market or two. We won't hesitate to do it and we continue to do that work to determine whether or not that's meant in our shareholders' best interests or not.","Steve Sakwa","David, could you just maybe share with us kind of the one or two markets that you might go back into where and would you go into that through acquisition or through development?","David Neithercut","Well, look, I guess, one of the things that we have to be thoughtful about Steve is just given our size for us to go \u201cinto a market\u201d. We've acquires a very meaningful amount of capital to have it make sense for Michael and his team and for investment team and for all the support that one needs to give. So my guess, if we went into a market, it would be with a hopefully, some sort of portfolio acquisition that would then be supplemented by one-off acquisitions. And certainly, we would consider development. I would say that Denver is a market that when we exited that market as part of the large sale of the assets to various \u2013 Starwood several years ago.","We\u2019d always consider that not to be a market exit but rather to be a portfolio exit. It was a portfolio of 30-year old quite suburban, surface park walkup kind of product that we knew we would not own long term. We did not see at the way at the time. So having this sort of portfolio that we want to have in that marketplace and so we took advantage of what we thought was very attractive pricing to sell those assets. And it's certainly a market that we would consider going back into if I want to make sense to pick so.","Steve Sakwa","Great. Thanks very much, appreciate the time.","Operator","Gentlemen, there are no further question at this time. I\u2019d like to hand it back over to Mr. McKenna for closing remarks.","Marty McKenna","And I will thank you very much everyone. I'll let you know that David Santee will be in attendance at the NAREIT's meetings in New York and you'll all get a chance to say a goodbye and wish David well and we look forward to seeing everybody at that meeting in June in New York. Thank you so much for your time today.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Please go ahead.","Marty McKenna","Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's full year 2017 results and outlook for 2018. Our featured speakers today are David Neithercut, our President and CEO; David Santee, our Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Parrell, our Chief Financial Officer.","Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.","And now I'll turn the call over to David Neithercut.","David Neithercut","Thank you, Marty. Good morning everybody. Thank you for joining us for today's call. We are pleased to have delivered operating and financial results for 2017 that were at the high end of our original expectations for the year. Now obviously a lot of things had to go right for us to do so, because it required every market to achieve our absolute best case level of performance for the year and stayed one that\u2019s pretty much exactly what happened.","Naturally as we began the year we were quite cautious, about the elevated levels of new supply across our markets, which had begun to impact landlords pricing power in 2016, ending several years of above trend performance that had been driven by extremely favorable supply and demand conditions, as we emerged from the last downturn. However, while revenue growth certainly slowed as compared to prior years, several factors allowed us to mitigate the impact of this new supply and outperform our original expectations.","First as everyone is keenly aware, there is clearly very deep and very resilient demand for apartment living in our urban and highly walkable suburban markets, which continue to be powered by an expanding economy, which has driven employment -- unemployment to record lows and is ignited wage growth that had been dormant for much of the recovery.","As David Santee will explain in more detail in just a moment, the second factor for our success in 2017 was the relentless focus on our prospects, our residence and our properties, by our property management and operational teams and everyone else across our enterprise that supports those teams.","Our 2017 performance was the result of everyone, working as one team, providing remarkable service to our residents and sweating every detail. This was a job very well done across the enterprise and I'm extremely proud and honored to give a hardy shout out to the mall.","However, we don\u2019t get to celebrate our successes for too long, because as these teams know all too well, 2018 will bring more of the same. New supply will continue to be delivered across our markets, which will continue to pressure new lease rates, occupancy and retention. Fortunately all signals continue to point to further economic expansion, corporate earnings continue to grow and the corporate tax cuts are encouraging companies to deploy capital and increase wages, which are very, very good signs for the apartment business.","There is no question that demand for our high quality rental properties will continue to be extremely strong. Our residents will see their wages increase and will have more after-tax money in their pockets, as a result of the new tax act, while still being disinterested or unable to afford single-family homes the cost at which continue to rise in our already high single-family market, high cost of housing markets. It won\u2019t be easy, but you can count on EQR teams across the country to continue to perform at highest levels and deliver optimum results in the New Year.","David Santee will now go into more detail of our 2017 results, and how we expect our markets to perform in 2018. And then Mark Parrell, will give some color on operating expenses, our earnings guidance for the year, and the various assumption that support this guidance. David?","David Santee","Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. A year ago, when we laid out our guidance for 2017, I told you that our teams are keenly aware of the challenges before us, and I was 100% confident that they would go above and beyond to deliver in 2017. They did and I'd like to recognize those efforts, which allowed us to keep revenue growth at the high-end of our original guidance and expense growth that came in well below the bottom end of our guidance.","In a new supply environment like this one, we know that our customers have many choices, but despite these above-average levels of new supply across all of our markets, our teams were able to deliver 4.6% renewal rate growth, while achieving the lowest resident turnover in the history of our company. They also continued to improve our customer loyalty scores, which have increased 25% over the last couple of years. And we did this while, also seeing our employee engagement scores remain at peak levels and our property employee turnover decline.","Our wining culture and the desire to deliver our best will be called upon once again in 2018, as we face another year of elevated supply. And so our 2,000 operating strategy is very simple. Hit the replay button and keep a laser focus on our customers and employees. Renew and retain combined with market pricing discipline will be the key drivers in our ability to deliver 2018 revenue results that are very similar to 2017.","Now moving on to the markets, I\u2019ll focus my comments on the assumptions that make up our full-year forecast on a market-by-market basis. These include new lease growth rates, the expected renewal rates achieved and the percent of contribution to same store revenue growth that together get into the midpoint of our full-year guidance. I'll also discuss what we see in the markets today and provide color on the new deliveries and how much or little we expect them to impact us based on our geographic footprint.","So I will start with the markets and we expect to have the most positive impact to our 2018 revenue growth and finish up with New York, which will have a negative impact. Before I get to the specific markets, a note on the impact of tax reform, while it\u2019s too early to make any conclusions about the impact of the new tax plan, our map in both California and New York, our average single resident will be saving about $2,000 annually and our average married couple about $3,500 annually. Also the new reforms appear to make homeownership look marginally more expensive. ","First, Los Angeles, which produced 3.6% revenue growth in 2017, which was in line with our original expectation. We got there from better than expected renewal growth, which offset lower than expected gains on new leases. In 2018, we expect Los Angeles to produce revenue growth of about 3.25% for the year and contribute approximately 35% of our portfolio wide revenue growth.","With the national economy appearing to be firing on all cylinders, LA is expected to see improved job growth in 2018, which should help drive strong absorption of the estimated 14,000 new deliveries. Announcements by Amazon, Apple and others have taken again larger chunks of office space in Cargo [ph] City bode well for both downtown and West LA.","With the favorable geographic mismatch in the new supply versus our footprint, we are forecasting 96% occupancy, 5.2% renewal rate growth and new lease gain of 75 basis points. West LA, the North, and East suburbs will be the strongest as these submarkets will see virtually no new supply. Downtown, Koreatown and up through Glendale past [indiscernible] we\u2019ll see the bulk of all deliveries, however at a much higher price point to much of our existing portfolio.","In 2017, San Francisco produced 2.2% revenue growth, which was better than we expected, but not beyond what we thought could happen. The growth here was again proved better than expected renewal growth. In 2018, San Francisco appears to be on very solid ground and takes the number two position contributing 20% to 2018 revenue growth, with total new deliveries on par with 2017, and spread similarly across the same submarkets. Very strong demand has positioned us for good start to the year.","With the new corporate tax plan taking hold, many announcements of tech expansion in the Peninsula and South Bay San Jose are very encouraging for maintaining solid absorption. With deliveries front loaded for the year and current occupancy better by 60 basis points versus last year, we checkmark San Francisco as the market that has the most potential to surprise to the upside. Our 2018 forecast has this market producing revenue growth of approximately 1.75% with occupancy for the full year at 95.8%, renewals up 4.1% versus the 4.3% growth in 2017 and flat growth on new leases versus the negative 1.7% for 2017.","On to Seattle, where the 5.6% revenue growth we produced in 2017, driven by good absorption of new supply, candidly [ph] be cautious forecast. We saw both new leases and renewals in this market perform better than expected in 2017. Now in 2018 Seattle will be our third largest contributor to growth at 16%, driven mostly by our strong embedded growth in the ramp up. But as we start 2018 we are more cautious as a result of the concentrated and elevated supply in all of the urban submarkets and the persistent moderation of new lease rent since the announcement of HQ2. ","In Q4 2017, rumors of hiring freeze at Amazon appear to play out with the number of job openings hitting their lowest level in years at 3,000. As recent as last week however, open jobs have rebounded to 3,600 and demand in the recent weeks has been good or average, but is yet to be consistent week over week. Occupancy and exposure are on top of last year however notable moderation in new lease ramp remains.","With that said, our forecast for 2018 is for this market to produce revenue growth of 3.25% versus the 5.6% growth we achieved last year. For 2018 we\u2019re budgeting new lease growth up 70 basis points, we\u2019re holding occupancy flat, renewals up 5.4% versus the 2017 achieved growth of 7.5%.","The Washington DC was the only market in our portfolio that did not meet or beat our expectations in 2017. We produced revenue growth of 1.3% in DC in 2017 as the uncertainty in the market caused by the political environment slowed activity early in the year. In 2018 DC is expected to contribute 11% of our revenue growth as the continued improvement in economic conditions is only sufficient to absorb the level of new deliveries at flat to slightly negative rental rates.","With federal government, which makes up a third of the metro economy not growing the private sector will need to be the fuel that creates outsize demand, a necessary variable to achieve rent growth that is closer to long-term averages.","With almost 12,000 new units expected, the concentrations in the district submarkets of Nomad, Central DC and the Riverfront will continue to pressure new lease rents in much of our footprint. The RBC Corridor and Alexandria will see little new supply this year and that should add some stability to full year revenue growth. Our expectation for 2018 is revenue growth of 1%. We expect occupancy to be flat at 96.1, renewals the same as 2017 up 4.1% and slight improvement to new lease gain at negative 1.9% versus the negative 3% we realized in 2017.","In 2017 Boston produced revenue growth of 1.6% in line with our expectations. We did better than we expected on renewals and occupancy, which offset some softness in rates. In 2018 we expect Boston to contribute 10% of our revenue growth and like last year Boston will deliver 4,500 new units spread across the same metro submarkets with a slight increase in Cambridge. The City will see deliveries front loaded, while Cambridge is back loaded and expected to have a greater impact in 2018.","Good news continues to be abundant in Boston as many of the large technology and biotech firms continue to take down large swaps of office space, as well as companies like Phillips who are relocating headquarters. All told 2,000 high paying jobs will be moving to Cambridge alone, which should continue to support good absorption rates with minimal pricing power on new leases. ","We expect this market to produce revenue growth of 1.6% this year similar to what it delivered in 2017. Forecast for 2018 hold occupancy flat at 95.8%, renewals slightly less than 2017 up 4.3% with marginal improvement in new lease gains of minus 1% versus minus 1.7% in 2017. ","Orange County and San Diego are two smallest NOI markets. Both had very good years in 2017 delivering revenue growth of 4.7% and 4.6% respectively. Again better than expected renewal growth and occupancy led the way in these markets. In 2018 they should produce our best revenue growth, but due to their size will contribute the least to our overall growth at 9% each.","Orange County will see a slight reduction in new deliveries that will come online evenly across next four quarters, while San Diego will see an increase of 3,700 deliveries that are front loaded. New deliveries in absolute term should be easily absorbed without pricing disruption, steady job growth coupled with increase in single family home prices continues to fuel demand in excess of supply that allow these two markets to achieve above average trend revenue growth.","We expect both markets to deliver 4% revenue growth in 2018. Occupancy forecast for both markets are 96.2% with renewals up 5.9% and 5.4% for Orange County and San Diego respectively. New lease growth is expected to be 2.1% and 2.2% respectively.","And then closing with the Big Apple, in 2017 this market exceeded our expectations by producing revenue growth of 10 basis points. Driving by a less use of confessions than expected as well as better than expected renewal growth and occupancy. We continue to be very pleased with the pricing discipline that the market showed in 2017 and that we continue to see today.","In 2018, this market will deliver elevated supply approximately 19,000 units in our competitive footprint. 62% of this new supply is in Long Island City and Brooklyn. As we've discussed previously the unknown in New York City is at the level of new supply in Long Island City will begin to attract meaningful demand for Manhattan.","Long Island City we see around 4,000 new units come online in the first half of the year with total expected 2018 deliveries of a little more than 6,200 new partners. Brooklyn, a more desirable burrow will almost 4,800 new units with over 1,800 in downtown and 1,400 in Williamsburg. East Brooklyn will see 1,300 new units that are counted separately from Brooklyn.","Brooklyn has developed into a destination location and its downtown has been completely transformed. But it only grew for Manhattan lenders seeking value, while Long Island City is far behind in neighborhood amenities and night life. The risk of increasing concessions and the potential to bleed into Manhattan pricing is only one great stop away. A short train ride for a 15% to 20% discount on risk on rent is a risk that we cannot yet quantify.","Manhattan alone has almost 4,000 new units coming online in Midtown West and Gramercy and the Hudson Waterfront Jersey City sub market another 2,000. With peak supply in 2018 and job growth for the year forecast to be below 2017 levels, we continue to be cautious for New York. We expect to produce same store revenue of minus 75 basis points in this market in 2018, which will results in New York making a negative contribution of 10% to our portfolio wide revenue growth.","Occupancy forecast is 96.1%, renewals at up 2.5% and new leases at minus 3.7%, which is a 50 basis point improvement to 2017. We were conservative in our estimate in regards to the amount of concession we thought we would have to use in 2017 and ended up using less than we budgeting. We begin 2018 with the similar level of conservatism on concessions.","In closing, all of our markets will see alleviative levels of new supply, but demand remains very good. Job growth continue to be solid and we are optimistic that the new tax plan will be a very good stimulus to improving the overall economy and the incomes of our customers.","Our employees are some of the best and brightest out there and they know how to do things right. But more importantly when to do the right things for our customers and our business that in the end will produce optimal results for our shareholder.","And again a big shout out to all of our employees out there, I know that you can hit that reply button and do it again in 2018. Mark?","Mark Parrell","Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. And I want to take a few minutes this morning to talk today about our same store expense, normalized FFO and capital expenditure guidance for 2018. Before I launch into some detail on our 2018 same store expense guidance range of 3.5% to 4.5% I want to give some context. Our lower than expected full year 2017 same store expense increase of 2.7% versus the 3.2% that we expected has set up a relatively difficult comparable period for 2018. ","We have also benefited from a modest 2.7% average annual growth rate of same store expenses over the past five years. Switching now to 2018, our same store expense growth this year will be driven as it usually is by growth in our big three expense lines, real estate taxes, on-site payroll and utilities, which together constitute almost 80% of our total same store expenses. On the real estate tax side, we expect an increase of between 4.75% and 5.75% with about 170 basis points of the increase coming from the 421-a burn off in New York. ","We face the tough comp in 2018, as we had better than expected success in some appeals in 2017, that brought the full year growth rate down to 3.2%, now is about 100 basis points lower than we originally thought back in February of 2017. Jurisdictions with the largest expected real estate tax expense increase in New Jersey and New York. For payroll expense, we expect an increase of around 5%, as we face continued pressure to retain our property level employees, especially in regards to maintenance salaries, which we see up over 6%, all in a very competitive labor market. ","Switching to utilities, we anticipate an increase of between 3% and 4% in 2018, after some very good years in this category you might recall we were up 2% in 2017, and we had decreases in both 2016 and 2015. We are now facing a tough comp and increases in trash and natural gas costs.","So now move over to normalized FFO guidance. Our range for normalized FFO for 2018 is $3.17 to $3.27 per share. Comparing our 2017 normalized FFO guidance of $3.13 per share to the $3.22 midpoint of our 2018 guidance, the major drivers are first, our portfolio of nine properties, totaling about 3,200 units in various stages of lease up, should create about $71 million in normalized FFO. As compared to 2017, this is an incremental contribution to our results of about $35 million or $0.09 per share.","Second, we expect to have a positive impact of about $0.04 per share from same store NOI growth in 2018 and offsetting this will be a reduction of about $4 million or $0.01 per share from our 2017 and 2018 transaction activity. Our guidance assumes that dispositions are relatively front end loaded, while acquisitions are relatively backend loaded.","Also on a negative side, we estimate an impact of about $4.4 million, and that approximates $0.01 per share from higher total interest expense, while we will benefit from our prepayment activity in issuance of new data at lower coupons, we will feel a large negative impact from significantly lower capitalized interest this year, because most of our development projects had now been placed in the service, as well as higher expected rates on our variable rate debt.","We\u2019ll also have a negative impact of about $0.02 per share from other items, including higher general and administrative costs and property management costs. Because G&A and property management mostly consist of compensation costs for off-site and corporate personnel, these line items are subject to the same cost pressures that I just mentioned as negatively impacting our on-site payroll number.","And then finally to our capital expenditure guidance, in 2018 we plan to spend approximately $210 million, which is about $2,900 per same store unit in capitalized expenditures, which is about 8.8% of same store revenue. And about one-third of this is for improvements that we believe are revenue enhancing. Included as revenue enhancing in the $210 million is our unit renovation program, where we expect to spend $60 million to renovate approximately 4,500 units at a cost of about 13,300 per unit and which we expect will produce returns in the low double-digits. ","Also providing a return is our spend of approximately $15 million to $20 million, on sustainability related projects like energy conservation through lighting and water retrofits, that both provide the company a strong 20% return as well as further our commitment to sustainability in all that we do. We will also continue our elevated spending level on customer facing projects, like lobbies, gyms and other amenities, to keep our extremely well located product competitive with new assets being delivered in our markets.","Over the last few years we've been spending between 7% and 8.5% of our same store revenue on capital expenditures. Even with the slightly elevated level of capital expenditures in 2018, the company should continue to rank as one of the very best in its peer group in terms of capital spending as a percentage of same store revenues. We still do expect that overtime, our capital expenditure spending will modestly decline as we complete some large ongoing projects and renovate a large proportion of our units and as competitive pressures abate.","I will now turn the call back over David Neithercut.","David Neithercut","Thank you, Mark. I want to spend just a moment addressing the transaction Mark in development activity. So across our markets there continues to be a very strong demand for multifamily assets regularly demonstrated by deal prints supporting all time high valuations despite slowing revenue growth and rising interest rates.","The sentiment across the space is that many investments remained under allocated to multifamily real estate and that a lot of capital is looking to be put to work in our space. In fact the annual NMHC meeting in Orlando several weeks ago attracted 6,000 registrants and by some estimates there were more than 8,000 attendees in total. Further evidence of the stability multifamily asset valuations can be found in our own disposition activity. In 2017, we sold five assets for $355 million and the prices realized were 102% of our internal valuations at the time and 105% of our 26 valuations of these same assets.","Now as recently as October last year, we thought we might get closer to our original guidance of $500 million of dispositions in 2017, but had more than $100 million of closings move into January of this year. And these assets will trade at 105% of our most recent valuation expectations.","Now with highly competitive demand for multifamily assets throughout 2017, we closed on no new acquisitions in the fourth quarter. And we closed on $468 million for the full year at a weighted average cap rate of 4.8%. Consistent with last year, we begin 2018 with an expectation for transaction activity of $500 million of acquisitions funded with $500 million of proceeds from dispositions. And like a year ago, we will only conduct this activity if it can be accomplished with the limited initial dilution and result in higher long-term total returns.","Now turning to development, it is becoming more and more difficult as land prices remain strong and the growth in construction costs continues to outpace rent growth significantly reducing development yields in all markets. Nevertheless development capital appears to still be available and around of abundant supply for the right sponsors with the right deals.","For the rest of them it appears that putting together a capital stack is becoming harder and harder. Our construction financing does remain available, but at lower advance rates and wider spreads, while requiring more capital support. To us, this all adds up to fewer starts and hence fewer deliveries in the very near future.","Now development remains a core competency at Equity Residential and we have development expertise in each of our markets that continue to underwrite new development opportunities for consideration. But the fact of the matter is that we have not acquired a land parcel for development since 2015 when we assembled the site for 238 units in downtown San Francisco.","Since then we've seen construction cost continue to escalate and revenue growth slow, resulting in development yield have forced us to the sidelines in taking down new land parcels. In the meantime, we've continue to work diligently to create value in our existing land inventory.","During the year we completed $584 million of development projects at a weighted average yield of 6%, which represents a 175 to 200 basis points premium to cap rates in today's marketplace. In 2017, we also started two development projects totaling $114 million where we are targeting 5% to 5.5% returns on cost, representing 75 to 150 basis points cap rate premiums.","Now at the present time, we have four development sites remaining in inventory, representing about $1 billion of total development cost and we currently expect to start the largest of these sometime this summer, because after nearly 10 years of extraordinarily hard work the team has all the necessary approvals to soon begin construction of a new tower on the site of our 50 year old parking garage located directly across the street from Boston's north station and the TD Boston Garden. ","At 44 Floors this 469 unit property will be Boston's tallest apartment tower, the fantastic views and located in exciting and growing Boston neighborhood. As I said, we expect to begin demolition of a garage sometime this summer and deliver the tower in late 2021 at a cost of $410 million, our current underwriting point to a stabilized yield in the low sixes. Now before we open the call to questions I want to quickly comment on the change in the company\u2019s dividend policy that we announce last night.","Coming out of the great recession with uncertain cash flow and an elevated level of development opportunities we adopted a conservative and totally transparent dividend policy pegged off of the midpoint of our initial annualized normalized FFO guidance. With our development spend reduced significantly we\u2019ll have a meaningful increase in uncommitted cash flow going forward and believe that increasing the distribution to our shareholders under this new policy is a very good use of cash at this time.","So with all that said, operator we\u2019ll be happy now to open the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Nick Yulico with UBS.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. David I just want to go back to the comments you had in the press release where you talked about the outlook in your coastal markets with high homeownership will soon improve significantly as new supply reduces. And I'm just looking to hear your view as to when you think this might happen if you\u2019re seeing any light at the end of the tunnel on supply in the second half of this year or is it more of a 2019 impact?","David Neithercut","Well we really look at 2019 deliveries Nick as the beginning of the reduction. In 2018 we\u2019ll still have 2017 deliveries that are spillover into this year and I will say in 2019 we will still have 2018 deliveries spillover. But the number of deliveries that we count as competitive to our assets we see diminishing considerably in some markets less so in others, but we do see kind of light at the end of the tunnel with elevated level of new supply beginning in 2019.","I'm not suggesting this going to zero, but clearly while we look at what we think will be and should be continued very strong demand we do see the supply we do see in 2019 and we believe that by that time we\u2019ll begin to see pricing power kind of return to the landlords.","Nick Yulico","That\u2019s helpful. And then on New York City in the past you\u2019ve talked about Long Island City Brooklyn is having the bulk of the supply delivering this year it feels like you\u2019re now saying that that competitive impact could be a little bit worse or at least your guidance is factoring some of that in. So perhaps you can just tell us more about how you thought about Long Island City Brooklyn pricing of the competitive new supply impacting your portfolio in terms of your guidance for New York this year? Thanks.","David Santee","This is David. At this point we have a lot of anecdotal stories, we have some examples of residents that move out of our communities in Brooklyn not to Long Island City, but after several months choose to move back. But as I said, I think, the long-term outcome of 6,200 units coming online is very hard to quantify. So we prepared for it last year certainly the number of units that are going to be delivered this year especially in the first half of the year are very, very elevated and we planned accordingly. And we hope the discipline stays in the market and owners remain picking to their guidance on profit.","David Neithercut","I guess I\u2019d add to that Nick that these developers that are delivering this product have not seen a lot of rent growth from their regional performance and for them to meet their expectation, meet their investments expectation, meet their refinancing expectations, they\u2019re going to be forced to toe the line on pricing. Now that doesn\u2019t mean that some of them will get aggressive and we may not -- we won\u2019t feel that, but I think that unlike what we experienced in San Francisco in 2016 there\u2019s not a lot of cushion for the pricing expectations of these few folks that are delivering these product in Long Island City and that maybe very well why we saw discipline throughout the market in 2017.","Nick Yulico","And just to follow-up -- that\u2019s helpful. So it sounds like you sacked in a fair amount of conservatism in New York relative to how this pricing impact could play out.","David Neithercut","Well I guess we\u2019re as conservative going into this year as we were last year and obviously we outperformed our expectations, not we\u2019re saying the fact that New York was the worst performing market, so this performance was all relative. We still expect New York to be our worst-performing market, but if pricing discipline holds throughout the marketplace maybe for the reasons that we have noted maybe New York could do better. But I will tell you, if there is a crack in the dike than we could have an outcome on the downside.","Nick Yulico","Thank you, David.","David Neithercut","You are very welcome, Nick.","Operator","And we'll go next to Juan Sanabria with Bank of America.","Juan Sanabria","Hi, thanks for the time. Just following up on Nick\u2019s question on New York, just hoping to better understand the same store revenue build where you guys are building in maybe potentially more concessions that you didn't necessarily see in 2017. If I didn't miss here, I thought you said, your expectation is for new leases down 3.7%, but you had a 50 basis point increase in 2017. So I was hoping you could just kind of walk us through that a little bit just to understand the assumptions on why you're starting out more conservative as you ended up in New York for 2017?","David Santee","Well, I think it's more driven by what potentially could happen in the summer months, a lot of these deliveries will come online, starting at the end of Q1 into Q2 that's when a lot of your lease expirations occur. The other thing is that, New York has the lowest turnover of any market. So consequently renew increases have a bigger impact and have more staying power in New York. So when a new lease turns over the drop and the difference between the current rent and the new lease rent is much greater.","So you\u2019ll just have more roll down in the rent rolled so to speak than we saw last year. And then we forecasted, we are prepared with the concessions we think are necessary should the market see pricing contagion with regard to concessions.","Juan Sanabria","And so I just wanted to follow-up on that 2019 supply comment. Any sense portfolio wide at this point what the expected decline in units across your competitive set would be looking at 2018 deliveries versus your initial expectations for 2019 at this point?","David Santee","I guess I would say 2019 numbers are definitely more bias towards the estimate than fact. But today, based on our boots on the ground and data that we reconcile through Axiometrics, we\u2019re showing almost a 30% decline in new deliveries in 2019 versus 2018.","David Neithercut","Now that being said, there are some markets that might be consistent deliveries 2019 over 2018 and -- but more significant drop in other markets. But as David said it\u2019s difficult to make a real call on 2019 in markets in which unlike New York where it doesn\u2019t you can take less than 24 so months to deliver product. Certainly New York, we have an expectation of a material decrease and I think we probably be pretty close for most anything to be delivered in 2019 it's got to be underway in some fashion today. And our guys are covering all this stuff very closely for us. ","Juan Sanabria","Thank you very much.","David Neithercut","You\u2019re welcome. ","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI.","Rich Hightower","Hey, good morning guys. ","David Neithercut","Good morning, Rich. ","Rich Hightower","So a couple questions here. So I want to follow-up on some of the market commentary and thanks for all the color during the prepared comments, it was very helpful. But just to stress test the guidance a little bit and you spent a lot of time talking about New York, but maybe some of the other markets just you know what generally would have to happen for you to hit the bottom end of the range versus the high end of the range? I mean, how do to you guys probability wait the different outcomes.","And then maybe further on those supply comment, I think we know with certainty that every time we look at these numbers at the beginning of the year the actual deliveries end up in some cases meaningfully less at the end of the year. And I'm wondering if you\u2019ve baked in that same sort of assessment to the way you've envision these markets to playing out in 2018.","David Neithercut","Well I'll let David answer the first part of your question. I'll answer the second. So if there is any meaningful change at the end of the year it\u2019s just because that product got pushed into the next year. And as I think we've talked about at one of our last calls. A lot of the data you look at is based upon when properties receive their final CO, and that doesn't necessarily mean that the opening of the door and their first availability for actually occupancy were pushed back any.","And we do track that very, very closely and we track not completions as defined by final CFOs, but when in each quarter or each month properties will actually be open for business and able to begin to compete with us actually thinking that occurs 60 or 90 days actually beforehand. So we've got our hand on the pulse of that competitive product. But as it relates to what kind of has to happen for us to be at the low end, I'll let David address it.","David Santee","Well, to be at the low end, we'd have to pretty much miss in every market. But I mean as you referenced, we do pressure test, I mean, the art of forecasting in a market is really the gut feel, which way the winds are blowing and that's why we kind a check mark San Francisco, I mean, we feel very good about San Francisco, the headlines are positive. We've had a strong start to the year probably our best last in the last three or four years.","So we feel that we consider all of the variables that San Francisco has very positive momentum. Relative to our forecast on Southern California, based upon where our properties are located, the general direction of the economy, we feel that it would be more difficult to outperform, but on the other hand lower risk to underperform.","Washington DC for the last three or four years it's been pretty much flat revenue growth. And there is uncertainty with the federal government and what the new budgets will look like that could pressure jobs. I mean, I think a quarter above jobs in DC are directly related to the federal government. So we see -- when we look at DC we see that risk we see continued elevated supply. ","And when you look at even the suburbs in DC is stretching far out the rest and what have you those markets are not generating revenue growth as well. So DC would probably be more at risk to the downside.","And then New York it just comes down to concessions. I mean, we feel very good about rates will do, what have you the number one variable with New York City is. As pricing remained disciplined and can we manage through these elevated supplies without new deliveries or lease up increasing concessions to a point where it creates contagion across the market.","Rich Hightower","That's helpful. Can you guys specify where you are in terms of an overall earn in so far for 2018?","David Santee","You mean embedded growth?","Rich Hightower","I'm sorry say that again?","David Santee","You're asking about sort of what we thought our embedded growth was beginning the New Year? ","Rich Hightower","Yes, that's exactly right.","David Santee","So for the portfolio it's 70 basis points. ","Rich Hightower","Okay. ","David Neithercut","Just might describe what that means, David. ","David Santee","Yes, so what we do is really just take the value of the rent roll for the portfolio on 12\/31 for the month, annualized that and divide it by full year 2017 that rent roll value. And that generates 70 basis points. So on the assumption that all other income components stay equal you would generate 70 basis points of revenue growth.","David Neithercut","Thank you. Do you have another question?","Rich Hightower","Yes, I do one separate question on the dividend. So after the prepared comments, just maybe give us a little more color to the decision there, how increasing the dividend and maybe making the policy a little more flexible compared to other avenues to return shareholder capital including share repurchases? And then Mark, I want to fold you into this as well, can you remind us where EQR is in terms of run rate, free cash flow versus the taxable income, dividend requirement and some of those other elements as we think about the calculation. So it's a bit of\u2026","David Neithercut","So maybe I think -- yes, that will be best maybe for Mark answer that question with the statistics and then I'll talk -- and I'll share with you how the Board thought about those as it change this policy.","Mark Parrell","So let's start with just free cash flow then talk tax and then David will interject the policy overlay. So the number to probably start with for 2017 is something around -- or 2018 pardon me is something around $270 million of cash flow after the dividend assuming the run rate dividend but we hadn\u2019t increased it. We have some additional CapEx and that we disclosed in the release. So that uses up $10 million call it. The incremental dividend is another $25 million use.","So now you are down of about $235 million, then you have development spending of $100 million to $150 million, it's closer to the high-end of that range because of the addition of the Boston Garden garage that David Neithercut describe in his remarks, which leaves you $80 million to $100 million of excess cash flow that now in our model effectively reduces debt.","So if you look, you'll see that we're paying down $1.2 billion in debt this year, but we're only issuing $900 million to $1 billion. So that difference is partly a draw on the line of credit, but it's also partly the application of this excess cash, at least in our model and guidance to repaying debt.","In terms of taxable income, we've got plenty of room. We distribute already significantly more than were required few under the re-tax rule. So every year just to give you an approximation we can sell about $400 million of assets and retain the cash without affecting our dividend policy, meaning without forcing the dividend higher.","With that I'll turn it over to, David.","David Neithercut","Yes, so with all in mind, I think, we have had conversations on these calls for at least the last year and certainly conversations with our Board for the same time period. Giving everyone the heads up that as our development starts were rolling down that as we were looking forward beginning sort of 2018, that we were looking at elevated levels of sort of uncommitted cash and discussing sharing with you all and sharing with our Board what are range of opportunities where with respect to that cash and one of those always was an increased distribution or annual dividend to our shareholders, which is resulted in this new policy.","We also did share with the Board that in doing so, that didn't preclude us from doing anything else with excess cash that by doing this that did not preclude us from buying stock back, did not preclude us from starting some additional development transactions like the deal in Boston that we've talked about or buying other deals or taking down new land. So this is just one way one that we\u2019re using this excess and we still have excess capacity to explore any other options and we think it's in our best interest to do so.","Rich Hightower","Okay. Thank you for those comments.","David Neithercut","You bet Rich, thank you.","Operator","We'll take the next question from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.","Richard Hill ","Hey guys, good morning. So I think there has been a few questions about this and just want to get a little bit of a better sense of cadence as you think about same store revenue growth between 1H and 2H. And it seems to me and I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth there seems to me maybe still some bumpy roads in the first half with improvement in the second half as we start to get pass this supply. Is that fair and could you give us any more color about that?","Mark Parrell","It's Mark, and I'm going to start and I think David Santee may end up contributing as well on some of the details. But that isn't quite right, sort of as we sit here in January, David talked about the embedded growth. We feel pretty comfortable with our level of first quarter growth and we came into 2018 with pretty good momentum. In 2017 and then this relatively good embedded growth that David Santee just mentioned.","In light of some of the upcoming supply headwinds and sort of increased move-in and move-out activity that you always see from us in the second and third quarter. We believe that sort of a step down in our numbers for the reminder of the year is prudent and is what is implied in our guidance.","So if you look at the way our quarter-over-quarter revenue numbers moved in 2017, there is likely to be a great deal of parallelism in how those numbers move in 2018. Now if we are able to hold occupancy and increase rate as the year progresses, or we utilized fewer concessions we may very well end up with the upper half of our revenue range. But at this early point of the year our guidance kind of is our reasonable best view of what can be achieved in the year.","Richard Hill ","Got it. And so that was sort of my follow up question I think there was a question about what would be the low end of the guidance range, but the top end of the guidance range might -- I think there\u2019s an expectation that pushing supply out in 2017 help you achieve the upfront of that range. This year it\u2019s going to be really driven by you achieving the top end of the occupancy range where supply is coming for the most part. Is that fair or how should we be thinking about it?","David Neithercut","Well, I mean, the stuff doesn\u2019t turn on and turn off, this is a -- supply is out there we\u2019re still dealing with supply delivered last year and there\u2019s sufficient supply now that is we\u2019re dealing with it and it doesn\u2019t -- there\u2019s not a first half and a second half. I mean, we do track when these things open every quarter, but the fact, the belief out there that somehow our performance this year was a result of new supply sort of being pushed back is just not correct. ","It\u2019s just that the markets performed better than we thought, the teams did a great job and it\u2019s not because for some reason there was not as much new supply as we might have thought at the new year. There\u2019s sufficient new supply in the marketplace that we\u2019re dealing with that whatever got pushed back. And again I note that pushing back is the pushing back of the completion not necessarily the pushing back of the delivery of new product that\u2019s competing with us.","Richard Hill ","Got it, that\u2019s really helpful. I\u2019ll follow-up offline with any additional questions, thanks guys.","David Neithercut","Thank you, Rich.","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Dennis McGill, Gilman Associates. ","Dennis McGill","Hi, thank you guys. Actually just clarifying that last statement David, so when we think about the comment earlier about 2018 supply being pretty similar to 2017, I think at this time last year you would have had more of an optimistic view that 2017 would have been the peak. So as you weigh what\u2019s different today versus a year ago as it relates to 2018. How much of the higher level of competition in 2018 is a reflection of 2017 stuff being delayed versus more being in the pipeline than was visible at this time last year?","David Neithercut","Yes, again it\u2019s forward not the latter I mean it\u2019s just and again I want to just emphasize this notion of delay. When properties are completed which is how everybody track this all the third party densities track this it\u2019s by completion, which is when they get their final CFO that does not mean that they were delayed in opening their own doors.","We had a couple of properties ourselves, and one in San Francisco last year and one in Seattle last year, that was delayed or the completion pushed back but the opening of the door, the day on which these properties became available for rent was not delayed it was simply the completion that was pushed back for various reasons.","And one of them we didn\u2019t get some street gate work done because of some issues with the city, but the property opened its doors it was available for lease right on time. So I want to just get away from the people thinking about the stuff was delayed, which means it wasn\u2019t competitive in 2017 it was competitive even though it was pushed back.","As we add up the completions of 2017 plus the completions of 2018 the total there really has been no change in our review and the way that we look at competitive product.","Dennis McGill","Okay. And then similarly as you talked about the very preliminary look into 2019 and the step down is that from the competitive side or from the actual completion side?","David Neithercut","The stats we would give you would be on the completion side. We do give you data that may not be the same footprint as the third party services, but it is defined the same way as the third party services.","Dennis McGill","Okay, perfect.","David Neithercut","Okay, because we don\u2019t look at say New York Metropolitan area we look -- we draw a different boundary and consider that product that we believe would be impactful to our market. But we do track completions in the manner in which I described you as completed in final CFO which is consistent with the third party service providers.","Dennis McGill","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then second question just as it relates to the fourth quarter sorry if I missed this, but do you have the renewal and new lease numbers for the fourth quarter and then maybe any color you can provide on thus far as well?","David Santee","Sure, renewals for Q4 were 4.6% and then lease over lease was minus 4.2%.","David Neithercut","Now as David has mentioned several times on these calls those new lease rates reductions always are sort of wider than on average, because you're often re-leasing units in the down of the winter versus the up in the summer. And so when people for whatever reason have to come in and term their lease, they leased it at the peak of the season where we got the highest pricing they\u2019re giving it back to us in the lowest time of the season. So it's not uncommon for that delta to be the widest when it\u2019s happening in the wintertime or in the fourth or first quarters and it also does not account for any prepayment penalty or cancellation fees that we might have received. ","David Santee","And then let me give you January and February renewal numbers. January, closed out at 4.6% on renewals, February thus far which is early and we would expect this number to jump up again another 20 basis points is 4.4%.","Dennis McGill","And the new lease on January?","David Santee","We don't track the new lease numbers on a month-by-month basis. ","Dennis McGill","Alright, thanks guys. Good luck. ","David Neithercut","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Conor Wagner with Green Street Advisors. ","Conor Wagner","Good morning, ","David Neithercut","Good morning, Conor. ","Conor Wagner","David Santee on the Bay area, could you break out your expectations by the three submarkets there, San Francisco, San Jose and open East Bay. ","David Santee","Well, let me say this most of our portfolio is in the Peninsula and South Bay, we have a few assets in the East Bay Berkeley that should do better this year. So really all I mean most of our assets in downtown San Francisco are still new store. So when you think about same store, it\u2019s really the Peninsula South Bay, which we feel should do very well as I stated in my comments. So the driver of the full market would be greatly influenced by Peninsula and South Bay.","Conor Wagner","And then within your Bay area forecast, what are you thinking about the impact of H1B and do you have any sense for how many of your residents are H1B holders?","David Santee","We measured that before, I mean, we really haven't seen any material impact from that, I mean, lot of the H1Bs were kind of the $60,000, $70,000 a year jobs, I think the -- we employees -- employers typically get sole security numbers and what have for the employees after they move in. So our proxy is really to kind of measure the number of residents that don't have a sole security number. And that numbers been consistent, but we really haven't seen any negative fallout from all the H1B headlines.","Conor Wagner","And you are not forecast anything really to change on that this year?","David Santee","No, I mean, the only thing that\u2019s changed really last year was this express approval process, I don't -- I think the actual number of visas really remained unchanged in the big scheme of things. So it's really more about I think they kind of all get approved in like the end of Q3 versus companies paying up $1,500 to $1,000 for this express approval, which I believe that was what was eliminated, the express approval.","Conor Wagner","Thank you. And then David Nethercutt you mentioned on development 5% to 5.5% return on cost and the spread that is their cap rates and the bid that you received on your dispositions with your stock trading at an above 5% implied cap rate. How attractive is even a small share buyback given you Mark Parrell that you have $400 million in annual capacity to do that?","David Neithercut","Not sure, we attract it at all at these levels and as you know by your own math, that you have shared with us that the after taxable gains and being balance sheet neutral there's just not a lot of capital left after dispositions to make a meaningful impact. And the impact that it has just generally on the enterprise going forward, we don\u2019t think it makes sense at these levels. That being said, we have bought stock back in the past and we won't hesitate to do so in the future. ","But levels at which we've traded off of that AZ today and this is about the level that we experienced six or so months ago. The management team here saying the Board just don't believe that the discount is enough to have it make sense particularly given the taxable gains that's embedded in the assets that we own today.","Conor Wagner","And so use of the free cash flow even like $100 million buyback doesn't look attractive to you?","David Neithercut","I think that that's an option with free cash flow. I guess, I was responding more to the notion of selling assets to buy stock back. There is not a lot of capacity there. But from the free cash flow perspective that is certainly a perspective use of that capital.","Conor Wagner","And how perspective?","David Neithercut","Well, I mean, it's just an option on the table. I mean, we'll act and we\u2019ll let you know when we act, and don\u2019t let you know ahead of time.","Conor Wagner","Thank you. ","David Neithercut","That's certainly an option that we have with that capital. But we've said for the last year it remains an option. And as I noted in a response to one of the earlier questions nothing that we've done with respect to the increased demand nor the commencement of this deal in Boston has precluded us from having ample cash capacity to do anything else.","Conor Wagner","Thank you.","David Neithercut","You bet.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Michael Bilerman with Citi. ","Michael Bilerman","Hey, it's Michael Bilerman here, with Nick. I'm curious David how you feel about sort of the overall private equity and just other money looking at multifamily in a large scale transaction. To-date a lot of that capital has gone to higher cap rate product, value add, secondary markets or southern assets, the assets. And pretty much everyone has been playing in that and may have been able to get the leverage and get pretty attractive ROE. If you think about the deal you did with Starwood in that sale do you think there is capital for a larger scale core type transaction of the product that you own today?","David Neithercut","That's hard to say, Michael. And I guess, I\u2019d first add that if notice the Starwood transaction I'm not sure anyone who still exists today has done more in that space than we have with the sale we did to Starwood. Anyone who might have done more doesn't exist as they've gone public to private. But we\u2019re a big company and it's hard to say just because Brookfield might think they can do some of the GGP doesn't mean that same level of capital is available to do large transactions. So, I guess, I believe that to you and other sort of pundits to suggest, it's tough for me to say. ","Michael Bilerman","I'm just wondering whether you see that now core building up in more assets in the markets that you have whether there is appetite that you're seeing from capital sources to buy that product, because most of the capital has been targeted towards higher yielding product. As this didn't know whether there\u2026","David Neithercut","I think most of maybe the big capital investments have been, but there has been plenty of one-off capital acquisitions of what we\u2019d considered to be core product. I mean, there are prints every day of core products that might not be billion, multibillion dollar transactions of core products. But we think that there is a lot of demand for at least one-off core product that continues to print on a regular basis showing very strong values in cap rates and freeze and certainly low 4s across our portfolio. Now whether or not that's available in scale which is your question, I just -- I can't comment, I just don't know.","Michael Bilerman","And your Chairman has been pretty vocal about as you on equity markets and also selling a lot in certainly he's doing that through on a real estate basis through ETC liquidating a lot of those assets. How does his views sort of translate into your strategy from an asset recycling perspective and narrowing this above average discount to your peers as well as above average discount just to pure NAV?","David Neithercut","Well, I guess if my math is correct, we've sold more in the last couple of years than ETC has not as a percentage of the company obviously. But I think the $6 billion sale we've done in 2016 is more than ETC and probably worth more than EQC\u2019s total valuation. So it may not represent as larger share in the company, but we\u2019ve been as active as anyone. ","Michael Bilerman","I'm not insinuating that you haven\u2019t done a lot of things I'm saying that\u2026","David Neithercut","No, I appreciate that I'm not suggesting you insinuate that, but I just think it\u2019s important to communicate to everybody else on the call to just kind of put some of these things in perspective. And so I think Sam obviously he had his view, much of his view of what you hear and talk about on Quark [ph] Box or Bloomberg or whatever is a general view. He has more of his network away from real estate than he does in real estate. I mean, it\u2019s just more of a sort of general view and obviously I have conversation with him more specifically with respect to Equity Residential. ","And I can tell you that Sam is not concerned at all about discount to NAV, his suggestion to us after having done the dispositions we did a couple of years ago and his understanding about the arithmetic relative to buying stock back at the current discount, which we believe was insufficient Sam says go run your business, he plans something around for a long time and encourages us to kind of run our business without regard to where the stock price is.","That being said, if the discount widens we\u2019ll begin to maybe perhaps need to have a different conversation, but right now it\u2019s go run your business.","Michael Bilerman","Just last question in terms of capital you talked a little bit about the equity side and how it\u2019s unsure whether there\u2019s large pockets of software [ph] and or a private equity that would be willing to take down large scale portfolios versus single assets I'm curious what your views on the lending market and Fannie & Freddie certainly bumping up over 50% of the multifamily lending market last year. And whether you think this appetite and what you\u2019re seeing sort of on the mortgage side to fund core type deals?","Mark Parrell","Hey, Michael, it's Mark. Fannie & Freddie as you said has just been extremely active, we anticipate them being extremely active in 2018. They have a slight preference probably and their pricing reflects it for certain types of affordable product, but they are certainly a very significant lender on our kind of product as well. And I think are able to do things in size. I would caution however that their ability just really for political reasons to do very large loans on very visible transactions is something I can\u2019t -- I've not discussed and I can\u2019t underwrite or explain.","I mean, their ability to just finance our product in the ordinary course I think is unfettered, we have very little secured debt now especially by the end of this year. So we\u2019ve got plenty of room with them and I think others do to. But to do very, very large loans that I think you\u2019re talking about is both in underwriting decision and in their case due to conservative a political decision and that I can\u2019t give you any opinion.","David Neithercut","Well, that\u2019s true, but we\u2019ll just sort of add there has not been a transaction in the multi-space of public to private that was not significantly financed by those agencies. Now again to your point Michael that was smaller sizes, but they played a very significant role in -- I think in every public to private event that we\u2019ve seen in our space.","Now again there\u2019s political issues that doesn\u2019t mean it will continue, but they have played that role.","Michael Bilerman","Alright, thanks for your time, guys.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Rob Stevenson with Janney.","Robert Chapman Stevenson","Good morning or afternoon guys. Just a couple of questions left, in terms of the $0.04 negative impact in the first quarter on a sequential basis from same store, can you talk about whether or not that\u2019s more revenue or expense driven and what markets are predominantly driving that as well?","Mark Parrell","Hey, it's Mark. It\u2019s really about some real estate tax refunds that we got that I sort of alluded to in my remarks in the fourth quarter. So that just meant that the usual decline we have between the first quarter and the fourth was $0.02 larger throughout really was just those couple of large refunds running through this system in Q4, increasing FFO in that quarter and just making it look like that difference was larger instead of sort of that being spread out probably in 2018 and just kind of move forward a bit.","Robert Chapman Stevenson","Okay. And then Mark can you help me understand what the next couple of years on New York tax abatement stuff looks like, I mean, you guys have a lot of assets in the city. I mean, is it just a constant role of those programs down to over the next couple of years or does the peg [ph] go through the pipe on at some point in time and you get back to a more -- you can just sort of normalized the tax abatement stuff in your same store expenses and your same store property taxes?","Mark Parrell","I think, it's probably fair to assume there is 150 basis points to 200 basis points for the medium term of growth in our number due to New York 421-a burn off, there isn\u2019t a particular year Rob that\u2019s at all ends in the next year and it's all done, it does go on for some number of years. But I just want to add a remark, it sort of like prepaying a loan, every year you get closer to the end of the loan maturity, the prepayment penalty goes down. Every year we get closer to the end of the 421-a period, the cap rate on these assets decline.","So NAV is being created because they trade as these assets get stabilized at a lower cap rate, but in the mean time you do feel it through the P&L in property tax expense.","Robert Chapman Stevenson","All right. And then last one for me, any update on relationship with Airbnb and how that's progressing relative to expectations?","David Santee","Sure, this is David Santee. We completed the rollout of additional pilots on the 18 properties in Q4 -- I'm sorry 14 building in Q4. And there is not a lot of activity in Q4 as a lot -- most of these buildings that we put on this portfolio were more corporate housing company type properties that typically will Airbnb some vacancies and that's why we selected the specific group of buildings. So it's more about just getting visibility into what these companies are doing and I don't think there has been any surprises, but it's doing exactly what we thought it would do, which is give us transparency into the entire process.","Robert Chapman Stevenson","Okay, guys. Thank you, appreciate it.","David Neithercut","You bet, Rob.","Operator","We'll go next to John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim ","Thank you. David four of your six core markets are finalized for the Amazon HQ2. I was wondering if what your thoughts were on which market if we announce the winner would be the best for your company.","David Neithercut","Would be the best for the company, that market in which we\u2019ve got the highest allocation of capital deploy. I think everybody is having a great deal of fun trying to figure this out. We think the DC market identify three sort of submarkets within DC. We think that there is a possibility there that would certainly be good for that marketplace. It\u2019d be good for any market, but certainly would be most beneficial in those markets in which we have most NOI coming up.","John Kim ","Okay. And then the second question is on your same store rental rate declined a little bit of quarter to $2,720, I was wondering if in your 2018 guidance if that contemplates an increase in rates?","Mark Parrell","So for full year when you look at 25, when you smooth out the leases on renewals and new lease expectations, it doesn't show much growth.","John Kim ","The $2,720 is the GAAP number so that\u2019s effective rental rate?","David Neithercut","That's a number from the press release. ","Mark Parrell","I'm sorry you are on $2,720 for the fourth quarter?","John Kim ","Yes, sorry this is page 11, of your supplemental.","Mark Parrell","Yes, I mean it customarily goes down and it's not stunning thing for it to decline in the fourth quarter, a little bit, I mean, it's not as transaction intensely a quarter. David has given some of the parameters about renewals in new lease rates in the rest and I think that what you are going to see in new lease rates there and average run rate is it will go up but only very modestly.","David Neithercut","Yes, we talked a little bit about how -- previously about how lease over lease rent that delta is the widest during this time of year when we're often re-leasing units that had been leased previously during the best time of the year meaning the summer. Due to lease cancelations or for whatever reasons and these numbers out again as I noted don\u2019t include a breakage cost that we receive from the person walking out. So it\u2019s the delta while yes lease to lease but that\u2019s not the full economic impact to the company, because of the lease breakage cost that we recover.","Mark Parrell","And just to add, I mean, it went down in 2016, I mean, this is not like I said an uncommon thing to have happened. So I wouldn\u2019t take it as a read through against anything that this year in 2018 is particularly ominous. It\u2019s just sort of the way the fourth quarter and compared to the third sequentially often play out.","John Kim ","Okay, thanks for the color. ","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to John Guinee with Stifel.","John Guinee","John Guinee here, thank you. Let me just focus on two things, first, operating expenses, you mentioned real estate taxes 4% to 5% to 6%, utilities 3% to 4% personnel 5% and we fully expect personnel to continue to go up at least 5% annually they do a great job deserve it. Do you think we should be thinking that real estate taxes and utilities are all going to go up at these sort of levels for the next three to five years or was this a one-time aberration?","Mark Parrell","Thanks for that question John, its Mark, and I think David Santee also contribute to this answer. But on payroll just to give you a little background certainly a lot of that is the very deserving pay raises to our on-site personnel, but a portion of these estimates we've given you reflect our estimates and it's very difficult to estimate this changes in our medical insurance reserves like most employers healthcare costs are very significant to us, and we\u2019re effectively self-insured. So large claims which are your lumpy can really move our numbers.","We made an estimate of that in there and we had a good experience towards the end of 2017 and you saw our payroll number decline and depending on that that could move that number a lot. So I don't feel that 5% is actually a terrific run rate going forward, I think it\u2019s probably good estimate for this year, because of impart these medical costs as well as the pay increases.","On utilities, I think, our estimate of 3 to 4% we hope to be near the lower end to that range but it\u2019s more based on just having terrific result over the past three years, where we were negative in two years and up 2% and seeing some increases in trash in Los Angeles and a few small things, David Santee and his team do a lot of repurchases and hedging of utility costs that\u2019s been very effective. So I don\u2019t think you should think of utilities as a run rate 3% to 4% necessarily, it could be lower.","And finally on real estate taxes, the big two things that we were trying to handicap this year because the 421-a stuff is understood is in New Jersey there is submarkets that we\u2019re in that are having their first reassessment in a generation. It\u2019s very hard for us to guess how that will turn out, we may have been too cautious in which case our number is too high or we made out of it. ","We also have to take some guess as to how many of our appeals are successful, we are good at that, we pay a lot of attention, we have had some success of late, we hope for more. Depending how that goes you could see that number decline as well from the range I gave you in the script. So a little bit of color for you, but for your run rate I'm not sure 5% is the right number for payroll, that's probably the one comment I\u2019d give you.","John Guinee","Okay. We hope no one is listening from the properties for that one. Okay then the second question, merchant builders as you know are about 95%, 98% of all development starts the re-crowd is relatively insignificant and they've been -- they used to underwriter to 100 and 150 basis points spread and they were getting 200 basis point spread and creating a lot of value. Do you see any signs that the merchant builders are closing up shop, laying off people or do you see any signs that equity investors are just shutting down their interest in multifamily? Or do you expect maybe these spreads just to come down and the merchant builders maybe building to a 50 to 100 basis points spreads instead of 100 plus.","Mark Parrell","Well I guess I'd say perhaps all of the above. There certainly we believe equity capital that is now sitting on the sidelines because of the sort of shrinking yields. And we do believe that there are some lesser well-capitalized merchant builders that might not -- might have to be forced to the sidelines. At the same time they were certainly well-capitalized, experienced their folks that continue to have access to capital and they may not be building at lesser yields, they just maybe building different product in different locations or different submarkets or further away from their urban core. So I think it\u2019s a little bit of everything. ","John Guinee","Great, thank you. ","Mark Parrell","You\u2019re very welcome. ","Operator","We'll go next to Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb ","Good morning out there. I'll try to be quite quick by two questions. First, David, assuming that Amazon doesn't take the DC area for HQ2, you guys have almost 20% of NOI there and yet you have that market just continues to produce a huge amount of supply every year. And the job outlook that you provided based on the government hiring doesn't sound so great. So if Amazon doesn\u2019t take there, would you guys consider pairing some of your exposure in that market?","David Neithercut","Well, sure. I mean we'll consider pairing in every market Alex. What you say is true, we've got a big exposure in DC, that market is really underperformed and we believe will continue to underperform given what we see hiring in the government as well as our outlook for new supply. And those are one of those markets that we think will not see a reduction in new supply come by 2019. So it's certainly a market that we believe will continue to be under pressure.","All that being said, there are trades being printed in that marketplace that continue to support valuation. So while the top lines and bottom lines might not be growing we've not seen any real diminution in certain valuations. And I guess I'll say also these tides turn we saw phenomenal results in DC coming out of the great recession. And my guess is DC has been over the long-term a fantastic apartment market we don't think it will be anything other than a fantastic apartment market, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have periods of time in which it doesn't do well.","So we've got great assets in the district, and we think again as more and more demand for people wanting to live in the district or in the close in sort of walkable communities in which we\u2019ve got assets in Alexandria and Silver Springs and [indiscernible] et cetera. We think that market will do okay, but we do acknowledge that it's been underperformed at least in terms of revenue growth for the next several years. ","David Santee","And we did just to remind you Alex, we did sell a fair amount of DC as part of the Starwood transaction and where assets packaged up some of the further out suburban stuff. And we got rid as part of that deal as well.","Alexander Goldfarb ","Okay, that's helpful. And then the second question for David Santee. You talked about the revenue trend expectations for the year. But as far as pricing power, do you foresee that you'll have your normal peak leasing season pricing power or is there a concern that just given how the markets are shaking out that you may not be able to fully push as much as you normally would like as you head into the peak later the spring?","David Santee","Well I think the lease over lease numbers that I gave you on a market-by-market are indicative of the curve that we expect in each market. But nevertheless there will be a curve. And the shape of that curve is going to be a little bit different in each market. So yes, we expect peak pricing in the call it April through August periods. And to what levels those rise will determine the outcome of our full year revenue growth.","David Neithercut","So if I may add on that, Alex for just a moment. Certainly pricing power is the issue that we have, but demand is not the issue. The occupancies remained very, very strong, so this was just not a function of attracting traffic, it's just how much pricing power we have and we're seeing less today obviously than we did in the five or six years immediately following the great recession. ","Alexander Goldfarb ","Thank you.","David Neithercut","You're welcome. ","Operator","And we'll move next to Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. ","Tayo Okusanya","Good afternoon everyone. Just two quick ones from me, the first one in the markets where you are seen increasing supply, could you talk a little bit about just how the local developers or the merchant builders are behaving in regards to lease up progress they get with pricing concessions and is there any concern even in first quarter that you guys may have to kind of compete at that level to get it rationale like they did a year ago?","David Neithercut","Well, as we see the markets today, we believe that they have been very similarly to 2017 acting quite rationally. I think as David Santee said in his prepared remarks and in response to some previous questions Tayo. That could change particularly in New York, but we believe that developers are offering normal sort of levels build concession, they offer in order to stimulate lease up, but we\u2019ve not seeing anything that we would believe would be concern for us today, but we remain very cautious about New York and how that might change.","But as I\u2019ve noted earlier the fact the rents haven\u2019t moved much since these deals started, we believe gives them very, very little cushion on the ultimate net effective lease rates they need to achieve to meet their expectations for their investors and to meet their expectations for their refinance amounts.","Tayo Okusanya","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then my last question just to confirm in 2018 you do not forecast we\u2019ll have any developments starts in your guidance?","David Santee","I did I noted that we expect this summer to begin the demolition of our property in Boston, and to begin that demolition of that old garage is going to be the start of that process it does not require a great deal of capital this year. But we will begin -- our expectation is we will begin construction on that project this year.","Tayo Okusanya","This year. Okay great. Thank you.","Operator","With no questions remaining, I\u2019d like to turn the call back to management for additional comments or closing remarks.","David Neithercut","Great well we\u2019ve been added a while, I appreciate your patience and look forward to seeing everybody around the season. So thank you very much for your attention today.","Operator","Thank you, sir. That does conclude our call for today. Thank you for participating you may disconnect at this time."],"8857":["Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) Q4 2018 Results Earnings Conference Call January 30, 2019 11:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Marty McKenna - IR","Mark Parrell - President & CEO","Michael Manelis - COO","Bob Garechana - CFO","Conference Call Participants","Nick Joseph - Citi","Jeffrey Spector - Bank of America","John Kim - BMO Capital Markets","Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI","Drew Babin - Baird","Rob Stevenson - Janney","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Hardik Goel - Zelman and Associates","Rich Hill - Morgan Stanley","John Guinee - Stifel","Tycho Okusanya - Jefferies","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets","Tycho Okusanya - Jefferies","Operator","Good day, and welcome to the Equity Residential 4Q 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to today\u2019s speaker. Please go ahead, sir.","Marty McKenna","Thank you, Mary. Good morning from the Polar Vortex and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's full year 2018 results and outlook for 2019. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer.","Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Mark Parrell.","Mark Parrell","Thank you, Marty, good morning, greetings from [Sheryl] Chicago, it\u2019s the negative 21 degrees right now, with a minus 50 degree windshield. Although the weather outside is quite cold, our business on the contrary feels quite one to us and we will spend a few moments this morning with you discussing it.","And we\u2019re pleased to have delivered same store revenue growth at the top end of our original guidance range as well as solid normalized FFO growth in 2018, we had strong momentum in the fourth quarter and 2019 has started well. Now admittedly December and January are months with a seasonally well volume of transaction. So strong high wage job and income growth in our markets combined with positive demographics and a consumer preference for a Reno lifestyle in our highly desirable city has created a supported backdrop for our business in spite of elevated levels of new supply.","Recent announcements regarding Amazon HQ2 and Google\u2019s continued business expansion are reinforcement of our belief that analogy economy will be focused and the markets will redo business. In Washington DC 70% of our NOI comes within 5 miles of rural location of HQ2. In New York we\u2019ve more than 20 properties that are start to new. In the Long Island city location of HQ2 we\u2019re more that are start to new from the new Google expansion location in the West Village.","We expect that 2019 will be another good year for us with strong demand across our markets creating high occupancy conditions, but continuing elevated supply levels for some of our markets keeping us within the price submission allow our internal dashboards blink and green, we\u2019re also aware that the economic and other headlines are giving me more cautionary yellow signal.","With that in mind, in a moment I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer to give you color and how we\u2019re looking at revenue growth across our markets in 2019 and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer will follow with a review of normalized FFO and expense results and guidance and also discuss our balance sheet and then I\u2019ll wrap it up on the prepared remarks side by speaking on our investment activity and after that we\u2019ll open the call to your questions.","Go ahead, Michael.","Michael Manelis","Thank you, Mark. So today I\u2019m going to begin with a quick recap of our 2018 performance. I\u2019ll share the assumptions that create the midpoint of our 2019 guidance range and I\u2019ll provide updated commentary and outlook for each market.","Here are few key takeaways from 2018. First, strong demand fueled by good job growth and record low levels of unemployment in our markets aided the absorption of elevated supply. Second, equity employees delivered remarkable experiences to our residents which resulted in the highest customer satisfaction and online reputations course and the lowest resident turnover in the history of the company.","We reported 51.1% turnover in 2018 which is around 200 basis points less than 2017 and if you exclude turnover for those residents who moved to a new unit in the same community, our net turnover dropped to 45%.","Finally, our 2.3% same store revenue growth was achieved with 96.2% occupancy, negative 30 basis points new lease change and achieved renewal increases of 4.9% which were all stronger than 2017 results. As we sit here today we\u2019ve strong momentum coming out of the fourth quarter. We\u2019ve more pricing power today versus the same time last year which keep the dashboards blink and green and allows us to remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook for 2019, but we acknowledge that the hard work is still ahead of us in the future leasing seasons, but our teams are ready to deliver.","Consistent with our preliminary assumptions that we shared on the last call, our overall guidance assumes approximately the same occupancy and renewal performance as in 2018 with a modest improvements in new lease change based on expected pricing power during the first half of the year and an embedded rent roll that is better than one year ago.","Our guidance also assumes that the steady but lower job growth expectations as being predicted by many economists will lead to the continued efficient absorption of the new supply in our markets. In 2019 supply will be less in Boston, New York and Orange County and the other markets are expected to be flat or up as I\u2019ll discuss in my market commentary.","Our 2019 same store revenue guidance range of 2.2% to 3.2% as a midpoint at 2.7% which is 40 basis points better than our 2018 results. The upper end of our range assumes a slight improvement in occupancy with strong pricing power on new leases staying in place through the peak leasing season. The bottom end of our revenue guidance assumes no intra period growth in rents and a modest reduction in both occupancy and renewal performance. All of our markets except for Seattle and Orange County are projected to deliver better revenue growth in 2019 as compared to 2018.","So let\u2019s move onto the individual markets beginning with Boston. Boston finished the year strong with continued growth in biotech and other high wage job. Job growth accelerated in the second half of the year and fourth quarter deliveries were very light. These factors contributed to a fourth quarter performance to five seasonal trends by growing both rate and occupancy each month from that quarter.","In 2018, Boston delivered full year revenue growth of 2.5% with 95.9% occupancy negative 80 basis points new lease change and a 5% achieve renewal increase. The theme for our 2019 guidance in Boston is modest pricing power. Only a small percentage of the 2019 supply will compete with our assets in Boston and Cambridge which comprises almost 70% of our revenue in the market. Most of these new supplies expected to deliver later in the year which should lead to a favorable leasing season.","The 2019 revenue midpoint for Boston will be 2.8% which is primarily based on improving pricing power heading into a period with lower overall supply. Today our occupancy is 95.7% and January renewals came in at 5.8%. Our local team and portfolio are well positioned to capture the opportunity.","Moving to New York which delivered 80 basis points of revenue growth in 2018 with 96.5% occupancy, negative 150 basis point new lease change and a 3.4% achieved renewal increase. These results were also accomplished with using approximately 40% fewer concessions than in 2017. New York\u2019s 2018 outperformance albeit with still the lowest same store revenue growth in our portfolio was a major contributor to us achieving the high end of our overall company same store revenue guidance for 2018.","We finished the year with strong momentum in the fourth quarter. New supply in our competitive footprint will be approximately 50% lower than in 2018 with expected deliveries just under 10,000 units. The deliveries will continue to be concentrated in Long Island City and Brooklyn where to date we have not seen a significant impact to our operations. In fact, we\u2019ve been monitoring and forwarding addresses from our move outs for over a year now and we continue to see less than 2% of our residents leaving us for Long Island City.","Similar occupancies, strong renewal performance and improve in a new lease change are the foundations to our 2019 revenue guidance of 1.8% for New York. We expect the market pricing to remain discipline which allows us the continued used concessions that are very strategic and targeted level and in amount that we estimated will be 25% lower than 2018.","With 96.3% occupancy today, January renewals at 4.3% the local team continues to feel the strength that propelled and from the fourth quarter. So DC is the market we definitely have all been hearing a lot about in the news. Our assumptions regarding 2019 do not include the impact from any future government adjust.","During the initial shutdown we do not experience anything outside of waving a few dozen late fees. If there are additional shutdowns we have a good process in place to ensure that we work with any residents who is being impacted.","We finished 2018 with revenue growth of 1% in DC which was comprised of 96.3% occupancy, a negative 180 basis points on new lease change and achieved renewal increases of 4.4%. We also saw the Washington readings economy continue its strong performance in the fourth quarter ending the year with above the average job growth and an unemployment rate below the national average.","Occupancy rates remain strong as class A absorption continues at a record phase. Expectations for new job growth in 2019 still indicate enough domain creation to aid in the absorption of the 13,500 deliveries expected in 2019. We\u2019re forecasting limited pricing power to continue through the year and we expect DC\u2019s 2019 revenue growth to be 1.4%, a 40 basis point improvement over 2018 is entirely due to growth that is already in place on the rent law as our full year assumptions include a slight decline in occupancy and very similar new lease change and renewal performance.","Most of the decline in occupancy is expected in the back half of the year where we have a difficult comp period from 2018. Today our dashboards are growing in DC and occupancy is at 96.5% and January renewals came in at 4.5%.","Moving over to the West Coast, Seattle delivered 2.8% revenue growth for the full year in 2018. This was accomplished with 95.8% occupancy, negative 220 basis points in new lease change and achieved renewal increases of 5.8%. Seattle supply is expected to increase next year to just over 9,000 units as we saw just over 10% shift in expected completions from Q4 of 2018 into Q1 of 2019.","In 2019 we expect to see more impact from new deliveries in King County Suburban East Bay than the CBD area. Professional and business services and informational sectors continue to lead the way within the areas of overall job growth. Major companies continue to announce expansions and new hiring into 2019. Even Amazon is still expanding in Seattle despite their plans for New York and DC. In fact, last week they had over 9,200 open positions in Seattle which is the highest we\u2019ve seen in a while.","In terms of the deliveries, only some of the 3,900 units being delivered in the Bellevue Redmond submarket will be directly competitive with our well located East Bay property. In addition Downtown Seattle should experience some relief from supply in 2019 and we\u2019ve almost 40% of our income in that submarket. In 2018 we saw growth slow significantly in this market in the back half of the year. And our 2019 guidance of 2% revenue growth reflects the impact of that second half slowdown.","Overall, we expect to see a slight improvement in both new lease change and occupancy which will be offset by a lower but still healthy renewal growth rate. We\u2019re at 96.4% occupied today with January renewals at 5%.","Next up is San Francisco. Our markets that in 2018 demonstrated strong job growth, 34 new IPOs and a consistent daily stream of headlines about major office leases and land acquisitions to support future expected growth from companies in the area. In 2018, San Francisco delivered full year revenue growth of 2.9% with 96% occupancy, positive 80 basis point new lease change and 5.1 achieved renewal increase.","The expectation for 2019 is that San Francisco market will continue to enjoy economic and job expansion albeit at a more tempered phase. Deliveries will be higher in 2019 but the concentration shift to the East Bay Oakland Submarket. There is still uncertainty surrounding the broader impact from deliveries in Oakland. To-date there has only been a small viewer to come online and the majority of the deliveries are expected in the second and third quarter of this year.","We will be monitoring the impact of this new supply in Oakland market and the overall San Francisco market. Our 2019 revenue growth guidance of 3.4% is built on very similar occupancy, new lease change and renewal growth as we achieved in 2018. Today we\u2019re 96.6% occupied with January achieved renewal increases at 4.6%.","Moving down to Los Angeles, where our 2018 revenue growth was 3.6% this was achieved with 96.2% occupancy, positive 140 basis point new lease change and 6.2% achieved renewal increases. On the supply front labor shortages continue to create delays in project deliveries resulting in approximately 2,400 units from 14 projects shifting from Q4 of 2018 into early 2019 completion.","This brings our 2019 delivery forecast at just over 14,000 units in LA. As I mentioned last quarter it is likely that we will see this trend continue with some of the expected 2019 deliveries being pushed into 2020. The combined total over the two year period has not materially changed and this is a huge geographical area.","In 2019 there will be supply concentrations in San Fernando Valley downtown and West LA. The growth in online entertainment content is creating strong momentum in West LA and will most likely quickly absorb the new units in the submarket. We\u2019re projecting 3.8% revenue growth in 2019 for Los Angeles with slightly lower occupancy and renewals and the same new lease change as in 2018 which is being offset by gains already in place on the rent law.","The reduction in occupancy is primarily in the second half of the year and is recognizing potential pressure from the new supply in a few of the core submarkets that I mentioned. Sitting here today San Fernando Valley is starting off a little weaker than expected, but the overall market in LA continues to demonstrate strong demand which should continue to aid the overall absorption. In total the market is performing very well with 96.2% occupancy and achieved renewal increases for January at 5.7%.","Moving to Orange County, we finished 2018 with revenue growth at 3.5% which was comprised of 96.1% occupancy, positive 10 basis points new lease change and achieved renewal increases at 5.7%. Our revenue growth for 2019 is expected to be about 40 basis points lower at 3.1%. The decrease is primarily due to recognizing the impact of lower growth from lease assigned last year along with the slight decline in projected renewal increases.","2019 occupancy and new lease change expectations are very similar to 2018 results. Job growth appears to be slowing but the overall outlook remains positive. Overall, deliveries in Orange County will be less in 2019 with just under 3,000 units expected, but the actual impact to us from a competitive standpoint should be very similar to 2018. Today we\u2019re 96.4% occupied and have achieved a 5.6% increase on January renewals.","And last but not least, San Diego. We finished 2018 with revenue growth of 3.9% which was comprised of 96.3% occupancy, a positive 160 basis point new lease change and achieved renewal increases at 6.1%. Our outlook for 2019 will be the same with revenue growth at 3.9% with similar occupancy and new lease change projection and slightly lower increases on renewals which is being offset by gains already in place on the rent law.","Deliveries are projected to be slightly higher than the 4,300 units and the impact to us is expected to be very similar to 2018 with pressure on our downtown locations. As of today San Diego is 95.9% occupied and achieved renewal increases in January are 5.3%.","Now we did reenter the Denver market in 2018 and added another property this month. Denver is not part of our same store pool and is not included in our guidance range. I could tell you that right now the market is performing to our expectation. The one in close with a huge shut out the employees of Equity residential. There were rent less commitment to our residents that was reflected in our all time aid customer satisfaction metric is amazing. We\u2019re so proud of their accomplishments in 2018 and we look forward to 2019 being even better.","We have strong momentum and we\u2019re off to a great start. Thank you.","Bob Garechana","Thanks Michael. This morning I\u2019ll take a few minutes to discuss our guidance assumptions for 2019 same store expenses and normalized FFO. I\u2019ll round out my remarks with a brief discussion of our balance sheet and capital market.","Before I begin a couple of quick comments on the fourth quarter 2018. In the quarter our same store revenue grew 2.6%, expenses grew 4.2% and NOI grew 1.9% putting us generally in line with our full year operating expectations from the third quarter call.","For normalized FFO we delivered $0.84 which is a penny shy of the midpoint of our expectation. As we mentioned in the release this is primarily driven by the negative impact of higher than anticipated casualty losses driven by rainstorm damage at several properties in our Washington, D.C. area portfolio.","Regarding 2018 same store expenses let me give some more specific color. The relatively high year-over-year expense numbers we experienced in repairs and maintenance and insurance are driven in part by very low or negative growth for the comparable period in 2017. For example, repairs and maintenance grew 1.6% for all of 2017 and only 0.7% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Insurance expense for the same period was negative.","Moving over to payroll, as is typical in the fourth quarter onsite payroll was impacted by various throughout on payroll related reserves like the medical reserve which we\u2019ve discussed in the past.","Now onto 2019 guidance. For full year 2019 we expect same store expense growth between 3.5% and 4.5%. 80% of our same store expenses come from three major expense categories. So let me walk you through and we currently estimate that unfold in 2019.","At a little over 40% of overall same store expenses, property taxes drive anticipated 2019 growth. We currently anticipate fewer refunds for the year relative to 2018 because of the great appealed success we had for that period. Also contributing to growth in 2019 are certain of our New York properties that are subject to the 421-a abatement program and are in various stages of burn-off that we've discussed on prior calls. As a result, we would expect 2019 real-estate tax front growth between 3.75% and 4.75%.","In on-site payroll, our second largest category, we continue to experience a very competitive job environment. Many of our markets were experiencing elevated supply as Mark and Michael mentioned which is competing with us not only residence but also for highly skilled employee.","That coupled with a strong general employment factor up means we continue to focus on retaining our colleagues on site. As such, our expectations on payroll for the full-year 2019 is for growth between 4% and 5%.","Finally, our last major category utility. Utility should benefit in 2019 from a couple of factors that reduce our expected rate of growth relative to the 4.5% increase we posted in 2018. First, in 2018, we experience higher than usual growth in trash and store expense in Southern California that shouldn\u2019t repeat itself in 2019.","Secondly, we experience some very extreme weather in the first half of 2018 in the northeast that we did not include in our 2019 forecast. We are in the business of forecasting weather but our guidance does assume a more traditional run rate.","Finally, we continue to benefit from our on-road electricity and gas purchase contract along with our investment in LED lighting for generation and other initiatives to manage this extent. As a result, in 2019, we expect utility expense to grow between 1% and 3%.","Our guidance range for normalized FFO in 2019 is $3.34 per share to $3.44 per share. Major drivers for this change between our 2018 normalized FFO of $3.25 per share and the midpoint at $3.39 per share which from 2019 guidance include a $0.10 contribution from same store NOI and our same store properties based on the revenue and expense assumptions that Michael and I just outlined.","A $0.04 contribution from our leased up properties which anticipated to generate $40 million in NOI in 2019. A $0.01 contribution from the timing of our acquisition and disposition activity involve 2018 and 2019, offset by $0.01 in higher expected interest expense.","While we continue to benefit from favorable refinancing activity, we do anticipate short-term rates on average to remain elevated in 2019 relative to 2018. This expectation is driving a negative impact.","Final note on the balance sheet before turning it back to Mark. Our financial position remains the strongest in the company's history and one of the strongest in the REIT industry. During 2018, we not only issued $900 million in unsecured bonds, we retired over $1 billion in higher coupon secured debt. Our NOI is now over 80% on encumbrance creating ample capacity to opportunistically access either this secured or the unsecured market.","We issued an unsecured bond early in the year at one of the lowest 10-year recredit spreads ever and were the first multifamily rates issue a green bond. In addition to being an attractively priced piece of long-term capital, the green bond is a reflection of the many sustainable projects and initiatives that we have and continue to undertake balancing people plan it and profit.","For 2019, we anticipate issuing between $700 million and $900 million in debt capital to refinance debt that either matures in 2019 or matures in 2020 but it's prepayable at par in 2019. We are very manageable development spend that we anticipate being funded entirely from free cash flow and hold that capacity and industry leading access to the full-spectrum of capital.","As I just mentioned, we also have plenty of capacity to issue either unsecured or secured debt capital. For the first time in quite a while, we've also seen a convergence of pricing between the unsecured and secured markets for lower levered high-quality borrowers like our self.","With that, I'll turn it back to Mark.","Mark Parrell","Thanks, Bob. Just quickly on the investment front. We had a relatively quiet fourth quarter with no transactions as you saw on last night's release. We had a busy January, we acquired three properties. We continued our portion at Denver with the acquisition of a newly constructed property in the Golden Triangle neighborhood which is near downtown Denver.","This 274 unit property was completed in 2017, as a 90 walk score and is slightly less than 90% occupied. We acquired it for a 110.5 million at a 4.4% cap rate on the current rent roll and a 4.6% cap rate once fully stabilized. We see the price is at about a 7% discount to current replacement cost. We now have three properties or about $385 million of capital invested in Denver.","We will continue to look for opportunities to expand our presence in Denver as we think that assets in the right location, we'll produce excellent long-term returns. We do not that similar to many markets, Denver's experiencing significant new supply, this is both a challenge to near-term operating fundamentals that we do reflect in our underwriting and also an opportunity for us to buy well-located product at modest discounts to current replacement costs.","Moving over to Seattle. We acquired a 174 unit's property constructed in 2016 in the South Lake Union neighborhood; this asset was acquired for $74.1 million at an acquisition cap rate of 4.6%. The property has a tremendous walk score of 97 and we were able to acquire it at a discount to current replacement cost.","We like this properties location which is in walking distance of many major employers, parks, and other attractive amenity. We also added to our New York metro area portfolio with the acquisition of a 131 unit property in the desirable Paulus Hook neighborhood of Jersey City; we acquired the property for $74 million at an acquisition cap rate of 4.6%.","The property has a 92 walk score and easy public access, transportation access, into much of Manhattan. On the disposition side, we're in the process of disposing of several assets. We're closing expected in late in this quarter or the second quarter. This includes a sale of an asset in Manhattan that was reported in the press, I have more to report on this transaction once this is closed.","We have given guidance for $700 million of acquisitions and $700 million of dispositions in 2019. You can expect us to continue our selected portfolio pruning as we find attractive opportunities from both in acquisition and development perspective for new investment in our markets.","Overall, values and cap rates are holding steady in our markets as there continues to be demand own high quality apartment assets. On the development front, during the fourth quarter we completed a development of our 100K street property in Washington D.C. which we expect to deliver at a stabilized yoke of 5.6%. We also stabilized our Cascade development in Seattle at a yield of 5.8%. We did not start any developments in the fourth quarter.","Well now, let's go to the Q&A session. Operator, if you could begin?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Nick Yulico of Scotiabank. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good morning. This is Trenter Hill here with Nick. Thanks for first all the market level color in your prepared remarks; that's great. Kind of a big picture question related to supply and like the theme that we continue to hear is more of it being shifted to one quarter to another from one year to another.","So, now 2019 based on industry level date, it seems to be the new peak for supply deliveries of the national level. And we appreciate you deal on internal analysis of supply. But we've been talking about this for a while as it gets pushed and pushed further end of the cycle.","So, when do you think we truly see the peak supply as it pertains to your markets?","Mark Parrell","Hey Trent, it's Mark Parrell, thanks for that question. So, it seems that we do have this conversation every year. We always seem to have the highest supply numbers right now for the year. So, our internal estimates now for 2019 are give-or-take 77,000 units. But we fully expect 10% or 15% of that to move because it always moves.","So again, we do think something will move in the 20. Right now our 2020 numbers are lower and we will be putting our an update on our numbers a little bit later in the quarter. But again, we see continued pressure on construction costs. Labor costs, materials cost, land prices is not really declined at this point.","We see all that, we also see rents not growing as quickly as construction cost and we see pressure on developers and we see that growing over time. When that really comes to pass in a very significant decline, we would expect that to occur at some point but I just can't have it to guess at this juncture that at this point we do think '20 is lower than '19.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thank you very much. And just a quick follow-up something relating to your guidance. It looks like you have a 25 basis point dilutive cap rates spread between acquisitions and dispositions. And you've already announced a healthy amount of acquisitions in the mid-4% range and you have that Chelsea asset pending sale which we would assume it would be something in the low-4% cap rate range.","So, I guess the question is what are you planning to buy yourself that would flip this dynamic from being accretive to delude if just to get some details on that, thank you.","Mark Parrell","Sure, Trent.","Bob Garechana","Yes, thank you. All we do with our guidance is give you the number that's in our estimate. So, it doesn't mean that will actually end up because we don\u2019t know exactly what we're going to buy and sell during the year. At this point we do have somewhat of an accretive trade going on but there are other assets we've identified for sale that would be higher cap rate assets.","So, I could tell you there is almost equal probability that we could be 50 basis points accretive as 50 basis points dilutive. Mean, it's just a pretty small margin in between. And in terms of the impact on this year's numbers which I don\u2019t think was exactly what you asked, it's really minimal.","Because it's really about the timing of these trades and because we're buying relatively early or going to be slightly accretive, my guess is in 2019 almost no matter what.","Unidentified Analyst","All rightt, thank you very much. Thanks for taking the questions.","Bob Garechana","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Nick Joseph of Citi. Please go ahead.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. In the last few years you've been pretty conservative with initial same store revenue guidance that you ultimately at the high-end of your initial expectations. So, first a basic change is here with tightly set guidance. And then which markets have the largest potential variants that will drive maybe the high-end or low-end of the range?","Mark Parrell","It's Parrell, and Manelis will kind of split this one up. So, in terms of anything changing in our process, no. our process is sort of both the bottoms up and the top-down process and we sort of arrived at a consensus number. So, not the process is the same.","We talked our field personnel, there's often assets specific positive and negative going on. New supply where they know sort of the exact impact, maybe a renovation at a property, things of that nature. Or the top of the house we're looking at supply numbers, job growth, we're thinking about how the market moved the prior year and we sort of merged those two together and reach consensus.","I'll let Michael speak to the markets with positive and kind of that.","Michael Manelis","Yes. So, I think that the one way to just start thinking about this is there's four core markets that are driving 18% to 20% of our revenue which would be kind of D.C., in New York, San Francisco and L.A. so, obviously those are big focal points because if any one of those markets kind of either out performs or under performs that have more weight into the overall company.","I guess, I'm just going to tell you sitting here today. I think we're up to a great start, right. You got Boston, San Francisco and New York but we feel we got good momentum and with just left towards kind of the outperform state but again we're very early in.","I think on the downside we're going to watching D.C. and L.A. just for any signs of softening and the absorption of this supply which could impact our projections. But as of right now, we're not seeing anything to suggest if that's occurring.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. So, then with supply coming to Oakland in the East Bay. Do you think that the new product will pull demand from San Francisco or do you expect it to be more muted somewhere toward what you've seen in New York with Long Island City?","Michael Manelis","I think that's a great question and that's something obviously that we're going to be looking at. I think I even said that on the last quarter which is yes it's a little bit different than Long Island City because Oakland does have areas to go to today. So, it's a little bit more established than Long Island City.","It's something that we've got to watch, I think in the next probably several weeks we're going to have one of the first deals, bigger deals, 420 units start to the free leasing's but just going to be interesting to see kind of that price relationship to San Francisco.","My guess is it will come out of the box somewhere 15% to 20% discounted in rents but we'll see. And then we just got to watch their ability to absorb what happens with them to see if they do start to drop from San Francisco.","Nick Joseph","Thanks.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Jeffrey Spector of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Spector","Thank you, good morning. Mark, just stepping back from results for a minute. Now that you're in the CEO, see I just want to confirm from a strategy standpoint, is there any potential change or anything you've been wanting to do whether it's more development, less development market exposure.","And it even say but even the balance sheet increasing leverage possibly at this point?","Mark Parrell","Thanks for the question, Jeff. I've been at the company 20 years and was the CFO for an 11. So, I fully invested in this strategy. I mean the strategy is always more then changed over time and it undoubtedly we'll continue to. In last year, we went back into Denver, we telegraphed that, we talked about it, we continue as we did under David's time at the helm as we will undermine, we'll always think about markets and different types of assets we can buy in our markets.","Now I think that sort of evolutionary process will continue but in terms of some dramatic changes that the board now are contemplating that that would not at this point in the case.","Jeffrey Spector","Okay great, thanks. And then, just two quick follow-ups. On Oakland, I was just going to ask historically have you seen an impact when there's a new supply in Oakland in your San Fran portfolio or are we saying that it's really not a good comparison to look in the past given the changes going on in Oakland?","David Neithercut","Yes, I think so. I think you got to wait and see, this is some concentrated new supply high-end stuff coming online. So, I think in the past I don\u2019t know that they've ever had this wave of the concentration all coming online in a couple of quarter period that really have an impact and really touch the ability to absorb.","Mark Parrell","And Jeff, if I can just add to that a little bit, it's Mark. We do see maybe 3500+ units being delivered. This is into a market that has I know I mean the Bay area in general, the least amount of housing in the country; it needs more housing.","So, whatever little blip this might cause or might not cause to the operations of our assets across the Bay in San Francisco or the few assets that we do have in each day, in the long run this market will absorb this product readily because it's just an area where there's just incredible demand for housing.","It's very under supplied and so we don\u2019t look at it as some permanent disability or even frankly much more than a temporary blip.","Jeffrey Spector","Okay, thanks. And then, my last follow-up is just on supply New York City, you commented that you're still expecting a decline of 50% in '19. We hosted or broke a call last week and we heard '18 supply was down more than we expected. So, we weren\u2019t sure of the slippage into '19 would decrease that estimate.","But it sounds like you're sticking with the 50% decline in New York City supply.","Mark Parrell","Yes. So, actually when I look back at where we thought '18 was going to be, we really have not seen a significant change at all. So, the 19,000 units that we expected kind of came in maybe one unit's look smaller, two units small units but we really didn\u2019t see that kind of slippage in New York.","And again, as we think about the 2019 landscape is against our competitive footprint.","Jeffrey Spector","Great. Thanks, guys.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","John Kim","Thank you. Based on your market commentary, it looks like the biggest improvement that you're seeing in 2019 in same store revenue guidance will be coming from New York. But when you look at the earn-in from a lease growth rates from last year, it does not appear to be that strong.","I'm just wondering if you could provide some more commentary on your constant level in achieving this other than just supply coming down.","Mark Parrell","Well, I guess I would say from an earn-in perspective New York contribute with 70 basis points stronger and better growth today than we did at this time last year. So, we do have some embedded growth in the rent wall from leases that were saying for like maybe or to the back half of the year and we've got good momentum right now.","We've got demonstrated pricing power. It's not robust pricing power but it's more pricing power than we've had in a long time. And if that momentum can continue, I think we're going to be just fine with this range that we put out there.","John Kim","You had strong momentum in the fourth quarter versus I think your prior year guidance in New York? I just want to make sure that was the case.","Mark Parrell","Yes, both from a demand; from an occupancy; from a renewal; everything.","John Kim","Okay. Also there was a commentary on waiving some late fees in D.C. and just wanted to make sure that we understood your revenue recognition when a tenant is late in paying rent. And also, is your expectation that government workers will be fully current on rents when the government shut down it's primarily over?","Bob Garechana","Yes. So, I'll take real quick the revenue recognition is not waiving on late fee. So, we recognize the late fee one due. So, we recognize that through revenues almost like on a cash basis. Obviously, we didn\u2019t collect it, we would not recommend it.","Mark Parrell","So, just to give you an order of magnitude, John, to help you a little here and we're talking about two dozen people. So, we're not concerned about it. We waive those late fees, so we're not going to get them. So, that's undoubtedly true.","So, we do charge the accounts the late fees, we do recognize that through revenue and if they aren\u2019t paid, we have a process where a couple of months later it all gets written off.","We've very low write offs in this portfolio, one of the advantages of the portfolio shift is to have a portfolio where you didn\u2019t have a lot of people that move out in the middle of the night, you didn\u2019t have a lot of people that don\u2019t pay the rent.","So, write off this portfolio effectively the minimist. So, I don\u2019t expect that change as a result of this recent incident.","John Kim","But the workers to your knowledge that they will be caught up in rents once they go back to work.","Mark Parrell","Yes, I guess at this point there is nothing out there that would suggest that even if there are additional shutdowns that there is not going to be a retro pay catch up. And therefore, the residence won't be in a position to get caught back up nonetheless.","Bob Garechana","Yes. We have, there are family members are kind of workers that were for loading, they know they're getting the money and they bid all that but that just between that readings the paper, I expect you'll get the money and then we'll get the rent.","John Kim","Got it, okay thank you.","Bob Garechana","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks. I just want to touch on the investment market and just maybe get your comments on kind of unlevered IR's today, how you guys are underwriting sort of acquisitions just late in the cycle and do you guys think about a down turn, do you put that in or how do you sort of think about the next possible recession?","Mark Parrell","Hey Steve, it's Mark. Thanks for the good question. This is as much are the science as you know we got people on the ground really looking at this hard, we underwrite every deal. We end up bidding on a select group of oneself. I'll give you a little bit of flavor of how we're thinking about things.","When you're talking about revenue assumptions in the next few years, we do feel like we have more visibility there. So, for example the Denver asset that we just bought a few weeks ago, we effectively assumed because we know there is near-term competition, no revenue growth for a couple of years and concessions.","We understand that market, we know what's going in the next few years and then over time at some points things will balance themselves differently. And you'll have a year with the six in it later on. Well, what generally happens is in the near term, you have whatever you really think is going to happen in that market from your knowledge on the ground from our investment in property management teams.","Going forward, you sort of revert to some sort of average in the market which generally for us and revenue growth then your five on might be somewhere in that who is depending, how we feel about the markets long-term prospects. And then you look at your cap rate, you're reversing every cap rate at the end because of a lot of the product we're buying like the stuff we're buying in Denver, a high rise.","We don\u2019t see as much cap rate widening in the sale as maybe you'd see if you were buying garden product. That give you just a framework for our thought process but again picking what your seven revenue growth is going to be is definitely an estimate.","Steve Sakwa","So, no effective real downturn in a market like or just nationally two, three, four years out. There isn\u2019t sort of a down 4% or 5%, 6% within a strong bounce back and could you kind of just kind of look through that basically?","Mark Parrell","Well, we accomplish. Yes well, and you just said if you look through that. I mean if you think the number is going to be 350 in the market for revenue growth over a long period of time. You may have underestimated it in year four and you over estimated in year seven and that just kind of averages out.","So, again the near term stuff, we underwrite tight based on having product in these markets, knowing how it's performing, having a real good feel. As you go further out, it's a little bit more of an averaging effect.","Steve Sakwa","And then, just in terms of unlevered IRR's. We're on the things that you've been buying or the things you've underwritten but have a one. Where would you say the market is today and you're kind of core five or six markets?","Mark Parrell","Yes. And we're seeing trades go off and we think unlevered IRRs maybe in the sixes, the stuff we've been giving the purchase has been in the sevenths. Again, some of that is skewed by Denver, maybe being a little bit higher cap rate market but the stuff we're buying in the sevens but we do see product rate.","In at the sixes, maybe even in the five or high fives in terms of IRR's but again those are the deals we wouldn\u2019t plan.","Steve Sakwa","And then, just lastly on development. Obviously, the pipeline for you is kind of dwindling down there or how do you sort of think about new land sites and new development starts over the next couple of years?","Mark Parrell","Yes. Thanks for that question. So, on development. We've had a terrific run, we have a great team in place. We do think about it as a long-term value creator for our company. Right now, our development folks are mostly been busy with adjacent land sites; the properties we already own. We do have a couple of other land sites on the west coast that we're thinking about.","But we made a decision a few years ago as we saw these costs really go up as we saw rents kind of flattened out but it really wasn\u2019t worth the risk. We completed I think a very lucrative development pipeline for the most part, there are couple of things still in process. I guess the way we think about it right now Steve is, we think about it as part of the long term mix to capital allocation for the company. I don't think you will see us accelerate that in the year or so we just don't see an opportunity to do that as yields were willing to accept to take that kind of risk. But I do think you should expect that there will be a time and a place where we will do more development for sure and I think we will constantly do these densification plays where we take a property and it's the parking lot, the back parking lot or the garage and we will do something there. We are adding units. We are adding new building and what not.","Steve Sakwa","Okay, And then just quick one for Bob. Just on the debt that\u2019s expiring this year and kind of your new debt that's in guidance just kind of from a timing perspective how should we think about that and to the extent that you were to come to market with say a new ten year deal where do you think pricing is?","Bob Garechana","Yes. It's a real quick on the timing. So the two components of that that are either maturing or pre-payable at par are kind of midyear, end of the day one of them is unsecured bond that's floating, swap to floating. And another one is that I think secured debt deal that I mentioned its pre-payable at par. So that's kind of midyear so I think from a modeling standpoint mid-ish year is probably pretty close. We obviously could be opportunistic if the market presented opportunity to go a little bit earlier and take them off the line, etcetera. But overall that's the timing plan.","From a pricing perspective, I would say and this probably applies for secured and unsecured low levered secured for borrowers like us because as I mentioned in my comments the threads are pretty tight to each other. I would say we are probably a little bit under 4 overall. So sitting here, call it 275 treasury here and that kind of 115 area for either one.","Steve Sakwa","Great, thanks very much.","Mark Parrell","Thanks Steve.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Drew Babin of Baird, please go ahead.","Drew Babin","Hi, good morning.","Mark Parrell","Good morning.","Drew Babin","Moving past on the earn and assumptions moving into 2019 and looking more towards peak season, I mean the potential for continued second derivative leasing spread improvement. I guess, are you assuming that most of your markets are \u2013 are your markets kind of on average roughly in line with 18 as far as renewal and new leasing spread or are there certain markets assuming some incremental acceleration or deceleration?","Michael Manelis","No, I would say and I went through each kind of market as to what those overall assumptions were, but I would say clearly in New York probably stands out where we have significant improvement in the new lease change assumptions. So the rest of the markets I would say are pretty close, Boston where you have pricing power existing is going to generate improvement in new lease change as well. And I think as we get closer in the March we will have an investor presentation deck, you get to see a little bit of those assumptions as kind of a layout by quarter as well.","But I really point to the markets where I talk about kind of having some pricing power momentum. Those are the ones that our expectations are kind of geared towards improvement in new lease change and the rest is probably just holding the line on the occupancy and renewal.","Drew Babin","Thank you, that's helpful. Can you talk some about the repair and maintenance costs being relatively high in 2018 off of difficult comps? I noticed that the building improvements and replacements capitalized per unit were down about 9% year-over-year in 2018. Can you talk about how the capitalized expenses were kind of going down while the expense ones are going up? Is there any different on the accounting side? Does it reflect the younger portfolio? Just curious kind of why that bifurcation is occurring?","Mark Parrell","Drew, it's Mark. So specifically when you look at building improvements, building improvements are large scale systems so that's why air conditioning unit replacements on top of buildings, elevators and things of that nature. So there is some interplay between that. There is some things that when you do a big capitalized project end up falling into expense. But that interplay isn't quite right. There wasn't a switch there as much as I would like to tell you. That's what happened. It really was just these sort of additional expenses relating to slight damage that hit same store and otherwise non same store. So that really was more of it. ","Michael Manelis","So nothing changed on the accounting front or capitalization policy at all.","Drew Babin","Okay. So what do you say in the 9% decline year-over-year. Is that just sort of asset mix over the years? Is there anything kind of behind that?","Mark Parrell","Sure. Those are generally big projects, in a few cases big window replacements or sighting deals on a few mid rise units we own. So those just slide. Just move down a little bit and they'll get done in the next year. So it's really more about just timing of some big chunky projects more than anything else.","Drew Babin","And then, one more for me obviously there have been some headlines about tech companies kind of reaching out and hoping to increase the inventory of affordable housing or in some cases kind of medium income type housing projects. Has there been any talk of them partnering with other capital to potentially do larger projects that might deliver more units that we're kind of currently talking about? Do you think there's any potential that these companies might reach out to EQR or other public REITs to kind of partner in these projects and would you say that the rents on them are probably a little bit too low kind of considering to ours target customer? Is there anything developing on that front or is it maybe just too early in the process? ","Mark Parrell","I'm thinking it's too early I mean we certainly know these people in our markets but we don\u2019t have a lot of detail on those programs at this point. We've run very affordable product before. We own some bay area stuff that I would characterize as highly affordable product. We have affordable units throughout the whole portfolio as well. So I think we have the ability to manage in our markets all types of price points if the returns make sense. So, we'd be interested in it and I'm sure possibly but I guess I just don't know enough to react to that yet.","Drew Babin","Great, that's all from me. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will now take our next question from Rob Stevenson of Janney, please go ahead.","Rob Stevenson","Good morning guys. What's your expectation for fee growth in 2019, the application pet and all that other stuff and are there any new ones that you guys have recently implemented or will implement 19?","Mark Parrell","So I would say I think right now if we look through the guidance I'm guessing it's 3% which is kind of in line with kind of where we see these other income lines going from an initiative standpoint. I'll tell you we did a hard look at the parking many years ago. Our parking revenue is up to 54 million in 2018. We actually grew parking by 3 million or 6%. We have basically the road map laid out for every single property and some of that just takes some turnover, some renewals, some changes in the leases to get that income.","But if we still have a little bit of room left to optimize some of the parking income but it's not like there's significant kind of opportunities in front of us. The rest of the fees I mean it's a very strategic review asset by asset to try to understand where do you have opportunities, where do you have levers to increase. I don't think I'm aware of anything kind of on the new fee side coming in that that's worth talking about on this call.","Rob Stevenson","And then what are the expected stabilized development yields on the three properties in the current pipeline?","Mark Parrell","Sure bear with me for a second here. So for West End 6 for 249 third square 5 and for 1401 East Madison 58. ","Rob Stevenson","And what's the $0.08 gap between the REIT and normalized FFO guidance for this year? ","Michael Manelis","Yes. So for 2018 or 2019, sorry?","Rob Stevenson","For 19, the guidance.","Michael Manelis","Yes. So for 19 the guidance there's a page in the very back. The biggest issue and we noted on the disclosure or the biggest item is the write off, or anticipated write off of an unamortized discount on a tax-exempt bond that we would expect to incur in conjunction to a plan disposition that Mark may have alluded to in his comment.","Mark Parrell","Yes, so it's a non-cash charge Rob, so it's cost we incurred when we bought this asset a long time ago and we have to write it off. So that runs through the REIT and EPS versions of FFO after our normalized version and that's the biggest item.","Rob Stevenson","And I know that there hasn't been any sort of formal plan put out there yet Mark, but given that the administration says that they have the ability to do something with the GSTs I mean what's \u2013 how you guys thinking about that and does that impact any of the timing for you guys in terms of dispositions and\/or the way that you guys think about financing in the space through the remainder of the year?","Michael Manelis","Yes, I'll take this real quick and I'm sure Mark can take you back on it as well. So we're familiar with the same kind of media reports that you guys have seen and it's been all over the page right in terms of -- as of late most recently it's in the privatization kind of rumors. What I'll say kind of more specifically and I think answering your question on 19 is at the moment we see no disruption to the GSE and it's the kind of the operating business as usual.","They had very large production volumes in 2018 prior to the change of the regulator whose term expired at the end of 2018. They put out their caps which were very similar to what they were previously. So for 19 we wouldn't expect anything to kind of impact our position or their kind of operations overall. I guess what I would say kind of longer-term is who knows right, I think the bigger issue that will drive kind of GST reform is both political but also probably single-family financing in this country and so it is unclear.","From a specific standpoint I'd say for us we would certainly be less impacted or less negatively impacted by GST reform I would say for two reasons. The first as it relates to funding ourselves. We have very strong access to capital as I alluded to in my comment particularly strong relative to the private market which is very reliant on the GSTs whether it's for stabilized assets or for refinancing their construction loans I mean every bank in the country basically when doing a construction loan underwrite to take out to the GSTs. So we benefit kind of from a direct standpoint of having all this access.","The other thing I would say is our portfolio on the secured debt front it's very attractive to other secured lender types as well so we don't have a lot of the large-scale suburban kind of stuff that is probably more the core GSP product today than what we might have had ten years ago.","Mark Parrell","Yes that's the point I just want to emphasize Rob without beaten this to death is we got rid of a lot of the product that we thought was more susceptible to GST risk some time ago but some of these dispositions including Florida and the Denver suburban stuff this product we thought but really only financed fear was the GST market. So we don't feel and it so it's not changing our plans. Most people who buy assets from us are buying free and clear and you may finance it later at some point but the financing market is not particularly relevant to them. They are cash buyers.","Rob Stevenson","Thanks guys. Stay warm.","Mark Parrell","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Alexander Goldfarb","Thank you and I guess given the temperatures maybe that Florida assets look a little attractive now. Just two questions, first you guys are not alone in facing operating expenses and taxes are what they are, you can grieve them all you want but that is what it is. But wages especially with the sustained with this economic recovery ultra low unemployment and the fact that you've had a lot of local mandates for higher minimum wages just seems to be something that's continuing to weigh on the apartment.","Some talk about more automation but still you need people at the properties to run them, to fix them, etcetera. So do you expect that for the next few years we're going to see force type percent expense growth driven by payroll or do you think there's some offsets here? ","Mark Parrell","Yes. I believe in the mean reversion theory of these long term expenses. I mean over the last five years our expense growth rate is average 2.5% certainly we're expecting it to be higher in 2019 than it's been. Real estate taxes are what they are, but some of these sales of these New York assets where we've affected the 421A growth in our real estate tax line item that stuff Alex is going to help us over time. So we expect that number to go down here. These appraisers have noticed how well apartments have done. They've raised their values. They've taxed us more. At some point that will change and those values will go down and we'll have more appeal success that's just the cycle.","In terms of headcount and wages and stuff I would say the same. Right now with so much new products being built there's just a lot of competition for talent as Bob suggested. At some point that'll wax and wane. So I don't I don't know I don't feel like 4% is a run rate. I feel like that's just kind of this year's number and I think there's some good chance it could be lower depending on how things break during a year. I know Michael if you got anything you would add.","Michael Manelis","Yes, I think I guess I can bring up that obviously from an automation standpoint we're about to introduce pilots to kind of go after mobility on the maintenance side of our business. I don't know if that that's really not a head counting that's more around utilization. So it's allowing us to maybe get some more stuff done in-house and have less dependency on contractors but it I think you are right some of these minimum wage increases and they're not done in 19 they're going to continue going and that is going to continue to keep pressure on any of the contract labor services that we utilize.","So I think we're taking a hard look at all that trying to make sure that we've optimized, trying to make sure that the staff is as utilized as possible. So I think there will be things that come out of the learning from 19 that will get folded into 2020 but I don't think we're in a position to really impact the 2019 with any of these types of initiatives yet.","Alexander Goldfarb","And then the second question is as you look here in New York obviously Albany is now all democrat rent control is up this summer. There's a lot of talk about a lot of, taking out a lot of things that were more favorable to landlords. From any of your local real estate contacts especially who deal with Albany. Is there any concern at all that rent control may spread to market rate units and\/or that they may start to limit the ability to raise rents within existing 421A deals on either the 20% restricted or I think someone mentioned that the other 80% is still subject to some qualification. But just sort of any commentary of what you're hearing as Albany didn't do debates renewing the rent control this summer?","Mark Parrell","Yes thanks Alex. Listen this is a very complex area. New York rent control regulations are very involved that we have several full-time staff members who administer this. It's that complex. We are used to these regulations. The Governor was rather general in his remarks. I don't have anything specific to react to. We will continue to advocate through our local trade association as we did very effectively in California that rent control in the long run and New York give me listen a rent control New York forever and it hasn't helped keep prices down to somehow lower level on workforce housing or produced more affordable and workforce housing I would argue.","I think enlisting the private sector by having incentives like the affordable New York program, by having zoning that's more inclusive things like that or where you're going to make a real dent in it. The industry does want to be helpful both in New York and otherwise and in fact Alex, the annual trade show event for the industry is going out right now in California and I know right now because we've got senior people attending that there's conversations about New York, about California, about all the places that have these affordable housing issues but this isn't an area where you can legislate a good outcome.","You need to really enlist I think the private sector. I think the industry is willing to do its part. So I can't answer your question specifically because there's no detail. Once there are there will be on it but our sense is in New York that the industry association has been pretty effective in education and we'll hope the same occurs this time.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay thanks Mark.","Mark Parrell","Thank you, Alex.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Hardik Goel of Zelman and Associates. Please go ahead.","Hardik Goel","Hi Mark, thanks for taking my question. Thanks for providing color on your markets earlier regarding 2019 guidance and as I look across them I'm just wondering where are the ranges the widest? Which markets do you see potential for upside and also on the other end potential for downside and what are the factors influencing you there?","Michael Manelis","Yes, this is Michael. I guess I would say from a range perspective we have equal upside and downside in almost every one of our markets relative to our midpoint. I think as I alluded to earlier in one of the question, the markets that have the elevated supply so we will be \u2013 DC and LA and they're driving 18% of our revenue, other markets where the range could be tested both on the upping and the downside.","So it's the markets where we need to watch the absorption of the elevated supply and we need to balance kind of the pricing power that we have in place. Right now like I said earlier the dashboards are all green we've got good pricing power in those markets. So sitting here today I would say we have minimal on the downside risk. But I think the way to think about it is the markets that are contributing the majority of the revenue growth and where is their elevated supply and that's kind of how we're thinking about it.","Hardik Goel","Thanks.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Rich Hill","Good morning guys and thank you for the time. Once just come back to two things one of which you've already spoken about maybe some of that add links. But New York City looks like you put up a really nice number in 4Q and expect that acceleration to occur. One of the things that I know you and I have chatted about in the past is sort of how neighborhood by neighborhood New York City is and certainly our own analysis supports that.","So I'm curious when you think about the various neighborhoods and where your properties are located what's driving that outperformance relative to maybe what we see in trends in overall New York City. Is it lack of supply or is it just people unwilling to move or a little combination of both?","Mark Parrell","I think it's a little bit of a combination of both and then you also got to remember what our earning or what our embedded growth is sitting in some of these neighborhoods. They maybe didn't have as much pressure on supply in 18 that allowed us to start getting some momentum on raising rents and getting some momentum on pricing power. So Manhattan still has an attractiveness to it, at least we see it in our foot traffic. We see it in the demand for our product type.","And sitting here today when we look through New York and I go through almost every submarket, every sub market is demonstrating more pricing power today on where our rents are in the marketplace than where they were this time last year. So I think you're right to think about at a sub-market level we could see kind of deviation in the projection and in fact our own projections have ranges going down to 1.5% up to all the way up to a 4% based on various sub-markets.","So I think some of it is what is embedded with us and some of it is what should we see is the competitive landscape that we're going to be facing in 19.","Rich Hill","Got it, that's helpful thank you. I mean I want to come back to the supply comment. One of the things that we focused on and we'll keep hearing a lot about is a tremendous amount of private equity dry powder that that's on the sidelines. I'm wondering if you get any sense that the supply which continues to get pushed out is really driven by builders anticipating that maybe that private equity wants to go into apartments and they can't find enough apartments to buy.","So is there a chance that developing it maybe last longer than we're all anticipating because of all this dry powder that might be attracted to multifamily or do you think that's maybe misguided?","Mark Parrell","Yes I'm not sure that dry powder is looking for development exposure. I mean some of it is but I think some of it is probably interested in value add and some of its interested in core and different flavors and the continuum there. I would say that lately we've had more anecdotal evidence to the contrary in terms of more inbound calls to Alan George, our Chief Investment Officer and his team of people that have sites tied up but can't find the equity to do it or their equity went away and they're looking for someone else to jump in and wondered if we were interested.","So I'm not suggesting that yet a full trend but we are hearing more of it. We are also seeing and again not yet meaningfully, but we also seeing land come available at prices that were lower or less high than before. So to us I'm not sure that that dry powder is waiting for development. I think if you really wanted to do development and you didn't care too much about the yield you figure out a way to do more development. I think a lot of that is probably interested in other kind of plays in real estate in general or in apartments and right now I kind of see equity.","Equity is probably a little bit more hesitant in our opinion on development now than it was a year ago, but until something dislocates they're still going to put some measure of capital into that because the plays work so far.","Rich Hill","Got it, thank you, that's helpful, that's all for me guys. ","Mark Parrell","Thank you, Rich. Have a good day.","Operator","We will now take our next question from John Guinee of Stifel, please go ahead.","John Guinee","Great, just nice quarter by the way guys. Just building on the last couple questions on development, the merchant builders dominate the business. What do you think the yield on cost that they are willing to accept versus the yield on cost that you're willing to accept? Is that a overall 25 basis point gap or a 150 basis point gap?","Mark Parrell","That's almost an existential question for us because when we think about development it isn't with the merchant builder mentality of what's the cap rate if the market is trading at 4 in a quarter we need to get 5 in a quarter and otherwise we won't build it. We're looking at a price per unit, a price per square foot, feeling that this location has been hard to buy I mean a lot of what we built coming out of the great recession that we got from our stone was [chat] with properties in San Francisco because we had such a hard time finding stuff to buy. So we figured we had to build it if we wanted to own it.","So I guess, I\u2019d tell you I think, the weak industry in general in Equity Residential for sure on the apartment development side just thinks a little bit differently and more like a long-term investor. So I think most of these developers that are private guys who build until someone doesn't give them the money and they can have different yield expectations that they are what they are. I think for a company like ours we are very disciplined that's one of the advantages and we're perfectly willing to sit on our hands and like I said continue to look at things that are already in the portfolio to create densification and\/or buy assets that already exist. So I don't know that it can be reduced to the manner you just reduced it to.","John Guinee","If you try to reduce it to that manner could you?","Mark Parrell","It's probably too cold outside. Well, we might accept a little lower spread than they are if it's really hard to build asset in like San Francisco. We might require a lot more in a place that maybe is a little bit easier to build like DC because we have the ability to go optionally between buying existing streams of income and building new streams of income. So I guess that would be my full answer.","John Guinee","Great, thank you.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Tycho Okusanya of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Tycho Okusanya","Yes. Good afternoon. Keep warm in Chicago please. First question, the 700 to 900 million of debt you are planning to raise in 19 and the debt you are planning to pay off I just wanted to confirm from a payoff perspective it's the 450 million notes due July 1, 2019. And also the 500 million due July 1, 2020 is that what you're planning to pay off?","Mark Parrell","That's correct.","Tycho Okusanya","Perfect. Second question, the green bonds congrats on getting that done. Just kind of curious what kind of buyers you're seeing for that specific type of bond and it's generally the type of REITs you're getting on them whether they're more advantageous and just issuing regularly on secured bond?","Mark Parrell","Yes. So I'll cover kind of a buyer base and the differentiation between a green bond and a conventional bond. Obviously with the green bond you do attract a different type of buyer base in part but not in total as what I would say. So in part, this deal that we lasted did probably have 15% or 20% of capital that came from dedicated kind of green institutions that had a mandate from their stakeholders to invest in these types of bonds and that is certainly helpful to the overall demand as you're issuing a bond.","To kind of get to your second point which is from a pricing perspective it is really hard to quantify whether or not you get kind of any differential between the spread on a conventional bond versus a green bond. That being said obviously demand for our paper which has been high given our credit quality and kind of our reputation in the space for fixed income is very good. It's helpful to always have more buyers. It was certainly helpful in the market in the fourth quarter because the market in the fourth quarter was pretty choppy. So it did assist us in that regard.","Tycho Okusanya","That's helpful and then another one for me if you don't mind appreciate the intimation about renewal rates in January and kind of an overall sense of what it could look like this year. Could you just talk a little bit more around kind of new rates, kind of new rent growth and what that's shaping up to be there 1Q overall views for the year?","Mark Parrell","So the projection for the first quarter is that what you're asking on new lease change?","Tycho Okusanya","On new lease change yes, just some general thoughts about for the year that's built into your forecast?","Mark Parrell","So I don't have it broken down by quarter in front of me. I know that in the fourth quarter of 18, the new lease change was down at negative 2.4 and I think as I\u2019ve said on previous call not really thinking that that metric should be looked at on a quarterly basis as much as it should be looked at kind of the annual year-over-year basis.","I'm happy to kind of share it as we get through the first quarter. I don't have it down with me right now as to how we broke that improvement up. My guess is most of the improvement in new lease change that I talked about at the top level is occurring in the second and third quarter as we start to experience pricing power in the peak leasing season but I'm sure there's an improvement over Q4 and that I'm sure we stagger it up as we work through the year and then we take Q4 of 19 back down.","Tycho Okusanya","And kind of -- for 19 over and last 12 months I'd basis are you expecting that number to eventually turn positive?","Mark Parrell","Yes. So for the full year revenue guidance we would expect new lease change to be positive 10 basis points.","Tycho Okusanya","10 basis points. Excellent, thank you very much.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Wes Golladay","Yes, good morning guys. Looking at the wage growth you're seeing in your markets I know it's at your property level you\u2019re seeing 4% to 5% but can give us a sense of what you expected for the overall markets that EQR markets and which markets are you seeing the biggest buildup in affordability?","Mark Parrell","So it's Mark. So you're asking less about high like wage growth in general of our residents?","Wes Golladay","Yes.","Mark Parrell","So just to be clear about the data we have is a little bit limited on this. So we only pull our residents, are able to effectively request what to take when they first apply to lease portfolio. They're not as forthcoming afterwards. So we're trying to do renewal negotiations. So we don't necessarily know what's happened. So again it's a little bit of an estimate.","Generally speaking as we see it the portfolio has had higher wage growth by our residents and certainly the best way to look at it is that affordability statistic compared to our rent continues to be pretty well. There's room we think to raise rents the old-fashioned way because of the wage growth and just the fact that in our segment are more affluent renter segments there's room to raise rents because the rent income ratio is not terribly high.","Michael Manelis","And it really hasn't moved much either on a trailing 12-month, we're at 19.3% and our ranges in our market go from 17.5% to 23% with Washington, Seattle and New York kind of being the lowest and like that 17.5% to 18% ratio and Southern Cal averages at the highest at 21.3%.","Mark Parrell","Is that helpful Wes?","Wes Golladay","That is fantastic. That was what I was looking for. So fantastic there and then for your employees now there's a 4 % to 5% wage pressure you are seeing. Is there any markets that stand out or maybe West Coast versus East Coast?","Mark Parrell","No, I would say it's kind of just across the board that we are experiencing that.","Wes Golladay","Okay thanks a lot and stay warm.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from [Indiscernible]. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys thanks for taking the question and good results. Just a question on the tax cuts in Jobs Act. There was some clarification about two weeks ago on some of the deductions and the path through. Has there been any adjustment on your side? Have you guys gone through all the new legislation and these clarifications, has there been any updates on your side for any implications on that?","Mark Parrell","No I mean there's macro implications and Bob may supplement my answer but there's sort of big and small implications. I mean what the tax cuts did is actually give our residents on average more cash and I think you're asking a more technical question, Bob is going to answer it more general way initially. It gave our residents more cash because they weren't taking, they were now able to take a larger standard deduction. So for us it's generally been okay.","A negative in our markets could be that some of these jurisdictions were in our relatively high state local tax jurisdictions and if those taxes aren't deductible is it harder for those jurisdictions to raise capital to renovate subways in places like New York and DC and things of that nature.","In terms of the technical aspects again Bob and I can go back and forth a little bit with you but generally speaking they have not been terribly meaningful to us. We appreciate the work the industry association did on the pass through stuff. There's some technical depreciation things that still need to be resolved but there's nothing that we're watching with a great deal of concern at this juncture.","Unidentified Analyst","It was more on the technical side, if there was any kind of additional pass through that you could take advantage of. But obviously on the FF&E there's a bit more flexibility on that side as well. Has that created any opportunities for you to perhaps move into furnishing, move into furnished departments in greater scale or are you guys still pretty comfortable where you are?","Mark Parrell","Well, our tax person will be so excited to talk to you about. So certainly we can do depreciation studies if we needed to lower our taxable income and that's why people do these sorts of studies and we've done it before. So you can reclassify some things into a faster depreciable class. What's possible we could do that we're aware that that exists we don't need to do that right now. So it's fine to sit where it is and if we need to do that study we will.","Unidentified Analyst","And just that the last thing is also on legislation but it's more of Boston, Cambridge focused and I know you got a question earlier about some of the rent control concepts that are being thrown out there. The Mayor of Boston recently is trying to impose a cap of 5% on tenants that are over the age of 75 which is effectively a stealth rent control and things like right to purchase and of course Cambridge being what it is, is they're also trying to impose some things like paid relocation expenses for evictions and larger rent increases.","How I mean, as you have more pricing power with your tenants and there's going to be more, there's really more ability to push up the rent. Obviously the government's are going to get more involved particularly in Boston and Cambridge. So I mean, how worried are you about this? Is this I mean, this is something that's going to gain a lot of steam?","Mark Parrell","Yes. Well people thought that in California and we want a resounding victory the industry did through I think a good educational campaign. Once people understand that this is not a productive way to solve a problem you tend to get a better reaction from voters. I mean Cambridge had rent control for a long time and it worked very badly and in fact there's academic studies about it and that was one of the reasons they got rid of it some years ago.","I realized memories are short, the industry does need to stay very engaged. You can expect we will be. We have very senior guy in Boston who is involved with the Boston Apartment Association and the different functions groups in Boston that are involved on the industry's behalf and we will continue to have that conversation. But again, I think enlisting private industry and creating more workforce and affordable housing is the way to solve a problem. I think a lot of the things you mentioned certainly are negative and it's our job to have a conversation about those and they're not just negative for us we think they're just negative in general. I think they're not going to provide more affordable housing. I think they're going to do the opposite over time.","Unidentified Analyst","Agreed, all right that's it for me and I'll say the prerequisite of a stay warm. Thanks guys.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our final question from Tycho Okusanya of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Tycho Okusanya","Yes, thanks again for indulging me. 2019 guidance does that have any expectations forecast in regards to any benefits from HQ2 or Google which you did discuss in your comments? ","Michael Manelis","No. There's nothing embedded in our guidance either in New York or DC regarding those expansions. I think our view right now it's a positive psychological impact. It reinforces like Mark said in his opening remarks as to why we're in those markets to begin with and I think it's, like I said it's too early to kind of see any economic impact from that.","Tycho Okusanya","Understood, thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to your host for any additions or closing remarks.","Mark Parrell","Well, we thank you all for your time today for sticking with us and what was a pretty long call and we'll see many of you on the conference circuit over the next few months. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Marty McKenna. Please go ahead, sir.","Marty McKenna","Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's third quarter 2018 operating results. Our featured speakers today are David Neithercut, our CEO; Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; Mark Parrell, our President; and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer.","Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.","And now, I'll turn the call over to David Neithercut.","David Neithercut","Thank you, Marty, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for today's call. As we reported in last night\u2019s earnings release with the primary leasing season in the rear view mirror, we\u2019re pleased to now expect to deliver same store revenue growth for the full year of 2.3%, which is at the very top of the guidance range we provided on most recent earnings call in late July.","Achieving this level of growth is the result of a couple of primary drivers, the continued strong demand across the board for rental housing and the relentless attention to customers' service delivery each and every day by our outstanding property management teams. These two factors combined to maintain very high levels of occupancy, record setting resident retention and very strong renewal rates, all despite elevated levels of new supply across our markets. We could not be more proud of our teams across the country for the outstanding jobs they do, making living with equity a remarkable experience with each and every one of our residents.","I'll now ask our Chief Operating Officer, Michael Manelis, to go into greater detail on what we are seeing across our markets today.","Michael Manelis","Okay. Thank you, David. So let me being with a huge shout out to our onsite teams. The third quarter represents our busiest activity period with just over one third of the entire year's renewal and new leases taking place. The team's performance and relentless focus on delivering remarkable experiences to our residents delivered outstanding results for the quarter. With just over 24,000 transactions completed during the third quarter, we achieved a 5.1% increase on renewals, and a 1.2% increase on new leases signed. This, along with maintaining our occupancy at 96.2%, has delivered third quarter revenue growth of 2.3%, which as David said, now gives us the confidence that our full-year 2018 revenue growth will be 2.3%, which is the top of our previous reported range.","I would also like to highlight that the 16.4% turnover for the quarter is the lowest third quarter turnover reported in the history of our company. We renewed just over 500 more residents in the third quarter of '18 versus the third quarter of '17 with roughly the same number of explorations in each period.","During the third quarter, we also achieved our highest recorded resident satisfaction scores. Service related surveys completed in the third quarter, came in with an average rating of 4.8 out of 5, and year-to-date, we have increased our all-time high online reputation scores with both Google and Yahoo. Both of these are by far the most important customer review platforms to our prospects.","Bottom line is that service and leasing teams have been focused on delivering remarkable experiences and their efforts are paying off. Before I move to specific market commentary, I would like to start by saying that the overall trends we discussed last quarter has continued. Our average resident tenure, currently at 2.2 years, continues to grow, as a result of our exceptional renewal process rate service and the macro trends of millennial differing life change events like marriage, children, and buying homes.","For on-demand fueled by good job growth and record low levels of unemployment in our market has aided in the absorption of the elevated supply. So let's start with Boston. Full-year revenue growth expectations of 2.4% is slightly above the expectations we shared with you on our second quarter call, primarily due to strong replacement growth, which has continued into October and stronger renewal increases. This performance happened at the same time that the majority of the 2018 new supply was delivered in the urban core, and went head to head with most of our NOI. Our revised assumptions for 2018 include occupancy at 95.8%, a negative 0.8% on new lease change and achieve renewal increases of 4.9%. Deliveries will be like the urban core over the next year, which should continue to bring modest pricing power to the market.","Moving to New York, our current expectation for full year revenue growth has improved to 70 basis points. This is 50 basis points higher than the expectations we shared with you on our last call. This outperformance is a large contributor to us achieving the high end of our overall company's same store revenue guidance.","Our full year assumptions for New York include occupancy at 96.5%, a negative 2.2% new lease change, and achieved renewal increases of 3%. Concession used in our portfolio remains extremely targeted and is well below both last year and all expectations throughout the year.","During the third quarter, we had moving concessions being issued to less than10% of our total applications in New York. This resulted in only $260,000 in concessions in the quarter as compared to 830,000 in the third quarter of 2017. 2019 deliveries will be significantly lower than '18 with more than a 50% decline expected. The deliveries will continue to be concentrated in Long Island City and Brooklyn where to date we have not seen a significant impact to our operations. In fact, our base rents in New York today remains strong and sitting here in the last week of October they have not yet started their normal seasonal decline.","As we think about DC, there is not much news to report. Positive economic conditions continued to aid the absorption of new supply, but the overall market continues to demonstrate very little pricing power. We have no change to our full-year expectations of 1.2% revenue growth. Our assumptions include full year occupancy at 96.2%, our new lease change of negative 2.1, and an achieved renewal increase of 4.2%. 2019 will mark another year of elevated supply with just over 12,000 units expected.","Moving over to the West Coast, Seattle is expected to deliver 3% revenue growth for the full year, which is in line with the guidance we issued in July. Our full year assumptions for Seattle include occupancy at 95.7, a negative 1.8 new lease change, and achieved renewal increases of 5.7%. Seattle supply is expected to slightly increase next year to just over 8,000 units. As a CBD where we have approximately 40% of our NOI should experience some relief in 2019 as the concentration of the supply shift to the Bellevue Redmond submarket, where we have 24% of our NOI.","On the previous calls, I mentioned the outperformance of the San Francisco market being a contributor to the upward revision of our revenue guidance. Not much has changed. We expect full year revenue growth to be 2.9%, which is consistent with our July call. Our full year assumptions for San Francisco include 96% occupancy, a positive 0.3% new lease change, and 4.9% achieved renewal increase.","Looking at the overall market, the tech companies continued to grow, and the Bay Area is on track to surpass the 10 year high of 35 IPOs that was set back in 2014. There continues to be daily announcements highlighting the expansion of companies in this market. Office vacancies continued to move lower, and all of this should support positive fundamentals in our space. The deliveries for 2019 in San Francisco are expected to increase by about 2,500 units to 9,500 with over 40% concentrated in Oakland and East Bay submarkets. At this point, it is still unclear exactly what the impact from the Oakland delivery will be, sort of like the Long Island City situation on Manhattan, although this will have considerably fewer units coming online.","Moving down to Los Angeles, we expect full-year revenue growth to be 3.6%, which is up 20 basis points from our July guidance. Our full-year assumptions are 96.2% occupancy, 6.1% achieved renewal increase and 1.4% new lease change. Construction in the market continues to face labor shortage issues, which has pushed 2,000 units from 2018 into 2019. We now have 2018 showing just over to 9,600 units and 14,200 units being completed in 2019.","It is likely that we will see some of these expected 2019 deliveries we pushed into 2020. That being said, the combined 24,000 units over the two year period has not changed and this total has spread out over a huge geographical region. Remember, we tend to feel the impact from new supplies when it is delivered in a concentrated fashion in direct competition to our assets. For example, in 2019, our San Fernando Valley portfolio will have exposure to new supply for the first time in a while, but that new supply will have very little direct impact on our West L.A. portfolio, which is many miles away. Regardless, the overall market in L.A. continues to demonstrate strong demand, which should continue to aid the overall absorption.","Moving to Orange County, our full-year revenue expectation has modestly increased 10 basis points to 3.6%. This is tied with L.A. for our second highest revenue growth market for the year. Our full-year assumptions have occupancy at 96%, achieved renewal increases of 5.5% and 0.3% new lease change. 2019 outlook for deliveries is about 500 fewer units at just over 3,500 units expected.","And last but not least, San Diego. Our full-year revenue expectations remain unchanged at 8%. This will be our highest revenue growth market for the year. Our full-year assumptions have occupancy at 96.2%, achieved renewal increases of 5.9%, and 1.6% new lease space. 2019 outlook for deliveries is about 700 fewer units at just over 3,000 units expected.","So now, let me close with some color on 2019. While we are not issuing guidance at this point, nor will I'd be sharing any specific numbers at the market level, I do want to share some general thoughts on our guidance process and our preliminary review of the 2019 market performance.","To begin, we have two different approaches creating our guidance: one, that is bottom-up completed by the onsite and property management leaders, and the other that is a top-down approach completed by our revenue management and senior leadership teams. We are in the very early stages of both methods, and both methods consider supply, employment, and our current posture in terms of renewals, new lease rates and occupancy.","Today, we anticipate that both occupancies and achieved renewal increases will be very similar or slightly better next year. We also expect to see some improvements in our new lease change as modest pricing power continues to grow in many of our markets. To bucket our very preliminary expectations today, we would say that California market, excluding any impact from propositions, and may deliver similar results in 2019. Seattle will likely to be less. And moving to the East Coast, New York, should be better, Boston's on track to be slightly better and D.C. will most likely to be about the same.","With that, I will turn the call over to our President, Mark Parrell.","Mark Parrell","Thank you, Michael. As we expected, we had a busy third quarter on the investment side. We mentioned last quarter that we planned to reenter the Denver market, after exiting that market in early 2016. We did so this quarter by acquiring two assets at a total cost of $275 million. As you may recall, we left that market because we had a portfolio that was primarily garden, surface-parked older suburban products and with a portfolio exit, not a market call. We have kept our eye on Denver and continue to believe that in the right locations and prices this market can produce excellent long-term returns.","We see in Denver, many of the same attributes we see in our coastal markets and we think will lead to higher long-term returns such as single family home prices that are higher than absolute matter as well as on a relative basis as compared to incomes, the creation of many high-paying jobs over an extended timeframe, our history of strong rent growth and a market with a high quality of life where our target millennial demographic wants to live, work and play as evidenced by strong population growth in the 25 to 34 year-old age cohort. And all that comes along with a fiscally sound local and safe government.","So some specifics for the assets in Denver. One asset was acquired for $140 million, which is about $395,000 a unit. The property was completed in 2017, and is a high-rise in the uptown neighborhood near downtown with a 96 walk score. We expect a 4.7% cap rate in year one and believe we purchased it at a modest discount to replacement cost. The other Denver property is a mid-rise located in the same uptown neighborhood. The property was acquired for $135 million or about $364,000 a unit, was built in 2017, and has 83 walk score, we expect a 4.6% cap rate in year one and believe we also purchased it at a modest discount to replacement cost.","We also acquired a high-rise asset in Boston for $216 million or about $572,000 per unit. It's located in the south end neighborhood that was built in 2015, as 97 walk score and complements well our current Boston portfolio. We expect a 4% cap rate in year one. And while we acknowledge as a relatively low cap rate, we feel that is a good trade as it was used it was funded using proceeds from the sale of an asset on the Upper West side of New York, at a disposition yield of 3.9%. ","This property sold for $416 million or about $820,000 per unit. We earned a 9.8% unlevered IRR over our five year whole period. This property is in the burn-off period for the 421-a tax abatement program.","A quick note on our strategy in New York. We had significant -- have a significant concentration on the Upper West side of Manhattan and felt it prudent to reduce our concentration in that submarket and our exposure to outsize real estate tax increases in the future. We continue to believe that the New York market is an excellent long-term IRR performer, as evidenced by the return on the asset we just sold. You can expect us to buy and build in New York as opportunities present themselves. As always, we will continue to review our portfolio both in New York and elsewhere with an eye to maximizing our long-term total return, including our cash flow growth.","Before I conclude my remarks, as you all know, our friend and leader, David Neithercut, is retiring January 1, after remarkable 25-year career at Equity Residential. On behalf of our investors, our Board and the entire Equity nation of employees, current and past, thank you, David, for your leadership and even more for being a person of great wisdom and integrity whether it was taking advantage of capital allocation opportunities like Archdome, navigating us safely through the shoals of the credit prices, or in your work every day to improve our operations and build our team, you always made the right decision in the right way. I also thank you for all the time and effort you've spent mentoring me over the years, and I look forward to have you continue to contribute to Equity Residential as a board member. You've had a great ride at Equity, and we wish you well in the next chapter of your life.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Bob Garechana, EQR's new Chief Financial Officer.","Bob Garechana","Thanks, Mark, and good morning. With Michael having covered our upward revision to same-store revenue guidance, I want to take a couple of minutes to talk about same-store expense guidance, full-year normalized FFO guidance and capital markets activity.","As is our custom with our third quarter reporting, we've raised our same-store guidance from -- we've provided, sorry, our same-store guidance from ranges to single points. For same-store expenses, we expect to produce full year 2018 growth of 3.7%, which is effectively at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided during the last call.","Before I move to specific categories, I'd like to highlight that for the first nine months of 2018, same-store expenses increased 3.4%. As a result, our guidance implies a higher expense growth rate during the fourth quarter of 2018. This is due to a low comparable period for the same quarter last year.","Now, let me provide some color on the drivers of full-year same-store expense growth. On property taxes, we've produced growth of 4.1% through the first nine months of 2018. We now expect our full-year property tax expense growth to be approximately 4% or at the low end of our prior expectations. We've continued to have success with our fuel and refund efforts this year relative to our prior estimates. As a reminder, our prior property tax expectations already contemplated the sale of the New York assets subject to 421-a in the third quarter as Mark discussed. As such, a 30 basis point reduction to property taxes was already included in our second quarter range of 4% to 4.5%.","Now moving to payroll, our second largest expense category. For the full-year, we continue to expect payroll growth around 3.5%. The job market remains highly competitive with near full employment. We, like many employers, continue to experience wage pressure in order to retain our best-in-class onsite employees and continue to provide superior residential service.","In our earnings release, we gave full-year same-store revenue guidance of 2.3%, driven by strong renewals, low turnover and high occupancy, as Michael discussed. With same-store expenses in line with prior expectations, we now expect to produce same-store NOI growth of 1.7%, which is at the higher end of our previous range. This contributes approximately one additional $0.01 per share to full-year normalized FFO.","We've also updated our guidance for normalized interest expense and corporate overhead, which we define as property management and G&A. We now anticipate a $0.01 improvement in normalized interest expense, driven by lower than expected floating rate and later timing in our expected debt rates, the normalized corporate overhead we expect to come in at the top end of our previous range resulting in a $0.01 reduction to normalized FFO due to compensation expenses at the higher end of our earlier estimates.","The net result of all of it is a $0.01 increase to our normalized FFO guidance midpoint, moving it from $3.25 per share to $3.26 per share. All-in-all, revenue expectations have improved, expenses remain in line and the midpoint of our normalized FFO guidance has modestly increased.","Quickly on the capital markets front. You saw in the release that we prepaid a $500 million secured debt pool due 2019 with our line of credit. Our guidance contemplated pre-paying is relatively expensive debt and we\u2019re able to do so without penalty. We expect to turn out all our portion of this debt in the upcoming months. With the majority of the anticipated offering hedge a very favorable treasury rate, we would expect to issue at a rate well below the level of the debt that we prepaid.","With that, Jonathan, I'll turn it over to the Q&A session. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America.","Juan Sanabria","I was just hoping you guys could give us a little bit of color on New York City, and how you're seeing new lease rates trending into next year. It seems like that\u2019s a big variable. If you could just talk to the range of what's expected for New York City in particular given the meaningful drop off of it supplies, a market that is going to accelerate quickly or is that more of a 2020 story?","Michael Manelis","Yes. So this is Michael. So I think, I said that I\u2019m going to stay away from kind of the specifics of ranges at a market level. I will just tell you though, in New York, that while we do see this marked reduction in the supply the 50 basis point, we like where the base rent growth is on a year-over-year basis today, holding strong into October. You\u2019re going to come up against the wave of renewals for all of the deliveries that occurred this year. So it\u2019s not that you are completely out of the wood, but you have forward momentum in New York, definitely will be better next year or should be better next year than where it is today just because of that forward momentum and what we have embedded into the rent growth.","Juan Sanabria","Okay, great. And then you kind gave some parameters about supply expectations for '19. But do you have, could you provide the percent change and expect deliveries if we look at the latest action. But it seems like some of the West Coast markets are seeing an increase as a whole. But again you still generally feel confident outside of Seattle that things are going to improve. Is that correct?","Michael Manelis","Yes. But I think, I said even like in the San Francisco market, we see about 2,500 more units coming consecrated in that Oakland kind of East Bay. So I think our process that we go through and obviously we start with this kind of actual database, we look at what is competitive to us. So I think in those prepared remarks as I was going through each market, I mean, the biggest market decline is New York City right. And then I would put everything else in these buckets of relatively similar and slight increase like we just said up in the Seattle and San Francisco area.","Juan Sanabria ","[Indiscernible]","Michael Manelis","I\u2019m sorry. What was that?","Juan Sanabria","Anything in the San Jose area as you mentioned Oakland that would be a concern this year relative increase for your portfolio exposure?","Michael Manelis","No, I wouldn\u2019t say that there is really a concern means that, listen, there is strong demand in that market right now and even at those submarket levels. I think what we're paying out there right now is what impacts those the Oakland deliveries have on San Francisco. Will there be drawn? I think it's too early to understand that. But there is -- there all other drivers are positive for the fundamentals of our business in that market. So I think these units will be absorbed that are coming to market. And I do want to clarify one thing that because of the shifts that we what I said in the prepared remarks in L.A., we do see a significant increase in the deliveries for L.A. in '19 as compared to '18.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank.","Nick Yulico","Appreciate the commentary on 2019 on some of the revenue drivers there. Any early look you can give on expense growth? Is there revenues improving? Is expense growth can aid into that at all next year?","Bob Garechana","Yes. Hi, Nick. It's Bob. I mean, as -- I'm going to do the same thing that kind of Michael was doing and avoid any specific commentary on numbers. But thinking about the big expense categories, you really have real-estate taxes, which we've seen a healthier run rate and not sure that you would expect anything kind of different going forward in terms of an aggregate growth component. And then, on the payroll side, we continue to be as full employment in the economy. And so we would expect to kind of see similar levels of employments or wage pressure as we look to retain and engage our employees.","Nick Yulico","And then on New York City, you've had 6% expense growth this year or some of that is due to, I guess, 21 tax abatements burning-off. Can you just remind us where your portfolio in New York City is today in terms of the tax resets that have happened? What still to come? And I guess whether this issue is getting sort of better or worse in terms of expense growth for the New York City portfolio?","Bob Garechana","It's Bob again. We currently have 14 properties in New York that are subject to the 421-a program. And what that means on our kind of real-estate tax run rate basis related to the abatements specifically is on a full-year basis, call it $2.5 million to $3.5 million for the next, call it 5 years. Those projects are all in different levels of abatement, and some of them don\u2019t even start until further out for the next, call it 5 years of $2.5 million to $3.5 million on an annual basis.","Nick Yulico","Okay. And then, I just, last question. You sold the West End asset. It was a low cap rate. It sounds like, I mean, we heard that went to evaluate buyers. So I guess that's supported a lower cap rate. I think you have two other assets you are marketing for sale on New York right now. I mean, are those similar low cap rate deals? And is there also any tax abatement burn-off there to consider? Thanks.","Mark Parrell","Hey, Nick, it's Mark. Congratulations on your new role. What I would say is -- what I'm going to comment is specific marketing activities. We're always out there putting assets on the market and then doing recycling of assets through the system. But I wouldn\u2019t expect New York to be disproportionately effectiveness as fairly by our sale activities we've done well in the market. You can see we've got a pretty good IRR in the asset we just sold. So I think, overall, as we look at New York and the tax abatement assets, if you wanted to buy relatively New York assets are built, you bought them with this abatement. Nothing really was built that didn\u2019t have this abatement on it. So the fact that we have a significant portfolio of 421-a assets is a reflection of fact that we have a significant portfolio in Manhattan. So again, I think, we've done pretty well in these assets. Michal has mentioned some improvements in the supply picture side. And I think there's some optimism in our minds about New York performance. And whatever assets we sell, we'll sell because we get a good price, and if we don\u2019t sell anything in that market that's okay as well.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Nick Joseph from Citi.","Nick Joseph","You continue to drive turnover well. I know it's been a large focus. But what level of turnover do you consider frictional at which it can\u2019t go lower and then new lease growth becomes more important?","Bob Garechana","Yes. I mean it's an interesting question. So I think, I don't know if were there yet. But I would say that we're getting close. I think with record turnover being recorded now for the last couple of quarters, I would expect that trend to continue. I think that the team has done a fantastic job as I said with our relentless focus on delivering outstanding service and focus on renewals. I don't know exactly where we\u2019re going to land, but I'm guessing that we're getting close to kind of normalizing on a turnover percent.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. And then you did the deals in Denver this quarter. Are you considering expansion into nearby markets right now?","Mark Parrell","Hey, Nick, it's Mark. The best thing I can do to guide you on that and -- we've been very open to evolution in our strategic process is to refer you to our investor materials. There is a chart on Page 17 that is like a bit of a heat map that shows you what we think on our market attributes that contribute to success long term. And Denver was the highest rated market on there that we did now. So as we think about our markets, certainly possible that we will win our other markets. But we're thinking about it in the framework of these classic characteristics that we think are good markets, which are relatively high single family costs, places where our target demographic wants to live, work and play, high wage growth markets, those sorts of things that are driving us decision.","Unidentified Analyst","It's Michael filling in and speaking. David, just question for you. And congratulations on your retirement, and congratulations for the rest of the team in terms of this transition that was executed all with internal promotions demonstrating the bench and the leadership that you shown. I\u2019m just curious about staying on the Board. We've seen companies do different things where our CEO retires, and then exits completely versus that are staying on the Board. Can you talk me through how you and the board came to decision to how do you stay on versus leaving?","David Neithercut","Sure. We've had lots of discussions about that, Michael. And decided that really one size does not fit all, not withstand in the fact they are probably years best practices. And probably would have been impossible for me to state on the Board if someone was coming in from the outside. But I've actually hired Mark 20 years ago. He reported nearly directly to me most of that time period. And so, I think the general belief is that -- with that scenario that it would be okay for me to remain on the Board. I think, I understand my boundaries, Mark. And I've had a lot of discussions about what role I should play sort of going forward as well as what role I can play for him sort of going forward. And I think we both go into this with our eyes wide-open and with the belief that it will work very well.","Unidentified Analyst","Now would you add another independent to the Board to sort of balance things out a little bit because arguably you're technically an insider?","David Neithercut","Well, I'm more than technically an insider. I am an insider. Look, we have had some Board -- quite a bit of Board refreshment over the past several years. And I expect that to continue.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Steve Sakwa with Evercore Investments.","Steve Sakwa","I wondered, I know, you guys are not going to talk specifically about next year. But, obviously, Seattle is showing a very, very large deceleration on your numbers, the same-store rental rates gone from 66 a year ago down to 14. And I appreciate your comments about maybe supply moving to some of the suburban markets next year. But, I guess, how concerned you are about further slowdown in the Seattle market in general, as you look forward?","David Neithercut","Yes, well, I mean, I think, clearly, and you can tell us from the prepared remarks that we expect Seattle will produce lower revenue growth next year. It almost is taking what's embedded today with the rents in place and modeling your tool work. I would tell you, I feel better right now about Seattle than I did sitting here three months ago when we were talking about the market. We kind of stabilized the occupancy albeit at a lower price point. But sitting here today, our occupancy is up at 96.1%. So we have some growth in occupancy over the prior period. And I think we're going to kind of run this portfolio with a little bit of a conservative play and build-up this occupancy and let us get through kind of some of this play. I think the job growth side; it remains a diverse market for job growth. We see that Amazon's got like -- their backup to like the record number of open positions at 7700 in Seattle. So I feel like there are some good fundamental things happening. We had a work through some of this supply. We're seeing some of that release in the CBD. Now next year there will be that shift like I said into the Bellevue, Redmond, I think, we will be able to kind of work our way through that with some of the expansion and strength for Microsoft. But, this is just something we got to kind of let play out a little bit. And I think we know how to kind of navigate our way through this.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. So it sounds like things are stabilizing, obviously, we just had sort of the natural maturation of the numbers. But in your perspective, it doesn\u2019t sound like it's getting worse from here.","David Neithercut","No. Other than like the erosion of the pricing power that I just alluded to it, feels like we've kind of stabilize, and we think we're in a place that we know how to navigate our way through this.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. And then, just maybe switching gears to development, I'm not sure everyone to feel this. But just, in general, if you guys are evaluating new projects and thinking about potential land purchases this weight in the cycle. I'm just curious what are you seeing in terms of construction costs and sort of what is your experience in the market in terms of other developers, new projects the pace of new starts, again, we clearly continue to see a push out of the current pipeline. But I'm just sort of curious on your expectations maybe over the next 12 months in terms of new start to given sort of stabilizing market, but certainly rising construction cost.","Mark Parrell","Hey, Steve, it's Mark. And David may amplify my answer a little. Just to answer the question on costs. What we are seeing is generally 4% to 8% higher cost escalation with the 4% to 6% number more of the East Coast, and the numbers in the 6 to 8 range being more Seattle, San Francisco and Southern California. We do look across our markets, and we go to events that are industry events. And here developer speak to the pressures they're under -- both under in terms of hard cost escalation, the tariffs, high land costs, the slower growth we've seen in rents of late, not keeping up with those costs as well as, of course, financing costs up. We do see construction continue to go on. We think it is abating. But not in some material sense except in New York, as Michael alluded to. But we do you think these developers are under significant pressure. We do think they're building IRRs that are, from our perspective, too low. A lot of the product that was being built is good product, and maybe this product we would be interested in buying at some point in the cycle. But at this juncture, I can't tell you, I would I see some material significant decline across the Board, again accepting in terms of New York City.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.","John Pawlowski","Curious. Some of your office three tiers have been found in the table on inflection point in D.C. demand. And I know the multifamily supply is still high. Curious if you're seeing any inflection points from fiscal stimulus defense spending where big employers are starting to enter the market.","Michael Manelis","Yes. So this is Michael. All that I\u2019m trying to see if I can get through the foot traffic count. I think, the overall market right now is showing increase in demand, and I see if I can write percent. So for the month of September, our foot traffic was up 1.4% over September of '17. So call it stable to increasing. What I would say is demand -- people willing to take the time to come in and take a tour with us. It's still not demonstrating the pricing power that we need. So I do think there is a stable improving demand component that's abating in the absorption of the new supply, but nothing that's really giving us the position for pricing power.","John Pawlowski","Okay. And D.C. is kind of New York as a magnet for capital, and cap rates are pretty low at least for the near term growth prospects. The cap rates seeing irrationally low, perhaps. Curious, how you're thinking about D.C. as a source of funds, potentially rather expansion markets? And how you kind of rank the return prospects of D.C. versus some other East Coast markets to operate in?","Mark Parrell","Hey, John, it's Mark. We\u2019re constantly looking at all the markets, including D.C. and including the low performing assets. You can expect us to continue to do that in D.C. And we\u2019re certainly aware acutely of the high supply and the impact that\u2019s had on our numbers in the last few years. I do want to point out D.C. over time has been a terrific performing apartment market. And coming out of the great recession, it was -- it did very well for us. So it does have some countercyclical benefits, it does have the factors perform well over long periods of time. So there are things about D.C. that we do find appealing certainly would be great if this supply abated a bit, but at this juncture, it is like we think the D.C. And in fact, we just completed an asset of 100K that's just started with lease up that. So far is going very well in this sort of know my area so to speak of Washington. So we like the market in many regards that we do acknowledge in difficulties as late in terms of supply.","Operator","We will take our next question from Rich Hill from Morgan Stanley.","Rich Hill","Good morning, guys. I'm sorry if you've mentioned this earlier, but I haven't having discussion on it. Do you have any updates on Costa-Hawkins? We're hearing various different things. But I was wondering if you have any updates from [Indiscernible] less than a month away, a couple of away at this point?","David Neithercut","David Neithercut here. We really no update we would have. It would be the thing you just want hear onto on just the results of -- we see more and more newspaper editorials coming out of closing prop 10, reduced, probably, through the same totaling that you're probably seeing. So no real updates I can give you going into now just 14 or so days away from Election Day. But generally, I can tell you, we've got a -- we've assembled a really good team, very ably led by our senior most leader in the West Coast as well as Essex to the senior leader there. And those guys have really been doing a terrific job getting the message out about what a mistake this would be to address a very serious housing problem in the state. And polling is suggesting at least initially that this understanding if this is not the way that one goes about addressing a very serious housing problem. So we are going to run through the tape on this, and we feel like we've got a good message and it will be elected this year.","Rich Hill","Got it. I want circle back to New York City for a second. Complete depreciation aligned New York City is really attractive asset class of the medium to long-term. But I'm curious, if you think about New York City and the supply coming down. Is it just a worst case scenario coming up the table? Or do you really expect growth to inflect? And I guess the question that I'm asking you is how do you as an owner of multifamily properties in New York City balance near-term, maybe growth that's not as attracting as some other markets, but recognizing that medium to long-term and IRR potentially still really attractive?","Mark Parrell","John, it's Mark. I want to repeat that the question because you broke up a little there, you were asking for some of our view short and medium-term on New York. Is that right? Yes, I'm going to go with that because I can't quite hear at all, again, we're not in a position to give you exact numbers at this juncture. But just in 2015, this market was a 4% revenue market that wasn\u2019t that long ago. So we think there with the supply abating, the continued cycling unit of new media jobs and technology jobs into that market, as a reason this market and are now suggesting its 4% next year. But again go back to a good run rate on revenues at some point in near future. So we would like the market short-term, medium-term, long-term, all across the board.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from John Kim with BMO Capital.","John Kim","The two stabilized development you have this quarter indicate of 4.3% stabilize deals. I'm wondering if that came in below your expectations. And if so, what drove this?","Mark Parrell","So I'm sorry, again, the question was relating to Helios?","John Kim","Yes, Helios and [Multiple Speakers]","Mark Parrell","Yes, we see those assets stabilizing at a mid-5% yield. Again, they're still occupying, positions are burning-off. All that still goes on, on those assets. So we're happy to bring those in kind of a mid-5% yield is our expectation.","John Kim","Okay. And then on your partnership with WhyHotel in D.C., can you give some kind of indication to how much that could add to your development returns or your development yield on the project?","Mark Parrell","So it's Mark. I mean, we think that could be $800,000 or something like that to normalized FFO. It's the really -- just to be clear, none of the numbers that we\u2019re going to show you as occupancy step in the development page of anything they do with WhyHotel occupancy temporarily if units and net properties does it hotel execution. So in the long run, you will see from us of just the 100K number strictly from a residential, permanent residential perspective. But I think you should think about it not as affecting the development yield, but really just effecting FFO next year.","John Kim","Okay. Great. That was my next question. Turning to your New York strategy, do you still feel like three is a need to reduce the consternation in Upper West Side and or are you encouraged somewhat given the pricing at 101 West End?","Mark Parrell","Well, we certainly thought the pricing on West End was good from our perspective. We don't feel compelled necessarily lower our exposure further there. I think, again, we will have assets in the market in all our markets to varying points in time. And but they came in we like we might take it in reinvest in Denver and elsewhere. But I don't think, we here, as a team, we don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re overexposed anymore to the Upper West Side. But again, we will look at each opportunity as they come.","Operator","We will take our next question from Michael Lewis from SunTrust.","Michael Lewis","You talked earlier about rising construction costs of what that maybe for supply. I wanted to ask it a little more specific to you. You haven\u2019t had to raise the budgeted costs on your active developments. Could you talk a little about when in the process you locked in cost? How much you lock in? And if you\u2019ve changed your process around that all given we're in a rising cost environment?","Mark Parrell","I\u2019m going to start, and David may amplify some of this. But, for example, the West End tower deal, the so-called Garden Garage deal, we\u2019re 90% bought out on that deal. It was a matter of great interest to both the board and to the investment committee internally that we not go forward unless we\u2019re very certain about our construction cost and had an appropriate contingency. So I think we're very focused on these things. Not try at the level of detail you're asking for and each one of these deals. But as we approach both West End tower and 249 3rd Street, which are our two most recent starts, we've been very focused on making sure that as much as possible things have bought out. And if there are some risks that we got an appropriate contingency in them. So right now we feel comfortable very much with our budget.","Michael Lewis","That\u2019s helpful, since West End is a biggest line and has the longest lead time. My second question is more of a bigger picture question. You know a lot has been talked about millennials finally getting to marriage age girl there right, but there get it up until their late 30s, the oldest ones. I was wondering about the following divorce rate, and if that\u2019s in any way impactful, and if you think these things together, could become a drag on household formation as that demographic wave kind of moves through the snake?","David Neithercut","We don\u2019t think about -- I mean, very good question. We don\u2019t think about our assets is only attracting millennials. I mean 20% of our residents are 50 and older. We think our kind of product in the areas we are in with the urban and then suburban amenities we have attract people of all ages. So I guess, I would answer and say that, certainly through the millennials are aging. Our average aging our units is 34%. And the biggest cohort is 26, right now of millennials. So we've still got people coming feeding demand. 40 plus percent of our units are single occupant units. So again, we see continued demand across all age groups for our product that GenZ Group that's coming up. I'm not sure why they would like an urban lifestyle any less than they are slightly older siblings. So I mean, we feel pretty good about all the demographic numbers.","Michael Lewis","Do you think the fallen diverse rate was paying attention to it? Or do you think it's mostly immaterial and \u2026","David Neithercut","Yes, I guess, that's kind of hard to say. I mean, I don\u2019t know if that's a trend or if that's this year's number or I don\u2019t mean. The birth rates went down and down and down and now sort of went up a little bit. I don\u2019t, I said, I'm not sure to make it something when it just happens for years.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Dennis McGill from Zelman and Associates.","Dennis McGill","One question with the relation to the employment outlook, as you guys think about and plan for 2019, in general, and maybe rising uncertainty in general about the economy. How do you think about some of the key drivers whether it's employment growth, wage growth and things like that, as you build the plan? And what type of ranges would you put around that with uncertainty, maybe little bit higher deeper into the cycle etcetera?","David Neithercut","Yes, great question. So just to be fair about our process, we don\u2019t have an algorithm where we can put 150,000 jobs per quarter or per month, pardon me, new jobs and come up with a revenue number. It's more that onsite teams and the end market teams talking about the hiring they are seeing and hearing about, as supplemented by what our investment teams think across our markets here in Chicago. So I don\u2019t want to get this sense, but again there is some computer that's fitting on a number for us. And again, a lot of the job growth numbers are national and our portfolio is not national, it's in certain places. So our focus is a bit more micro than maybe your question implies.","Dennis McGill","Okay. And then, but just, as you think about that micro impact, I'm sure, you've looked at it that way. Is the preliminary look, and the numbers that you laid out as far as directionally markets, is that largely assuming that the employment backdrop that was in place in 2018 holds in 2019?","David Neithercut","Yes, it roughly is. And we feel like we have remark -- in Michael's remarks did give you a little color on that. We see hiring occurring in all our markets whether it's a new tech company in Boston or some other hiring relating to media in Los Angeles. So we see it across the platform. But yes, we are basically, in our minds, we are now assuming the things we have rising wages across our residents base combined with employment that's roughly equivalent in '19 to '18.","Dennis McGill","Okay. And then separately, can you maybe just discuss what you're hearing and seeing whether it's your own team or just out there in the market conversations around capital availability from the lending side as well as capital interest in the assets in general?","David Neithercut","Well, I'm going to take part of this, and ask Bob to speak on the lending side. But it continues to be a strong bid across the board for our assets, and for our assets, we think in the apartment space in general. We do think that Chinese buyers have retrenched and are little less participatory in the market. There still are other significant foreign buyers, Canadian, Europeans, and like as well as lot of U.S. money still chasing the asset class. You kind of see that in development side, right. I mean you see the continued development flow as people trying to get exposure to our space. And again, we think flows continue to be very strong on the equity investment side. I\u2019m going to turn it to Bob to talk just about the debt availability part of your question.","Bob Garechana","Yes. So breaking that up and following on Mark's comments, on the stabilized piece, we continue to see very healthy supply or multifamily kind of with the GSTs kind of lending arrangements. So overall, costs have gone up because interest rates have gone up, but that has been very healthy and no meaningful changes versus kind of prior history. On the development side, really kind of echoing Mark's comments as well. We continue to see banks lending. Construction lending is -- pricing actually has come down a little bit in terms of spread, but rates have gone up with LIBOR going up, so all-in costs are maybe a push to slightly higher. But banks are continuing to lend, and they are lending relatively conservative kind of advance rates, so loan to cost rates. What you\u2019re seeing in the space that is probably different than maybe what we thought decade ago is alternative sources of that capital in the form of private equity debt funds etcetera that are willing to be a little bit more aggressive, and we see all of those kind of sources providing capital to the space.","Dennis McGill","As you look it on the development side, does that imply that developments going to last longer or prolong some of the -- what would otherwise be a decline in competition from this supply, deeper into the cycle?","David Neithercut","I guess that remains to be seen, but I will say that this capital that Bob just alluded to, that\u2019s in the middle. That's above the bank and below the equity is very expensive. This tends to be very price capital. And it's going to make the pro forma even harder to pencil. But now as that money is coming in at the same cost of the banks, I mean, it's considerably higher, double the costs or more. So with that in mind, I think, it isn\u2019t necessarily going to extend things too much, just again, because the money is particularly expensive on a relative basis.","Operator","We will take our next question from Drew Berman from Baird.","Unknown Analyst","This is Alex to check on for Drew. Hope you guys could give us some color on the recent Boston acquisition's long-term NOI growth expectations relative to the 1101 West End asset you sold. ","David Neithercut","Sure, I can give you little color on that. So the asset is fully occupied. There is fair amount of competition there. So our first year number in terms of revenue growth was relatively low around 1%. And then we saw rent growth more averaging as it often does for us, in the 3s and then a few quarters here and there with expense growth for us 2.75 to 3. We generally underwrite these deals over a 10-year hold. That gives us some color there. We can certainly comment on West End, but I would say this, I don't know what the buyers pro forma looks like. I don't know what renovations they're going to do? What things they have in mind other potential uses they have? So from our perspective, we saw relatively muted near-term rent growth, relatively high real estate tax increases in the near-term. But again, at some juncture, when this burns-off, you can reset those units to market. And there is certainly value that I'm sure the buyer underwrote in the deal.","Unknown Analyst","That's really helpful. Additionally, could you give us some insight on your our long-term unlevered IRR expectations for your third quarter acquisitions, most notably the Denver assets. We were just curious how you anticipate Denver's long-term NOI growth to trend whether the relative residual value argument holds up compared to the coastal markets?","David Neithercut","Yes, good question. I mean, we were looking at the Denver deal is mid to high 7 IRRs unlevered over 10 years with just the way we generally measure that. They did have -- we did have in our pro forma sum increase to the cap rates on exit, but with the thought that even though these are high-rise and mid-rise construction that there would be some cap rates expansion on the end of the pro forma.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill and Partners.","Alexander Goldfarb","Thank you, and good morning out there. And first, congratulations David, and Mark as well. Two questions for you guys. The first is just on retention. It was a question earlier in the queue. But if you guys are raising renewals at 5%, it doesn\u2019t seem like you are holding back on the renewals and yet, again, you are still retaining more and more tenants if that retention is improving. So do you think there are other things at work like our people just less willing to move apartments the way they were a decade ago? Or have home move outs suddenly declined? Or what do you think is going on that's allowed you to push 5% overall on a sort of 1% to 2% market, and still have keep more of your tenants than lose?","Michael Manelis","So, this is Michael. I would say it's probably a little bit of what everything that you just kind of alluded too. I would say from a reason for move out to buy home. We've actually seeing very little change in our portfolio. I mean year-to-date basis, we're actually down a little bit to a 11.3% of those that move out sighting that reason that was compared to 11.8 last year. Put that all in is 200 fewer people this year to date moving out with that reason. I think, in the third quarter, we renewed. I think I eluded to it 500 more residents than we did in the third quarter of last year with roughly the same amount of exploration. And I think it's a little bit of everything. I think its deferring life changes. I think, honestly we see the relationship between high customer service and retention. And we saw marked improvement in our customer service. This is something we have done and we're seeing the efforts pay off. So I think all of those things put in the blender are contributing to this retention. And to elude to the 5%, part of this too is, remember when you are pricing these renewals, so we have a lot of our transactions occurring, while, pricing these renewals three months before, and where is the rents going to be and we're issuing those renewals at that point. So I think this is demonstrating the fact that in many of our markets are rents are up 3% year-over-year, and reporting these renewals and you are negotiating through this process. And a lot has to do with where these residence prior rents were in relationship to that market as well.","Alexander Goldfarb","And then the second question is just on D.C. it's been sort of a developer's paradise the past number of years. Popular speculation is that. Amazon will go to Northern Virginia. Is your view that if that happens suddenly you and other apartment landlords will benefit because certainly there will be an increase in demand Or is that fear that the developers are already waiting for this and will just ramp-up on the development side. And therefore any pick-up in jobs is going to be more than offset by development?","Mark Parrell","Yes, it\u2019s Mark, Alex. I'm not sure that anything happens instantaneously. I mean, I don\u2019t think Amazon is going to open an office and immediately have 5,000 new employees, and then it get to 50,000 and whatever the number is. Again half of that obviously it's going to be more gradual. Depending where this is there is certainly the capability to developers have to build into this. But if it's near to some of our well located assets that are there already, we can certainly do this. There is no doubt.","Operator","We will take our next question from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.","Rich Anderson","Costa Hawkins, I know where you stand on it. But have you guys done kind of a sensitivity such that let\u2019s say get\u2019s repealed and every single municipality chooses rent control and vacancy control. What the impact would be on your growth profile? Would it be 100 basis points when you look at the entirety of your portfolio? Have you done that exercise? Just to think of a worst case scenario.","David Neithercut","It's David Neithercut here, Rich. We\u2019ve not done all that math, because, of course, that\u2019s the worst case scenario. We don\u2019t know what municipalities that currently have rent control demand. We don't know what municipalities don't have rent control might and act rent control was in fact a right they've had since Costa Hopkins was first put in place and even before that. And you don't know what limitations they'll put on -- they go for properties built before 1995. There are going to be properties built between 2000 and 2005, 2010. So it's just a little bit of some game theory that I\u2019m not quite sure as the productive use of our time. We do know how much NOI or current revenue we got in markets that currently have rent control. We know how much of that might be impacted if the certain market went from 1995 to 2005 or whatever. And so we -- it's just not productive use of time to do what we suggest. But we certainly do know where we have exposure [indiscernible] income might be at risk if certain changes are put in place. But as I said earlier, we feel like what a very good place with respect to the feeding Top 10, again, it's not the best thing for the state of California. It\u2019s a worst thing they could possibly do. We got a good team in place. We\u2019re running hard. We\u2019re going to right after until the bitter end and we feel good about our chances there.","Rich Anderson","Okay. And then last, second and last question. You're talking a lot of that social changes, a lot of divorce, but, one thing, forgive me, but about 75% or 80% of your portfolio now has recreational use of marijuana legalized. And I'm curious how you feel about that probably going to 100% over time. Do you have the ability to write your own laws within your communities because perhaps there could be some mismatches within your community about people who are for and against it? Or maybe it is what they roll and let people do their thing, and perhaps they're happier, and everybody's happy because of that. What are your thoughts about that?","David Neithercut","No client incentive there Rich.","Michael Manelis","This is Michael. I would say it\u2019s not that we write our laws. I mean we have lease agreements in place. I would say almost our entire portfolio is smoke-free today. I think we have some outlier properties that we have not deployed that with. So to me the use of smoking marijuana is no different than cigarette. Cigarettes our legal today. Marijuana it could be recreational legalized in those markets. In our communities, we\u2019re still smoke-free community.","Rich Anderson","Right. But they can smoke inside their apartment and run around out in the community right?","Michael Manelis","No. That would be kind of a lease violation. So just like cigarette, if somebody is smoking inside their apartment, neighbors smell it and that's a lease violation.","Operator","We will take our next question from Tycho Okusanya from Jefferies.","Tycho Okusanya ","Again, you guys have been a dynamic dual for a very long time. But again with Mark [indiscernible] to the CEO role, I'm just curious Mike, are there any changes that you can sign up with reports and maintain to the EQR's strategy now that you are kind of in the CEO seat?","David Neithercut","Well, I'm not quite in the seat; I'm very close to the seat. Well, thank you for those most comments. We've never got in the dynamic dual conversations before. Look, I've been with the company almost 20 years. I've been in the CFO role for 11. The strategy, I think, say it was one that, I embrace in terms of urban then suburban products and the advantageous long-term of owning it. We have all of all the kinds here. And we certainly evolve back into Denver. So I think the strategy will naturally change overtime in response to changes and conditions, and I mean, our thought process. So I wouldn\u2019t expect it to be static. But I don\u2019t expect dramatic changes, especially on the core investment strategies.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we have no further questions. I would like to turn the floor back over to David Neithercut for closing remarks.","David Neithercut","Thanks, everyone. As we are now close, what I think is my 100th and final earnings call, I want to thank everybody in the REIT community for your support, the confidence and probably most important your friendship over the last 25 years. I can tell you it's been a great pleasure and I work with all of you. For those of you, I'll see you in San Francisco in a few weeks. We look forward to thanking you in person. For those of you, I will not see, please note that I would step down at the end of the year with extra ordinary gratitude and with great confidence in Mark the leadership team here at Equity in the future of Equity Residential.

Welcome to the Equity Residential First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded today, Wednesday, May 1, 2013. I would now like to turn the call over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead.","Marty McKenna","Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's first quarter 2013 results. Our featured speakers today are David Neithercut, our President and CEO; David Santee, our Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Parrell, our Chief Financial Officer.","Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.","And now, I'll turn it over to David Neithercut.","David J. Neithercut","Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our call today. As reported in our earnings release last night, the first quarter of 2013 was a very busy, very exciting and certainly a historic period for Equity Residential. On February 27, along with our partners at AvalonBay, we closed on the $16 billion acquisition of Archstone. Equity Residential's $9 billion share of this purchase included 22,000 existing apartment units, 6 assets in various stages of development or lease-up and 14 undeveloped land parcels. Within minutes of the closing, 100% of the Archstone assets were live on our website, equityapartments.com, and Archstone's website was directing all traffic from the assets we acquired to equityapartments.com. Within hours of closing, every acquired property was fully operational on our platform, and normal activity was taking place such as rent payments, service requests, lease renewals, new leases, e-leads, et cetera. The following morning, our LRO pricing system provided pricing for every newly-acquired unit. We've received nearly 3,000 online rental payments totaling nearly $5 million. We've received 5,600 direct debit payments totaling $13 million and 250 service requests, and had certainly achieved our goal of immediate and seamless resident and prospect transfer.","In addition, during the quarter, we restructured $2.9 billion of Archstone's secured debt. We arranged $3.25 billion of new unsecured credit facilities with our bank group. We sold $3 billion of noncore assets and redeployed much of those proceeds in what we have been told is one of the single, largest 1031 tax-deferred exchanges in history. And we were happy to welcome 700 new professionals to the Equity Residential family.","And if that was not enough, we also delivered same-store revenue growth in the first quarter 2013 of 5.1%. We also delivered our 24th consecutive quarter of same-store expense growth of less than 3% and NOI growth for the quarter of 6.3%, all which were very much in line with our expectations for the quarter.","Now I could go on and on for quite some time of how proud we all are of what's been accomplished this past quarter, of the incredible effort and hard work of so many people across the enterprise including our new colleagues that have joined the Equity team from Archstone, of how pleased we are to have completed the total transformation of our portfolio several years ahead of plan and of how excited we are now to own a portfolio of some of the finest assets in gateway cities across the country that should deliver the highest risk-adjusted returns over the long term. We've got a lot of ground to cover today.","So before I turn the call over to David Santee, our newly-appointed Chief Operating Officer, I want to just take a minute to thank the people of Equity Residential, those of you who have been with us for a while, those that have recently joined us and those who have recently departed -- for all that you've done over the last year and the last quarter to make this all happen. Your commitment, your dedication, your spirit and your love for what you do made all this possible. And it's an honor to be your CEO and to work with you all each and every day.","So I'm now very happy to turn the call over to David who will share with you what we're seeing on the ground across our markets today.","David S. Santee","Thank you, David. Since we last spoke, our business has performed exactly as expected on both revenue and expense during the most active quarter in our history.","For the quarter, same-store revenue for 90,350 apartments was 5.1%, driven by continued strength in apartment fundamentals and our execution around the 4 key revenue drivers, which are physical occupancy, resident turnover, base rental rates on new leases and renewal pricing.","Now unlike Q1 of last year, we entered 2013 from a position of greater strength, with occupancy averaging a solid 95% versus 94.7% in Q1 of last year. Improved sales metrics for the quarter, which are Internet leads, foot traffic and applications were all up, producing an increase in move-ins of 3% year-over-year, giving us continued confidence with our renewal program that I'll discuss in a moment.","Resident turnover quarter-over-quarter on the surface increased 20 basis points. However, looking behind the curtain on this metric, we saw a 14% increase in same-community apartment transfers as residents trade both up and down to accommodate changing life situations and continue to find ways to adapt to affordability concerns. Even though our turnover metric is up, we were able to retain more residents for the quarter as the increased same-property transfers more than accounted for the 20 basis points increase in turnover.","And just to add additional color, home buying inched up for the quarter, increasing 40 basis points from 11.7% of move-outs to 12.1% of move-outs. But in absolute terms, it was only a net increase of 51 more home buyers over 2012. Most important was the continued decline in move-outs due to rent increase that we saw begin in early Q4 and fell from 15.1% for Q1 of 2012 to 13.3% in Q1 of this year. As we have cycled through the 2 or 3 years of double-digit rent increases in many of our core markets, our new residents now find high single-digit renewal increases more palatable.","As expected, base rent pricing for the quarter followed the traditional seasonal pattern of moderation. However, our strong occupancy and low exposure that we see today sets the stage for base rents to move slightly above 4% as demand begins to accelerate.","And last, but certainly not least, our renewals. For the quarter, we achieved a 5.7% average renewal increase, slightly above our expectations. Looking forward, we have quoted renewal increases for May, June and July in excess of 7% and are currently achieving a 5.3% for May, 5.1% for June and 5.2% for July. Residents with smaller increases typically sign immediately, and as a result the monthly achieved numbers have historically improved as we move into the month of expiration.","All in all, we are right where we expected to be. San Francisco, Denver and Seattle continue to be our top 3 markets. And to date, we have seen little direct impact from the new supply in Seattle or North San Jose. Washington, D.C. continues to meet our expectations with solid occupancy and moderating rent growth in some submarkets. The overall fear of sequestration and its unknown impact on the D.C. economy, in addition to the new supply, has caused many multifamily operators, as expected, to hunker down and buy occupancy, putting a damper on any potential near-term pricing power. It's important to note, however, that all but one of our same-store D.C. assets are still experiencing positive revenue growth as of May.","Los Angeles appears to have finally realized sustainable traction with outsized growth in the urban core and more moderate growth as you move north and east into the Inland Empire. Orange County is on the same track of above-average growth with San Diego bringing up the rear with a 3.6% year-over-year revenue growth.","New York remains solid as continued economic diversification in areas of tech and new media from financial services, coupled with little to no supply, create a very robust demand for quality apartments.","On the expense side, it's business as usual. As David mentioned, our 24th consecutive quarter of sub-3% expense growth is a testament to the transparency and power of our platform process, and more importantly, our people. The 3 drivers of expense making up 68% of all expenses are real estate tax, payroll and utilities and all are expected to meet our full year expectations. However, recent speculative run-ups in the natural gas market have pressured both gas expense and electric costs during the past couple of months. Only recently we have seen them fall back to expected levels, but they still meet our forecast. Real estate taxes, our largest expense, is on target at 6.5%.","More importantly, as we have exited many Southeast markets, we have also reduced future volatility in our ability to forecast full year taxes. Before the Archstone acquisition and dispositions, 80% of all real estate tax dollars were unknown until the end of Q3. Today, that number is 40%, adding a higher degree of predictability to overall expense growth. All other account groupings are well within our expectations, and we expect to see continued expense optimization in our same-store portfolio as a result of integrating the Archstone assets.","As for the integration, everything is going extremely well. As David mentioned, many months and hours of planning paid off with a swift and seamless transition to our platform. And equally rewarding was the feedback we received from our new residents, but more importantly, our new associates regarding the superior enterprise platform and process that our team has spent the last 7 years designing and building. Our new associates continue to assimilate and remain focused on the key drivers of our business.","Occupancy as of today for the Archstone stabilized assets is a solid 96.1%. Revenue is tracking in line with our same-store portfolio with an estimate of 5.3% revenue growth for the quarter and is slightly ahead of our original underwriting done almost a year ago. Expenses to-date are substantially below our budget and far exceeding our expectations as we continue to embed our procurement tactic and spending philosophy in every aspect of the business. We couldn't be more pleased with both the financial results and positive outlook from our new Archstone associates and look forward to continued success and exceptional results.","David J. Neithercut","Great. Thanks very much, David. Let me take a minute now to talk a little bit about the portfolio and what we sold during the quarter, what we expect to sell over the remainder of the year and what we think we'll look like on the 1st of January 2014.","So as noted in the release last night, during the quarter, we sold more than 18,000 apartment units for nearly $3 billion at a weighted average cap rate of 6% and a price per unit of slightly more than $161,000. These sales and volume were right on top of our original expectations when we were finalizing the Archstone deal late last year.","Now as we indicated when we announced the deal in late November, the disposition of assets in exit markets, as well as nonstrategic assets in core markets were extremely integral to the overall deal. Because not only did the acquisition of 60% of Archstone give us access to a huge supply of assets that fit hand and glove with our existing portfolio, but it also represented the opportunity to recycle capital out of the markets in assets that we had no desire to own for the longer term.","As we also discussed in our last call, it was our original expectation November of last year that we would sell our properties more ratably over the current year, but thanks to the work that had been done by our team in advance of the announcement and the continued strong demand by buyers to acquire these assets, we were able to accelerate the disposition timeline and significantly reduced the execution risk of the Archstone acquisition, though that would come at the cost of more FFO dilution for the year than originally expected.","In addition to the $3 billion of dispositions in the first quarter, thus far in the second quarter, we have already closed the sale of 8 additional assets for $374 million at a weighted average cap rate of 6%. We currently expect to sell another $400 million to $500 million yet this quarter and plan on selling another $200 million in the second half of the year, bringing the total amount of disposition activity of legacy EQR assets for the full year to $4 billion.","On Page 8 of last night's press release, we show the changes in our portfolio between the end of last year and the end of the first quarter of this year. And during which time, we have increased the amount of our NOI coming from our core markets by 6 percentage points to 92% and have increased our average rental rate in those markets by 9.5% to $2,126 per unit. You can also see that we reduced the number of units we own in Atlanta, Phoenix and Orlando by nearly 1\/2 and in Jacksonville by nearly 75%. By the end of the year, we expect to have 90% of our operating net income coming from the noted core markets, to have exited Tacoma and Jacksonville completely and to have essentially completed our exit from both Phoenix and Atlanta, but for a handful of joint venture assets that will be left behind that will require a bit more time and structure.","The disclosure of our development business in last night's earnings release shows $1.4 billion of active development currently underway. That number increased during the quarter with the start of construction on our project at 170 Amsterdam on Manhattan's Upper West Side, a terrific site that we tied up in early 2011 and where we will build 237 units on a long-term ground lease.","Our development activity also increased during the last quarter with the addition of 6 Archstone assets, representing $400 million in total development costs. Of these new additions from Archstone, our current expectation is that only the Marina del Rey project is a long-term hold and we would expect to sell the others following lease-up and stabilization.","As part of the Archstone transaction, we also acquired 14 new land sites. Of these, we will hold 6 for future development -- 1 land site in Washington D.C. and 5 in San Francisco, 4 of which are in San Francisco proper and 1 which is in the Mid-Peninsula. We will likely sell the remaining 8 land sites -- 3 in Arizona, 1 in San Diego, 2 in South Florida and 2 in Maryland about 30 miles south of Washington D.C.","With the Archstone land sites that we intend to keep, we now own a total of 17 land sites and control 2 others, all in our core markets, representing a pipeline of about 6,200 units in great locations in Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Seattle and Southern California with a development cost of $2.5 billion.","In addition to the $130 million of projects already started this year, we have the potential to begin construction yet this year on as much as another $1 billion of development. We will address all potential development starts on a case-by-case basis with a close eye on appropriate sources of funding. But at the present time, we expect to begin another $500 million to $700 million of development, bringing our total starts for the year to as much as $800 million, adding great assets to our portfolio in key locations and continuing to create value for our shareholders through our development business.","So I'll now turn the call over to Mark Parrell.","Mark J. Parrell","Thank you, David. I want to take a few minutes this morning to review our Normalized FFO guidance for the second quarter. I would also like to give you some color on our recent capital markets activity and discuss how we expect our balance sheet, credit metrics and liquidity to look at year end after the integration of the Archstone assets and the disposition of $4 billion of assets from our portfolio. I will also summarize some changes we made this quarter to our income statement and press release supplement to improve transparency and add clarity regarding the Archstone-related transaction costs that we are incurring and the current and future configuration of our portfolio.","So let's talk about Normalized FFO a bit. This quarter we had a pretty large difference between FFO as defined by NAREIT and Normalized FFO, and we also had substantially lower NAREIT-defined FFO in the first quarter than we had expected in our February guidance.","We do show you on Page 24 of the release a chart that shows the main adjustment items. I want to quickly summarize the 3 main drivers. First, there were $71 million of prepayment penalties incurred in the first quarter and these were incurred about one quarter earlier than expected and they were responsible for the lower NAREIT FFO in the first quarter. We also had $46 million of merger costs, which were disclosed on the loss from investments in unconsolidated entities due to merger expenses line item, a very catchy name, and I'm going to talk about that line in a moment and give you some more color. And that's just primarily our share of the Archstone employee severance costs. We also had $19 million of merger costs, which we disclose on the new merger expenses line, which I'll also explain in a moment and these were mostly investment banking, legal and accounting fees. Both of these types of merger costs were included in our NAREIT-defined FFO guidance number for the first quarter and both were about what we had expected.","For the second quarter of 2013, we have provided a Normalized FFO guidance range of $0.67 per share to $0.71 per share. The press release contained a description of the items that bridge the difference between our first quarter 2013 Normalized FFO of $0.64 per share and the midpoint of our second quarter 2013 range.","Now on to the capital markets side of the house. Eliminating the funding risk from the Archstone transaction as quickly and efficiently as possible has been a major priority for us. As David Neithercut just described, we are well along to selling $4 billion in non-core EQR assets, in addition to the over $500 million in Archstone assets that were sold before we closed on the Archstone acquisition. This success also allowed us to more quickly address 2 other important balance sheet goals: reducing the large amount of secured debt that we have post-Archstone; and reducing the elevated level of 2017 maturities. I'm happy to report that we have had great progress on both these fronts.","At the close of the Archstone acquisition, we assumed about $2.9 billion in secured debt. This was down from our expectation at the time of the February earnings call because we thought we would assume a $500 million Archstone secured debt pool that matured in 2017 at acquisition and then repay it in April 2013. Because of our accelerated dispositions, we were able to repay that pool in the first quarter at the time of the Archstone closing.","In the first quarter, we also took another step to address the elevated secured debt in 2017 debt maturity levels caused by Archstone. We decided to prepay $543 million secured debt pool that matures in 2017 and was originated by EQR several years ago. This action both improved our maturity schedule by lowering our 2017 maturity tower and reduced the elevated level of our secured debt. As a result, we incurred prepayment penalties in the first quarter, which our February guidance anticipated would be incurred in the second quarter.","Also in April, we accessed the unsecured bond market, raising $500 million in a massively-oversubscribed unsecured notes offering. These notes mature in 2023, and have a coupon of 3% and an all-in effective rate of 4%, including the impact of certain fees and the termination of our interest rate hedges that related to that debt. We are very pleased with the strong demand for our paper.","We continue to think it is wise to match the long duration of our expected ownership period of the Archstone assets with a set of liabilities that have a similarly-long duration. We are studying whether to extend the maturity of a portion of the $1.2 billion in Archstone debt that matures in 2017 that we assumed. By June 2013, we must decide whether to take advantage of a favorable extension option offered to us by the secured lender. However, lately, secured debt spreads have widened considerably while unsecured rates have declined. This secured debt spread widening offsets a fair amount of the benefit of the favorable extension option. We will be thoughtful in balancing the advantages and disadvantages of exercising this option against using cash on hand to retire some of this debt without refinancing it or possibly leaving 2017 maturities alone for now.","All of these actions on the capital market side, combined with our dispositions, leave us pleased with what our balance sheet, debt maturity schedule and liquidity will look like at the end of 2013. Measured at year-end 2013, we would expect to cover our fixed charges at about 2.6x, to have a debt-to-undepreciated book value of assets ratio of about 40% and to have a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of slightly over 7.0x. At year end, we expect our $2.5 billion revolving line of credit to be undrawn, the $750 million term loan to be fully outstanding and have approximately $500 million of cash on the balance sheet. Our current guidance assumes development spending in 2013 of only about $500 million, which has been factored into all the metrics I just discussed. And I do want to point out that $500 million includes the acceleration that David Neithercut referred to in our pipeline. Most of that additional spending on those starts will occur in 2014 and '15.","As David also mentioned, besides accelerating the -- we don't see this as having any real impact on our ratios or funding in future years, given the relatively small percentage of our asset base that's currently tied up in our development business, along with our ability to use free cash flow and asset sales in 2014 and thereafter to generate $500 million or more of investable capital.","Now just a couple of changes on the accounting and disclosure side I want to go over. First on Page 8 of the release, we have expanded our portfolio summary to show the portfolio at both December 31, 2012, and in March 31, 2013. We have a lot of transaction activity going on and we thought this might be helpful, to show you the progress of our portfolio transformation and help you track our dispositions. We combined the Maryland and Northern Virginia D.C. submarkets that we previously disclosed separately, into the Washington, D.C. market and we removed the Tacoma submarket, which we'll be exiting shortly, from our Seattle market. Second, we wanted to show as clearly as possible the transaction costs we incurred and expect to incur related to the Archstone transaction. To that end, we added 2 lines to our income statement: merger expenses; and the loss from investments in unconsolidated entities due to merger expenses lines.","The merger expenses lines are costs we incurred directly here at Equity Residential in acquiring Archstone, and those include investment banking, legal and accounting costs. Merger expenses in the first quarter totaled $19 million and we do not expect this line item to have much activity during the remainder of 2013.","The new loss from investments in unconsolidated entities due to merger expenses line also contains Archstone-related costs, but these costs were incurred by the joint ventures that we created with AvalonBay to assume employment-related expenses like severance and to pay the salaries for the remaining Archstone employees that are helping us with the wind-down process. These JVs also hold disposition assets like Germany and they assume certain preferred stock interests that third parties hold in Archstone subsidiaries. So on this line, we will pick up our 60% proportional share of all our costs from those things. We reported Archstone-related acquisition cost on this line of $46 million, almost all of which was severance-related in the quarter. We expect to incur about another $11 million in these costs in 2013 for a total Equity Residential 2013 cost here of $57 million. I wish I could have combined this line with the merger expenses line, but the rules do not allow us to do so.","On Page 26 of the release, we give specific guidance on both these line items. Neither merger expenses nor losses from investments in unconsolidated entities due to merger expenses impact our Normalized FFO numbers. I'm also pleased to report that at this point, we believe that we will incur materially less in Archstone transaction costs than the $180 million that we estimated at the time of the equity raise back in November 2012. We now expect to incur about $100 million in transaction costs, mostly because we have avoided substantially all of the transfer taxes and most of the tax protection costs that we thought we would incur.","Finally, we have changed our prepayment guidance on Page 26, so it equals the prepayment penalties we have incurred so far this year. This, along with some expected land sales, also caused us to increase the midpoint of our NAREIT-defined FFO range by $0.11 for the year. Both land sales and prepayment penalties do not impact our Normalized FFO numbers. As I previously mentioned, we are currently reviewing our debt restructuring options for the remainder of the year and we will update these numbers as part of our second quarter earnings call in July.","Now, I'm going to turn the call back over to David Neithercut.","David J. Neithercut","All right. Thank you, Mark. So just in closing, let me note that last weekend, the lockup expired on the stock that we'd issued Lehman as currency for our share of the Archstone purchase and the 34.5 million shares held by Lehman represent about 9.2% of our total shares in units currently outstanding. I've been asked a lot of questions about Lehman's intention with respect to these shares. And while I wish I had all the answers for the investment community on this particular matter, I'm sorry, but I just don't. These shares are the responsibility of the parties with whom we negotiated the overall transaction. They're very smart people that are under no pressure to sell any or all of our shares within any certain timeline. And indeed, if Archstone going public was, in fact, an option for them, they were clearly prepared to hold stock for quite some time and must have had the ability to do so under the terms of emergence from bankruptcy last year.","Our understanding is that they have ample cash to meet any pending distributions to their creditors from the multiple billion dollars of cash paid as part of our closing and that realized from monetizing other assets. But they will have to monetize or position our stock at some point in the future and we're obligated to help them to do that if asked. We recognize the Street would like Lehman out of our stock. And believe me, we would like Lehman out of our stock and Lehman will ultimately get out, but they're in no hurry to do so because they have the necessary flexibility to exit in a fashion that will maximize the return to their creditors and they intend to do just that. So all that being said, we do know that the underlying value of our company is not dependent on who owns those shares. There's really not a whole lot more we can say about that, and so we'll be happy to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Just a question on development and I get the sense that there's an increasing interest on your part relative to expanding the pipeline, adding to the land bank. And this seems to be occurring at the same time that we're seeing higher levels of supply and other sort of entrants into the supply market. What are your thoughts around sort of beginning to accelerate product delivery at this point in the cycle?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I guess, David, I'd tell you that the Archstone assets that we acquired, the land sites that we acquired that we expect to build, are absolutely terrific land sites. As I said, 5 of them are in San Francisco Bay Area, 4 downtown and 1 in the Peninsula. And we believe that these will be great long-term assets for us. And we just think, frankly, that construction costs could continue to rise from here and we believe if they have the ability to get going on these sooner than later, that's a smart thing to do. I guess what I'll tell you that while you may see in 2013 and 2014 our development starts increase from what has sort of been our historical levels, I would not expect that to be a new run rate -- having established a new run rate, but rather working through this increased inventory that we have before we might step back into what you've seen us do on an annual basis in the past.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then along those lines, what kind of yields are you thinking about today relative to, let's say, Alexandria versus the New York sites? And what's the sort of trend in the shadow pipeline relative to the yield expectations?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I guess of the assets that we have in D.C. today, including that which we just finished, we're kind of in the mid-6s on those deals. And in New York City, thanks I guess in large part to the terrific deal we've got on the deal in Amsterdam that I mentioned, where we think our current yield on current rents would be in the high 6s, we'd be close to about 6% on the 2 deals that we're building now, that on 400 Park Avenue South and our deal on Amsterdam. So we think those are pretty good returns given where our assets trade in that marketplace today oftentimes with a 3 handle. And certainly, when comparing to the 6% yields that we're selling on our assets in Atlanta, Phoenix, et cetera, we think that's a pretty good trade.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then I just have one quick follow-up and I'll yield the floor. There's been some discussion here in Manhattan around the resurgence of office conversion to rentals and condominiums. Are you guys involved in anything like that relative to some of the deals you might be looking at?","David J. Neithercut","No, we're not.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Joseph with Citibank.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","David, you mentioned that move-outs to rent being too high is down year-over-year as you replace the departing tenants with new tenants used to paying higher rents. So does this give you more confidence to be able to push renewals even further than you already are?","David S. Santee","Well, I think that's a function more of a market-by-market situation. Obviously, if you go to a D.C. where rents are moderating, you have a lot of new supply. Pricing power is diminished. It's hard to push renewals above current market rents. I mean, our historical approach has always been to bring renewals to the current market rents, if not overshoot them a bit. So it's more of a function of market rents than anything.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And can you talk about traffic patterns this year relative to historical averages?","David S. Santee","Yes, traffic for the quarter was up about 5% and that's with a minus 1% in January. So we're seeing very good demand. When you say traffic, I refer to it as foot traffic and that's when people actually walk into our shop. That's great. That resulted in a 3% increase in applications, which resulted in a 3% increase in move-ins for Q1. And then as far as our website goes, just the activity there, especially as a result of kind of leveraging the Archstone website, has really increased 50%. I mean, that's what we saw for Q1. So there's definitely no lack of demand, that's for sure.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And does that kind of increase year-over-year was consistent in April as well -- in terms of foot traffic?","David S. Santee","Well, foot traffic, yes. April was a great month for us. April is, for all intents and purposes, stronger than the first quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Can you talk a little bit about the expectations for","D.C. over the remainder of the year? You guys had, relative to some of your peers, I think a stronger first quarter in terms of both occupancy and rental rate. Do you guys expect that to continue or is there basically -- are you hitting it 1 quarter or 2 later than other people and you're just going to -- expecting to start -- in your guidance or your plan for 2013, do you expect to see D.C. to continue to weaken over the coming quarters?","David S. Santee","Well, I think that remains to be seen how weak D.C. will be. Certainly, when everyone is concerned and the folks that don't have yield management systems, that don't have visibility into their operations, the first thing they do is build up their occupancy and we see that. We see a lot of our competitors running at 97%, 98% occupancy. We try to be a little more measured, use the visibility we have, make informed decisions, not run for cover. Our underwriting, I will tell you, we really assumed rents would remain flat for most of the year as far as new leases, but we're seeing -- we sent out 7% renewals for June and July in D.C. -- granted there will be more of a gap in what we achieve. But when you take getting a 5% on renewal increases and maybe a 1% on new leases, that gives you about a 3% to 4% revenue growth.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Are there any markets where you're seeing demonstrably different performance than the others -- in D.C.?","David S. Santee","Well, so when I look at our May billings, there is only one property and we've referenced this property before and that's 425 Mass. That's ground 0 as far as NoMa goes. You can see 15 cranes from the rooftop, and that really is our only property that has a year-over-year negative revenue growth and current month billing negative revenue growth. Everyone else as far as May year-to-date, May billings relative to last year, is still billing positive. I would tell you that Boston, Rosslyn, that's doing fine. Pentagon City is doing fine. So really, I would say it's a general softness pretty much across the whole market.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then after being in the assets now for a bit, I mean, is there any major deferred maintenance CapEx from the Archstone assets that you guys are going to have to rectify over the rest of the year?","David S. Santee","I would tell you that I have been to most of the properties. There's a lot of CapEx that was in process. I think they did a reasonable job of maintaining the integrity of the buildings. I think the opportunity is in the interior of the units, the rehab opportunity. And we are certainly taking advantage of those and will be proceeding with probably 8 to 10 complete interior rehabs.","Mark J. Parrell","Yes, just to add some color. I mean, we have about 1,200 Archstone rehabs we expect to complete this year. We have 3,600 units, Archstone units, that we've approved rehabs to do and we expect to kind of knock out 1,200 or more each in the next few years. So we have a sense that there's value that can be created there.","David J. Neithercut","And let me just add on the CapEx side, Rob. As we look at CapEx spend on our portfolio this year and the Archstone portfolio, we expect to spend a little bit more on their portfolio on a kind of dollar-per-unit basis. But I'll tell you that, that amount of spend is well below what we would ordinarily or expect to spend on a new acquisition, on a just one-off acquisition. And so -- and I'll also tell you, it is well below that total amount of spend, sort of a placeholder for CapEx that we had on our numbers when we underwrote the transaction. So while it may be a little bit more than what we've got at a run rate, it's well below what we normally spend on a new buy and well below the placeholder in our pro formas.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","What are you guys targeting for 2013 on a per-unit basis just on the maintenance, the sort of FFO adjustment per unit?","Mark J. Parrell","So we have guided you to $1,500 on the same-store side. So if you go to CapEx, that's Page 22 of the release, so that includes everything. It includes the rehabs because, of course, the rehabs could be maintenance-related or they could be income-producing and incremental, and there's difference of opinion on that. So we lay that out in the same-store pool, about $1,500 a unit. And then in addition, you'll have what we spend on the Archstone stuff and I think it'll be probably a little higher than $1,500, but not necessarily a lot as David said.","David S. Santee","Yes. And I guess I just would add on that with respect to the Archstone rehabs, we have approved a lot of rehabs. As Mark's noted, we'll expect to do $1,200 or so. And we're expecting a solid mid-teens return on that incremental capital invested.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just a few questions here. First, on the development especially because it looks like if you do $800 million of starts here, the CIP would get up to the $1 billion, $1.5 billion type range, which is pretty healthy for you guys. Do you have a view on what starts will be this cycle? I mean, clearly, we have material uptick year after a prolonged period of undersupply in the market. So is your view that we're sort of in a pig in a python right now where there's a sudden surge and then it peters out to a more normalized level? Or is your view that everyone is going to pile into this thing and we're going to go back to levels similar to the '80s?","Mark J. Parrell","Well, I guess, you've asked a question about development nationally and I'll answer your question about what we expect to see in our markets. Yes, so I guess, I would tell you that I think we're seeing development in our markets that had -- could have been built up over several years of no starts for obvious reasons. So that there was a lot of entitled land ready to go that nothing started on because no access to construction debt, et cetera, et cetera. So I think we are seeing a little bit more than what you'd expect to see in our core markets in a normal run rate. And again, as I said, we look at this through the product we have, we look at the yields we think we can achieve, some concern about continued rise in construction costs, we think it's a good time to go ahead and move forward with the projects that we have on our balance sheet. As you note about just -- the total amount of construction, a lot of that stuff that's on there will roll off. And regardless of what we start this year, a lot of that capital won't be spent until next year. So believe me, we're going to keep an eye on it. We do not expect to operate for multiple years at elevated levels of development. Again, we may have a couple of years up, but our run rate will be more of what you've seen us do in the past.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then a second question is more New York-centric. Post had some interesting commentary on their call, which makes some sense. I'm curious what you guys are seeing in your portfolio. As you look at operating, you have uptown, you have sort of Chelsea downtown and Brooklyn. Are you seeing differences in your ability to push rent, tenant turnover, rent levels, et cetera? Or is despite seemingly that everyone wants to live downtown, the turnover and ability to push rents is sort of the same whether you're uptown, downtown or in Brooklyn?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I'll let David answer that but I'll just sort of note, whatever conclusions you're drawing from Post, I think you're coming from a sample size of 2.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Correct, correct. Clearly, a smaller sample size, but...","David S. Santee","I guess I would say that we don't see a whole lot of difference no matter where you are. Jersey City, which we -- I guess, we call the suburbs is not as robust. But Brooklyn, our Brooklyn, our asset did a -- doing a 12. So we don't really see any difference. And frankly, with the addition of the Archstone assets and the close proximity to our assets, we're able to do a lot more effective cross-selling and we see a lot of residents moving between buildings and what have you. So we're very pleased with what we see in New York.","Mark J. Parrell","Yes. I mean, we reported, Alex, just inside our numbers for New York City and that includes Brooklyn, a 5.9% revenue number. New Jersey, Northern New Jersey was 5.5%. And everything else, which for us is a small amount of further out suburban, but very small, of around 3%. So I think those trends are broadly consistent with other reporters who have larger portfolios that are more suburban-focused and that's how you get to an average for us of about a 5.5% revenue number.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. So from what I hear you saying, it sounds like as you look forward to investing more in the city, you're sort of agnostic whether you're uptown or downtown. You just view the trend as good across the entire market, not better in any one submarket.","David J. Neithercut","Yes, I think that's the case. I mean, clearly, there might be more desired neighborhoods or markets than others, but they'll be priced accordingly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with ISI Group.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I guess 2 questions. First, David, it sounded like in your comments that the revenue from Archstone was pretty much tracking as you expected, but that the expense side was materially better on the operating side. I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that and how much more is there to go as you kind of move into the second and third quarter?","David S. Santee","Yes. Well, I guess I would say that we did make an adjustment for the first 4 months of acquisition. We did offer all of the Archstone on-site folks a job and we accounted for that. So -- but in between the time that we made that offer and we did budgets, we're seeing a considerable downsizing from people making decisions to leave and what have you. And then some of it is just simply timing. But I think, when you look at our overall annualized run rates after this 4-month period, we pretty much underwrote the deal very similar, if not identical, to how we operate our communities.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. I guess second question for maybe David Neithercut. As you kind of look at the arbitrage that is existing because kind of where the public shares trade of many of the multifamily companies and where you can sell high-quality assets, I guess at what level or how do you think about maybe selling more assets and either buying back stock from Lehman or buying back stock in the open market to potentially close that gap or a tax considerations -- just make that a very difficult exercise to execute.","David J. Neithercut","Look, I guess, we've worked very hard to assemble these assets. We think that they are terrific and will create value for us for a long time. And we're not going to react to just some short-term sort of dislocation for things that aren't under our control. I think we're focused right now on running what we've got and creating as much value as we can and I think the rest of it will sort of sort itself out. That doesn't mean that aren't times when we might not consider doing what you suggest, Steve, but I just think that there's some short-term dislocation going on that we're not going to overreact to at the moment.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a quick modeling question. On the dispositions for the rest of the second quarter and the second half of the year, are you still targeting about a 6% cap rate or are these assets different markets or maybe slightly older?","David J. Neithercut","No, I think -- yes, it's interesting. What we've sold in the first quarter was around 6%. What we've sold this quarter to-date is around 6%. And what we think we'll do for the whole year is about 6%. So you can continue to use 6 in your numbers.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then on the acquisitions, you didn't really expect much for this year except for Archstone, but you did acquire a Seattle asset in the first quarter. Do you think you'll still see opportunistic one-offs from your acquisition team or you're just really focused on Archstone for the remainder of the year?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I mean I guess we'll always consider but we did buy one asset and it was sort of done in tandem with the one asset that we sold in Seattle. So we sold the Archstone Belltown deal to the same people from whom we acquired the Seattle deal in Redmond. So we sold an older high-rise building in Seattle and bought a recently-constructed mid-rise property in Redmond and we thought that was a very good trade and done at a very comparable cap rate. And I think that, that's what you may see more from us going forward, is our ability to trade assets at cap rates that are far, far closer than what we've seen in the past. But we'll look at other opportunities this year if they're out there. Mark had noted we've got $500 million of cash we have on the balance sheet and we've got the capacity, but I would not expect us to be active in the marketplace.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just to follow up on Steve Sakwa's question. If you approached Lehman and said, we'd like to take out $1 billion of your holdings here at a price that was slightly above where your stock is today, is that something that you think they'd be receptive to or you would be willing to do?","David J. Neithercut","I guess, Ross, I understand people have got a lot of questions about all this and it's just not appropriate for me to talk about it. I sort of told you what we know and that's really about all I can say.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. But not even so much what Lehman would do, but with respect to what your willingness is. I mean, do you think about as an option to clear out their position, thinking about taking them out at a price that makes sense for everybody involved?","David J. Neithercut","Oh, we'd be happy to do something that made sense for a price for everybody involved. I mean, look, I think we've got to be openminded about how to address this, but I don't think -- we're not going to act desperate in the process, so -- but we're in contact with these folks and we're also in contact frankly with other people who have suggested interest in buying perhaps some stock and I guess I'd just tell you that we'll play whatever role we may need to play to help facilitate something. But frankly, my guess and my expectation is that we won't have to play a direct role ourselves.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So let me turn to operations. I might have missed this, but was there any commentary on what the new lease increases were during the first quarter above the tenancy lift?","David S. Santee","The new lease base rents for the quarter hovered around 3%, 2.5% to 3%. Today, when I look at the rate, it's right there almost at 4%, 3.9%.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Actually, my question has been answered already.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","David, just to go back to that last question, the 3% you quoted. Was that lease-over-lease?","David S. Santee","No, those are LRO base rents.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Do you have by lease-over-lease by chance?","David S. Santee","The lease-over-lease probably on average was about 0.75 point for the quarter.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And second of all, I'm not sure if you look at this, but if you look at the blended between renewals and new leases signed in the quarter -- in the first quarter, the average -- the rents that were signed in the quarter, how does that compare kind of on a year-over-year basis?","David S. Santee","I'm not sure that I understand your question. So are you asking, Mike, whether there's more renewals than usual in the first as compared to the first quarter of 2012?","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","No. What I'm asking is the leases that were signed in the first quarter, including both renewals and new leases on a blended basis, what was the average rent increase on leases signed in the first quarter versus, on a comparable basis, the leases signed in the first quarter of '12?","David S. Santee","Okay. So renewals signed in Q1 of '13 averaged 5.7%. I don't have Q1 of '12. I can tell you that Q4 was 6.2%. But I'm sure Q1 of '12 was probably 7%, I'm guessing.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I'll follow up off-line with you on that one. Second question, I know you only owned the Archstone portfolio for about a month. But any kind of -- and you didn't control it obviously last year, but any kind of comparable metrics you could provide? You said it's performing better on the expenses, but any kind of numbers you can put around that?","David J. Neithercut","Better on expenses than what we had budgeted.","David S. Santee","Yes, I guess what I would tell you is, is that we have pulled in all of their revenue data, so we feel comfortable in quoting a comparable revenue number. But when you look at the expenses: a, they were not a public company. They had different capitalization policies. All I can tell you is, is that when we looked at their actual data relative to ask our expenses, they were operating their properties about $400 per unit higher than our communities, our same-store pool. And we underwrote that acquisition using our same-store expense numbers.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's really helpful. And finally, David, having owned the portfolio now for about 2 months, as you look out over the next couple of years, where do you see is the biggest opportunity within the Archstone portfolio?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I think we've already discussed that, Mike, it's these rehabs. We've got -- I think as we've said previously, I think that the Archstone\/Lehman team did an adequate job taking care of the properties, but we don't think that they took advantage of opportunities that were there with a little extra capital. And I think it's the rehab -- our ability to execute the rehab program, which we've really got down to an art here. As I said, at least on the ones we've underwritten today, could be 15% returns on what we're talking about as another $35 million of investment in these assets. So we think that, that will create a significant amount of upside for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Harris with Imperial Capital.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Here's a couple of questions for you, Mark. I think you made reference to spreads widening on secured debt. I wonder if you could just add a little color to that. If I missed it, I apologize. And also, in any way is that spread widening associated with this backdrop of noise, which seems to be gathering in pace around Fannie and Freddie reform?","Mark J. Parrell","Right. What we saw over the course of the quarter, David, was an increase in the spread that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac charge on what we'll call normal leverage, which is sort of a 70% 125 kind of coverage loan. So we see that spread as approaching 2%. That's a considerable increase. This is all 10-year debt numbers I'm quoting. And on the unsecured side, I see that number as 130 to 140 for EQR. So you can see how it's become less favorable. I do think there is some impact from the regulator's requirement of the 2 GSEs that they change and take a lower market share. I certainly think this is one way to do it. But you're still talking about an all-in rate that's about 3.6% on the secured side. And so if you're like most folks in the multifamily business and you don't have access to the unsecured market, it's still a really good rate. And we have not seen -- and we had some good dialogue with our investment team, we have not seen or had any problems selling assets because of the spread widening just because absolute rates are just so low. But yes, I do think there is some push and that, that is one of the reasons -- from the regulator -- one of the reasons these spreads have increased.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","I mean, you flagged this. I mean, if I go back 2 or 3 years ago, David, you flagged this as being a reason why you were keen to push forward with sales. This is, as I say, 2 or 3 years ago before Archstone obviously was ever on board [ph] . What kind of spread do you think becomes an issue in terms of being able to sell the assets you are looking to sell and the cost of finance, the relative spread cost of finance to the buyer. Are we talking 300? What is it, 70 -- 60, 70, 80 basis points today? I mean, double that? Does that become an issue then?","Mark J. Parrell","Yes, I guess -- it's Mark Parrell again giving it a shot, David. It's the all-in rate that matters, not the spread. So if the treasuries went down again, which we always think is impossible, and then it happens. I would tell you that spread could be 3%, if the treasury is 1%, nothing would happen. I also point out that we've now disposed of a great deal of the assets that carried that risk that we highlighted for you some years ago. So I'm not quite sure how that all works. I mean, do all-in rates go up because there is growth in the economy, in which case our NOI is growing faster, in which case coverage of the loan is not a problem.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","We live in hope on that one.","Mark J. Parrell","Yes, we hope, right? Or is it inflation or spread. So I would tell you, I don't have a magic number for you except I think the all-in rate's a lot more important than spread.","David J. Neithercut","Let's not forget the CMBS market out there too, David.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Right, right. Well, are CMBS spreads widening like the Fannie and Freddie debt or not?","David J. Neithercut","No. There was a little widening earlier in the year and that's come back in. I mean, the life companies and CMBS have become more active. The life companies are more on low leverage, a little bit higher quality, little younger assets, where the CMBS market is mostly right now playing in the B market segment -- the B asset market segment, where they're becoming more active and I would expect the CMBS market could replace the GSE's good component or the GSE supply that's going away with relative ease.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Okay. My second question relates -- and it's a point of detail. But you referenced the German assets that are held in the joint venture, your Archstone joint venture. I mean, do these amount to very much in terms of net asset exposure to the euro?","Mark J. Parrell","We hedged a component of our exposure to the change as it related to assets, David, that are on the block and will be sold shortly. There's another part of the business that will take us a little while longer and we have not hedged that just because of the uncertainty. But it's not -- frankly, it's not actually that material amount of money in the aggregate to us.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Less than 1% if I sort of pick a number?","Mark J. Parrell","I think you could pick a number of less than $100 million and say -- which is considerably less than 1% as our share of what we would expect out of Germany.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","To move on, just a question on the Page 8 and sitting at 92% of your portfolio in core. David, I think you said that number will be 90% by year end, understanding there's a lot of moving parts. But what do you think the long term is? Is 90% the right number?","David J. Neithercut","No, let me -- I've got heads nodding, they're telling me that I said 90%; I meant to say 95%. Everybody knew that when I said it, and I appreciate you bringing it up. At the end of this year, we'll be 95%.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, okay. That screws up the rest of my question. So then the other part of it is D.C. and New York Metro area is 35% of the total. How comfortable are you with that in the long term?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I think that's a number that would need to be brought down over time and we'll continue to bring it down. We knew going into this that because of the weighting, the share of the Archstone assets that were in D.C., that we probably would ramp ourselves up a little more than we'd like. But we still have got assets in D.C. that are not in the district, that are not in the Arlington area that we can sell to bring that number down.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","What level of kind of normal activity would you expect in 2014 and beyond of just portfolio management, couple billion on either side every year, something like that?","David J. Neithercut","No, I think that's way high. And I guess unlike what we've been doing over the past several years in trying to sell assets and reallocate that capital, we have the ability to, I think, be a little bit more timers [ph] now. I think that when we find opportunities to reinvest capital, we can certainly access our disposition -- some disposition assets. But we'll still have some assets in Orlando. We'll have -- still have some assets that we'll need -- that we'll want to sell but we'll be in no hurry to sell them and I think that we'll do so only if and when we find the right reinvestment opportunities.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. In terms of the same-store portfolio, will you consider folding in Archstone into that analysis this year even though you haven't owned it for the full year, or will that be something that'll happen later?","David J. Neithercut","Unfortunately, the Archstone portfolio will not be in our full year same store until 2015 because we will not own it for a full year until all of 2014. It will be brought into quarterly numbers in the second quarter of 2014, okay, because we will have owned it for the full second quarter of 2013.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, understood. Got it. In terms of the Archstone developments that you're planning on selling, will those then be housed in a TRS and hence will you be booking gains into FFO when you do sell those assets?","Mark J. Parrell","Well, first off, when we book those assets -- it's Mark Parrell answering, Rich -- the assets were brought in at market because we're required to do purchase accounting and book them at fair market. So if we sell them, there will be minimal gain or loss on those assets, I would expect. So right now, there's a little bit of gain you see already in our regular NAREIT-defined FFO. That's from a legacy property -- we held a piece of land for a long time, not related to Archstone. So I would not expect material gains on the Archstone development noncore stuff that we're going to sell. The land, the development assets themselves, we'll see, because we're going to stabilize those and build them out. In terms of the TRS, we have plenty of NOLs to go against tax, so I wouldn't expect there to be any material tax hit on those assets. But if we bought an asset with the intention to sell, we would have put it in the TRS.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Last question for me is if there was anything kind of wrong about Archstone, it was their accounting not so conservative, particularly from a capital expenders perspective -- expenditures perspective. Do you see any material adjustments from an accounting viewpoint from your -- when you're looking at the portfolio, or is all that stuff kind of behind you at this point?","Mark J. Parrell","Well, I'm not sure their accounting -- I'm not sure I'd characterize their accounting that way, first of all. And second, I don't think their expense and CapEx accounting is actually relevant to us anymore. I mean, our expenses are going to be completely than different than theirs because we're resetting real estate taxes, we have different capitalization policies. So I'll tell you those folks we've dealt with them for a while and they've been nothing but professional and honorable to deal with. So I don't think their accounting is actually all that relevant to us on a go-forward basis because we're really -- it's sort of a fresh start for us.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","It did make me think when you saw lower expenses from the Archstone portfolio that maybe that was a capitalization issue as opposed to a real expense issue.","Mark J. Parrell","Well, we looked at it -- I mean, we don't care about the accounting, honestly. We look at just what it cost to run the asset and we saw savings in both realms.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Joseph with Citibank.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, Michael Bilerman. David, another question on dividend policy. A few years ago, end of 2010, you went to this new policy of 65% of sort of Normalized FFO. And I think, at the time, you expressed some views that others may follow and you really like the policy. I'm just thinking sort of a few years hence, not many people or no one has followed that sort of methodology in all the services whether it be Bloomberg, Reuters -- SNL continue to show your dividend yield at 2.8% where in your mind it's much higher, a 3.2%, a 3.3% based on your forecast for the year. And I'm just wondering whether that's limiting the investor base at all that really don't understand, that may just be taking a quick look. You're a big cap REIT. And so I'm just wondering whether you rethink the plan now that you've tried it. And I admire you for trying it, but I'm just thinking about whether it would be a success going forward.","David J. Neithercut","That's a very good question, Michael. I will tell you that we continue to think that it is the best and appropriate dividend policy for the company. That being said, we have given a great deal of thought to how we would pay that out. So at the present time, we pay out at a lower level in each of the first 3 quarters and kind of true-up in the fourth quarter dividend. And we wondered whether or not we shouldn't think differently about how we pay it out over the year. But in no way have we ever discussed or considered actually changing the policy of being 65% of that Normalized FFO. Had we not been in the middle of this entire Archstone process, that might have been something that had been addressed earlier. But I do know that it's something that our board will be looking at towards the end of this year and could consider for next year. So not a change to the policy, but rather a change in terms of how that dividend will actually be distributed.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. And perhaps even thinking maybe as a range that you don't get into a point of having to lower dividend and then get on lists of -- like that, where there's inconsistencies in dividends. Just a question just in terms of sale activity. And I do take your point on not trying to be reactive to a short-term dislocation in the marketplace and that you spent years assembling what is an unbelievable portfolio of assets that you wouldn't want to just sell just to prove a  point in terms of valuation. But would you sell interest in assets and so that you're still maintaining the portfolio that you have, but arguably just a lower interest in a handful of assets to generate that capital to potentially buy back stock if you wanted to do that, but you're not losing control of the asset.","David J. Neithercut","Well, I guess, look, I think that if and when we feel the need to raise capital for any purpose, we'd consider all sources. We are not as enamored with joint ventures as you may see others in other sectors. We just believe that we're working too hard for someone else's money and don't get appropriately paid for it. And we just kind of lose control of assets and people got different -- I guess, we don't see any need or desire to get budgets approved by a third party and then be accountable to that third party. But again, I mean, that's certainly something that could be considered if and when the time comes for whatever purpose to raise capital. But I'll also suggest that we've still got, as I said, assets in Orlando and others that we know that we'll sell over time that could create significant capital, of course if we wanted to for whatever purpose.","Operator","And at this time, I'm not showing any further audio questions. Please go ahead with any closing remarks.","David J. Neithercut","All right. Thank you very much. Appreciate everybody's time today, and we look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT here in Chicago in June.","Operator","Thank you.

We also provided guidance for the entire year for same-store revenue growth that was right on our original numbers of 4.4%; for same-store expenses that will come in at 3.3%, the high end of our original expectations, as our worst fears about real estate tax increases came true; and same-store NOI of 5.1%, a bit below our original midpoint due to these higher expenses.","As expected, San Francisco, Denver and Seattle continued to lead the way with very impressive quarterly and year-to-date performance. And as we discussed on our last call, in late July, new supply in Washington, D.C. is beginning to impact our numbers.","2013 has been a tremendous year for Equity Residential and we're very pleased with the exceptional portfolio we created and with our operating results, thus far, this year. We remained focused on core coastal markets and expect that, with the benefit favorable demographics and the high cost of single-family housing in our markets, to produce very good revenue and FFO for years to come.","And last night, we also provided guidance for same-store revenue growth for next year of 3% to 4%. And note, that our same-store set of 2014 will include the nearly 18,500 units that we acquired in the Archstone transaction.","Not surprisingly, our revenue growth estimates for next year are impacted significantly by having nearly 19% of our 2014 same-store revenue coming from the Washington, D.C. market, which we expect to produce slightly negative revenue growth next year. More importantly, however, we expect many of our other markets to continue to deliver strong, above trend revenue growth in 2014.","To take you through what we're seeing across our markets today and how we're thinking about next year, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, David Santee.","David S. Santee","Thank you, David. Before I jump into preliminary 2014 expectations, I'd like to briefly discuss our Q3 operating results that, when combined with our year-to-date performance, puts us exactly where we thought we would be when we gave full-year guidance last October.","As reported last night, our Q3 revenue growth of 4.1% was a result of continued strong fundamentals across all of our markets. Occupancy of 95.7% for the quarter, was down 20 basis points year-over-year. However, this is more about our, higher-than-we-would-have-preferred-occupancy, last year, and entering this year's peak leasing season in a position of greater strength.","Year-to-date, our occupancy is 10 basis points above plan and increased 10 basis points, sequentially, which creates a solid foundation going into Q4.","Renewals in Q3 remained strong, averaging 5.4% and continue to be driven by the Northwest markets with San Francisco, Seattle and Denver all realizing achieved renewal rates that were above Q2 results at 9%, 7.5% and 7.4%, respectively. Forward-looking renewals for October and November achieved, to-date, results remained above 5% for the entire same-store portfolio.","Apartment turnover was down 30 basis points for the quarter and 20 basis points year-to-date as pure residents moved out due to price and\/or renewal increases. Move-outs due to home-buying for the quarter increased 90 basis points year-over-year consistent with prior quarters, representing an incremental change of only 87 move-outs across the entire portfolio.","As discussed last quarter, both inter- and intra-property transfers remained 11% higher year-to-date, representing a much higher resident retention than the apartment turnover statistics might represent.","Base rent increases quarter-over-quarter were 2.1% and were greatly influenced by a decline in Washington, D.C. rents of 3.2%. However, based on how we see the market today, we would not expect Washington, D.C. revenue to turn negative on a quarter-over-quarter basis until midyear. As renewals were a positive 2.6% for October and are expected to be positive for quite some time.","Base rent pricing leaders continue to be San Francisco, Seattle and Denver. And we would expect those 3 markets to be our top 3 revenue growth markets, again, in 2014. Expenses continue to be a very short story and it's all about real estate taxes. The aggressive actions of states and municipalities are unprecedented. Both rate and value increases are occurring simultaneously, as real estate taxes always lagged value creation.","Historically, value increases would be offset by lower tax rates, but this is not the case for 2013. We now expect to end the year near the high end of our expense guidance. However, it's important to note, that excluding real estate taxes, our year-to-date expense growth would amount to only 1.3%. A testament to our continued focus and leverage of the Archstone assets, which continue to perform in line with expectations","For comparison, the Archstone portfolio revenue growth is 4.5%, year-to-date, and sequentially, 1.3%, essentially in the same zip code as the EQR portfolio.","As you drill down to the market and submarket results, specific property anomalies account for the slight differences versus our same-store portfolio. We remain extremely pleased with the results of our integration and I can confidently say that we have put that behind us, some time ago, and have been operating as one company for quite a while.","Now, I'll provide a little color on our preliminary 2014 revenue guidance.","First, as we announced in our release, we will include the same-stores and communities for full year 2014, creating a same-store portfolio of approximately 101,820 apartments.","Looking at the new market mix, going forward, we will arrive at a guidance range of 3% to 4%, by category, raising our markets into 3 buckets of revenue growth.","The first bucket continues to be filled with the Northwest markets that should produce combined 2014 revenue growth in excess of 5%, driven by strong embedded growth and, thus far, minimal to no market disruption due to new supply. Seattle continues to remain resilient after receiving and absorbing over 10,000 new units in the past 12 months, with solid revenue growth and current year-to-date occupancy running 10 basis points above 2012.","The second bucket includes markets where revenue growth would average 3.5%, which include all other markets, excluding D.C. These markets represent solid levels of embedded growth and continuing strong fundamentals with slightly elevated levels of new deliveries. Our core markets most impacted by new deliveries would be downtown Boston, Los Angeles and South Florida, with downtown Boston receiving the blunt of head-to-head new competition. L.A. and Orange County continue their slower than expected path to recovery, but still have plenty of runway for outsized revenue growth in the future.","And then the final bucket, representing almost 19% of total income, is the Washington, D.C. Metro, in which our revenue growth model assumes a full-year 2014 revenue decline of 1%. If we were to exclude D.C. from our 2014 revenue projections, our most likely outcome would produce, full-year 2014 revenue growth in excess of 4%.","While we have not finalized our 2014 expense expectations for the new same-store portfolio, we will experience another year of outsized real estate tax increases. However, we expect significant reductions to property management cost and minimal growth across all other categories that will result in a range that could be similar to 2013.","To sum it up, the continuation of solid fundamentals will drive revenue growth well above historical trend across many of our markets. Core controllable operating expenses should remain in check. Resident turnover continues to trickle down. Rent growth for lease renewals achieved remain above 5%. Same-store base rent growth of 3.5% versus same week last year, and today's occupancy of 95.8%, creates a solid foundation of performance as we close out the year and turn our eyes to 2014.","David J. Neithercut","Great. Thank you, David. On the transaction side, as noted in the press release last night, we've sold $4.36 billion of assets through the first 9 months of the year and expect to sell 1 or 2 additional assets in the fourth quarter, which will bring us to $4.4 billion of disposition for the full year, and that compares to our most recent guidance of $4.1 billion.","The increase in guidance is the result of having sold one of our largest single properties this past quarter. And that was in the Mission Valley submarket of San Diego, where we sold 1,410 units in 62 buildings, over 75 acres. This asset traded for $360 million. A confidentiality agreement prevents me from saying what the cap rate was on this deal, but I can tell you it was well below the average cap rate than what we've sold everything else year-to-date.","While this was not a must-sale for us in any regard because we, frankly, we like Southern California, a garden asset of this size and age is not terribly liquid and we thought it prudent to monetize our investment while there was a strong demand for Southern California assets and a continued low interest rate environment. So we started our process that produced the bid that we thought made sense for us and are pleased that, that bid delivered an unleveraged IRR of nearly 12% -- 12% over a 16-year holding period. Other asset sales continued our market exits from Tacoma, Phoenix and Atlanta.","In a very busy quarter, on the development side of our business, with 3 starts totaling $366 million, bringing our year-to-date starts to nearly $500 million. We also began pre-leasing 4 projects and, during the quarter, we sold 2 land sites.","In addition to the $500 million of starts through the first 9 months of the year, we have 4 deals totaling nearly $800 million that could start very soon. What doesn't start in the fourth quarter this year, will likely start in the first quarter of next year; 2 of these sites are in San Francisco and 2 sites in Southern California.","The disclosure of our development business in last night's earnings release, shows about $1.6 billion of active development currently underway and $262 million completed and in lease up. I'll remind you, that of this $1.9 billion, 5 assets totaling about $300 million, which came to us as part of the Archstone transaction, are not considered core investments, and we would expect to sell those following lease up and stabilization.","In addition to that, which we've already started in those projects, which we will start very soon, we have 12 additional land sites and those are owned or controlled, representing a pipeline of nearly 3,500 units in terrific urban core locations in our core markets, with development costs of approximately $1.5 billion. As a result, our development starts would be elevated relative to historical run rates and could average close to $1 billion both this year and next. I'm happy to say 100% of which will be totally self-funded with free cash flow, disposition proceeds or use of our $2.5 billion credit facility. Going forward, my expectation is that by 2015, our starts will be more in the range of $500 million to $750 million a year","And with that, I will now turn the call over to Mark Parrell.","Mark J. Parrell","Thank you, David. I want to take a few minutes this morning to describe the changes we made to normalize the FFO and some of our other guidance for the full year and give you some color on our recent capital markets activities.","For the year, we have provided a revised normalized FFO guidance range of $2.83 per share to $2.85 per share. This is slightly higher than the guidance we gave you in July and it's pretty much right on target with the guidance we gave back in February. The improvement since our July guidance is due to the loan payoff that occurred on October 1, as well as the new loan closing and additional partial loan payoff we expected to have this quarter, both of which are described in the press release.","While these activities triggered substantial prepayment penalties in the fourth quarter, they also lowered fourth quarter interest expense and other financing costs.","Moving to another guidance matter, we increased our annual G&A to $63 million, which was up about $16 million from 2012. The increase is driven primarily by Archstone-related and other onetime items. These costs are specific to 2013 and will not be part of our normal run rate level of G&A. We anticipate 2014 G&A to be substantially lower than 2013, likely in the low $50 million range. We are careful stewards of our shareholder's money and expect in 2014 to reestablish our customary low level of G&A.","We've had -- certainly have had a busy few months on the capital market side. As you saw in the release, we are in the process of repaying approximately $1.8 billion in GSE debt, all in a single quarter, and refinancing $800 million of this debt with a life insurance company.","Let me take a moment to give you a few highlights. About 1 month after we received the additional disposition proceeds, we repaid a $963.5 million secured loan that we had assumed as part of the Archstone transaction. This loan was set to mature on November 2014 and carried a cash interest rate of 5.88% and a GAAP interest rate of 3.45%, and the GAAP rate is lower because it's impacted by the amortization of the Archstone debt premium.","While selling additional assets is still dilutive, compared to the 3.45% GAAP rate I just mentioned, we certainly we're able to lessen normalized FFO dilution by lowering interest expense and we're able to address a near-term debt maturity. In other words, as a cash management matter, it was a better deal to incur the prepayment penalty and deploy this cash than to hold it and earn nothing until we could prepay this debt at par in 2014.","We also took out to bid a pool of 13 former Archstone properties, which are tax-protected assets and on which, we are required to maintain secured debt. Currently, these 13 assets and several other assets are encumbered by a $1.27 billion GSE loan that matures in 2017 and carries a cash interest rate of 6.26% and a GAAP interest rate of 3.58%, and again, the GAAP rate is lower because of the amortization of the Archstone debt premium.","The interest by life insurance companies in the GSEs in refinancing these prime urban assets will be very strong. The bids we obtained from the life insurance companies was substantially superior to pricing available, at that time, from the GSEs, while CMBS lenders were not competitive at all in our process.","After this exhausted process, we committed to do an $800 million secured loan with a large life insurance company. The loan will have a term of 10 years, will be interest-only, and will carry a fixed interest rate of 4.21%. The proceeds from this loan will be used to pay off $825 million of the $1.27 billion of secured loan. The approximately $440 million balance will remain outstanding and continue to mature in November 2017 and continue to carry a cash interest rate of 6.26% and a GAAP rate of 3.58%. The prepayment of these 2 loans will result in a cash prepayment penalty of approximately $150 million and an earnings and FFO charge of $43 million. The charge will not impact normalized FFO.","While this is, certainly, a substantial sum of money, we see the net economic cost to us as much less. Niemann is effectively paying a substantial portion of the prepayment penalty here, in the form of the reduced purchase price we paid in the Archstone transaction, we're assuming this above market debt. Also, we were able to benefit from the bargain extension option that we have previously discussed with you, which was granted to us as part of the Archstone loan assumption process. After netting these contributions from third parties, prepaying this loan and incurring the penalty now equates to a breakeven refinance rate in 2017 of less than 4%.","Besides the economic value for the company of this financing activity, the company also received some important other risk and debt management benefits. We lowered our outside debt maturities in 2017 from $2.2 billion to $1.35 billion and significantly extended the weighted average maturity of our debt to almost 7 years.","Also, when the prior GSE loan matured in 2017, these assets would need to be refinanced with secured debt or very substantial tax protection costs to the company would have been triggered. So dealing with it now and putting its risks behind us, seemed prudent. We also established a valuable new channel for sourcing secured debt. And best of all, we locked in a great rate on the last piece of the Archstone transaction capital structure.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to Lilly to compile questions for the question-and-answer period.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In terms of same-store revenue growth, next year, at 3% to 4%, while it's a deceleration from this year, the absolute growth rate remains historically strong. Without giving guidance, but looking over the next few years, how long do you expect growth to remain above historical averages?","Mark J. Parrell","Well, it's tough to sort of say, but we believe strongly that with the markets that we are now operating in, these urban core markets, and as we look at the demographic picture, the cost of single-family housing in these markets, which is a significant multiple more than average across the country, look at what's happening to what we think jobs are going to be going forward, we think that we are in a position to having a nice and extended run of very strong performance.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then, you continue to sell assets in the market. How is the transaction marketing cap rates change with the increase in rates?","Mark J. Parrell","Really, not much at all. We think that -- we continued to see maybe slow increases in values of kind of core, core-plus products and have not seen much of any diminution in value of a lesser quality product. This is a very, very -- it remains a very strong demand for both classes.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","All right. And then, given what your stock is trading, relative to net asset value, what are your thoughts around share purchases relative to other capital allocation decisions?","Mark J. Parrell","Well, I guess I can tell you that having acquired $1 billion, or so, of stock back, it's something that is, certainly, part of our calculus, and will remain part of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dave Bragg of Green Street Advisors.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC","You break out that same-store revenue growth outlook into the 2 buckets for us, your legacy portfolio, that same-store portfolio versus the Archstone assets?","Mark J. Parrell","We didn't break those out for 2014. I mean -- but based upon performance, there really shouldn't be any material difference. I will say that, when you look at the first part of next year and you look back at the impact to the operations on the Archstone portfolio, just as a result of the announcement, I think that, in the near term, or at least for Q1, we would expect the Archstone properties to do a little better and play catch up from last year. But by the end of the year, their role isn't a material difference.","David J. Neithercut","And so, the Archstone portfolio is overweight D.C., but there's a catch-up opportunity there that will cause it to perform pretty closely to the legacy portfolio?","Mark J. Parrell","I guess, our comments, Dave, are sort of market by market, submarket by submarket. So, certainly, because of the overweight of D.C, that portfolio would underperform. But relative to the Archstone assets in D.C. versus EQR, or in Seattle or any other market, we would expect those to perform relatively -- comparably, but for the little bit of pickup we may have in the first quarter, in the Archstone portfolio.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay. So you've undergone this transaction, the significant amount of dispositions that you've executed on, yet the stock trades at as wide of a discount as it has in a long time. Can you talk about what steps you are considering taking to close that discount? Maybe elaborate on your last answer, if possible? Or any misperceptions that you think might be out there that are driving this?","Mark J. Parrell","Well, I guess, there's nothing more to say about my prior answer, Dave. I think we've demonstrated ourselves as the company willing to acquire stock, we have in the past. And, again, it would certainly be part of our calculus. With respect to just pricing, I can tell you that our team, everyday, sees the kinds of properties that we own and we'll happily own for a long time. Trading today in markets certainly in the 4s and, in some markets, maybe even in the 3s. And so at EQR, trading today kind of in the mid-5s. I think it's quite an opportunity relative towards [indiscernible] trading on a one-off basis out there. So our focus today is just going to be execute, execute, execute. Again, we're happy with the assets we've got. We think they'll remain, I think, an extended period of very solid performance and the stock price will take care of itself.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay. Last question is, given the size of the company today and now that you've had time to digest the Archstone assets, how can we think about Equity Residential's opportunities to move the needle via external growth going forward?","Mark J. Parrell","So, I'll tell you that we remain a company that has, I think, the capacity to be very opportunistic and the intent of being very opportunistic. We'll continue to sell assets where we believe we ought to, and reallocate that capital into assets in our core markets. We will continue to have a development business. As I said earlier, we'll be a $500 million to $750 million of start per year business. And we'll, again, remain very opportunistic. I think we demonstrated that in 2009 and 2010, and we'll be prepared to do that again. We certainly have got rehabs going across our portfolio that we think, incrementally, will help, repositioning assets across the portfolio. But again, it's -- for the time being, I think it's execute, execute, execute. We've got a couple of billion dollars of starts this year and next year. And also, I think that we've got our hands full and you can expect us to have our nose to the grindstone on those particular subjects.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Just quickly, what are your expectations for the depth of the reversal in D.C.? Do you see this as being sort of a stark decline? More of a gradual sort of prolonged soft patch? If you had to sort of like think about that market in the next 24 months, what does it look like from a revenue perspective?","Mark J. Parrell","Well, I'll let David say a few comments in just a moment. Clearly, there an awful lot of units coming online. Certainly, there remains an extraordinary amount of dysfunction in D.C. And yet, if you look at third parties' expectations of household formation in that market over the next few years, we believe that there will -- these units will absorb. I mean, it won't be pretty maybe getting there, but we think that there will be a lot of incremental demand going forward.","David S. Santee","I guess I would add that when you look at the distribution of all these units across the metro area, certainly, a lot of those are downtown. When you start looking at deliveries into 2015, they spread out more to the burbs, which would not be a great as impact to our portfolio. When you add in the Archstone portfolio to next year, many of those communities that we acquired at Connecticut Avenue are virtually insulated from development. So I think it'll just come down to the timing of the deliveries in conjunction with what's going on with the politics in D.C. Another benchmark we just started our lease-up, Belle Pre in Alexandria. We are leasing new units at our pro forma net effective rents and our pace of leases is very robust. I mean the pace of lease-up is exceeding expectation. That can be said for many of our new developments. So when you look back over the last 24 months, base rents have been relatively flat. And then if you go back to 2007, 2008 in the downturn, renewals kept exploding and renewals will offset some of that negative rent increase. And I don't think, at the end of the day, it will be as bad as people think.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then my other question, David, is, you've obviously been net sellers for some time. You talked about that very specifically and maybe expected it for a bit. At what point does that reverse? Is it the sort of the potential for an uplift in cap rates? Is it the completion of the disposition strategy? Is it something external that would cause you to reverse and sort of think that there were more opportunities in the market for buying? How do you think about that going into what could be a higher cap rate environment?","Mark J. Parrell","Again, we have -- all of our acquisitions, David, have been self funded. So it's really -- do we see opportunities instead of arbitrage, what we can sell versus what we can buy? In fact, I'll tell you that we're working on a deal right now in Southern California that we think we can sort of acquire at a cap rate very similar to the cap rate at which we can sell, something that we think is out in the Valley. So I mean, those -- that's the kind of trading I think we'll do. But as I've said in my -- one of my previous answers, we'll remain very opportunistic. And if there are opportunities to buy and, frankly, they're maybe in Washington, D.C., for instance. I don't think we'd hesitate to take advantage of those opportunities.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Did you notice any impact on the D.C. portfolio from the government shutdown in October?","Mark J. Parrell","Really, absolutely none. We had made arrangements to work with the government employees should it continue and waived late fees and what have you. But really, we saw nothing that we could -- nothing that was tangible.","David J. Neithercut","But that market has been sort of operating under uncertainty of the sequestration and everything else that's going on. So I mean, it didn't add anything more than I think the weight that, that market had been carrying for quite some time.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then David, if you can comment on the performance of A versus B assets in your portfolio in the third quarter, particularly in the markets that saw the increases in supply?","David J. Neithercut","I don't know that we've seen any material differences. I think, again, it comes down to location, location, location. One of our best performing assets in downtown D.C., #1500 Mass, is a 50-year old building. So I can't point to anything that would lead us to think that there's that much difference in the asset class.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And does that kind of hold also for your view for the 2014 guidance?","David J. Neithercut","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","David, what's -- with 20% of the portfolio exposure in D.C. now, I mean, is that bordering the upper line -- upper boundary, of your tolerance for any market concentration? Or how do you think about that?","David J. Neithercut","I would say that on an average long-term basis, that probably is at that upper limit. Yes, Rob.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then when you're thinking about the -- going through the development pipe -- the development starts over the next couple of years, where's the bulk of those starts going to wind up being? And then are there any sort of ultra big size deals like the Park Avenue asset?","David J. Neithercut","We've got 4 sites in San Francisco -- actually 5 sites in San Francisco, so that would be a pretty good market share. We've also got a couple of sites in D.C. that are kind of on ice at the present time. We've got a very nice site, the Howard Hughes site, down in Southern California. And I think that's generally what you'll see. And then we've got -- and we certainly have some things in Seattle -- in some Downtown Seattle and some South Lake Union sites in Seattle.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And are any of these, like I said, ultra -- very large assets at the end of the day, especially in San Francisco?","David J. Neithercut","No. They're in the plus -- several are in the plus $200 million range, yes. If that's what you mean.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Yes. I mean, just trying to figure out what's -- when you're talking about $1 billion, is that for starts? Or is that 10 type of...","David J. Neithercut","Well, our focus has been really urban core locations, not suburban, but urban core locations. And those are, by definition, going to be a little more expensive assets. And so you'll see us doing fewer starts, but they are likely to be more expensive, yes.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then just lastly, was there any particular rationale for the '14 same-store revenue guidance now versus kind of January or in line with earnings like normal?","David J. Neithercut","A very good question and one that we talked about ourselves. And I guess it came down to the fact that we believe that we had a pretty good handle on it, a good view, that our people across the country, our systems, our process, and the experience that we've got gave us a good enough look at it that -- and when we have that, we felt it was appropriate to share, and that to sit on it for 90 days was not the right thing to do.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line from Ryan Bennett [ph] with Feldman and Associates.","Unknown Analyst","Just staying on the lines of development real quick. In terms of your start that you expect over the next year, what's the current yield on developments based on current rents versus where cap rates are in these markets?","David J. Neithercut","Well, in our sort of pipelines, that million -- $1.5 billion or so of pipeline, at current rents we think were low-5s to mid-6s and these are markets all day long, that are in the 4s, and some of these assets could trade in the high 3s on a stabilized basis [indiscernible].","Unknown Analyst","Got it. I appreciate the color there. And then I appreciate all the color on D.C. Just want to know the market that stood out. I know you've been positive on New York in the past, and then it seems like you got grouped into the middle bucket for next year. Just curious if you've seen any pressure on your ability to push rents there recently or anything submarket specific in the New York region that may cause the incremental slowdown?","David S. Santee","This is David. I mean, certainly, there are stronger pockets in New York. But I think, generally speaking, we don't see any market-wide slowdown, certainly as you'd move further away from Manhattan. Revenue growth is not as robust. Jersey City is less robust than Manhattan, moving down Fairfield, Connecticut. And we -- so the activity is still in the urban core. And one of the things that we really haven't seen this go around is the moving to Jersey City. I mean, historically, when rents have elevated in Manhattan, we see a pretty strong demand in Jersey City. But we're not seeing this, this go around.","Unknown Analyst","Got it. And then just -- I think you've mentioned the -- move outs due to rent increases was down in the quarter. Was there a particular market trend in terms of where it maybe have been down further or increased in particular markets? Any trends there?","David J. Neithercut","On a quarter-over-quarter basis, as an example, Denver sticks out in my mind. That was down -- compared to Q3 last year, down 600 basis points. I'm just kind of scanning the markets. That's probably the most notable, I would say. Everything else is maybe 100, 200 basis points.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Harris with Imperial Capital.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Let me have another crack at the share buyback question. If I remember correctly, you are amongst the most active of share buyback companies, and your Chairman was very vocal about being capital -- good capital discipline. I applaud you and him for that action. If I think back, then, was your decision to buyback principally driven by discount to net asset value? And how are you thinking that, that might be any different in today's environment?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I guess, it was. I mean, we just looked at what we thought the fundamental underlying value was of our assets and looked at what that was relative to our stock price and thought that the stock market was trading those assets at a significant discount. And again, as I've mentioned several times already today, we own assets today that there is an extraordinary demand for by institutional investors that are paying cap rates in the low 4s and perhaps even high 3s, yet our stock today is trading at an implied cap rate that is representative of a lot of the assets we've sold in commodity markets over the past 9 months. So again, we pay a great deal of attention to that, we pay a great deal of attention to that as we buy assets, as we start new development transactions. So I'll just -- not sure what more I can say on that matter except that we do paid a close attention to it. And as you noted, we were amongst the most aggressive back when an opportunity presented itself some time ago.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","All right. You have re-uped your buyback and your share issuance programs after the Archstone deal closed. I think it was around second quarter. Has the board reviewed capital allocation, in particular, with regard to share buybacks recently?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I guess, the board reviews most everything when we gather on a quarterly basis.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","When was the last quarterly meeting?","Mark J. Parrell","In September.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","September, okay. And then another question here on Archstone. Now you've got your arms a little bit more around the portfolio. Is there any thought to revisiting corporate leasing and condo activity, again, as we look forward?","David J. Neithercut","I guess I'll let David address the corporate leasing side. On the condo side, there has not been. But I do believe that we will see good condo demand for the kinds of properties we own in a not-too-distant future. Now what action we take as a result of that remains to be seen. I would not expect us to play in the manner in which we did back in the early -- the middle 2000s around what we did in Florida and Arizona, but I do believe we're certainly seeing interest of condominium people looking for land sites. We're seen more potential demand there. So I think that, that is something that we'll see, as I said, in the very near future. Now with respect to corporate leasing, David?","David S. Santee","With respect to corporate leasing, spending my first 10 years in this industry at Oakwood Apartments, taking corporate leases feels good when they come in, but there's a long tail when they move out. And one of our goals, over the past 12 months, is to continue to add more strategy around when and where and how many corporate apartments we take. It certainly does not fit into our branding expectations of creating long-term loyal customers. And so I think we have been trying to wean ourselves off that drug, so to speak, and we'll continue to evaluate on a transaction-by-transaction basis.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","What do -- what these corporate leases represent as a percentage of the portfolio today?","David S. Santee","In our portfolio today? Gosh, I mean, again, you have to kind of define what you mean by corporate leases. There are many -- in New York, we have lots of missions and types of apartments like that, that have been with us for 10 years or so. So it's very -- it's not as easy just to say we have this many corporate units. But we're definitely trying to get out of the short-term block of business type corporate function, especially in the world -- or the era of Airbnb. Airbnb is creating some very unique challenges for owners in, especially in New York City and Seattle. And that's something that we have to keep in front of us.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I mean, if we use broad terms of definition, are we talking 2% or 3%?","David J. Neithercut","I would say probably closer to 4%.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Mark, did you say, I don't remember -- I don't know if you said it explicitly, but did you say that you get -- you breakeven for the $150 million of prepayment costs in 2017 with lower -- assuming the lower interest rates?","Mark J. Parrell","Rich, so what we did is we took a look at what rate in 2017 we would need to refinance the debt at.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","The remaining debts.","Mark J. Parrell","Yes. I kind of regret the $800 million being refinanced now at 4.2%. And that rate is a little less than 4%. So if prevailing rates where 4.25% and higher, we would -- this decision we just made will be a good one financially for us. And if it was -- if rates were 3%, then it wouldn't be. But we did think that, that was a good way to kind of hedge out. That's a big exposure for us in '17, we have a lot of debt due in that year. We also had all these other things we were trying to balance out. So that was the analysis.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then do you think that this is kind of the last of the kind of reset activities that you might have related to capital markets transactions for Archstone? Or will there be more to come?","Mark J. Parrell","No, I think we're done. I mean, the important message to kind of get across here is we needed to get our hands on $9 billion of capital to fund Archstone, and we did $4 billion plus of that through the dispositions that were right on -- on the numbers we thought, right on NAV. We raised $3 billion through the equity market and $1 billion directly and $2 billion through Lehman and we think that blended price was good. And we needed to make the debt stack make sense. So that other $3 billion or so that we assumed had a duration, Rich, of like 2 years. And so we had a bunch of debt on assets we hopped on 10 or 20 years that has a duration of 2. And by doing what we did this quarter, we have fixed that and we can move forward. And I think the capital structure is balanced.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Turning to the 3% to 4% revenue growth. Can I just -- can you characterize that for me? Is that kind of what you would get next year from like a loss-to-lease perspective if nothing changed in the markets, and so kind of like a static view? But if market rents increased, that number would go up? Or is that a view of what -- how markets might behave incrementally next year as well?","David J. Neithercut","So Rich, this is David. So we don't use loss-to-lease. Basically, we look at the value of our rent roll in December and pretty much multiply that times 12 and divide it by 2013, and that gives us our embedded growth. We're going to assume that occupancy remains, for the most part, steady. And so that embedded number is 1.9%. So if the value of our rent roll remains constant all through next year, all other variables are constant, then we do a 1.9%. As -- beyond that, it's really a market by market looking at our rent trend reports, kind of estimating what we would expect in rent growth based upon what we've seen this year and what we expect from deliveries and just general strength within the market. And then we take a percentage of that number to get a market-by-market number. And then it's just a matter of weighting that -- weighting all those numbers and throwing them into our model.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. So if you said that 1.9% number earlier, I apologize. But do you have a conservative factor baked into that range? Or is that really -- you expect to hit 3.5% next year as you see it today?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I guess the only way that I could answer that is that if you look back over the past 2, 3, 4 years, we've kind of been dead on in our guidance -- in the midrange of our guidance.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then just looking at this recurring trend, and this might -- I don't know if this is just a reclassification issue, but I've noticed property management cost seems -- breaking at the same store has been on the decline this year versus last year. What's the reason for that? It's down 9.8% this year.","Mark J. Parrell","Well, I'm sorry, you're talking about prop management cost closure or prop management cost split between same store? I want to make sure I understand your question.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Yes, I'm looking at Page 15 of the supplemental. And historically, property management cost this year had been down by anywhere from 4% to 10% relative to last year. Basically, the oversight costs, district management and all that kind of stuff. I'm just wondering what...","Mark J. Parrell","Yes, these are the centralization and scaling initiatives that David Santee has led here at EQR. And it has gone very well for us, and we hope to continue to harvest some of those benefits. I mean, we're just much more concentrated now, and all the back-office functions that lead into property management has been kind of evaluated and resized to support that more concentrated portfolio. So that's what we're seeing.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I guess my question is, how do you expect that to trend going into future years?","Mark J. Parrell","Well, that's going to be harder to trend at the same rate because as we exit markets and are able to exit the infrastructure of those markets, that's where a lot of that is also rolling off, right? We managed to bring these Archstone assets on -- $9 billion of Archstone assets, sell $4.4 billion of assets, and we'll have fewer people running that larger portfolio. So no way we'll be able to sort of see the same improvement or same year-over-year change as we've seen initially. I have every expectation that David and his team will continue to squeeze as much out of it as they possibly can and you certainly would not expect to see this same kind of run rate.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Do you think there's more synergy type of opportunity left? I assume there is going into 2014 with the Archstone investment?","Mark J. Parrell","Well, yes. I mean, we -- our focus for the next couple of years will most likely be on the service side. So there remains opportunities in consolidating operations at the property level. And in addition, we did make some more senior-level changes in the property management organization in the past month that will contribute to below-average growth in property management cost for next year as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Two questions. Let me first pick up from Rich on the Archstone. In touring with us, I mean, your field folks, over the past several months, a number of them noted that there was some immediate pickup in Archstone where they were just able to do things much better and be ahead of expectations, and yet the commentary that you guys provided was sort of that Archstone was in line with expectations. So is this sort of just a difference between sort of at the local -- sort of very local level versus what you guys see from the Chicago level? Or is it that initially, there was a bunch of pickup, low-hanging fruit, but then as the portfolio became integrated over the course of the year, that most of that low-hanging fruit sort of went away and now it's basically in line with what you're expecting?","David J. Neithercut","So this is David. I guess long answer to the question in 2 directions. First, a lot of the savings that we've realized were accomplished as soon as we plugged those properties into our portfolio and just our operating process. On the other hand, we did bring over all of the Archstone employees, meaning we offered everyone a job, we gave time -- we gave people time to integrate, we've made more selected personnel decisions, and that took from March until the end of July to accomplish that. But again, that was underwritten as well. So we always have higher expectations on our budgets. And I think for the most part, I don't think there's a big difference in what our people on-site are saying and what we're believing as well.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then the second question just goes back to David Harris's questions on the share buybacks. If we look at the share buyback and basically rewarding shareholders from a different perspective, let's just sort of assume that the REITs are what they are, I mean, you guys are not alone in trading below NAV. I mean, you can go to other sectors and everyone's got a similar issue. The buybacks, in theory, should help, but in practicality, whether they move the stock or not, there may not be a direct link. Versus if you guys just increase the dividend even if the stocks remain as is, at least shareholders are getting more money today, more cash flow. So you guys have an AFFO yield of about 3.5, you could, I mean -- sorry, dividend yield of 3.5. You could have -- you have an AFFO yield of close to a 5. Why not just increase the dividend and say -- and reward shareholders for sticking around and holding the stock, versus the stock buyback, not that you guys are necessarily doing it right now, but a stock buyback where you're hoping the market reacts, but the market may not react and current shareholders may not be necessarily any better off because they're still getting the same dividend and maybe the market, just for whatever reason, doesn't want to recognize the discount to NAV that is demonstrated by selling assets and buying back stock?","David J. Neithercut","Well, that was a mouthful. I guess it was an awful lot of theory about -- dividend theory about whether or not you're creating value by giving your -- distributing more to your shareholders or not. We'll just put that aside. We believe that the right way to run the railroad is the dividend policy that we've got right now, which is to distribute 65% of our normalized FFO and to retain some capital for -- fund our development, for incremental investment, for a rainy day, what have you. We think that's the right way to do that dividend. We are -- we will be making a presentation to our board at our next meeting about changing the manner in which we pay that dividend. Again, this is all subject to the board approval. But thinking about paying that dividend more pro rata across the year as opposed to smaller payments in the first 3 quarters and then a true-up in the fourth quarter. But I guess I'll just say, as I said again, we certainly appreciate and recognize the discount of what we're trading today. I think we've taken the appropriate actions in the past and demonstrated that we think that way, and we won't hesitate to do that going forward. We think that's the right thing to do.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. No, I mean, I just said because you guys can fund developments through dispositions, and as you indicated, the development pipeline will be coming down. So there's -- it would seem like the company -- the free cash flow generation is definitely manageable. And if there's less need of it, hence, thinking that maybe it could just go back to more to shareholders. But yes, we look forward to the next board meeting, I guess.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's Nick Yulico on the line. Turning back to the revenue guidance for next year. I was hoping you could provide some of the major factors that get you to the bottom, middle or top end of that range? I mean, is the big sensitivity where job growth settles up?","David J. Neithercut","This is David. I mean, we've never really factored in job growth. We build our expectations from the ground up, what's going on the neighborhood of our communities. Certainly, if we had an environment of more robust job creation, we would feel much better about that, especially for 2014 considering that will be the peak of new supply.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Because, I mean, the reason I asked is because there's this feeling that there's pent-up household formation that could happen in this country, but we're not creating enough jobs to get that household formation. So it sounds like what you're saying is when you're looking at your guidance for next year, you're basing it on what's going on in your market now where job growth at the national level has been anemic even if it's strong in the west. So I'm wondering, is that correct and that your sort of -- if job growth goes back above 200,000 a month on a national level, does that mean that, that's likely additive to revenue guidance -- revenue next year?","David J. Neithercut","I guess I would say that when we run the numbers, we look out the next 12 months. We either feel like there could be a catalyst or not. And we kind of feel like there's not and that job growth will continue to run in the 150,000 range and anything above and beyond that will be favorable to our business.","Mark J. Parrell","And we'll get -- and then we'll help get the 3 million additional 20 or 30 year olds that are living with mom and dad out of the house and get those missing households back into the marketplace.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So that's not factored into guidance, that's an added benefit?","Mark J. Parrell","We look at the economies and sort of see it operating today, not robust growth, 150,000 or so jobs a month, maybe 170,000 or so, I guess what they've done year to date, and just kind of roll that forward. But we also do -- as David said, we really look at this neighborhood by neighborhood and submarket by submarket and give our best guess. And if -- let me tell you, if we took 7.2 unemployment down to 6.5, and that's -- that job growth significantly changed, yes, that will be certainly be helpful on the upside, and it sure would help in Washington, D.C.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Just one other follow-up. I think you said earlier that you categorize the Northwest as the market next year that would be above 5% revenue growth. Specifically, which cities are falling in the Northwest? And what is the percentage of NOI from the same store that's in that over 5% bucket next year?","David J. Neithercut","So that would be the combined results of Seattle, San Francisco and Denver. And if you want the same-store percentages, I'll probably refer you to Page 9 where we're telling you what the portfolio looks like at 9\/30\/2013, not same store, but in its totality, because our total unit count, same store as versus total units owned are going to be very similar. So you could see that San Francisco there is going to be 12% or so of our next year same-store NOI, for example.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Rosivach with Goldman Sachs.","Jeffrey Pehl - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Jeff on the line for Andrew. I'm just going back to D.C., about 33% of our portfolio you bought from Archstone was in D.C. by NOI. And you've highlighted that D.C. will be your weakest 2014 market. Did the Archstone operating income meet your acquisition underwriting?","David J. Neithercut","Yes. I mean, I don't think we thought any differently about D.C. when we underwrote the Archstone portfolio than we thought about our own.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","David, on the current pipeline -- the development pipeline today, where do you see yields coming in at? And how is that comparing to underwriting as you start leasing on a few of those? And then as we think about starts additionally in the back -- in the fourth quarter and into '15, where are yields penciling on that relative to recoverable acquisitions are today?","David J. Neithercut","Well, again, of our -- the products we have under construction -- let me back up. What we have delivered and delivered recently has done very well and will meet or exceed our expectations. And some of those deals are in the 8s, okay? So those are the things that we would have bought very low land prices back in 2009, 2010. So those have probably exceeded our expectations, and many of those are in the 8s. What's under construction today, so that which we will deliver very soon, is in the mid-5s, and some of those are even in the low 8s. The pipeline, so those being assets we have not yet started, at current rents, we think those are low-5s to mid-6s. And again, if one where to trend rents, and again, that's not a terrific science, but we think some of those deals would stabilize in the mid-6s to also mid-8s. And again, as I noted, we are in the market -- in the core markets today. The kinds of quality of assets that we now own and operate in these core markets will trade in the mid-4s, low-4s all day long and some of them probably even in the high 3s.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Great. That's helpful. Second question, obviously, as you've been going through the repositioning process, disposition has been elevated. As you think about dispositions for next year just in terms of sources and uses, I mean, what should be a normalized kind of run rate for recycling for EQR kind of going forward? And then just as a bookkeeping thing, what was the -- where were the 2 land parcel sales? Were those legacy Archstone stuff?","David J. Neithercut","I guess with respect to the elevated levels of dispositions, I can tell you that we are done. We have, for many years, been selling $1 billion, $1.5 billion, maybe even $2 billion, reallocating that capital into our core markets that have been doing so at cap rate spreads between 90 basis points, 60 basis points, as wide as 125. That business is over. What you'll see us do going forward is what I indicated -- we're working on L.A. right now, where we believe for the same cap rate, we can sell an older garden property in the valley and reallocate that into a mid-rise property in a downtown. So you'll see -- I don't know what the volume will be because it will be more a function of what's available and how we think we're going to fund it. But you'll see the spread between what we buy and what we sell narrow considerably, and it will be more tactical. The larger sort of strategic work is done and it will just be more sort of local and more tactical. The land sites we sold, one was the legacy site that we've had for quite a while in Chino Hills in Southern California. And then we sold an Archstone land site in which we had a 23% interest in the San Diego market.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And finally, David Santee, if I missed this, did you say where renewals went out for November and December?","David S. Santee","Let's see. For November, what they went at -- renewals went out for November at 7.4%. And we achieved -- yes, it's a little early to quote our November. But we're already at 5%. I mean, when people get the lower increases, they pretty much sign immediately. So the closer we get to expiration date, the numbers climb. But for December, we sent out a 7.9%. And we have achieved a 4.3%. But again, that number will grow substantially.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","The typical moderation is about 100, 125 basis points, if I remember it correctly?","David S. Santee","Correct.","Operator","We have a follow-up question from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's actually Michael Bilerman. David Santee, the 1.9% static number you gave heading into '14, what would that have been heading into '13 as a proportion of that 4.5% growth?","David S. Santee","It was a 2.3%, if I remember correctly.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So as we think about '14 effectively in the guidance, just probably a little bit lighter in terms of rent growth assumptions in '14, what will you have expected heading into '13, in explaining the change?","David S. Santee","I guess -- are you asking about '14 or...","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Well, I'm just trying to think about if you have -- when you're heading into 2013, you had 2.3% locked in of an 4.5% growth profile. Now as we look towards '14, you have 1.9% set of a 3.5% growth profile. The slight diminution has to come from your expectation on either turnover, rents, renewals, new leases and how all that blends together.","David S. Santee","Yes. Well, I mean, a lot of it is just -- it's an entirely different portfolio with different weightings. And I think I said earlier in the comments that Washington, D.C. will weigh down the portfolio. So I think you have to kind of really look at it market by market and the contribution -- of percentage of revenue in each market and then the expected rate of change for next year.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Do you have any sort of details on looking at what your expectation is for renewals in '14 relative to what it was in '13 and whether that's playing a part or sort of what your expectation is for base rent increases versus for new leases versus renewals?","David S. Santee","Well, we certainly -- I mean, that's how we build our model. So we certainly have expectations. And a lot of those -- I mean, renewals are pretty much a function of what we've accomplished this year and assuming that you will have rent growth next year at specified levels.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I'm going to come back to the share buyback just for, I don't know, the 5th time. Is there any reason why -- well, 2 parts. One, is there any reason why you haven't done it? You talked in September at a conference saying that the stock was one of the best options that you had, but you hadn't bought any stocks since then. So I don't know if it was a blackout or anything. Is there any reason why you haven't done it yet?","David J. Neithercut","This company has done an extraordinary amount of very successful and very value-creating work this year. And we've had to deal with a great deal of execution risk in getting the Archstone trade done. And really, that has been what our focus has been; making sure that we got the disposition done as we said, at the prices that we had hoped to get, the balance sheet restructuring that Mark has done, putting us in a position where, frankly, we could consider such a thing. And as I said before, and hopefully we can put this matter to bed, at least for this call, that we will continue to consider going forward. So we needed to get ourselves in a position, Michael, where we could do that.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And I assume just given the fact that you're on GGP's board and you're comfortable, I assume, of going direct to a shareholder and buying a block of stock, that should factor into the calculus as well or not?","David J. Neithercut","I mean, I can't say anything about that, so I guess we'll leave it at that.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I mean, I guess with that said, would you be aggressive in going after Lehman and then saying, look, we're...","David J. Neithercut","Michael, Michael, I don't know what more I can say on this particular matter. So why don't we just leave it there?","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","We'll move on, okay. Last one just expenses. As you think -- as you look towards next year, you talked about your worst fears on the real estate taxes coming true, driving the expense growth to 3.3% for the year. How should we think about the dynamics in '14 between taxes and all the other expenses which you did keep to only have 1.5% increase? How should we think about that trend line into '14?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I think in my comments as I said when you do the calculus on a fixed handle [ph] real estate tax, that being 35% of our total expense makeup and we -- we're going to assume that we have very minimal growth across all the other account lines with some savings in property management, I don't -- I guess I would say next year looks very similar to this year.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, good call on changing the dividend policy.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Derek Bower with ISI Group.","Derek Bower - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just had a quick follow-up on guidance. Could you quantify what the boost to 2014 same-store revenue growth would be from the rehab spend, particularly on the Archstone portfolio?","David J. Neithercut","It's not enough to move that meter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Hoglund with Jefferies.","George Hoglund - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I was just wondering if you could give a little bit more color on the transaction environment in markets that have been seeing new supply, and more specifically in Seattle, where you've seen some of your competitors buy some of these newly constructed assets?","Mark J. Parrell","Well, as David, I think, said in his opening remarks, Seattle has absorbed a lot of new units. It's been one of our top performers and we expect to continue to be a top performer on the operating side. And there continues to be a lot of demand by institutional investors for sort of core-plus and lesser-quality assets in that marketplace. So I guess it's across every market in which we currently operate, and we think the markets in which we no longer operate, based upon what we've seen in selling a lot of assets and commodity markets, there just remains very strong demand for good quality, cash flowing assets like multi-family.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. Please continue with your closing remarks.","David J. Neithercut","All right, thank you very much, Lilly. Thank you, all, today. But before we close the call, I want to say a few quick words about our friend and colleague John Collins. Well, some of you may know but most of you may not know, John has decided to retire after a distinguished 19-year career at Equity Residential. During these last 19 years, John has played a very important role in 80 earnings calls, 40 NAREIT conferences and hundreds, if not thousands, of investor meetings across the country. Today is John's last earnings call with us. Next month will be his last NAREIT conference. And so I ask you all, please don't forget to say your farewells to John in San Francisco next month. On behalf of everyone at Equity, I will tell you we will miss John's wit and his wisdom as he transitions to life's next great adventure. We thank him for his many contributions in making Equity Residential such a great and highly respected company.

And now I'll turn the call over to David Neithercut.","David Neithercut","Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We have got a lot to go over today and we will start with David Santee providing some color on operations. Talk a little bit about how last year ended up, a discussion on our core markets and our overall outlook for 2016. I will then discuss the acquisition and disposition activity that we are planning this year that will be in addition to the recently completed $5.365 billion sale to Starwood. And finally, Mark Parrell will take you through how our operating outlook and transaction and other assumptions impact our 2016 earnings guidance, our regular and special dividends, our recent debt repayment activities following the Starwood sales and liquidity.","Now before we get started, I want to make a couple of general comments because we all read and listen to the same things the rest of you do and we know that there is a lot of volatility around the globe and across the financial markets. And there a lot of questions about how that is currently impacting or might soon impact the domestic economy in general and our business in particular. Because there have also been some reports of increasing apartment vacancy and declining rental rates. Like you, we don't have a crystal ball. All we can tell you is what we are seeing real time in our business and what we're seeing is some markets are a bit behind where we had expected at this point and others a bit ahead.","But in total portfolio wide, we are where we expected to be one month into the year with 30 days forward visibility. And as in recent years, renewals tell a lot of the story. Renewal increases in November, December and January were all plus 6% and we will also achieve plus 6% growth in renewal rents in February. Portfolio occupancy today is 96.1%, very much in line with our expectations and quite strong for this time of year. All in all, we are pretty much right where we thought we would be when we gave our initial guidance for 2016 back in late October.","So with that said, I will let David go into more detail about our markets, our current outlook for 2016 and why we think this year will be another good year for the apartment business and for Equity Residential.","David Santee","Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. During Q4 turnover continued to decline with the quarter-over-quarter reduction of 7% in gross move-outs. For the full year turnover declined 40 basis points from 54.9% to 54.5% and then net of intra-property transfers turnover decreased 50 basis points to 48.5% from 49%. Our continued focus on minimizing Q4 and Q1 lease expirations continue to produce more operational stability as occupancy once again remains stronger through the historical Q4 seasonal slowdown.","Moveouts to buy homes increased only slightly across many markets for the quarter and the full year. With rents continuing their rapid ascent across most markets, it should come as no surprise that affordability, our second-largest category for moveouts, increased from 13% to 14.1% for full year. Yet demand for quality apartments in great locations has remained steady thus far.","Similar to 2015 we again we start the year from a solid foundation of occupancy, exposure and pricing levels across most of our markets. Today occupancy, as David mentioned, is 96.1% and exposure is 20 basis points lower with the net effective new lease rents up 3% year-over-year versus same week last year. While not the record setting renewal increases we enjoyed in 2015, we achieved a 6.4% increase on our January offers and February will deliver in the same range. These early indicators coupled with continued favorable job growth, fever deliveries on our core markets but more importantly the submarkets that we operate in, gives us the confidence to stand by our preliminary revenue guidance range of 4.5% to 5.25%.","However, we are mindful of the headwinds from the headlines and the potential odds and impact of the U.S. economy entering a recessionary environment. Our 2016 revenue guidance is available by the West Coast with San Francisco leading the way followed by Los Angeles which continues to show momentum in both new lease and renewal gains. Our 2016 buckets of revenue growth again include San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle and the remainder of Southern California, all expected to exceed 5% revenue growth for the full year.","Boston and New York Metro remain in the 3% to 5% bucket as concentrated new supply in each of our submarkets continue to dampen pricing power for new leases. Washington DC once again remains in a bucket of their own but we have projected revenue growth of 1% to 1.3% for full year 2016.","Our total portfolio assumptions based on 75,123 same-store units that drive the midpoint of guidance, our 2.3% embedded growth from 2015, 3.5% average new lease rent growth and 6% average gain on renewals. Occupancy and turnover for 2016 are modeled to be flat.","Expense results of 2% for the quarter were extremely favorable versus our forecast of 4.3%. Even with our optimistic adjustments that were made prior to our last earnings release, we were unable to predict the full impact of a commodities route and record temperature which allowed us to deliver full-year expense growth of 2.5% versus guidance of 3.1%. The two drivers of the 230 basis point pick up or approximately $4 million in Q4 were spread almost evenly between utilities and payroll with the unseasonably warm weather materially influencing both.","The rapid price decline across all relevant commodities combined with record warm temperatures through December allowed us to beat our original forecasted savings almost threefold for the quarter, resulting in an additional $2 million pick up across heating oil, natural gas and electric. Also, the warm temperatures combined with a 7% decline in Q4 moveouts allowed us to achieve our historical salary forecast but the need for contract labor and overtime was virtually nonexistent. This in addition to favorable employee bonus and health insurance accruals allowed us to achieve an additional $1.7 million in payroll savings for Q4, bringing our forecasted total of 4.3% down to the 2% for the quarter and 2.5% for the full-year.","Expense guidance for 2016 of 2.5% to 3.5% is once again driven by real estate tax growth of 5.25% with 190 basis points of that 5.25% attributable to our New York portfolio 421 tax abatement burn of. Like 2015 we would expect minimal growth, if any, across the utility accounts. Payroll should come in between 2.5% and 3% and all other account lines will so flat to minimal growth as the impact of increased minimum wages and Affordable Care Act cost incurred by our outside vendors are already absorbed into our cost structure over the past two years.","So, going around the horn and starting with Seattle, I will give some brief market highlights, some revenue expectations and expected delivery, that combined influence our thought process for a full year of 2016 revenue guidance. Seattle will see an 8% decline in new deliveries from a little over 9000 units in 2015 to approximately 7200. Knowing that Amazon will continue its large capital investment and delivery of almost 4 million square feet of new office space in downtown and the continued migration of regional and corporate headquarters from the suburbs, Seattle should be able to absorb this new inventory with minimal disruption just as it has done over the past two years and as evidenced by the 3100 units that have been absorbed over the past two quarters.","San Francisco will once again lead all EQR markets and constraints to new development are all around. However, like any market where there is a concentration of new supply, near-term pricing pressure will always follow. As a result of the new deliveries in the urban core, pricing has appeared to revert to normal seasonal patterns with net effective new lease rents up only 4% today. As expected, properties closest to the urban core are experiencing the most pressure why properties further down the peninsula continue to enjoy year-over-year rental rate growth in the mid teens. With lease up velocity exceeding normalized expectations, San Francisco Metro should experience rapid absorption and deliver another year of high single digit revenue growth as evidenced by our year to date billings that exceed 9.6%.","While headlines are quick to recognize the slowdown of DC tech spending, the large-cap giants continue to buy, lease or build new office space in anticipation of future growth and elevated hiring. But as we all know trees don't grow to the sky but our dashboard tells us that fundamentals remain strong. Renewal offers issued through March remain in double digits and if history plays out, we would expect new lease rents to seasonally adjust up from the mid-single digits we see today, to higher levels as we move closer to peak leasing season.","With embedded revenue growth of 5.5%, renewal rates achieved averaging almost 10% and new lease rents everything 7+ percent, for the full-year we would expect our portfolio to deliver full-year revenue growth in the high single digits. Los Angeles fundamentals appear to be coming on strong with the anticipation of a breakout year for the LA economy and the pro-business city government, the rebranding of downtown as a world-class city coupled with meaningful additions to infrastructure and transportation cause us to be very optimistic in LA's ability to absorb the 7600 new deliveries expected in 2016. Given the concentrated nature of deliveries in the South Park and Hollywood submarkets, we see no major hurdles to strengthening fundamentals in revenue growth as net effective new lease rents are up 7.3% with both occupancy and exposure significantly better positioned versus the same week last year.","Orange County in San Diego should continue to see about average growth with 2016 deliveries of 3600 and 2400 respectively. These levels are on par or slightly less than 2015. With the concentration of assets delivered during 2015 being in Irvine and in close proximity to a large percentage of our assets, we would expect to see better results in 2016 as pressure on new lease pricing subsides. Our Boston portfolio continues to face pricing pressure as 2015 backloaded deliveries remain in lease up. With only 2200 deliveries scheduled for 2016, which is a 62% decline and a lower concentration in the financial district and downtown, we would anticipate a window of improvement late this year and early into 2017 before an estimated 5000 units are again delivered in 2017. To date 19,000 units have been absorbed in the past two years without the disruption that one might expect. With GE announcing their headquarter relocation and the continued biotech related job growth, Boston should deliver results very similar to what we achieved in 2015.","For New York Metro we expect to deliver 3% revenue growth as new supply certain submarkets. After delivering average annual revenue growth of 4.9% for the last 16 quarters, the performance of our Manhattan portfolio will be greatly influenced by almost 2000 new units on the Upper West side which makes up almost 30% of total revenue for our New York Metro area. Most of the projects are luxury with unit mixes that skew towards two and three-bedroom apartments and of late have been more difficult to lease and as a result ends up with a greater economic vacancy loss. While occupancies remain above 95% we expect Upper West side new lease rates to be flat or slightly positive until a majority of these new deliveries are absorbed.","We continue to see strong fundamentals in pricing in our other Manhattan submarkets, the financial district, Gramercy and Chelsea. Collectively these neighborhoods should deliver revenue growth in line with our historical averages that I noted earlier. Another New York Metro hotspot is Jersey City or the Hudson waterfront where over 1000 new units were delivered in late 2015 and another 1500 expected in 2016. All concentrated in one to two mile radius. Thus far we have not felt the full impact as year to date revenue growth is holding at 3%.","Brooklyn will also deliver a number of new buildings but these are north and further east of downtown with the new supply being smaller in unit count and less desirable based on amenities and location. We would expect moderate impact in Williamsburg and less so in downtown Brooklyn as both EQR communities in this location are delivering in excess of 4.8% revenue growth through February. Again, as new supply comes online in concentrated areas, new lease pricing will be under pressure and we see that in our net effective rents today. However, occupancy remains strong across the portfolio at 96.1%. Renewal rate growth should average plus 4% for the portfolio that combined will produce full-year revenue growth of approximately 3%.","Washington DC will experience declines in deliveries to approximately 11,000 units in 2016 after absorbing over 28,000 units in the previous two years. With positive revenue growth in Q4 and full-year we are cautiously optimistic about near-term performance. Should absorption maintain its velocity, DC should begin to deliver more favorable revenue growth as new lease pricing pressures ease. With job growth in the professional services sector continuing to improve, an increase in DC business activity as a result of the election year and more of the 2016 deliveries in the suburbs versus Arlington and DC, we continue to be optimistic about the long-term performance of our portfolio.","In summary, we continue to see favorable fundamentals across all of our markets. At this point in the apartment rental cycle it is much too early to be influenced by the negative headlines that we all read each and every day. We remain focused on what the data tells us and we will respond appropriately. Today our dashboards tell us that not much has changed in that apartment fundamentals, at least for the first quarter remain strong leading us to believe that 2016 will be yet another year of performance above long-term trend.","David Neithercut","All right. Thank you, David. We are very pleased to have recently closed our sale of 72 non-core assets totaling 23,262 apartment units to Starwood for $5.365 billion or $231,000 per unit. I am particularly pleased to realize an 11.1% unleveraged IRR on these investments inclusive of indirect management costs over an extremely long hold period. This sale was a result of an incredible effort by a lot of folks here at EQR who worked practically around the clock to get this deal done. And I thank all of them for their dedication and commitment. And I also thank those who left the company with the sale of this portfolio. Some of them have been with us for more than 20 years. We are most grateful to all of these people for their service to our residents and the company.","On our last earnings call when this transaction with Starwood was first announced, we explained that this disposition accomplished several things for us. First, we realized very good pricing on assets in markets not considered core for us and on some assets in our core markets that didn't quite fit our long-term strategic vision. The second thing we accomplished is that we can now focus solely on our strategy of owning, building and operating assets in higher density urban locations with close proximity to public transportation, job centers and other amenities that cities have to offer.","As we have discussed with many of you since the original announcement, this sale and the sale of $700 million of additional assets in 2016, would result in a special dividend of $9 to $11 per share. And that decision was made due to the challenge we saw trying to recycle $6 billion of capital in today's marketplace where we continue to see strong institutional demand for core assets in Gateway coastal cities and very competitive pricing as a result of the demand. We continue to believe and are grateful for the support of so many of you who did agree with us for returning much of these proceeds to our investors through a special dividend in a balance sheet neutral way is the best capital allocation decision we can make on behalf of our shareholders.","Since our original announcement of the Starwood transaction, demand for multifamily assets in our core markets has continued unabated and so we have considered the sale of several additional assets that due to either operational challenges or submarket issues, or pricing potential that we simply thought too good to pass up, might represent additional timing opportunities to monetize our interest in certain assets and modestly increase the size of this year's special dividend.","Last week, for instance, we sold one of three assets acquired from the Macklowe family in 2010, when we paid a total of $475 million for the entire portfolio. This particular property, RiverTower was sold for $390 million, or $1.2 million per door at a yield in the low 3s, for a five-year unleveraged IRR inclusive of indirect management cost of 14%. This sale was previously contemplated and was accounted for in our original special dividend guidance of $9 to $11 per share.","In addition, we have also started work on the potential disposition of another $600 million of possible sales that if consummated could increase the dividend by another dollar or so per share and hence the new range of $10 to $12 per share noted in last night's press release. I want to be publicly clear because I am sure many of you will have questions about this. We backed up the truck once with the sale to Starwood, we have no intention of doing so again. And as I have said, we are working on a limited number of additional sales yet this year that could bring our special dividend up to the $10 to $12 per share.","Our guidance also assumes that we will sell an additional $300 million by the end of the year, 100% of which would be redeployed in the new acquisitions. And that level of activity is accounted for in our guidance towards the back half of the year at a negative yield spread of 75 basis points. This additional $300 million of activity will only occur if we can find suitable investments for which we are willing to trade out of current assets. So the guidance provided in the press release is for $7.4 billion of dispositions comprised of the $6.1 billion we announced last October, nearly $400 million for RiverTower. Another $600 million expected to be sold during the year adding an additional dollar per share to our special dividend and $300 million of sales that will occur if and only if we can suitable reinvestment opportunities.","Our acquisition guidance for $600 million is roughly $300 million of 1031 reinvestments to cover some very large tax gains of certain unaffiliated limited partners as a result of the Starwood transaction and $300 million of additional possible acquisitions in the back half of the year and matched up with dispositions in the normal course of managing our portfolio.","I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Mark Parrell.","Mark Parrell","Thank you, David. I want to take a few minutes this morning to talk about our guidance for 2016 that includes both the annual dividend and the special dividends, our recent debt prepayment activity and then I will close with a discussion of sources and usage in 2016.","Our range for normalized FFO for 2016 is $3 to $3.20 per share. This range is larger than usual due to some of the uncertainties over transaction timing. I am going to walk you through some of the bigger highlights at this point. The biggest reconciling item between 2015 and 2016 normalized FFO is of course the reduction we will experience in net operating income of about $345 million, that's about $.90 per share, from our transaction activity including Starwood. The second big item going the other way is the use of approximately $1.7 billion of those disposition proceeds to prepay debt. That creates an $80 million or $.21 per share benefit or improvement in interest expense.","I will pause here and note that we are expecting about $10 million decline in capitalized interest in 2016 versus 2015 and I did include that in the $.21 per share improvement number that I just gave you. So once you get past the transaction and debt activity, our normalized FFO is driven by the usual suspects. And that includes an increase of $.23 per share in same-store NOI and an increase of $.12 per share from lease outs.","And the final items are just a variety of other individually less material items that reduced our normalized FFO estimate for 2016 by about two cents per share. And they include, among other things, lower income from unconsolidated entities and that's due to the sales in 2015 as the last few Archstone JV operating assets. So this brings our normalized FFO guidance midpoint for 2016 to $3.10 per share. So now I am going to move on to the dividends. For the annual dividend as you know, it is our intention to pay 65% of the midpoint of our normalized FFO guidance as our annual common share dividend. Given the midpoint I just discussed of $3.10 per share, we would expect to take $2.015 per share for the year or 50.375 cents per share per quarter in 2016.","Also we expect to pay two special dividends which will total between $10 and $12 a share. The first special dividend is anticipated to be paid in the second quarter and is expected to be about $8 per share. There is less variability in our minds about the size and timing of this first special dividend, given that the Starwood sales and some of these other sales have already occurred. But of course our board of trustees retains discretion on all dividend matters.","The second special dividend has been modeled in our guidance at $3 per share based on our existing disposition guidance number as well as numerous assumptions we had to make about the exact timing and amount of the gain per asset and our 2016 operating income and other tax variables. Similarly, the timing of the payment of the second special dividend is less certain in our minds and we will like the amount of that dividend ultimately depend on when these sales close, the number of sales that close and certain other tax variables.","Now on to the bond tender and our other recent debt repayment activities. Consistent with what we have said on the earnings call back in October, over the last two weeks the company has prepaid prior to maturity a total of $1.7 billion in debt through an unsecured bond tender and early repayment of a large secured debt pool. In mid-March we also repay using the cash we now have on hand. The $270 million of March 2016 unsecured bonds that were not tender. Collectively, the company will incur approximately $112 million in prepayment penalties and that will be recorded as additional interest expense in the first quarter and it will impact EPS and FFO but will not impact normalized funds from operations.","These debt repayment activities were funded with a portion of the proceeds from the Starwood sale and our other recent sales and are intended to maintain and they do in fact actually slightly enhance the company's already strong credit profile. We now expect net debt to EBITDA for 2016 to be about 5.8 times and fixed charge coverage to be about 3.6 times and this compares for our already strong 2015 net debt to EBITDA ratio of 6.1 times and fixed charge coverage of 3.5 times. And I am computing all these fixed charge coverage ratios using the more stringent rating agency methodology which does not reduce interest expense by capitalized interest.","Also, our near term maturities are now greatly reduced and in fact we currently have only approximately $330 million of debt maturing in 2016 consisting of $60 million in secured debt that matures a little later in 2016 plus the $270 million of unsecured notes due in March 2016 that were not tendered as I discussed previously. Our 2017 maturities have now been cut in half and now total about $600 million. The company's liquidity position is excellent. Currently we have $3.5 billion in cash and our $2.5 billion revolving line of credit is undrawn. We also have no commercial paper outstanding.","At the end of 2016 we expect to have about $50 million in cash and the revolving line of credit and the commercial paper program between the two will have about $300 million balance. And that is certainly a lot of inflows and outflows in one year. So I am going to take a minute and just give you a little background on that and the bigger pieces. For the full year 2016 we expect net inflows from buys and sells of about $6.8 billion. To date we have sold approximately $5.9 billion which is inclusive of Starwood and we have not acquired any properties.","We have assumed paying about $4.25 billion in special dividends. As I just said we expect to pay the first and in second quarter of 2016 in the amount of about $30 billion, and the second later in 2016 in the amount of approximately $1.25 billion. We anticipate repaying approximately $2.1 billion in total debt during 2016. As mentioned earlier, we have already retired approximately $1.7 billion. We further expect to spend about $250 million during the year. That\u2019s mostly for the prepayment penalties I referred to previously and about $40 million or $45 million of transaction cost on the dispositions.","We expect to spend about $600 million in development activities during 2016 and the final piece of the puzzle is positive cash flow from operations of about $200 million. And that $200 million number is net of our annual dividend and our capital expenditures. In order to balance our sources and usage, we have included in guidance a $200 million to $250 million borrowing later in 2016, which we have assumed will be a secured loan and we expect to have the revolver drawn or to have CP outstanding equal to about $300 million.","And I will now turn the call back over to Angela, our operator for the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Nick Joseph","David, I appreciate your comments on the uncertain macro environment but from your comments it doesn't sound like there's been a large impact to the transaction market. So, I'm wondering if we were to enter a recession, how do you think asset values would hold up in the gateway markets versus the secondary markets?","David Neithercut","Thanks, Nick. Good question. Look I think that history has demonstrated that these gateway market asset values hold up better and recover more quickly. I think we have experienced that certainly through the last recession and the markets in which we are focused today we saw rent recover quickly and surpass the established new highs and values perform similarly. So we are quite comfortable and confident that we are in the right markets for the long term and think we are in the markets that will perform and should outperform if there is any sort of recession on the horizon.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. And with all the asset sales, the same store pool is changing considerably in 2016. It looks like it's about 70,000 units. So I'm wondering if you can give, for the 2016 same store pool, what their revenue expense and NOI growth was in 2015.","Mark Parrell","It's Mark Parrell, Nick. It was broadly similar. Revenue was slightly lower as you might guess from losing Denver which was a strong market. But it was within a couple tens of a percent of the same numbers we reported for 2015 for the existing same store set.","Nick Joseph","Okay. So, you're not expecting, for those existing same stores, there's not much of a deceleration expected in 2016?","Mark Parrell","Correct.","David Neithercut","Not relative to the 2015 same store -- what would be the same store [indiscernible]","Mark Parrell","So comparing the 93,000 units in 2015 to the 70,000 we expect in 2016, there is no meaningful difference in our lines.","Nick Joseph","Okay. Thanks. And then, finally, for the same store buckets that you laid out earlier, have any of the market outlooks changed materially since you gave the preliminary guidance three months ago?","David Neithercut","No. I would say that we when we go through the budget process that we just wrapped up and Mark reviews, I would say that some started off the year a little differently than we expected but we still feel that full year results are intact. LA is definitely much stronger than we expected. Orange County, San Diego is much stronger than we expected. San Francisco starting off a little slower than we expected primarily due to just some of the lease ups and the impact on the closer in assets. But everything else is really right where we thought it would be.","Operator","We will now go to Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.","Steve Sakwa","Maybe David Santee, could you just comment a little bit more on San Francisco? It's clearly a market that has captured everybody's attention. Just curious if you're seeing anything in terms of just the leasing activity, traffic, roommates' situation, just any color that you could offer. I can appreciate the difference between the urban core and maybe the Peninsula. But just any more color you could give us around that market, what you're seeing in terms of future renewals and traffic coming in would be great.","David Santee","We've spent a lot of time over the last week or so as we went through budgets. Traffic really remains identical to last year. Our level of applications, which is really the canary in the coal mine, are identical to last year. I think San Francisco, we looked at rent growth on a property by property basis. I would tell you that some of the other developers have different philosophical approaches to lease ups and different tactics that are probably not warranted in my opinion relative to the strength of market, but nevertheless we will have to deal with that. Anecdotally, I can tell you that we've had a graphic design guy that's been at equity for probably 14-15 years, that took a job in San Francisco and basically he's renting a couch in someone's apartment because there still remains a housing shortage and I think this temporary dislocation given the seasonality of the market will repair itself over the next 30 days.","Steve Sakwa","Okay, thanks. And I guess just a follow-up question on New York. I noticed on the development page that both of your New York properties had relatively slow leasing and I can appreciate the comments you made about the Upper West Side and maybe the 170 Amsterdam project is falling victim to some of the oversupply on the Upper West Side. But just anything you could comment on in New York. Are the developments, were they below your expectations and if so, what do you attribute that to?","David Neithercut","Well, the recent activity I guess is attributable to a couple of things Steve. Number one is, just, you would have less activity in the fourth quarter, particularly in lease up. So I wouldn\u2019t read too much into the fourth quarter statistics or recent statistics on lease up. The other thing that happens is that when you get in to the later stages of leasing up a building, you have less inventory. And so you are less able to accommodate everybody who walks through the door. You can imagine people walk through the door early on. You have got all the ones, all the studios, all the twos and can accommodate from a wider price range and whatever product we have. Now you are getting to a point where you have got less inventory in particular ranges and you may not be able to accommodate everyone. So it just will naturally slow. And on the Upper Westside as you know, it's being impacted by other deliveries and we have larger units either sort of with the inventory yet to lease at our Amsterdam deal and that would also just take more time. But all in all, we have been very pleased with those assets. Have been thrilled with the value we have created there and they are going to stabilize and will do extraordinarily well for us.","Operator","We will now go to Nick Yulico with UBS.","Nick Yulico","First, Mark, on the guidance, I wanted to see if it was possible to just get a range for the total NOI in dollars for the portfolio this year?","Mark Parrell","A range total NOI in dollars.","Nick Yulico","Right. If you don't have it immediately available, I can maybe just wait on that. And then, secondly, can you talk a little bit about, it looks like you guys may have purchased or in contract to purchase an asset in DC, which I don't think you've done for a while. Could you talk a little bit about what was behind your thinking there?","David Neithercut","Well, as we noted back when we announced the Starwood transaction, we had close to $300 million of 1031s we were going to have to do to cover some set gains for some unaffiliated investors. And so a property became available for sale in DC in the [U Street] [ph], 14th Street corridor, that we thought we could buy at an attractive rate, at mid-4 kind of cap rate. And we thought it was a good trade and would be a good asset to cover. We can obviously have a big operation in DC and the guys saw that it represented pretty good value. So walk score of 99 in that very highly desirable marketplace for the demographic that was living in the city.","Mark Parrell","If I could just revert back on your question. So for 2016, and this is total NOI so this includes our projected acquisition NOI, this includes a few weeks of Starwood, I mean this is just the totality of it, between $1.6 billion and $1.65 billion would be a good number.","Operator","We will now go to Gaurav Mehta with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Gaurav Mehta","Just a couple questions on your investment activity. So the additional sales, $600 million and then $300 million at the end of the year, where are those assets located?","David Neithercut","Well, the additional transactions that we had first announced that we would do in addition to the Starwood transaction are generally sort of in Connecticut and Massachusetts. So it's the residual assets that we acquired with the Globe transaction back in the late 90s. The other properties that, in addition to that, was the RiverTower transaction, which I noted, we did in New York. And a couple of other properties in California that we are considering selling, that are in various stages of that process. And then of the $300 million that I have talked about, that would be disclosed if and if we can find appropriate trade assets. My guess, so you will see a little bit here and a little bit there. There's been nothing specifically indicated at this time.","Gaurav Mehta","Okay. And then the 75 basis point CapEx spread is narrower than the 100 basis points you have been doing for some time now. Is that expected to continue or is it just for this year reflecting the quality of assets that you're selling?","David Neithercut","Yes. I guess I can't tell you what that spread will be going forward in the normal course of our business but, yes, it should certainly narrow because the assets we will be trading in the future in the normal process of managing our portfolio will be assets in our core markets. And those will trade at a tighter cap rate to the assets than which we would acquire in those trade markets as opposed to selling assets in the secondary, kind of non-core markets that we have been selling over the past half a dozen or so years. So, yes, it will be a narrower spread than historical. I don\u2019t know exactly 75 or not but certainly much more narrow than what you have seen in the past.","Operator","We will now go to Dave Toti with BB&T Capital Markets.","Dave Toti","David, a quick question for you on the strategy of shrinking the company. And I guess along the dimensions of, at what point does it become a structural change? And are there any associated G&A impacts or internal management realignments as you go through the year on the dispositions?","David Neithercut","Well, I guess the strategy has not been to shrink the company but to rather take advantage of what we thought was very strong pricing on assets that we knew we didn't want to own, it did not make sense for us to own long term. In terms of any sort of change in G&A, so there were no -- not a big structural sort of change. There might be some little changes that may have to occur but you won't see a big structural change as a result of selling what we have sold and what we intend to sell over the balance of the year.","Dave Toti","Okay. And then my second question just has to do with your thoughts on the acquisition market. I guess more specifically, what would have to change in the environment in the second half of the year to make acquisitions more attractive from your perspective? Would it just be simply pricing or change in the capital environment?","David Neithercut","Well, I guess, David, the investments are really a function for us of -- the acquisition market is a function of the disposition market. So it's where we believe we can trade and where we can acquire assets relative to the prices at yields at which we can dispose of assets, which represent the capital for that reinvestment. So we are just really working both sides of that equation. There are times in which the bid-ask spread is sort of wide and you won't see us transact. You will see others in which it narrows and we think it would be an advantageous time to transact. So I think that\u2019s really the answer to your question, is it's just how we look at the value of what we want to buy relative to the value of what we want to sell.","Operator","We will now go to Andrew Rosivach with Goldman Sachs.","Andrew Rosivach","To set this up, Mark, when you said the 5.8 times debt to EBITDA, is that assuming 16 run rate kind of run rate EBITDA with growth on it. And the debt is net of all the transactions that you guys are announced and planning?","Mark Parrell","Yes. So the EBITDA number is what our true 2016. So it does include a little bit of Starwood income we won't have next year. It does include the growth and the debt is the year-end number.","Andrew Rosivach","Got it. Okay. So, it's not like a perfect run rate to run rate.","Mark Parrell","No. But I would expect 2017 not to be dissimilar to that 5.8 or to be slightly better, given what we expect on growth. And the fact that we have also effectively covered all our liabilities for a bit.","Andrew Rosivach","Got it. So here's what I was going to ask. If you look at UDR today, they've got a three year plan that actually implies their debt to EBITDA will be even lower than this, actually half of where they were in the fourth quarter of 2009. We've had kind of your distant cousins, if you will, in student housing just recently very dramatically take down their debt to EBITDA even lower than your planned levels. Massive dilution associated with doing that but the stocks have actually behaved very, very well. And I guess my big picture question is, do you think that public REITs need to dramatically change their leverage relative to where they've been historically?","David Neithercut","Every REITs got to look at its business model and particular volatility of its income, and we look at ours. You have got a pretty diversified portfolio. You have got debt maturities, we got very little maturing in the near term. And you have got interest expense coverage approaching four times. I mean you really have outstanding metrics in every regard here and the unencumbered pool at our company is the secret not so secret credit strength. We have about, even after all the sales this year, about $1.2 billion of our NOI that I quoted earlier, is unencumbered. And that just gives us huge flexibility. So we think here, when we talk to our board and we discuss this, we're always interested in making sure we are comfortable defensively and position so we can do things offensively. And honestly with the liquidity we have and with the access to the kind of channels of capital we have, I feel very comfortable with these numbers. Other people with different platforms and different volatility, their income streams probably need to be lower. We also have relatively little development, because of that again we can run the balance sheet in a different manner. So I think it's kind of a custom, no one-size-fits-all. It's just applying thoughtful principles to whatever your strategy is and whatever your income stream is.","Andrew Rosivach","Well, in your back pocket you can do $1 billion equity offering, dilute your earnings, and your stock will probably go up. Thanks for taking the question.","David Neithercut","Well, people did that in 2009 and it only lasted for a little while.","Andrew Rosivach","It feels a lot like that. I understood. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","We will now go to Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors.","Dave Bragg","Can you spend a little time talking about development? What are your thoughts on the appropriate level of development for you at this point in the cycle given your cost of capital? And what are your plans for development starts in 2016?","David Neithercut","Well, after starting an average of $1 billion in each of '13 and '14, we I think communicated pretty directly and quite early to the Street that that number would come down, and it did. Starting only 375 or so million in 2015. And deals that we could start if we feel the desire to do so of similar amount in 2016, Mark's guidance assumes about $350 million of starts. So as Mark noted in answer to the last question, we have seen our development exposure come down considerably. Land is very expensive. Construction costs are up, yields are down and as we look at the yields that are available in the marketplace, we just don't think they make sense for us. We are also not inclined to go further out into the suburbs in order to sort of chase yield because our strategy is to be focused on the urban core. We think that the total returns will perform better in the urban core than in the suburbs.","So there is not a function of us saying we want this amount as a percentage of our equity footings on our balance sheet or that percentage. We just look for opportunities and when we find ones we think make sense for us, we will not be shy pursuing them, but they are just getting more and more difficult to find. We did acquire some sites in San Francisco in the SoMa district last year, three properties which were assembled. And we will work on those going forward and we will see those might be a potential 2017 start. But we've been quite clear, I think, for quite some time that after an elevated level of starts in that $1 billion range as a result of the land sites that came to us in the Archstone transaction, that that number would likely come down and indeed it has. And we are happy where we are. If we can find opportunities that we think makes sense for more, we will be happy to do more. But I don't see us for some time ever getting close to the $1 billion start rate that we saw in '13 and '14.","Dave Bragg","Okay, great. Thank you for that. And the second question relates to CapEx. What are your expectations for CapEx spending in 2016?","Mark Parrell","Hey, Dave, it's Mark Parrell. I am just going to refer you to page 23 where we have our CapEx guidance. So what we have done is we have expected, and this is on the 70,000 unit set that will be our new same store we think by the end of the year. That we expect to spend about $2200 per unit. This year, this year being 2015, we spent $1800 effectively. But that was on the 93,000 same store unit set. So what we have done is we have tried to think about this as a percentage of NOI, as a percentage of revenue. And with the company's new higher rent per unit and new higher NOI per unit, when you look at 2200, that\u2019s about 7% of same store revenue for the new 70,000 units and about 10% of same store NOI. And that\u2019s exactly, really exactly identical to the $1801 we spend as a percentage of the lower same store revenue per unit and lower same store NOI per unit. So really proportionally it's about the same but on a per unit basis it goes up just like our per unit rents are going up.","I would say it's our contention that over time high rise and mid-rise on a capital basis will cost less as a percentage of NOI than running a garden portfolio. That contention will play out over a longer time period than just two years.","Operator","We will now go to Dan Oppenheim with Zelman & Associates.","Dan Oppenheim","Thanks very much. I was just wondering if you could talk, in terms of San Francisco you talked about the expectation that as we go through the spring season, you're hoping that there will be better trends in terms of the new lease growth there. Wondering, in terms of the guidance for the full year, how much of that is based on that expectation of improvement versus being based on the embedded rent growth that you have at this point based on the strength of last year.","David Neithercut","Well. So, call it a high single-digit with five and change built-in. We know renewals will deliver in the high single-digits which is roughly 50% of our revenue growth. So really as far as contribution of new rental rate to the overall full year revenue growth, it's about 25%.","Operator","We will now go to Greg Van Winkle with Morgan Stanley.","Greg Van Winkle","Are you starting to see a bigger difference in pricing power between A and B quality properties in your core markets?","David Neithercut","I'm not sure we've seen any change. I think that there's been very strong demand for the good-quality product and that demand will push other buyers maybe to lesser quality products. So I don't think there's been any real change over the last year, six months, 90 days between the two. Our teams came back from the NMHC meetings in Orlando last month. We are quite confident that there will continue to be really strong demand across all qualities in these core markets and have really seen no let up whatsoever.","Greg Van Winkle","Okay. And we're continuing to see a lot more supply growth in the urban cores and in the suburbs. My question I guess is, do you think the apartment industry is building the right amount of products in the right places today? And I know you guys talked about, you have a view that the urban core is the place to be in the long run and we are seeing more demand growth there than in the suburbs right now. But do you think in the near term there might be some overbuilding there relative to the suburbs in some markets?","David Neithercut","Well, I guess I can only answer the question or judge that by the success we have had leasing up the properties that we have developed in the urban core. And the strength has been just incredible. You know Washington DC over the last several years has delivered 30,000 units and occupancy hardly budged. Now we didn\u2019t have a lot of pricing power for several years but as David indicated, we hope to see that change in 2016. I think there is more product being built downtown because more people want to live downtown. I guess I have questions about how many people want to leave downtown to move to the suburbs that live in a structured box. So we just think long-term that this move to urbanization is not a short-term but a long-term phenomena and that we are very much positioned where we want to be now. Particularly having sold what we have sold and what we intend to sell for the balance of the year. The statistics will be quite clear as the perspective of the percentage of our income from the urban core, the walk scores of our properties etcetera, etcetera, will be without peer in our space.","Greg Van Winkle","All right, great. And then last one, just quickly here. On your occupancy guidance you're expecting it to remain about flat in 2016 at 96%, I think. Do you think there's any room you have to drive occupancies higher? Or would you rather not see it climb much more if it means you're not pushing hard enough on rents?","David Santee","Yes. I think that was our thesis back in late 2014-2015, was that demand increased organically, we did not do anything to grow our occupancy. And we are pretty much in net effective shop and we will let the rent and demand be the god. Certainly San Francisco is a great example of where demand far outstrips supply and we saw 100 basis point pickup in the previous 18 months while still increasing rents 14%, 15%. That's kind of the job of LRO and our pricing team is to optimize that balance with occupancy and rate each and every day.","Operator","We will now go to John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","I had a question on right-sizing your common dividends. I realize it's prudent to maximize retained earnings and keep your CAD ratio low. But some investors unfamiliar with your company may view a cut as a negative event. And I'm wondering if that was factored at all into your decision making, particularly given the new real estate GICS classification.","Mark Parrell","Yes. It's Mark Parrell. Honestly in a year where we are planning to pay our shareholders an $11 special dividend, it didn't occur to us that the annual recurring dividend would be the topmost concern and that going down it needs to make sense relative to our cash flow in good and bad times. It needs to be resilient. So when operations do decline, we're not in a position with the dividends to let some or immediately uncovered. So I guess we have a policy, we think that transparency has a lot of value. So people who are in that, predictability has a lot of value. So we didn't think about freezing the annual dividend in order to just preserve those optics. We think people in the long run will see through that.","John Kim","Okay. And then are you doing anything different this year as far as marketing to non-REIT investors or maybe something you may change in your reporting? There are some beneficial items such as asset sale gains that are not reflected in earnings and may not be as apparent to equity investors.","David Neithercut","Sure. I mean this is a very important year for REITs. I think it's a terrific opportunity for us to market to a wider set of people whose eyes are open to the benefits of owning real estate in a public format. And so we do intend to be pretty aggressive this year in reaching out to generalists, to people who don\u2019t own. And we are trying to think about things in a more general way instead of giving it to specific statistical information that some of our more longer term investors are more focused on. I think some of these generalists are more focused on more broader demographic trends , broader population usage. You know people being more interested in urban core and maybe not owning cars. Those are facts that are more of interest to some of the generalist investors than per square foot rent numbers or per square foot build numbers. So, yes, we do have a big focus this year on that and we do intend to discuss both earnings in the way they think about it and IRRs in the way we think about. Getting the most you can get out of a portfolio. A lot of our activity this year, as you pointed out, was about maximizing the IRR on some of these assets and returning capital which we think is good for all shareholders generally and are dedicated.","John Kim","So are you contemplating an alternate to FFO or core FFO?","David Neithercut","No.","Operator","And we will take Tom Lesnick with Capital One Securities.","Tom Lesnick","I think earlier in the call you mentioned some softness in some of the larger units, particularly in New York City. I was just wondering, is there any evidence of that being a more widespread trend? And is there any evidence of a stronger home buying environment being attributable to that?","David Santee","No. I mean there is -- this is David Santee. There is really no change in home buying in our core markets. I think the focus on the two and three bedrooms is limited to the Upper West Side and perhaps our new developments. But when you are 96% plus occupied across most markets, you generally have a good mix of product. Typically in New York, the majority of our units are studios and one bedroom. So the fact that we have so few and the fact that those so few are more vacant really causes us to focus on that from a revenue perspective. So I don't see any other issues in any other markets relative to demand for larger apartments.","Tom Lesnick","Got it. And then my second topic was Airbnb. I was just wondering, first, if you could quantify what financial impact at all that has had on your business. And then, secondly, have you met with them and is there any progress there on resolving some of the issues?","David Neithercut","Well, let me answer your first question. The economic on our business we have no way to determine that. There was no deal signed, there was no agreement in place at the moment. Should we entertain an agreement, I would say that economic benefits would be at the bottom of our priority list and it's really more about gaining transparency and control of what's going on all around us today. So regardless of what happens, I don\u2019t see any direct material economic benefit to our company. Perhaps more so with residents and those who choose to participate in the sharing economy. But I think we have ways to go before anything meaningful comes with that.","Operator","We will now go to Michael Lewis with SunTrust.","Michael Lewis","Thank you. You've given a lot of good detail on San Francisco. I wanted to ask, more specifically, it looks like the Mission Bay development is leasing up a few quarters ahead of schedule, and I was wondering if that's due to maybe getting a little bit more aggressive ahead of some competing new supply, including some other projects you guys are working on. Or if it's more of an organic thing that demand has just been that strong, and actually a similar situation for your Odin development in Seattle.","David Neithercut","It's really the latter. I mean you answered your own question. Really, Michael, honestly, just demand is that strong in that marketplace. Now Mission Bay has been impacted a little bit as of late because of some competing supply in Mission Bay but that's absorbing very quickly. And Oden and in Ballard in Seattle is essentially the same thing. There's just that much demand of this kind of housing in these locations. And so our absorption has been in those assets much faster than what we had thought at rates that met or exceeded expectations. We are obviously very pleased with both of them.","Michael Lewis","Thanks. And then on New York. Similarly, you've given some good detail on the sub-markets in New York. Last week SL Green made some comments on their call about slowing job growth and retail sales that panicked office investors and maybe apartment investors as well. I'm just wondering, if you're concerned about the job growth picture there. And as you think about your markets where there's risk, so not necessarily the weakest performers like maybe DC, but where there's risk where things could fall off the table. Is New York that market, or is San Francisco that market that might concern you a little?","David Santee","This is David Santee. You know I think perhaps there could be some short-term dislocation in the quality of product that is being delivered in New York. The only way you could build an apartment building in New York is through a 421a subsidy. And the rents command the top end of the market. But there are plenty of people that make considerable amounts of money that can afford those types of buildings. So I think what you see is what we see. And in every other market when we have a concentration of deliveries, there is near-term impact. And I don\u2019t see New York falling off the cliff. I mean it's kind of the number one place that people want to be in the world. And I think should there be any short term dislocation, it would come back even stronger than it had been before as it has every other time that it's taken a dip.","San Francisco, I just think that, look, even though you are delivering the apartments in the urban core, the area is still under-served as far as affordable housing. And when you look at the job projections across San Jose, San Francisco and Oakland, you are looking at 122,000 jobs in 2016 and delivering only 6000 apartments. So I don\u2019t see anything materially changing in San Francisco.","Operator","We will now go to Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.","Rich Anderson","Mark Parrell, you mentioned the $2,200 of CapEx. How much of that would you put in the revenue versus non-revenue buckets?","Mark Parrell","We have about $725 per unit which equates to about that $40 million we have number. It's hard for me to put a precise percentage. Certainly there is a percentage of that that's more or less deferred maintenance but a great deal of it is optional. We talk about it at investment committee and in fact we would probably also add that there is some sustainability stuff in those numbers that has a pretty good ROI on it. So, I guess, I can't give you a precise number. I think it's probably more revenue enhancing than it is just necessary capital in that rehab category, but I don't have some specific number for you.","Rich Anderson","Okay. Thanks. David Neithercut, can you quantify, not quantify, qualify the nature of your buying public here? I know with the $700 million you are expected to sell, that was supposed to be individually or small portfolios. Is that changing at all? And is the audience of potential buyers with FIRPTA and changes in the non-traded REIT world changing along with it?","David Neithercut","Well, certainly nothing has changed with respect to those assets that are in Connecticut, Massachusetts, that we talk about as sort of the [growth] [ph] assets. Which were the additional dispositions that we announced that we would sell when we announced the original Starwood transaction. Those are small assets. Local and regional players, we have got some of those under contract today. In our last investment committee discussion the team running that told us that they were seeing those bids come in just pretty much as they had expected with the same sort of cast of characters that they had expected. So really no change there.","With respect to any other change as a result of the FIRPTA, I think that many of those investors are still trying to figure that out. They have been operating under one set of guidelines for a long time and now they are trying to figure out with the new set, exactly how they might want to move forward. So I wouldn\u2019t say that we have seen any change at the present time.","Rich Anderson","With the $600 million that you have contemplated in addition to the $700 million, would that be more like a large portfolio all at once or also kind of in piecemeal?","David Neithercut","No, there is some larger assets involvement. It's fewer assets than what you might think. So just a small handful.","Rich Anderson","Okay. And then the last question is, you had a humongous deal, number one was buying Archstone and now this humongous deal number two is selling to Starwood and other asset sales. What's the crossover there? I guess what percentage of the Starwood sale came from the Archstone buy?","David Neithercut","I am not sure if any of it did. I guess maybe one or two assets. One or two assets at most.","Operator","We will now go to Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alex Goldfarb","Just some quick questions. On San Francisco and then comparing it to Seattle and the Peninsula, it sounds like the rent softness in the fourth quarter was purely supply as opposed to a slowdown in jobs. But if you could just provide some perspective with what you're seeing across those three tech oriented markets on the job front over the past three to six months.","David Santee","For San Francisco versus Seattle?","Alex Goldfarb","Yes. And the Peninsula as well.","David Santee","Okay. Well, Seattle continues to be in high demand. Amazon continues -- we look at the online job openings, they are still in the 4600 to 4800 range. A lot of the supply continues to move around. I think you will see that supply skewed towards Belleview in 2016. But as far as job growth in Seattle, we see that very strong in 2016. What do we have here, 2.3%, almost 44,000 jobs expected in Seattle. In San Francisco, I would say we didn\u2019t see any softness in the fourth quarter. I think that\u2019s what you ask me. I think that the softness more appeared right around the holidays and as we came into the New Year. I mean when you look back over the past two years in San Francisco, rents in January were up 15% over the previous year and in January of '14 rents were up 13% over the previous year. So you are just starting at a different point and when you look at the makeup of pricing, both in San Francisco and the Peninsula, the urban core is being affected by what's being delivered down there today. But the job growth outlook down the Peninsula, I think are very favorable. I mean every day we are reading about, whether it's Oracle, whether it's Apple, whether it's Airbnb and the Citi. All these large companies continue to lockup office space or land or have already started building other office headquarters. So I don\u2019t see any slowdown in the jobs in San Francisco and I think the softness on the rate that we see today is very concentrated as a result of new supply.","David Neithercut","Yes. And I will just add, we are doing a lease up in San Jose today in which we actually saw acceleration in activity in December from what the averages have been from the prior months starting in September. So I know Seattle is, Dave had mentioned about our property in Odin leasing up extraordinarily well, our [indiscernible] 99 leasing up extraordinarily well. And then as we talked about in Mission Bay, we are leasing up against some competition that\u2019s slowed down a little bit but that\u2019s not going to be an issue. Those units will absorb quickly.","Alex Goldfarb","Okay. And then the second question is for Mark. Mark, a two parter. One, have you now repaid all the associated Archstone secured debt? And then, two, I think in your comments you said that you guys are contemplating a secured issuance at year end. So if that's the case, just a little more color, maybe the joint venture asset or there's some particulars with that why you're going secured versus your normal unsecured route.","Mark Parrell","So, thanks, Alex. So the first question on the Archstone secured debt, except for the tax exempt debt that we inherited, we inherited several $100 million of floating rate, very inexpensive Archstone tax exempt debt. We have repaid all the secured debt that we inherited from that transaction after repayment of the pool that we mentioned in the press release. On the second question, again, it's just an assumption. We haven't done a large secured debt pool in a while. It's also a fairly small borrowing. The unsecured market really has a strong preference now for a larger borrowings and larger borrowers like us. So I wouldn\u2019t go to market on a non-index eligible, $200 million unsecured deal. I would go with something larger like $500 million. So given our relatively modest needs, my sense is we do a secured deal. We haven't done one in a couple of years, a large pool. So it'd probably be good to feel that market out and sort of see what all the terms exactly are as well. But that\u2019s really more a function just besides being relatively small.","Operator","We will now go to Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay","A quick question on your pro forma exposure. Do you have that by market, assuming the Starwood transaction and the contemplated $2 billion of dispositions?","Mark Parrell","Yes. And we have actually added that Wes. Those properties that we have under construction sort of on a stabilized basis. And it roughly breaks down where on the east coast Boston is about 10%, New York is 19% or 20% or so, and BC about 18%. So just little bit under half on the east coast. And then around 9% or so percent in Seattle, about 20% in San Francisco and 25% throughout the three markets in Southern California. So LA, Orange County and San Diego. So a little bit more than half on the west coast. And again that\u2019s after that Starwood, after everything else we are contemplating selling and putting on line and stabilizing all that is currently under development.","Wes Golladay","Okay. And then for the first quarter do you guys have the NOI expectations for the quarter excluding the NOI earned from dispositions. So sort of a core NOI expectation for the quarter?","Mark Parrell","That\u2019s a pretty heavy level of detail. We will give it a word. I mean I think we would suggest that same store NOI for the first quarter of 2016 would be approximately $400 million and that goes into the $1.6 billion I quoted earlier. And that number goes up throughout the year so it's a little below $400 million in the first quarter and ends up being above it, obviously. And then you have got lease up income which in the first quarter might be $10 million to $15 million and by the end of the year is more like $20 million. But again, I think we are getting into a great deal of precision at this point and it will certainly be variability.","Wes Golladay","Okay. Thanks for taking a stab at that. Last one, when you look at DC, how do you see that market playing out throughout the year? Do you plan to get more aggressive during peak leasing season this year versus last year of for the renewals?","David Neithercut","Well, I guess I would say that you have seen all renewals gradually increase over the last two or three years. I think two years ago we did a three, last year we did a four, this year we are tracking at a five. But really what will be the catalyst for DC is, we are moving the pricing pressure on new leases. I think once people get to a place that they are comfortable with, that\u2019s close proximity to where they work and the amenities that they enjoy outside, they tend to stay. So it's just a matter of getting the new people I the door at a higher rate. And when you look at the distribution of new deliveries, you are going to deliver far more units outside of what we call close in Arlington and the district itself. So I think the stars were lined to start seeing better performance come from our DC portfolio.","Operator","We will now go to Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Tayo Okusanya","Just a quick two parter around guidance. On the lower end of guidance and the assumptions behind it, is it safe to say that that scenario is strictly based on the outlook of there's a recession in the U.S.? Or is that kind of more behind that lower end of guidance? And then on the other side of the equation, is there any scenario you can think about where you could actually end up doing better than guidance, similar to what happened in 2015?","David Neithercut","So when we put guidance together and it isn't a vast difference this year, what we do here Tayo is we think about the NOI range would give us on either side. And then we think about our acquisitions and dispositions which are usually, we know them within a certain, fairly close tolerance. The lower end of that range is only accessible if dispositions were accelerated. We do not get there from our NOI numbers and as David Santee has indicated, we have no reason to believe we will be anywhere below our NOI guidance range. So I would tell you we only get to $3 if we announce next quarter that we have sold a lot of what is in process now, very quickly. So that really is the way you get to the bottom of that range. It isn't because we contemplated recession in our numbers.","And I will just take this opportunity to go a little bit further and talk about the trend of FFO by quarter because we have given you a guidance midpoint of $0.75 for the first quarter. And that will go up we think modestly every quarter and will be slightly over 80 by the time you get to the fourth quarter. So as you look forward, it isn't the same sharp increase you are used to seeing from us because there is some dilution. But I think at the end you will still see a number, $0.80 or so, by the fourth quarter and probably a little bit higher.","Tayo Okusanya","Okay. And then on the other end of the spectrum, when you kind of think about opportunities to outperform guidance?","David Neithercut","Well, that would come from dispositions being delayed and NOI either from lease-ups or from same store doing considerably better than our current expectations.","Operator","We will now go to Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Michael Bilerman","It's Michael Bilerman. Mark, that's exactly what I wanted to ask you in terms of the run rate. So, effectively you're going to end the year, let's call it, 320, 325 on an annualized basis. When you take out the special dividend your multiple would have contracted relative to when you announced the Starwood deal. So, there clearly is some uncertainty in the marketplace when people see a headline relative to what the underlying valuation really is. And while your dividend is going down, you're actually increasing your yield on a post-dividend basis as well, by 20-25 basis points. So, hopefully when people shift through it and start thinking about where your multiple is on a post-dividend basis it would clear itself up, right?","Mark Parrell","Agreed in every respect.","Michael Bilerman","And then the second question I was going to ask was just related to New York and the Upper West Side, and the Trump buildings. Clearly there's a lot of Trump news over the last number of months. I'm just curious whether that has had any effect, both positive and negative, potentially, as he supports New York values, on your buildings and any leasing activity there.","David Neithercut","Who? Michael, here is what it is, and it will be what it is for a while, would be my guess. It's interesting to sort of watch and I will tell you that I don\u2019t think anybody who is visiting our properties particularly cares and just it is what it is.","Operator","There are no other questions at this time.","David Neithercut","Great. Well, thank you all for your time today. We look forward to visiting with you all as the year progresses.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation."],"8672":["Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) Q2 2015 Earnings Conference Call July 29, 2015 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Marty McKenna - IR","David Neithercut - President and CEO","David Santee - EVP and COO","Mark Parrell - EVP and CFO","Analysts","Nick Joseph - Citigroup","Jeff Spector - Bank of America","Nick Yulico - UBS","John Kim - BMO Capital Markets","Alex Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill","Dan Oppenheim - Zelman & Associates","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors","Derek Bower - Evercore ISI","Drew Babin - Robert W.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Marty McKenna. Please go ahead.","Marty McKenna","Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's second quarter 2015 results. Our featured speakers today are David Neithercut, our President and CEO, David Santee, our Chief Operating Officer, and Mark Parrell, our CFO.","Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Law. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. And now I'll turn the call over to David Neithercut.","David Neithercut ","Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us for our call today.","As reported in last night's earnings release, our teams across the country continue to do a really great job, achieving 4.9% growth in same-store revenue in the second quarter, and 5% same-store revenue growth for the first half of the year.","This strong performance was driven primarily by increases in rental rate, and the continuation of increased occupancy levels first experienced toward the end of last year. There's no doubt that we continue to enjoy very strong apartment demand across our core markets, despite elevated levels of new supply.","This demand's being driven by the powerful combination of favorable demographics, an improving economy and good job growth, which create new households and millennials to have a high propensity to rent housing, and wish to do so in 24\/7 cities across the country that have very high costs of single family home ownership. So in a nutshell, business remains very, very good. We're pleased with how our primary leasing season unfolded.","We're pleased with our results year-to-date, and our outlook for the year. We're pleased with what we're seeing in the markets in which we operate, and with the assets we own in those markets. And we're extremely confident that fundamentals will continue to deliver above trend performance for many years to come. So to discuss a bit more about our markets, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, David Santee.","David Santee","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. As we discussed during our Q1 call in April, the jobs-driven surge in apartment demand that materialized last summer continues to fuel superior operating results, in spite of elevated deliveries across most of our markets.","As expected, the 100 basis points of occupancy gain we enjoyed in Q1 across our core portfolio continued throughout Q2, setting the stage for results that were better than expected, and providing an operational springboard as we moved into peak leasing season.","On our most recent call, we said that the strength that we saw in Q4 gave us the confidence to extend renewal increase offers for Q1 that resulted in renewal growth rates not seen since Q1 of 2012. Today, we are pleased to say that this trend continues throughout Q2, and we achieved a portfolio renewal growth rate of 7.2%, the highest growth rate since implementing our new platform in early 2008. I am pleased to say that this trend continues, with July on the books at 7.1% and August already at a 7%, which will continue to grow throughout the month.","Additionally, the percentage of residents who chose to renew with us was virtually unchanged from the previous two years at 53%, which also contributed to our combined Q2 renewal and new lease rate growth of 5.8%. New lease space rents continue to average 5% year-over-year for the quarter, and improved to 5.5% for much of July. Turnover increased to 14.5% from 14.1% quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by affordability. However, factoring in residents transferring to another apartment within the same community, year-to-date annualized turnover is down 30 basis points from 2014.","Home buying at 12.5% of move-outs remains in check across many of our markets, increasing from 776 units in Q2 a year ago to 1,914 this quarter, with the incremental increase being driven by Denver and Seattle. As high velocity rent growth continues to drive many of the West Coast markets, we experienced 180 basis point increase in percentage of move-outs due to rent being too expensive. However, the line at the door remains long, as demand measured by our online e-leads increased 17% in Q2, versus Q2 of 2014. The resulting applicants that chose to rent from this pool of inquiries also had the highest percentage of 720-plus FICO scores out of the last eight quarters, with 90% of all applicants being auto-approved.","Now, touching briefly on the health of our markets and our three buckets of revenue growth, San Francisco, Denver, Seattle, Los Angeles, Orange County and South Florida all make up the plus 5% revenue growth bucket listed in order of year-to-date revenue growth. San Diego, New York and Boston remain in a 3% to 5%, with Boston teetering, and DC in a bucket by itself, at a positive 40 to 80 basis points. The color remains the same, and the picture is bright across all of our markets.","We're halfway through a year of elevated deliveries across most of our markets. People of all ages and companies of all types continue to move to the city, as the generational shift in lifestyle preferences continues to take root. Not just in our core markets, but in cities all across the nation.","Broad-based job growth is driving increased absorption and record lease-ups, and for all these reasons we are confident in delivering on our increased revenue guidance. Now [blowing right on the horn], Seattle continues to absorb units at a rapid pace, with 25 new jobs being created in the central business district every day. As expected, the northern suburbs followed by Bellevue are delivering the strongest revenue growth. However, many central business districts and Belham [ph] Capital Hill communities are beginning to show signs of acceleration as delivery of new units are absorbed. Strong earnings performance announced by Amazon last week will certainly continue to drive positive momentum in the downtown markets","San Francisco continues to suffer from a housing shortage, as evidenced by year-over-year new lease rents which are up 13% versus same week last year. San Francisco continues to be a key driver in our revised revenue guidance. Southern Cal continues to be solid, with LA County leading the way in this broad-based economic recovery, with only small pockets of disruption due to new lease-ups.","Concentrations of new deliveries in the Irvine area, and lower than expected job growth caused Orange County to take a back seat to the growing excitement and investment into the revitalization efforts in downtown LA, and a multi-year development of Silicon Beach.","Boston continues to perform as expected, with virtually no pricing power in the downtown financial district. Outer sub markets continue to perform at or above trend, as new development is virtually nonexistent. New York Metro continues to add a steady pace of new jobs, and Manhattan assets show strong demand and rent growth. However, Brooklyn is feeling the effects of concentrated deliveries, and we would expect the same to occur later in the year on the Jersey waterfront.","DC continues to bump along the bottom, but with encouraging job growth numbers that are above the national average. As pockets of new deliveries come online in the South Alexandria and Rockville areas resident growth has deteriorated, while submarkets that have completed deliveries are on the mend. Our RBC corridor submarket remains the most challenged, with year-to-date revenue growth of minus 1.2%. While we are only halfway through our 13,000-plus deliveries expected this year, we still expect our DC Metro portfolio to deliver slightly positive revenue growth for the full year.","Expenses for the quarter were in line with expectations. Real estate taxes, which account for 36% of total expense, remain unchanged at 5.07%. Maintenance and building expenses remain elevated, as a result of the storms in Q1, which are offset by significant savings in energy costs year-to-date. As a result, full year expense growth will be in the range of the midpoint of our revised guidance.","Demand for apartments in great locations is exceeding even our best case scenarios. With a strong jobs outlook and a generational shift in home ownership, apartment fundamentals are better than any other time in our history. With deliveries across almost all of our core markets declining in 2016, and the belief that urban lifestyle preferences will continue its trend, some believe that many cities across the country are significantly underhoused to meet the growing demands of all age cohorts, creating a road map for continued above trend growth for the foreseeable future. David?","David Neithercut","Thanks, David. On the transaction side, we were able to acquire one asset in the second quarter, which remains the only asset acquired in the first half of the year, and remains so year-to-date. We briefly mentioned this acquisition in the first quarter call, which was a 202-unit apartment property in Boston that we acquired for $131 million at a low 4 cap rate. ","I've mentioned on several of our recent calls just how difficult it is for us to acquire assets today, given the very strong bid for multifamily assets from many different segments of the investment community. As a result, we've reduced our expectations for acquisitions this year to $350 million. ","Obviously, with only $131 million of acquisitions in the first half of the year, this means we will have to find another $220 million of deals before the year is up, and I'll have to admit that they're not on our radar at the present time. So we've got our work cut out for us for the balance of the year to achieve that goal. On the disposition side, we did sell three residential assets in the second quarter, along with the medical office building in Boston. ","The three multi-family assets were all in Orlando, and represented our last remaining assets there, so we have now totally exited that marketplace. These assets averaged 14 years of age, and were sold at a weighted average cap rate of 6%, and unleveraged weighted average IRR of 8.7% inclusive of indirect management costs. We calculate the weighted average buyer cap rate at about 5.4% on those purchases. ","As discussed also on our most recent call, in the second quarter we sold a 41-year-old, 193,000 square foot medical office building in Boston for $123.5 million or $639 per square foot and a mid-4% cap rate. Located next to Mass General, this asset was acquired as part of our Charles River Park investment 16 years ago. And with the current demand for healthcare assets, we saw great opportunity to dispose of it, and trade into the recently completed multifamily property in Boston, with far more upside in both earnings and NAV growth going forward.","Disposition guidance for the year has been reduced modestly to $450 million, and so there's no misunderstanding, the medical office building sale is included in this number. This means that we expect to sell less than $100 million over the remainder of the year. We're currently under contract to hit this number, and our disposition guidance will likely change only if we can find more opportunity to reinvest disposition proceeds, which as I noted previously will be a tough task given the competition for assets today.","In the quarter, we commenced construction on one small development project in Washington, DC, where we're building 174 units for $73.2 million at an expected yield on cost at today's rents in the mid 5%s. This deal is in the Mt. Vernon triangle market directly across the street from our 425 Mass Avenue property, and will be delivered in the second half of 2017, which we think will be a very good time to bring new product to the marketplace. This start brings year-to-date starts to $377 million, with the potential to start as much as [$460 million] of new developments for the full year.","Similar to the acquisition market, there's a lot of capital chasing development opportunities, and land pricing has increased significantly. As a result, and as noted in our last call, we're not acquiring land for new development at the same rate we're commencing construction on existing sites held in inventory. So in addition to a reduction in starts this year, we would also expect starts in future years to be down to levels seen over the last several years.","We're also very pleased to have completed our new development on Manhattan's upper west side at Amsterdam and 68th Street in the second quarter. Hopefully, many of you saw this asset in June when we hosted tours during the NAREIT meetings.","And we [indiscernible] showed -- showed on our cover of last night's earnings release. Like most assets priced several years ago and coming online in the current marketplace, we're seeing strong absorption, at rent levels at or above our original expectations, and we currently expect this asset to stabilize in the low 7%s. So I'll now turn the call over to Mark Parrell.","Mark Parrell","Thank you, David. I want to take a few minutes this morning to talk about the revisions we made to our guidance for the full year, as well as discuss our recent debt offerings. In yesterday's release, we revised our guidance for our same-store metrics, as well as for our normalized FFO per share for the year. I want to take a minute now to give you some color.","As David Santee discussed, we continue to enjoy very strong demand for our properties. As a result, we have raised our expectations for our same-store revenues to 4.75% to 5%. Our new midpoint of 4.9% is a 40 basis point improvement from the midpoint we guided you to in our first quarter release, and an 80 basis point improvement from the guidance midpoint we gave you to start the year back in February.","We have also raised our expectation for occupancy for the full year to 96%, which is up slightly from the guidance we gave you last quarter. As we have discussed before, we are getting a benefit from both rental rates, and running our portfolio at a higher occupancy level than we have traditionally.","On the expense side, we have narrowed our range to 3% to 3.25%. David Santee talked about the drivers of that activity. Expense growth will be higher in the second half of the year than the first half of the year, due to the more challenging comparable periods. I'd ask you to remember that we posted quarterly expense growth of 0.6% in the third quarter and 2.2% in the fourth quarter of 2014.","So overall, we anticipate annual expense growth for 2015 to be about where we expected at the beginning of the year. We are proud of our strong expense control record, and have posted a five-year compound average growth rate for annual expenses of only plus 1.7%. We now expect NOI for the full year to be between 5.5% and 6%, and we have reset our range for normalized FFO per share for the year to $3.39 to $3.45 per share. At a new midpoint of $3.42 per share, this is a $0.01 per share improvement from our April 2015 guidance.","So I want to break out these details a little bit further for you. Our improved expectation of same-store operating performance should lead to about a $0.02 per share increase in normalized FFO. We also now estimate that interest expense will be about $4 million or $0.01 per share lower than we've previously expected.","And this is due to the smaller amount of debt we will now issue in 2015, and we're just going to issue the $750 million that we already have -- we already put out in May, versus the $950 million we had in our previous guidance. With dispositions now anticipated to exceed acquisitions by $100 million, the excess cash will be applied for now to reduce debt, and will eliminate the need to source additional debt in 2015.","Also, we expect to have higher capitalized interest than our prior guidance, due to a slightly faster pace of development spending than we previously expected. We are also getting a benefit from lower floating rates on our successful new commercial paper program. On a negative side, we'll see about $0.02 per share more transaction dilution than we expected. And that's primarily as a result of our lower expectations for acquisitions. ","As we stated in our release, and as David Neithercut just described, we have lowered our expectations for acquisitions to $350 million for the year, and that's down from $500 million, and we have now assumed that any of these acquisitions that we do occur very late in the year. To sum it up, the improvement of approximately $0.02 per share from our better than previously expected NOI, and a pickup of about $0.01 per share from lower total interest expense, will be offset by about $0.02 per share in increased dilution from slower and less acquisition activity. ","And that will leave us at the end of the day, with a $0.01 net improvement to our annual normalized FFO guidance at the midpoint. ","So now onto the balance sheet for a moment. In May, we were pleased to successfully execute on two simultaneous debt offerings. We issued $300 million of 30 year unsecured bonds at an all-in effective rate of about 4.55%, and this was our second 30-year debt issuance in the last year. ","We also issued $450 million of 10-year paper, and that was at an all-in effective rate of 3.81%. Both these issuances were very well-received in the market. We saw tremendous demand, especially from large money market funds, desiring to invest in bonds from a high quality borrower like Equity Residential that issues larger and more liquid tranches. ","Over the last two years, we have aggressively taken advantage of historically low long-term debt rates, and now have about 10% of our debt maturing in about 30 years. The weighted average maturity of our debt at about 8.3 years is among the longest in the sector, and matches up well with the long hold periods we expect for our new better quality assets.","Our credit metrics are strong, and the balance sheet is in excellent shape. At the end of 2015, we expect to have about $460 million of outstanding commercial paper or revolver borrowings, and have availability under our revolver of slightly less than $2 billion. So Keith, we're now ready for the question and answer period. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we can take our first question from Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please go ahead. ","Nick Joseph","Thanks. You highlighted the strong operating fundamentals and we've seen the strong growth. But recently, we've seen suburban sub markets outperform urban. So I'm wondering if you think that trend will continue, and what we need to see before urban starts to outperform suburban again? ","David Neithercut","I'm fascinated at this interest of the investment community, Nick, in what happened over the last 90 days. We remain quite convinced that -- and I think history has demonstrated quite clearly, that over extended time periods, the higher density urban markets have outperformed the suburbs. And when we think about performance, we mean about overall total return. ","So from time to time, will different assets or different sub markets quote, unquote, outperform just in terms of rental growth? I suppose. But I think, over an extended time period, I think the total return on the higher density assets will do better. I think history has quite clearly demonstrated that. ","Nick Joseph","Thanks. Then just in terms of the development pipeline, it looks like you decided to add air conditioning to three of the developments which increased the total cost by about 6% in aggregate. Can you talk about that decision, and then what the impact is on the projected yields for those projects? ","David Neithercut","When those deals were conceived in San Francisco and Seattle, air conditioning was not really considered to be necessary for that type of product. But as more product has been brought to market there, and the expectations of luxury product have changed modestly, we came to the decision that we should add air conditioning. And was better to do so now under construction, than wait until these assets were completed. We think we'll get enhanced rents for having done so, but at the end of the day we think that they will modestly decrease the sort of stabilized returns, but believe over the long term hold, and over an extended total return on these investments that we'll at least break-even on that incremental investment or do better on it. ","Because we think it's the right thing to do in those marketplaces today, that those residents of those markets have an expectation of that air conditioning, and that was something for us to do. So we believe we'll get an increased rent. It'll be modestly, just a few basis points dilutive on a stabilized basis, but we think it will be long-term accretive for the asset. ","Nick Joseph","Thanks. And just to remind me, what is the stabilized -- what is the targeted stabilized yield for those assets? ","David Neithercut","Well, generally those deals are in the 5s and 6s. So it would just be a few basis points off of those levels. ","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please go ahead. ","Jeff Spector","Good morning. David, obviously some very positive trends and comments about the foreseeable future, and I know, of course, you're not providing 2016 guidance. But anything we can read into on your thoughts for 2016 on rent growth at this point? ","David Neithercut","Well, I guess, you can read into them what you care to read into them. I think in my quote, in the press release, my comments today, David's comments, we all feel very bullish, continue to be very bullish on the overall demand for housing, particularly in the high density 24\/7 urban markets in which we've been focused. The demographic picture is very powerful. The job picture very good. We expect supply to be down in 2016, over 2015. So you can read into that, and we think 2016 which should be a very good year.","Jeff Spector ","Okay. And then on the acquisition front, the Boston unit acquisition. At a low 4% cap rate, you've discussed how the environment is tough to do deals. How -- can you just talk to us a little bit more about that particular deal at a low 4% cap rate, versus I guess, other things you're seeing that you're not as comfortable with to execute on?","David Neithercut ","Yes, we think that that was -- probably become probably our best asset in Boston. We believe that the lease-up by the seller had not been done ideally. We had the opportunity to maybe fix that a little bit. But we also looked at it as a trade if you will, with the sale of the medical office building also in Boston. And by trading the one for a mid-4%, and buying the other at a low 4%, it was a good trade and a good capital allocation decision.","Assets today are trading in low 4%s, and 3%s in many instances in some markets. And we're just not -- we are finding other people being far more aggressive in acquiring those assets, and frankly, we just think every single day away from us, people are demonstrating the value of our portfolio, and demonstrating the true NAV of our Company. And that's okay.","Jeff Spector ","Okay. Thanks. And then last, on the development yields, you described DC, I guess mid-5%s, the rest mid-5%s, mid-6%s. Obviously, you're comfortable with those yields, with facing potentially higher rates over the next year or two. Is it that you're just -- you're not comfortable below that? I mean, are you still comfortable with the 5%s? I mean, at this point, of course, you have to execute. How are you thinking about those yields?","David Neithercut","Well, we think that -- we're building at 5%s and 6%s in markets, that trades in the 3%s and 4%s. So we're fine with that. I think what you're seeing our actions today, is unwillingness to continue to buy new land sites at prices today, in which we believe development yields are in the 4%s.","So we're comfortable in the 5%s and 6%s, again for the high density sort of urban locations that we've been focused on. So you'll see us continue to work through our existing land inventory, but you will see us, not likely adding a lot of new land at this pricing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with UBS. Please go ahead.","Nick Yulico ","Thanks. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the supply picture. I think you said 2016, you see deliveries easing up a bit in your markets. Yet the June starts number for multi-family from the Census Bureau was higher than recently. So could you just talk about the supply picture as you see it today?","David Neithercut ","Sure. I mean, starts in 2015 are not going to result in deliveries in 2016. So as we look at 2016, we see -- and again, let me just sort of be clear. We're focusing on our markets only, and we track projects of 100 units or more, or even smaller within close proximity to our existing assets across our markets.","Many of you have toured each of our properties over the years, and have met the professional teams we've got across these markets that are tracking this for us. We're currently tracking more than 1,700 units across all these markets.","So as we track what will be delivered in 2016 in the markets that we're focused on, we believe could be competitive to our own product, we're seeing a significant reduction in new deliveries. And as we look at what is either under construction for 2017 delivery, and what we think could yet be started that could be delivered in 2017, we see levels around 2016 or a modest increase to that. So again, still well below the 2015s. Now, beyond that, who knows?","We certainly are cognizant of some of those statistics that have been reported about permits, and we question how many of those will turn into starts. We note in Brooklyn, for instance, there was an elevated level of permits. But it was on so many projects, that the average unit per property was about 50 units, and disbursed over the entire borough of Brooklyn.","We're not quite sure how impactful that will be on some of our properties. So we're watching the stuff. And we'll be cautious about 2017 and 2018, but as we look at 2016 we see, again a meaningful reduction across our markets. And again, as we mentioned, continued very strong demand.","Nick Yulico ","That's helpful. Thanks, David. One other question, you talked about acquisitions becoming more difficult, or as difficult I guess, as they've been. It sounds like you're also going to maybe start -- some less in the development next year.","Does this point to a situation then, where the Board starts thinking about, if you don't have as many capital needs to have even higher dividend growth, and even more of your earnings being paid out for dividends?","David Neithercut","I think the Board thinks about all these things. I think we've been very good stewards of capital, and very good capital allocators, and we'll be discussing all those things. And again, a reduction in acquisition activity by us, or a reduction in land take-downs and development is not an indication in any way of our belief that fundamentals aren't going to remain very strong for years to come. It's just pricing has got very expensive, and yields very low. We're happy with what we own, and don't believe we need to buy assets at these prices. And to your point, we'll consider lots of different options for capital allocation, given those dynamics.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","Good morning. David Santee mentioned in his prepared remarks, the generational shift you're seeing in urban demand, and not just in your markets, but across the nation. Are any of these cities becoming more interesting for you to enter at this point?","David Neithercut","Any cities that we're not currently in?","John Kim","Yes.","David Neithercut","I would tell you no. As we -- and we've done a lot of work in looking at what's going on in -- across other markets that we don't currently operate in. And we just find that they don't stream well on all the important sort of things that we want to consider. Probably one of them, which is the most damming if you will is, the cost of single family homes as a multiple of income.","There are markets in the country, Chicago, Minneapolis, others in which there's some very solid 24\/7 cities, very exciting things happening in these cities, with millennial growth downtown, et cetera, et cetera. But as you look at single family home price as a multiple of income, they become very challenging to think of those being good long-term, and I want to stress long-term investment markets. I'm not suggesting you can't make money in those markets but I think one must do so with more of a trading mentality, and less of a long-term market. So we're focused on where we're at, and have no intention at the present time of deviating from that.","John Kim","Okay. And then a question on development yields. AvalonBay mentioned on their call yesterday that they're seeing higher achieved yields than originally projected. I am wondering if you're seeing a similar dynamic in your projects, excluding the ones you reconfigured?","David Neithercut","Absolutely. Anything that was priced a few years ago, land priced a few years ago, construction costs locked in a few years ago, are outperforming one's original expectation. I think that sort of almost goes without saying, but it just becomes more and more difficult, as pricing gets more costly. So certainly, anything being delivered today is at least achieving your expectations. Certainly, it's exceeding your expectations on market rents, at the time in which you underwrote it, and commenced construction. So we're very pleased with what we've got in the pipeline. I think we made a lot of money on that pipeline. The question is for us, is at what price or what cost you continue to probably reload that pipeline, and we've decided to take our foot off the gas.","John Kim","So you're not replenishing the land as much as you had in the past on developments? Are you also seeing higher construction costs as well that are outpacing the rental increase?","David Neithercut","Well, you're just -- well, I mean, by definition, yields are coming down. So you're having costs go up more quickly than rental rates. The product that we delivered, or started coming out of the recession is delivering 8%, 9%. And then several years after that we're sort of delivering 7s and 6s, and then 5s and 6s. And I said I think the product that we'd look at starting today, at pricing that we see coming to the market would be in the 4s. And so, we've made a lot of money on the product that we have already started, and have delivered or will deliver soon. But we've just elected not to start construction on projects today that we think would have yields of today's rents in the 4s.","John Kim","Okay. And then a final question on downtown LA. It's been a very strong market for you, but there's a lot of new supply coming to the market. Is this one of the markets where you may look to replenish the pipeline, and maybe protect your market share?","David Neithercut","We're not about protecting market share. We'll leave that to the automobile business. We do have a land site in LA, a terrific land site in LA, that we could start sometime in 2016. But we do like downtown. It's really one of the best-performing sort of markets. There is new supply there, but that new supply brings more density, and brings more restaurants and more things to do. I mean, it's kind of a self-fulfilling sort of cycle. We like downtown and we look forward to working on the project that -- the land site we already own in downtown LA that could start construction soon.","Operator","We'll go next to Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Alex Goldfarb ","Hey, good morning out there. David, just a question for you. You guys were vocal at NAREIT, you're vocal on the call, about the challenges of acquiring, both existing as well as land sites. And yet this apartment cycle seems to be going on longer than most people thought. As well as this year, it's got a second wind. So how do you balance the two between the cycle being longer, so therefore there's more opportunity to get a return on whatever you invest today, versus the fact that yields continue to come down, and are, as you point out, in the 4s even for development. How do you marry those two, and does that mean we should see EQR remain on the sidelines as long as yields are down where they are? Or do you think that something will break in the investment part that will make pricing come back to be attractive during -- yet while the cycle still continues to grow?","David Neithercut ","Well, I guess, you marry it, Alex, by just being happy that you're long, right? This pricing is -- it may be difficult for us to rationalize new investments, but it just validates everything we've been doing over the last 10 years. So when you're already long, this is a high class problem, right? Is it possible that with these elevated new deliveries, there will be opportunities to buy assets at prices that make sense relative to taking construction risk? Perhaps.","We don't have to buy. We don't have to develop in order to kind of create value. I think the single biggest value creating tool we've got is David Santee, and his teams across the country. They have delivered unbelievable bottom line results for us, and have created enormous value out of the existing portfolio.","So we admit that we continue to have assets that we rather sell, we'd like to sell if we could. But it's only if we can find the reinvestment opportunity for those assets. Absent those opportunities, we're happy to sort of sit tight, and operate what we have. We acknowledge that doing so is modestly more dilutive this year, than what we had originally forecasted.","But we're quite content to allocate capital in the best way we sort of see fit, the opportunities present themselves. And with George and his team, I tell you they turn over every bush and rock, and beating every bush looking for a product, and remain optimistic that we will find stuff we can buy this year, at a little better yield, by maybe taking on some risk that we can uniquely manage, and we'll be comfortable managing. We'll see. Not the first time in our history.","It's probably the sixth time or so in our 20 some odd year history, in which we've had relatively little transaction activity. And I guess, I'll tell you, that at the end of those lulls, we've always come back strong, and have created a lot of value in doing so. So we don't worry about marrying these things. It is what it is, and we're quite comfortable with our plan, and think that there will be opportunities down the road, and we'll patiently wait for them.","Alex Goldfarb ","Okay. And then, earlier in the call during the MD&A, you guys mentioned move-outs. But I wasn't clear, was that specific to one market? Or was that portfolio-wide the increase in move-outs? And if it was portfolio-wide, which markets were you seeing that mostly in?","David Santee ","This is David. Basically move-outs, the increase amounted to 600 for the quarter, and it's really broken down by three categories, half of the 600 were due to affordability, 150 were home buying, and the other 150 were transfers. So that's across the entire portfolio.","Alex Goldfarb ","Okay. And just finally for Mark Parrell. Anything else from Archstone out there? Any other either positives or negatives in the -- or are you guys totally done with anything Archstone related?","Mark Parrell ","Alex, it's Mark. Yes, there isn't a lot left. We've really wound down all the Archstone related joint venture activities. There's a little bit left, and we give you some disclosure of that towards the end of the preferred issuance. But it's really quite minimal. There could be minimal lawsuit costs, and master lease costs and stuff that run through for a little while. But I don't see anything significant on the horizon.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Oppenheim with Zelman & Associates.","Dan Oppenheim ","Thanks very much. I was wondering in terms of the move-outs and the affordability driven ones -- [indiscernible] up in the third quarter just based on more expirations coming through during the quarter, plus the way you're pushing rents here.","Is there anything in terms of the -- what you're doing with the rent? Do you think it's sticker shock in terms of the affordability, or it is some negotiation where you might be able to manage the turnover a bit, and how are you looking at that overall?","David Neithercut ","I guess, we don't -- first of all, we don't manage to occupancy. We manage to an acceptable level of inventory to coming at it. We have, as we discussed before, we did a lot of work on moving a lot of the Archstone expirations that were kind of out of whack. So on average, we moved probably 32% of our leases from January through May, into June, July, August, so where the rents are higher.","I mean, at 300 affordability move-outs across 400 properties across three months, I don't see any major concern there. A lot of that remains in San Francisco, where rents are still -- renewals are still double-digit. But as I said, there's just a long line waiting at the door to backfill those. As long as that's the case, we're not concerned.","Dan Oppenheim ","Okay. I guess, just relating to that in terms of the long lines or the duration of the cycle, in terms of the hesitancy in terms of pursuing acquisitions here, if you think that the long line persists for a while, would you be content to sort of try to find something here? So if we look back over time, we've had people make large acquisitions and talk about having a proud history of dilutive acquisitions, and then those turn out well, because the cycle continues. How do you think about that now in terms of managing it?","David Neithercut","Well, I guess, the acquisitions are funded by dispositions. And so these are trades for us, and we're just unwilling to make the trade. And again, it just validates, I think that the value in our portfolio, and validates everything we've done to reposition this portfolio over the last 10 or so years. So if pricing is very aggressive in the urban core assets we'd like to own, we're already long in those markets and that's a good thing. We're just not willing to make the trade of the assets we want to sell for the relative value pricing of the assets that people are buying today. We think that that could become more attractive as -- based upon the elevated -- the new supply that we talked about a little bit. There may be more attractive trading opportunities for us a little bit down the road.","But again, the fact that there are people out there willing to pay 3 cap rates for some of this product, I think says a great -- attributes a lot of value to our portfolio, and all that we've done. And we don't feel we need to continue to chase that pricing. Once you're already long, you're in good shape.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Tayo Okusanya","Yes, good morning. Just along the lines of acquisitions, could you just talk a little bit about which markets you're seeing the most competition for assets for? And then specifically, who seems to be bidding assets up, so much to the point where some deals are just not attractive to you anymore?","David Neithercut","There's a lot of institutional players out there that are buying assets. Big pension fund advisors, we're seeing life insurance companies, we're seeing some foreign capital. It's happening across all markets. I don't think that there's limited to just any one.","You're seeing some people on land for condos, for instance, makes it difficult to rationalize multi-family rental on land. But in terms of existing sort of stabilized deals, big institutional players, domestically and foreign. See very little REIT activity. I think we're not the only ones who are suggesting that that transaction activity may be reduced kind of going forward, but very much domestic and foreign institutional investors.","Tayo Okusanya ","Got it. And then, with the slowdown in acquisitions and development, how do you kind of -- how do you offset that from an internal perspective, just to drive your historical earnings growth levels?","David Neithercut","Well, again, let's understand about just kind of cash flow. Acquisition is really funded by dispositions, and our development kind of funded from free cash flow, and we've got development to fund over the next several years. And a lot of the growth, I mean, the lion's share of the growth, and I think more growth from us than from others is really being delivered, as I said from the property portfolio, the kind work that David Santee and his team have done.","Drilling down submarket by submarket, asset by asset, we believe that we're outperforming many others. And in terms of bottom line performance and putting whatever multiple you want on that creates that incremental value, is significant, and we think is a much better risk-adjusted return, than aggressively chasing development at these prices or new acquisitions. So as I said earlier, this is not the first time\/ I think there's been a pause for us in this activity, and every single time coming out of these pauses, we've been loaded for bear, and able to take advantage of a great deal of opportunity. So we're content to sit and wait and see what happens.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vincent Chao","Hey. I know we've had a lot of questions on acquisitions here. Clearly, it's a tough time to be buying. You've said you don't really have anything in the queue right now, and anything that's in the guidance is going to be back end weighted. Just curious why even leave the 220 in there. I know it's reduced, but given the conditions, why not just take that out of there as part of the guidance? But two, if for whatever reason you can't find deals that make sense, I guess what would be the sort of most natural use of the 220 that would have gone towards acquisitions? Would that be sort of debt repayment? I know you've got some stuff due in the early part of '16.","David Neithercut","Yes, so I'll answer the first part of the question, and Mark can answer the second. I guess, what we've told you is that we reduced the acquisition guidance and have told you that it will be backend loaded and challenging. So I think that's sort of giving you the pieces of the puzzle the same way.","We could take it down and tell you there's a chance we'll buy more or we'll tell you it's up and it will be tough to buy. So we figured you can get there on your own with the information we've given you. And as relates to use of proceeds, Mark?","Mark Parrell ","Yes. So just to be absolutely clear, we put it in so late in the year, that if the [$220 million] came through it would only be worth about $900,000 of FFO to us. So if it doesn't occur, we'll use it to pay down debt. We'll have, as I said a $460 million line balance, so we'll pay the line or the CP program down. That is not a particularly accretive use of funds.","But again, as David Neithercut mentioned a minute ago, it just loads us up and prepares us for when opportunity does arrive. So the use of proceeds will be to pay down the line or the CP program in the short-term and in the long term to fund our investment activity, as we have done at other points in the cycle.","Vincent Chao ","Okay. And just one other question on the sort of the demand you're seeing. So move-outs are up, but you've got a lot of folks waiting to get in. Just curious if you have any stats on how the household income has grown on your move-ins say, this year versus last?","Mark Parrell ","Well, so we use the same qualifier that we used for 20 years. So when you measure the income of those folks coming in, they have to meet that qualifier. So really when you look back over the 12 months which is, we measure the previous 12 months move-ins, the numbers never change.","And then, we have no means to measure incomes of people that have lived with us for three, four or five years. However, I think the important thing is that we have seen a tremendous improvement in the overall credit quality of the people coming in the door with 720-plus FICO scores. In summary, the rent to income will never change, as long as we continue to use the same qualifier.","Vincent Chao ","Right, right. I was more just thinking about the income side. Sounds like whatever rental rate growth you're seeing, you're seeing an equivalent increase in the incomes of the people coming in?","Mark Parrell ","Correct.","Operator","We'll go next to Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors.","David Bragg ","Just to follow up on a key topic on this call. David, you seem to be providing a view on values in absolute terms, but don't you think about it on a relative basis? Are you saying that the spread has widened between coastal, urban assets, where you want to invest in your sources of capital, whether it's Denver or Inland Empire asset sales or equity?","David Neithercut ","Yes, I guess, what I'm saying is that the trade between the sale and the buy has probably widened. And because of that, we're less inclined to make those trades, particularly at the price -- I guess, what I'd say is -- at the stabilized assets in these -- the coastal markets yields, as I said in many instances are in the 3%s.","We're confident that we can manage that spread, or have been confident, and hope we still can yet this year, by trying to find some things to acquire that aren't stabilized assets. But rather assets that have got maybe some lease-up risk, some completion of construction or some other things that might detour an aggressive bid from some of those institutions that will buy stabilized stuff, and provide us with an opportunity to buy something with a little better yield, which would narrow that spread and make a trade make sense for us.","Operator","We'll go next to Derek Bower with Evercore ISI.","Derek Bower ","Great, thanks. Just wanted to circle back on operations. Can you talk about where new and renewals are in July, relative to where they were in 2014, just the spread that you're seeing?","David Neithercut ","So renewals, renewals as far as achieved were 7.2% for the quarter. For quarter two in 2014, we achieved a 5.5%.","Derek Bower ","And then, just how you do those numbers compare to 2014's level?","David Neithercut ","Well, Q2 of 2014 was a 5.5% achieved renewals.","Derek Bower ","Okay. Thanks. And then just knowing you have a tougher comp going into the fourth quarter, but assuming you hit the midpoint of guidance this year, how should we think about the potential earn-in going into next year, relative to the one you had coming into 2015?","David Neithercut ","Well, so Q4 of last year I think we averaged 95.8[%], 95.9[%]. We're probably not going to run the portfolio up to 97[%]. I think if you start leaving rate on the table, once you get up to that point, unless we see continued acceleration in the job growth.","So if we see continued job growth above [250,000] and the formula for apartment demand has changed dramatically relative to home ownership. Then again, I'll just say 97 will be the new 95. I mean, we're not managing to 97. But if we continue to do the same things that we've done year after year, as far as rate optimization and managing inventory, if we achieve 97, then so be it.","Derek Bower","And then, Mark, just lastly, any updated thoughts on timing of the refinancing, the 2016 and 2017 maturities?","Mark Parrell","Sure. We've got a fair amount of debt maturing in those years. We don't now have any guidance, any thought of prefunding that. We will think about that. We will think about hedges as well, which we've done in the past.","So right now, I you would tell you that we're sort of waiting to see the rate climate, and feeling our way through it. But I think we've been pretty proactive in dealing with those maturities. It's about I think a 5.3% rate next year that we get to re-fi to, so I think it will be a pretty accretive refinancing opportunity, and so we will be all over that. But right now, the guidance has no prefunding activities in it at all.","Operator","Our next question comes from Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird.","Drew Babin","Going forward, as it appears dispositions will probably be -- or EQR is likely to become a net disposer over time, given where cap rates are on the acquisition market. And you mentioned that there's foreign demand for assets. Do you think the cap rates on your sales of apartment buildings may actually drift down as we go into '16 and '17, as you start to see maybe once in a lifetime type bids on some of your better assets?","David Neithercut","I'm sorry, I missed -- not sure I got the whole question. Assets -- valuations of the properties that we want to sell?","Drew Babin","Might we see kind of -- as you have already pruned a lot of your non-core assets, might we see some of your future assets, be sort of higher on the quality spectrum at even lower cap rates, versus what you've disposed of to date?","David Neithercut","Yes, but I think what you have a chance of seeing is, we'll begin to sell lesser quality product in more of our core markets, and the possibility and the expectation that that will attract a bid of a better cap rate than that which we've realized in exit markets. So yes, as we work through exit markets, and we'll also sell -- I guess, as we did like the office building in Boston -- we'll sell lesser quality, non-core assets in our core markets. And that's another way in which we're trying to manage the spread between the disposition cap rate and the acquisition cap rate.","Drew Babin","Okay. That's helpful. And back to operations, New York City, Boston and Seattle stand out as markets where, some minor deceleration versus last quarter on the revenue growth front, but also kind of versus your six quarter trailing average. Is there anything going on in those markets? Is it just kind of the supply being a disproportionately weighted towards where you're located? Is it rent fatigue? What are you seeing that might be behind that?","David Neithercut","Well, so let's just take Boston as an example. A lot of the deliveries are probably within a one-mile radius of the financial district. We have six properties in that one-mile radius that delivers 40% of our revenue for the entire portfolio. So that's just an example as we've talked about, when we're going to see some head to head pressure and pricing pressure. And I think you just have such a concentration of properties in such a small area that you just lose pricing power. So in the case of Seattle, probably the same thing, a lot of deliveries in Belltown, downtown, CBD. When you look at the portfolio up in Bellevue -- I'm sorry, north up towards Bothel, Snohomish, those properties are far outperforming the CBDs just because of the magnitude of the deliveries. But still, the portfolio in Seattle is producing very good results.","So I think it's just a matter of time to flush out these elevated deliveries that are very concentrated in some of these markets. No different than DC, where we have 20% of our revenue coming out of the RBC corridor, which is probably -- which is the most negative submarket that we have. So I think over the next year to 18 months as job growth improves, as new deliveries kind of start to dissipate and move kind of back out to the suburbs, I think you'll see the relative strength of these markets return.","Drew Babin","And New York would be a similar story?","David Neithercut","Well, New York is -- Manhattan is fine. I think you just look at our portfolio, and you look at Brooklyn, which is really dragging the portfolio down. We still have assets in the far outer burbs, down near Philadelphia, Fairfield, those are far underperforming. So I think when you break down a portfolio like New York, when you look at core Manhattan assets, those are performing better than expected and above historical trend.","Operator","We'll go next to Neil Malkin with RBC Capital Markets.","Neil Malkin ","Hey, guys. First question. Given that we have been seeing pretty strong job growth for the last several quarters, and just recently we've seen an uptick in household formation, what are your thoughts on as we move forward into 2016, given less supply this year?","And given, that we probably had a breakdown from that 5 to 1 jobs to apartment ratio has probably decreased, that we actually continue to see accelerated or higher levels of rent growth than we have this quarter, which kind of probably took a lot of people by surprise?","David Neithercut ","Well, I guess, we won't give you any sort of numbers. But we've been quite vocal for quite some time that even -- that the levels, elevated levels of new supply that we've experienced over the last several years would not destabilize these markets.","That we were confident that the demand was there to adequately absorb this new supply, and not destabilize these markets. And I mean, to your point, we expect less supply in 2016, and continued good job growth, and the inevitable of income growth that kind of comes with that.","This segment of the population is very interested in living in these high density urban markets. They either value the optionality and flexibility that provides rental housing, or can't afford single family housing in these markets, because it's significantly -- the multiple of those prices in those homes as a multiple of their incomes are significant.","And that's why we continue to suggest, and believe that we're going to have above trend fundamentals for many years to come. So we see it the way that you've just described it, and continue to remain very optimistic about the multifamily business for the foreseeable future.","Neil Malkin ","If I could just add onto that. Given that lag between strong job growth and household formation, if we -- this decoupling continues to happen, do you think there's a good chance second quarter of 2016 would have better rent growth than this quarter?","David Neithercut ","We're not going to give any over-unders on growth that far out. But just suffice it to say, we feel very positive about fundamentals for quite some time.","Neil Malkin ","Okay. Last one from me is, given your comments on development being expensive, sorry, would you look to do things more internally, maybe ramp up redevelopment? Maybe do deeper turns or deeper type of redevelopment, or are there other kind of efficiencies that you could work on to improve organic growth, I guess for David Santee?","David Neithercut ","Well, yes, it's David Neithercut. I want to make sure I just define what we mean by our rehabs, which is really not redevelopment. There are others in our space who talk about redevelopment, as spending $40,000, $60,000, $80,000 a door. What we have done, and what we have accelerated is our rehab business, which I'll have Mark Parrell explain.","Mark Parrell ","Right. We give you a little disclosure on that on page 22. We spend right now about $9,000 per unit. These are usually kitchen and bath freshenings. We generally get a yield in the mid-teens on that, and those have proven to be for us excellent investments.","I do think you'll see that ramp up. We didn't increase our guidance there, because we're still sort of in the formative stages of that. But I would expect we might spend closer to $65 million there, and do a few more of those rehabs.","The cost is trending up for us. Not because cost items are increasing, but the scope of these rehabs are going up. And the places we're doing them, these high-rise units that we now own, just demand a higher level of finish. So you might see us have that number go up a little from $9,000 per unit to $10,000 or $11,000. And I think you'll see more volume there and more spend, because it's a great investment in these very well-located assets that we intend to hold long-term.","We are doing one very significant rehab of an asset in LA. I guess, I will call that a redevelopment. We did take that out of same-store. We mentioned it in prior calls.","We may do another. These are assets that are right on the beach. They're just terrific, we can't replicate them due to zoning requirements. But they do require more in the $40,000 to $50,000 a unit rehab cost, and that includes interiors and exteriors. So I could see us doing more of this sort of stuff, because our assets are so well located now.","Operator","And it appears we have no further questions at this time, so I'll turn the program back over to our presenters for any closing remarks.","David Neithercut","Well, thank you all for your time and interest today. I hope you all enjoy summer, and look forward to seeing many of you in the fall. Have a great day.","Operator","And this does conclude today's program."],"8849":["Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) Q4 2016 Earnings Conference Call February  1, 2017 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Marty McKenna - Investor Relations","David Neithercut - President and Chief Executive Officer","David Santee - Chief Operating Officer","Mark Parrell - Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Juan Sanabria - Bank of America","Nick Joseph - Citi","Nick Yulico - UBS","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors","Rob Stevenson - Janney","Rich Hightower - Evercore","Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Drew Babin - Robert W.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead.","Marty McKenna","Thank you, Ashley. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential\u2019s fourth quarter 2016 results and outlook for 2017. Our featured speakers today are David Neithercut, our President and CEO; David Santee, our Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Parrell, our Chief Financial Officer.","Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.","And now I will turn the call over to David Neithercut.","David Neithercut","Thank you, Marty and good morning everybody. Thank you for joining us for today\u2019s call. 2016 represented the culmination of a very important multiyear process for Equity Residential as we completed the transformation of the company\u2019s portfolio, with the sale of nearly 30,000 apartment units and the return of $4 billion to our shareholders in special dividends in what\u2019s been noted by many as one of the most investor-friendly transaction seen in years. Unfortunately, 2016 also brought about an abrupt downturn slowdown in apartment fundamentals as new supply entered the market at a time of slowing job growth, particularly in the growth of higher paying jobs. And as a result, after 5 years of extraordinarily strong fundamentals, our same-store revenue growth in 2016 came in at 3.7%, down from the 5.1% growth delivered in 2015 and more in line with long-term historical trends.","Now as noted in last night\u2019s press release, we expect revenue growth to continue to weaken in 2017 with nearly all of our markets expected to deliver same-store revenue growth for this year below 2016 actual performance with Washington, DC being the lone exception. Weakness in fundamentals is not the result of much of any change in the underlying demand for rental housing across our portfolio. On the contrary, occupancy remains strong today and is expected to moderate only slightly through the year. Turnover across all markets, when excluding same property movement actually improved last year, dropping to 48%, a 100 basis point improvement over 2015 and consistent with our expectations for 2017. And move-outs to buy single-family homes remains a non-factor in our high cost of housing markets.","Furthermore, while our markets have experienced a slowdown in the growth of high-income jobs, the absolute number of new high-income jobs remains relatively strong. And perhaps more importantly, for the first time since the recovery began, there are abundant signs of wage growth occurring in all industries across the country, which obviously is a very good sign for the apartment business. So as we look ahead to what we see as peak deliveries in many of our markets this year, our teams across the country will work very hard, delighting our existing residents and extending their stay with us, while welcoming prospects and turning them into new residents. And we remain extraordinarily excited about the long-term outlook for our business, portfolio and the company.","So with that said, I will let David Santee go into more detail about our outlook for 2017.","David Santee","Okay. Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Before I jump into the numbers, I\u2019d like to first acknowledge the commitment and efforts of all of our employees over the past year. While results were certainly bumpy, it only strengthened our resolve to do better. I know our teams are keenly aware of the challenges before us. And I am 100% confident that they will go above and beyond to deliver in \u201817.","While markets have now returned to pre-2014, \u201815 seasonality, there continues to be strong demand for high-quality apartments in great locations and occupancy remains above historic norms. Today, I will focus my comments on the assumptions that make up our full year forecast on a market-by-market basis. I will provide you with lease-over-lease growth rates, expected renewal rates achieved, any material changes in occupancy and the percent of contribution to same-store revenue growth that together get you to the midpoint of our full year guidance. I will also discuss what we see in the markets today and provide color on the new deliveries and how much or little we expect them to impact us based on our geographic footprint. I can address any 2016 questions in the session \u2013Q&A session afterwards.","So I will start with the markets that we expect to have the most positive impact on our 2017 revenue growth and finish with New York, which will have a negative impact on our performance this year. Los Angeles will contribute around 40% of our growth this year. With job growth remaining steady, we are forecasting lease-over-lease growth of 1.8%, renewal rate growth of 5.4% and a 20 bps decline from 2016 occupancy. These assumptions would deliver 3.6% total revenue growth in 2017. As you know, Los Angeles is the collection of several large submarkets. About half of the new supply in 2017 will be focused in downtown L.A. as we witnessed the creation of a 24\/7 downtown for the first time in the city\u2019s history and will pressure our footprint there which represents 16% of L.A. same-store revenue. The remaining new units are spread across the Valley and specifically, Pasadena, which represent 24% of our revenue. There are virtually no new deliveries in West L.A., where we have 25% of our revenue, or in the Santa Clarita or other suburban markets which account for 35% of revenue.","On to DC, DC continues to show acceleration and will contribute 21% of our total same-store revenue growth in 2017. Lease-over-lease growth is forecast at plus 80 basis points, renewal growth of 4.4%, with occupancy essentially unchanged. Full year revenue growth would be 1.8%. While news of the federal hire increase causes us to take pause, history tells us that frozen federal jobs are simply replaced with outside contractors and higher wages. However, the actual order says that the hiring of contractors to circumvent the order is not allowed. Like other initiatives the administration has put forth, there remains more questions than answers on the potential impact to our markets, our industry, both at the city and national level. But we still remain confident that demographics will continue to drive strong demand apartments.","In the DC Metro, 2017 new supply will be slightly elevated from 2016 and approximately a third of those new units will be competing head-to-head with the majority of our entire DC footprint with the largest concentrations in the RBC Corridor and Arlington. The Navy Yard in Southwest DC will continue to deliver units, but neighborhood amenities and services are not following at the same pace, creating a less desirable but more affordable location. The remaining deliveries are dispersed across many popular suburban locations like Tysons Corner, Reston, around the Beltway to Rockford, Gaithersburg and Prince George\u2019s counties, which all should bode well for continuing improvement in the district.","Seattle will contribute about 20% of full year same-store portfolio revenue growth. Lease-over-lease growth is forecast at 3%, renewal rate at 6.2%. With no change in occupancy, our most likely revenue growth for 2017 is 4.25%. With deliveries in 2017 basically the same as 2016, we have yet to see any price pressures as strong demand for rental housing continues to be driven by employers like Amazon and Microsoft. We continue to produce strong results, while expanding their footprint into new business lines or next-generation technologies. The tech stalwarts are also expanding their employment base in the Greater Metropolitan area to better compete with talent, and Seattle continues to have the lowest absolute rents and taxes of any other market in which we operate. No difference in the past 3 years, most 2017 deliveries in Seattle will go head-to-head with our portfolio. Our 4.25% revenue growth reflects our expectation of moderation as a result of increase in competition. Additionally, prohibitions on upfront non-refundable move-in fees that were recently enacted by the Seattle City Council will negatively impact our 2017 revenue growth by 30 basis points. There is still uncertainty around the new ordinance regarding pet rent [ph] that could have a negative impact of an additional 20 basis points that is not captured in our forecast.","Contributing 10% each of full year revenue growth are San Francisco, Orange County, San Diego and Boston. San Francisco finished the year by returning to the seasonal pattern that we experienced through 2013 versus the power years of 2014 and \u201815. Currently, San Francisco is best described as stable, with minimal pricing power on new leases as a result of tax stagnation and new supply. Lease over lease rate is expected to be negative 1.5% as expiring leases continue to roll down from market highs and we forecast a 40 basis point decline in occupancy to 95.7%. Renewal rates of 2.9% will offset the negative new lease rate to deliver full year positive revenue growth of 1%. With deliveries in 2017 up from last year, the South Bay will feel the greatest impact where almost half of the deliveries are concentrated. And we have 30% of total revenues in San Francisco.","The CBD will see 25% of the deliveries and will impact 18% of our [Technical Difficulty]. We would expect our Peninsula and East Bay assets to deliver better results as only about 20% of the new supply will be delivered in these two large submarkets that combined, make up 53% of our total MSA revenue. Orange County continues to have strong demand as a result of solid job growth, but we will see a significant increase in new deliveries in \u201817. More than half will be concentrated at Irvine, where we have 30% of revenue. The balance of new deliveries, primarily Anaheim and Far North Orange should have little impact on the remaining 70% of our Orange County revenue, which is South and Southeast. As a result, lease over lease is forecast at 2.5%, renewal rate at 6% and little change in occupancy that would deliver full year revenue growth of 4.25%.","Like Orange County, San Diego will see increased new supply in 2017, with half concentrated in Downtown, where we have 25% of our revenue. With steady job growth and an expected increase in military spending, we would expect the balance of our portfolio to be modestly impacted by the remaining new supply in the near-term. Lease over lease growth is expected to be 1.8%, while renewal growth remains strong at 5%. New supply causes us to reduce occupancy by 30 basis points off a strong comp of 96.2 that we achieved in 2016. All-in, we expect revenue growth of 3.75%.","Moving on to Boston, over the last 18 months Boston and its urban core have experienced respectable gain since the elevated deliveries in 2015 and a significant drop in 2016. However in 2017, we will see more new units delivered with 50% in the urban core and Cambridge, followed by a 30% Far North of Downtown with the remaining 20% West than South. 75% of our total Boston revenue will compete with these new deliveries. Job growth has been steady in high profile corporate relocations like GE and Reebok are encouraging signs that this round of supply will produce results similar to 2014 and 2015, where demand kept occupancy strong with no pricing power on new leases, but respectable renewals kept growth positive. For those reasons, we forecast lease over lease growth to be dilutive by 70 basis points, but strong renewal rate growth of 3.9%. With a modest pickup in occupancy, full year revenue growth would then be 1.5%.","Finally, New York City is expected to have a negative impact on our 2017 performance. We also see New York as the market that has the highest potential for volatility to the downside with an increased amount of high end units being delivered into an environment where job growth is relatively mediocre and the biggest gains are in the lower paying sectors of education, leisure and hospitality. Financial services are contracting and tech job expansion has stalled. Our expectation of a 150 basis point decline in revenues assumes the decline of 3.5% in lease over lease rate, a 2.1% increase on a renewal rate and a 40 basis point decline in occupancy. Unlike all of our other markets, our expectations for this market has substantial move-in concessions built in. In summary, there continues to be strong demand for high quality apartments in great locations. Occupancy remains above historic norms. However, near-term supply will create geographic pockets that will lose pricing power on new leases in the short-term. David?","David Neithercut","Alright. Thank you, David. Following a year in which we sold nearly $7 billion of assets, 2017 will look slight tame on the capital allocation front. But the investment teams will be working very hard seeking to maximize total return on invested capital in their respective markets. 2017 guidance assumes $500 million of acquisition activity, funded by a like amount of disposition activity at a negative spread of 75 basis points. Now, I want to make it clear that after having backed up the truck last year as we sold nine core assets, there is very little that we believe needs to be sold in 2017. So we will transact if and when we find an opportunity to redeploy that capital into a higher fully return asset. The investment team will also be focused on our rehab activity in 2017, where we expect to spend $50 million this year, covering approximately 4,500 units and would expect our past returns on this capital of 12% to 14% to be achievable again this year.","Last year, Equity Residential completed the highest dollar volume of new developments in our history in five assets, totaling $1.1 billion of project costs. And in 2017, we will also complete nearly $900 million of additional new developments and this will contrast sharply with 2018, when we will complete just one development project, that being what would be the last remaining project underway, our $88 million 220 unit project at 100 K Street in Washington, DC. Clearly, we have throttled back our development activity in the face of rising land and construction costs and declining yields. At the present time, we have two potential development starts this year, totaling only $100 million. Beyond that, we will continue to work on several existing operating assets where we hope to upsize our density in order to build additional units. And have just two remaining land sites in inventory that were acquired and are currently held for future development with a carrying value of less than $60 million.","Now this does not suggest that we won\u2019t continue to look for opportunities to develop more projects and create new long-term streams of income for the company because our teams continued to look for those opportunities every day. But after a terrific long-term run of realizing development yields well in excess of current cap rates and creating meaningful long-term value for our shareholders in the face of elevated new supply and slowing revenue growth, we have opted to take a more cautious approach to development at this time. So I will now turn the call over to Mark Parrell.","Mark Parrell","Thank you, David. I want to take a few minutes this morning to talk about our expense and our normalized FFO guidance for 2017 as well as our capital expenditure plans. And then I will close with a few comments on our balance sheet activity and our sources and uses. So first, on the same-store expenses, we have provided a range of 3% to 4% for our 2017 same-store expense growth. I am going to go through a few of the main drivers of that at the moment. On the real estate tax side, we expect an increase of between 4% and 5%, with 1.8 percentage points of the increase coming from the 421a burn off in New York. Markets with the largest increases in property taxes are Boston, New York and Washington, DC. For payroll expense, we expect an increase of between 4% and 5% as we face pressure to retain our property level employees in a very competitive market. We have also added staff in some markets to provide even better service to our residents and to support tenant retention.","Switching over to utilities, which is our third largest expense category, we anticipate an increase of approximately 2%. In each of the last 2 years, our annual utility expense has declined, so this is a bit of a normalization year. Also, we are seeing some pressure on our repair and maintenance line item. This is due to increases in the minimum wage that impact our outside cleaning and landscaping vendors. We estimate that in 2017 we will incur approximately $1.5 million in additional cost due to minimum wage pressure. And that\u2019s going to add about 20 basis points to total expense growth from these increases in minimum wage.","For the leasing and advertising expense line item, after a big increase of 19% in 2016 versus 2015, we have budgeted leasing and advertising expense to be flat in 2017 versus 2016. The increase in 2016 was driven by increased promotional spending and that included gift cards and owner payment of broker fees and approximated about $1.6 million and was spent predominantly in New York, with a lesser increase across the portfolio in Internet advertising cost. We expect a lot of competition in markets with significant supply and we feel they are maintaining spending levels in this category as necessary for the time being.","Let\u2019s switch over to our normalized FFO guidance. Our range for normalized FFO for 2017 is $3.05 to $3.15 per share comparing our 2016 normalized FFO to $3.09 per share to the $3.10 per share midpoint of our guidance for 2017. I want to hit on a few of the main drivers. First, our portfolio of 15 properties, totaling about 5,300 units that are in various stages of lease-up should create a total of $85 million to $95 million of NOI. As compared to 2016, this is an incremental contribution to our results of $41 million or about $0.11 per share. We are excited about the current cash flow and about the long-term value creation that these assets will bring Equity Residential. We will caution that cash flows during lease-ups can be volatile due to the lease of timing and changes in rental rate and concession estimates. We expect an additional contribution in normalized FFO of about $4 million or about $0.01 per share from other non-same-store properties, so adding that all up, you get a total positive contribution in the non-same-store category of about $45 million or about $0.12 per share.","Second, we expect to have a positive impact of about $0.04 per share from same-store NOI growth in 2017. And offsetting these positive items will be a reduction in NOI of about $48 million or $0.12 per share from our expensive 2016 sale activity, including the Starwood sale. Also on the negative side, we estimate an impact of approximately $0.02 per share from higher total interest expense. We will benefit from the sizable pay downs of high coupon debt we made in the first quarter of 2016, but we will feel a larger negative impact from significantly lower capitalized interest this year as most of our development projects have now been placed into service. We will also have a negative impact of about $0.01 per share from other items which includes lower fee in asset management income. Remember, we did sell Fort Lewis during 2016 and lower amounts of expected interest income. Remember, we expect to have considerable lower cash balances in 2017 than 2016.","In another item of note, we expect lower overhead costs, which we define as G&A combined with property management, in 2017 versus 2016 by about $3 million. We have mostly completed rightsizing our overhead platform to our smaller property footprint. As you can see, the robust growth in lease-up NOI that we anticipate in 2017 as well as the more modest NOI growth of the same-store portfolio is being obscured by the lost NOI from our substantial 2016 dispositions. If you adjust prior periods with these sales and for the related debt pay-downs, our average rate of normalized FFO growth from 2014 to 2017 will be a very strong rate of about 7% per year.","Now on to the CapEx area, in 2017, we expect to spend $2,600 per same-store unit in capitalized expenditures as compared to $2,235 per same-store unit that we spent in 2016. Included in this is approximately $17 million of additional spend. The customer-facing renovation projects, examples include common areas, leasing offices and exercise rooms. As you know, much of the new product that is being delivered into our market is targeted at the higher end renter. We are making sure that our incredibly well-located assets are able to continue to compete with this new product. This increased spend will be reflected in the line Building Improvements on Page 23 of our supplement. We expect this spend to normalize back down over time.","Continuing on CapEx and continuing our commitment to sustainability in all we do, we are planning to increase our spending on projects in the sustainability area by about $8 million in 2017. These projects tend to have very high rates of return on invested capital. Also, the $50 million kitchen and bath rehab program that David Neithercut just discussed should generate strong returns on invested capital. The spending on this program is included in the $2,600 per same-store unit guidance number that I previously quoted.","Now, a bit on sources and uses in the balance sheet. The fourth quarter was certainly a busy one for our finance and legal teams. We replaced our $2.5 billion revolving line of credit which was scheduled to mature in about a year with a new cheaper $2 billion unsecured revolving line of credit that matures on January 2022. We made our line of credit smaller to reflect the reduction in the size of the company and the prepayment of a significant amount of debt during the first quarter of 2016. We had strong interest from our bank group in renewing the facility and we are able to obtain market leading terms. We also issued $500 million of 10-year unsecured notes at a coupon of 2.85% and an all-in effective rate of 3.1%. This is the lowest 10-year issuance we have ever done. We also paid $1.1 billion or $3 per share in a cash special dividend in the fourth quarter. These actions now left the company\u2019s balance sheet and liquidity position in an excellent place going into what appears to be a more volatile period. Currently, we have approximately $60 million in cash and have about $200 million in outstanding commercial paper, leaving availability of about $1.8 billion under our new $2 billion revolving line of credit. At the end of 2017, we expect the line of credit or the commercial paper program to have about $550 million balance.","I am going to give you a quick summary of some of the cash inflows and outflows. Our guidance includes a $400 million debt issuance in the second half of the year. We expect to payoff $630 million in debt as it matures during 2017 and recall about $340 million of debt that matures in later years, so a total of $970 million of debt repayments during 2017. We will spend about $300 million in 2017 completing our development projects, leaving us with cost of only about $40 million in 2018 to complete our current development starts. Acquisition and disposition activity is anticipated to be about equal in amount. And our guidance assumes that dispositions are slightly front-loaded for the year versus acquisitions occurring ratably over the course of the year.","Now I am going to turn the call back over to the operator for the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Juan Sanabria from Bank of America.","Juan Sanabria","Hi, good morning. I was just hoping you could speak to the 2017 guidance on the core business of same-store revenue and NOI and just give us a sense of the main variance items between the low and the high end, whether it\u2019s macro assumptions or supply\/concessions or whatever color you can provide?","David Neithercut","And by that, do you mean how do we set the guidance range for normalized FFO?","Juan Sanabria","No. For same-store revenue and NOI, what\u2019s the main variance between the low and high-end, what assumptions change?","Mark Parrell","Well, it\u2019s primarily revenue-driven. I would say that in places like obviously, Los Angeles, where we have the largest contribution to growth with the same-store portfolio, we are just assuming more volatility or providing a range for more volatility. New York, same story, New York is probably one of the most undisciplined markets when it comes to pricing and concessions and what have you. So we have assumed a certain level of concessions and rolled down in pricing. But there is more volatility that could happen there than we expect.","Juan Sanabria","Okay, thanks. And then on the supply side, any skew across the top markets between the first half and the second half of \u201917, how are you guys thinking about kind of the trends in results from over the course of the year in \u201817?","David Neithercut","Yes. I guess I would say that as we built up the budgets from the ground up, we understood when the bulk of the units were coming, whether its front loaded, spread across, equally across the fourth quarter or if it was more back end loaded. So the pace of those deliveries, are embedded in our revenue assumptions.","Juan Sanabria","But can you provide any color on kind of maybe Northern California, specifically, what \u2013 how you expect supply to play out over \u201817?","David Santee","I don\u2019t have that level of detail.","David Neithercut","Suffice it to understand, one, we are certainly aware of the deliveries. And with completion being sort of defined as when the property is finally completed and delivered, we understand when first units will be available and that 60 days, 90 days in advance of that, they will start marketing very strenuously. And so we keep \u2013 take all that into account as we pull our numbers together.","Juan Sanabria","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citi.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. David, you mentioned New York City had the most variability in terms of potential outcomes and I think you mentioned at the midpoint, you are assuming down 1.5%, but can you talk about kind of the low end and where that \u2013 where the downside could be for that market?","Mark Parrell","Well, I think it all comes down to level of concessions. We have certainly prepared for a certain level of concessions. But you are already hearing some crazy stuff like three months and four months free on 12-month leases. I mean certainly, if that becomes widespread across the entire MSA, then you can get to negative three pretty quick. So that\u2019s kind of our worst case scenario on New York City.","Nick Joseph","And how do you think about the use of concessions within your portfolio for New York versus using gift cards and does the same-store revenue guidance at 1.5% assume any use of gift cards or maybe that\u2019s being run through the expense line item there?","Mark Parrell","Yes. So let me just explain our overarching strategy for the company and then specifically, New York. We have always thought to be a net effective rent shop. The only market that we have budgeted significant concessions and its $4 million is New York City. We have \u2013 we budgeted the same level of gift cards that we spent last year, but everyone is very clear that, that is a tool that we will only use if absolutely necessary. So our first line of defense is rate, second, concessions and last, gift cards.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. And just one other question, for same-store revenue growth, there has been a deceleration on a year-over-year basis every quarter since third quarter of \u201815, but when you look out to 2017 guidance, do you expect that to stabilize at some point, in the back half of 2017 and could there be a reacceleration?","David Neithercut","Our guidance assumption now assumes a gradual decline in same-store revenue quarterly numbers throughout the year. Nick, certainly it would be great if there was some sort of reacceleration, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s presumed in our numbers.","Nick Joseph","Thanks.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Nick Yulico with UBS.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. I appreciate all the market level detail on the guidance. I guess going back to New York and San Francisco, the assumptions you gave on new lease growth for each market, how does that compare to where new lease growth is \u2013 was in the fourth quarter and so far in January?","David Santee","Well, let me say this. This is why \u2013 I can give you an example of the fourth quarter numbers, but we know from tracking this for the last 10 years that if the market is even stable, the likelihood of having negative lease over lease growth in Q4 is a likely outcome, because you have a disproportionate of people breaking their leases in Q4 versus regular lease expirations. So just to give you an extreme example, so New York in Q4 was a minus 5.3, okay. But almost every market is negative. So basically, you are re-letting units at \u2013 that were at premiums and now you are re-letting them at lower rents. However, you have very few transactions. So you can\u2019t extrapolate the direction of the market from those numbers. So in Q1, it becomes less negative. And then in Q2 and Q3, it\u2019s very positive. And that\u2019s just how the cycle works pretty much every year.","Nick Yulico","Okay. I guess what I am trying to get at is whether or not the guidance for New York and San Francisco is at the midpoint is assuming that both markets get tougher versus what you have actually been seeing on the ground of late, so whether you are actually building \u2013 how much conservatism you are building in for these markets this year would be helpful to understand?","David Santee","Well, I guess we look at the quarterly numbers historically. We have to assume some level of rent growth, what are leases doing. In San Francisco for 2017, we assume that new lease rents will be flat over last year, right. So rents will be basically the same as they were last year, but people who have lived with us for 2 years, 18 months, are paying above market rents, so those will roll down. So we have incorporated all of that into our guidance on a quarter-by-quarter basis.","Nick Yulico","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Mark, just going back to the development starts this year, I didn\u2019t catch that number on a dollar basis, what are the new starts likely to be?","Mark Parrell","Let me just put two things together Nick for you. We have no starts assumed in guidance, so no spend on new starts. We have $300 million that we will spend completing things that have already started that you already see on our development page. David Neithercut referred to two deals we may start. If we do start them, they will have a material impact on guidance. I mean there will be draws on the revolver and slightly higher capitalized interest and it just won\u2019t make a great deal of difference to the FFO numbers for the year.","Nick Yulico","Right, okay. I just but \u2013 just for the two developments that could start, what is the dollar amount of total cost for those projects?","Mark Parrell","$100 million on those two deals, Nick.","Nick Yulico","$100 million total?","Mark Parrell","Correct.","Nick Yulico","Okay. Total cost $100 million for two projects?","David Neithercut","That\u2019s correct.","Nick Yulico","Okay. So I guess my \u2013 that\u2019s helpful. My follow-up question here then is I mean if you think about it, I mean, you are essentially practically shutting down the development pipeline which means you are \u2013 you could have a lot more used potential for your free cash flow as you get out to next year. I mean, what are the thoughts about where that goes? I mean, are you going to increase your payout ratio on the dividend? Are you going to do more share repurchases? You are not going to have much in the way of future capital needs.","David Neithercut","I think we will see at the time, but those two things are certainly would be part of the things that we would strongly consider.","Nick Yulico","Thanks.","David Neithercut","You bet.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Conor Wagner with Green Street Advisors.","Conor Wagner","Good morning.","Mark Parrell","Good morning, Conor.","Conor Wagner","You mentioned that disposition activity could be front-end loaded. What are you seeing on demand and pricing for the assets that you are looking to sell? And without giving away too much, could you tell us how those assets \u2013 how they fit in your overall portfolio. You mentioned David that you had sold largely all of your non-core assets. So, I assume these are assets that are in your remaining markets and closer to the average of your existing portfolio?","Mark Parrell","Yes. And as I also noted, Conor, many of which would not be sold if there is not a redeployment sort of opportunity also on the horizon. So I would kind of think about them as more sort of pair of trades, if you will. We have $100 million or so of product that we had hoped to sell last year as part of the larger sort of non-core disposition program that did leak into this year. Beyond that, as I said during our prepared remarks, we have very little identified that we feel like we need to sell, but we do have product identified that we would sell if we could find the right reinvestment opportunity. Just with respect generally to valuations, I can tell you that of all that we sold a year ago or during 2017, we have sold that for about a 3% premium to what we had told our board that we probably could realize on that product. And I think that\u2019s a real testament to Alan George and his team for their ability to attract the market. Those guys are telling us today that values generally are kind of holding in there. That deals with some sort of story or some kind of structure here might be off a little bit on a year-over-year basis, but a great deal of our assets would be right in there, same valuation over a year ago and in some markets, maybe even up slightly from there.","Conor Wagner","And then on that acquisition disposition strategy, do you have any desire to use that to shift your allocation between markets at all? Again, it\u2019s obviously a pair of trade strategy, but is there any portfolio refinement strategy baked into that?","David Neithercut","I don\u2019t think so, Conor. I mean, certainly, we may sell an asset to one market, buy another and another but that\u2019s not be nearly going to change in any material way NOI concentration. So that won\u2019t be conducted with a specific desire to reduce one market and increase another market, but more just in response to whatever opportunities we may see.","Conor Wagner","Okay. And then David in the last night\u2019s release, you noted at the beginning, just in the opening, just the strong demand that you guys are seeing in the potential for great returns in future years. What\u2019s your outlook for employment growth and supply growth in \u201818 and \u201819 and what\u2019s underpinning that constant outlook that you have for your portfolio?","David Neithercut","Well, look, it\u2019s hard to ask me exactly where we think \u201818 supply is going to be, but we do think with land prices up and construction cost up and a lot of more traditional sort of construction lending sources maybe winding down a little bit, but there are lots of reasons to think that \u201818 deliveries will be below \u201817. And just with respect to demand, we just think that demographic picture remains very favorable. The job picture remains very favorable. Rising wages, we as you know operate in markets, which is processing. The family housing is very expensive. So we just believe that we have got a lot of residents that will stay with us and the demographic picture will bring more to the market. So, we remain \u2013 we think we have got peak deliveries in 2017. And as we have already discussed in great detail, that\u2019s we are going to have to work our way through that. But on the backside of that, we remain very optimistic on a multifamily business in general and certainly, very optimistic for the multifamily business in our core markets.","Conor Wagner","Thank you very much.","David Neithercut","You are welcome.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Rob Stevenson with Janney.","Rob Stevenson","Good morning, guys. Can you talk about what the current expectation in terms of stabilized yield is for the $960 million in the development pipeline?","David Neithercut","Sure. I mean of the completions that we delivered last year, so that\u2019s about the $1.1 billion. We think these things will stabilize high 5s, low 6s and the product that we believe \u2013 and we will certainly complete yet this year will stabilize also in the high 5s, low 6s.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. So the five projects that you guys have completed in California, the three in San Francisco, the one in San Jose and the one in L.A. that are already on your schedules completed, that already is sort of high 5s, low 6s?","David Neithercut","Well, I am not saying it\u2019s already, because they are still in various stages of lease-up but we believe that when they do stabilize, they will stabilize in that ballpark.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And where is that relative to what you expected at underwriting?","David Neithercut","Generally better. I will tell you that in those \u2013 in most of the products we have delivered, we are able to price these land and price construction costs at a different point in the cycle. So, our costs were very attractive. And we have seen, as you know, very strong revenue growth rental rate growth during that time period. So, while even our deals in San Francisco might be exceeding our original expectations, they might be a little off of what we had thought they might be at the beginning of \u201816, but still that will deliver at or modestly above our original expectations.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And then you talked about $50 million of redevelopment this year, what\u2019s the overall redevelopment opportunity in the portfolio? And is there any ability to bring some of that more forward and accelerate that over the next couple of years to $75 million or $100 million or is it really $50 million is about all you really can do at on an annual basis?","David Neithercut","Well, that\u2019s a very good question, one that we have asked ourselves. But it just there is some capacity requirement, capacity limitations, not just of the number of trades that can do. One of the biggest things driving construction cost out there today is cost of labor. And it\u2019s just, I am not sure that we have the ability to find the vendors that would allow us in these markets to do more than what we are doing. So I guess I would tell you that I think we are probably doing about all we can in any given year. We have had about $50 million or so run-rate for the past 4 or 5 years probably. And I think that\u2019s probably a pretty good run-rate for us just given what we think the limitations are on labor out there in the marketplace.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. Thanks, guys.","David Neithercut","You bet, Rob.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Rich Hightower with Evercore.","Rich Hightower","Hi. Good morning, guys.","David Neithercut","Good morning, Rich.","Rich Hightower","So I got a couple of questions here. I am going to go back to David Santee\u2019s comments earlier in the prepared remarks about first, New York City being the only market where, I think \u201csubstantial concessions were built into the forecast for the year.\u201d Are there other markets where concessions are built in but they are less substantial? And if so, can you kind of give a little color around what those markets are at this point?","David Neithercut","I guess, I would say that there is nothing \u2013 there are no markets that can come close to what we have budgeted in New York. Seattle, we put in probably $80,000 to really just because of the concentration within a couple of block area on some deliveries, we did a little bit maybe, call it, $90,000 in DC just because of some concentrations in a specific neighborhood. Other than that, there are no significant concessions budgeted.","Rich Hightower","Okay. And so would you also say that the concessionary environment in San Francisco is abated pretty significantly? I guess that\u2019s from the statement.","David Santee","Yes, I mean, look, the lease-ups are still giving concessions, that\u2019s just kind of as a standard operating procedure on new lease-ups. But we are, like I said, the market seems stable. Some people are offering concessions, but it\u2019s few and far between. And we think that now that the market has repriced in \u201816 that there is not really a need for concessions.","David Neithercut","I guess, what we have seen Rich is the ability to maintain net effective lease pricing across most markets even when they sort of soften. And maybe DC is the perfect example. There are a lot of new supplies you know in DC in kind of \u201813 and \u201814 and we remain Dave, there was discipline sort of in the marketplace and we could continue to operate successfully at a net effective rate. New York is something where the marketplace as David said, originally is less disciplined and is one in which concessions can become problematic and we would have to respond. But away from New York, we found the ability to operate on a net effective basis fairly successful.","Rich Hightower","Okay, great, that\u2019s helpful guys. Second question here, so going to Mark\u2019s comments about the balance sheet and how well positioned EQR is in the current environment with respect to liquidity and all the other sort of financing needs you have taken care of recently and he talked about anticipating volatility in the upcoming environment, so does that imply you see better opportunities for capital allocation maybe as a 2018, 2019 type of timeframe, I would also maybe compare and contrast that against the statements earlier about 2018, 2019 being better fundamentally, so where is the source of that volatility and what should we expect in terms of what EQR does about it?","David Neithercut","Well, I guess the volatility with respect to the fundamentals, not necessarily with respect to assets sort of valuations. But again, we have four in the last 12 months, 18 months, I think taken a fairly, but not 2 years, taken a fairly cautious approach to investment. Certainly, I think as indicated by the large transaction we did last year with Starwood and the other subsequent dispositions and the big special dividend that we did. So look, we see a lot of new product coming out of these markets. We think there may be opportunities, should it make sense from a capital allocation standpoint to buy new product, it might make more sense to buy some of that product, rather than develop and take development risk, construction risk, lease-up risk, etcetera. So we are just taking a cautious approach, given all the new supply with respect to capital deployment. And as noted earlier, by having reduced the development up to this point and not having any meaningful spend in \u201818, we do create net cash flow which we could use for some other purposes. And we would not be afraid to use that for those other purposes.","Rich Hightower","Alright. Thanks David.","David Neithercut","You bet.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Ivy Zelman with Zelman & Associates.","Ivy Zelman","Hi guys. Hello.","David Neithercut","Yes. We hear you.","Ivy Zelman","I am sorry I am trying to get off speaker. I am sorry. Thank you for taking my question. And really excellent color on the markets and appreciate you not going to the \u201816 results, because I think everybody want to talk about \u201817 and how you are getting to your forecast. One question I had for you guys is with respect to turnover, I realized I think you said you expect flat turnover and you kind of went through with respect to occupancy by market, so some occupancy flat, some down 20 bps, 40 bps, here and there. One of the questions I had is with respect to appreciating the fragmentation of your business is pretty significant and there is a lot of arguably players that are not as well capitalized or may not be as the tenure of being in this business that are in fact telling us they are cutting prices in New York, for example, not concessions, cutting prices and so one of the things I think about is on a renewal basis, if you are a tenant and with the Internet and all the transparency on pricing, what\u2019s the risk that you will see turnover increasing as people recognize there is better opportunities and then if so, what does that do to NOI with the higher expenses on the turn, so that\u2019s my first question, just want to know what you have built in and why you are assuming flat in overall basis?","David Neithercut","So I guess I would say that first of all, regardless of rate for renewal increases or lack thereof, we are going to try and retain any resident where it makes economic sense. Frankly, the hard costs associated with turnover are very minimal. New York has a lot of hardwood floors, so really you are paying call it, a couple of hundred bucks to paint the apartment and maybe $100 to clean it. So the real cost is in the vacancy. So our goal is to kind of minimize that vacancy. And I would say that when you look at our forecasted numbers and I gave you the breakdown, we forecasted basically 80 basis points lower in occupancy assuming that there could be people that choose to move in other locations because of the lack of neighborhood loyalty. One of the things we talk about is really what is \u2013 it used to be in New York City that people are very loyal to the neighborhoods and a very \u2013 neighborhoods are very desirable. You have got a big slug of new deliveries in Long Island City. What is the elasticity of our customer and their desire to go further out one more train stop to achieve a lower rent. So for all those reasons, we have kind of accounted for that with 80 basis points lower in occupancy for the full year.","Ivy Zelman","And therefore, assumingly the volatility may be that you will need to meet whatever the pricing maybe at that time and retaining that customer as the strategy?","David Neithercut","Yes. I mean the volatility would not be in rate. I mean rate would not immediately impact us. It would be in additional upfront concessions or significantly lower occupancy.","Ivy Zelman","Got it. Thank you. And separately on transactions side, I think David you mentioned that your \u2013 the overall success that you have had and recycling older assets and bringing in newer assets and I think you obviously commend to the team that\u2019s done so, when you think about the transactions that you would have liked to have done or just understanding what\u2019s going on in the transaction market, there seems to be a bit outspread widening and that\u2019s probably more Class A urban and there has been some disappointment in the market that transactions that just didn\u2019t get done that they were hopeful would have got done or when they saw deals where we traded and they were traded 1% to 10% depending on the asset lower, you guys are saying you are not seeing that or maybe you can comment further on that, because that\u2019s definitely \u2013 a lot of people are saying in the industry that they are seeing the same thing?","David Santee","I certainly would suggest that we are seeing did ask spreads widening. But I will tell you that the deals there that are getting done, we think are getting done and valuations that are not showing that kind of delta. Now may be deals are being pulled back in the marketplace, which seller is unwilling to sell at that kind of discount. But I also sort of just say just in support of that is that we are still seeing land prices very strong. We are still seeing construction cost going up and seeing no abatement in replacement costs, which are also going to be, I think the driver of underlying value of existing stabilized assets.","Ivy Zelman","Right, very true. Lastly, just can you guys talk about the sensitivity of rising rates and recognizing you are extremely well capitalized, generating strong free cash flow, but just appreciating what can that do to your competitors because some people are just really not as well capitalized and again it\u2019s highly fragmented, so how does that impact the competitive nature of the market for new move-ins and renewals from the way you have modeled \u201817 guidance and what are you assuming I guess for where rates are going to go in your modeling?","Mark Parrell","Ivy, it\u2019s Mark Parrell. I may need to disassemble, we may not have understood your question. Is that a question about balance sheet sensitivity of us and others to changes in interest rates or our customers\u2019 renewal, I didn\u2019t understand that second part.","Ivy Zelman","Well, I guess what I am saying, there is a connection as rates rise, clearly on the transaction side and what the impact is on underwriting assets and whether it\u2019s training or new development, etcetera, but then it also has impact to the competitive markets and how it may be bad players act, so there is the connectivity and I am trying to understand what you think about it broadly and you are forecasting \u201817 your rent growth, revenue growth, AFFO, everything that you are providing to us, how do you think that the rise rate environment impacts the competitive nature of the market as there is some changes in how people act when I think about a good player versus a bad player, do you have that incorporated in your forecast for \u201817?","Mark Parrell","Well, I guess what I will tell you, we have incorporated is the LIBOR, the curve that we do that hike. So we assume LIBOR to be higher and we put that into our forecast for our own floating rate debt. The third increase would be so late in the year it wouldn\u2019t be impactful to us. So we thought about that we will comment say that many of our private, most of our private market competitors are much more highly leveraged than we are and carry much more floating rate than we do debt. So to the extent that you are suggesting the competitive landscape changes, if rates go up suddenly and significantly more than people expect and by that I mean short-term rates, that impact will be profound, I would guess as it relates to our private competitors. And considerably less significant to guys like us, we had around worth 10% to 20% floating rate debt. As it relates to our tenant\u2019s actions specifically, I don\u2019t think we factored that into our thoughts. Well, I think what she is asking is \u2013 we will \u2013 like we saw in the South Bay and San Francisco early in 2016, the rational pricing to fill the building up to convert from construction to permanent financing. So I think we have \u2013 that\u2019s why we have created a much wider range in New York on the concession front, because if people do start operating 2, 3, 4 months free to get their building occupied so that they can then go for permanent financing. I think we have that factored into our assumptions or our ranges.","Ivy Zelman","Got it. Well good luck guys. Thank you for taking my question. Appreciate it.","David Neithercut","Thank you, Ivy. You bet.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Thank you and good morning out there. Two questions for you. Maybe they are both for David Santee. Going back to LA, you said that that\u2019s about 40% of your growth for 2017. And then in your commentary, it sounded I was trying to do the math quickly, like maybe half or so, a little over half of your portfolio are in submarkets away from supply, is that correct? And if not, if you could just break it down sort of how much of your LA exposure is in submarkets facing supply like downtown versus submarkets away from supply?","David Neithercut","So downtown, which would include, call it, Koreatown, Mid-Wilshire, Hollywood, that\u2019s where half of the supply is. We only have 16% of our total LA MSA across those submarkets. 25% of our revenues sits, let\u2019s just call it, in the Marina or West LA. Over the past year or so, there has been significant new deliveries in the [indiscernible], which has pressured West LA and the Marina. Those submarkets are just beginning to recover. And we would expect little pressure from new supply in \u201817. Other than that, the last major chunk is really Pasadena, where we only have, call it three or four properties. And then \u2013 but we have properties Far East of downtown LA. We have considerable portion of our revenue up in Santa Clarita, up in the San Fernando Valley. So I think we are good in LA as far as feeling the brunt of the concentration of deliveries and loss of pricing power in the urban core.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then switching coast to DC, you mentioned the hiring freeze and how that also covers contractors, but there is also \u2013 trust me, it was a different phone number, if was the wife, I would have to put you guys on hold. Hey, you got to know who the boss is. So, I think you mentioned that hiring is also impact on the contractor side. But if we see defense clearly seems to be getting favored nation status. So if we do see more defense spending, do you think that\u2019s enough to offset the hiring freeze? And then two, how much of your portfolio is Northern Virginia focused out of your DC portfolio?","David Neithercut","Well, I guess, what I would say is when you look at the makeup of all of the defense employees in D.C., a lot of them are contractors already. A lot of defense employees are contract employees. So, we kind of look at that as just an offset to not hiring at the EPA or what have you. But we certainly feel that an increased focus on defense spending which is just the biggest piece of the pie in DC will be an overall net benefit.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, thank you.","David Neithercut","You are welcome, Alex.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao","Hey, everyone. I just want to go back to the commentary about the trajectory of same-store performance over the course of the year continuing to decelerate. It sounded like if I heard you correctly. And if we think about sort of I know that\u2019s a bottom-up analysis of the markets and whatnot, but if we think about just supply and I think most \u2013 there is a lot of different estimates out there, but most see the first half being worse than the second half. And then also think about the demand side in terms of job growth which has slowed down a bit here, but potentially could reaccelerate towards the back half of the year. I guess, if I think about your trajectory, does that suggest that you don\u2019t expect any change in the job environment or job growth environment, I should say, towards the end of the year and that you are sort of building in more steady supply deliveries?","David Santee","I guess, I would say that we don\u2019t \u2013 we are not forecasting any material change to job growth either to the upside or the downside. A lot of the administration\u2019s initiatives are probably more construction type jobs what have you. I mean, everything else remains to be seen. And that\u2019s kind of how we are looking at jobs. I mean, the unemployment rate is low.","Mark Parrell","Unemployment rate and college-educated is 2.5%, so\u2026","David Santee","Right. So the unemployment rate and college-educated is 2.5%, so I\u2019m not sure how much more you could improve in the next 12 months, I think it\u2019s just another yet to be seen kind of thing.","Vincent Chao","Okay. So that\u2019s the one half and then the supply would be others, so I mean, it does seem like supply should theoretically be easing towards the end, but maybe there is delay in that benefit as those deliveries lease up? But I guess, maybe just another question on the liquidity side or the sources and uses. I thought I heard just under $1 billion of debt repayments planned for the year and then another $300 million of development CapEx, but I thought there was about $400 million of debt planned for issuance and then is the remaining Delta, the CP program that you talked about?","David Neithercut","So, some of that will go on the line remember, we do have $250 million to $300 million on cash flow a year and we will have that again this year after all CapEx. So some of that is offset by that. And then the remainder will be a higher line balance at the end of the year or CP depending on what\u2019s kind of more efficient. So, I do expect this to be more like $500 million or $550 million on the revolver CP program towards the end of the year compared to where we are now at couple of hundred.","Vincent Chao","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Drew Babin","Good morning. Quick question on price, you had mentioned before some leases where rents are probably rolling down to market or you have some legacy leases there above market. Could you quantify that in terms of loss to lease for the whole portfolio and more specifically, New York and San Fran, if you can?","David Neithercut","Well, I guess, I would say we don\u2019t really focus on loss to lease in a yield management environment. I mean, that number can change dramatically from Q1 to Q2 or Q3, but it\u2019s more about the momentum in the market. So certainly, anyone that moved in prior to, let\u2019s just say, June of last year in San Francisco is probably 5% to 7% above market today. So that\u2019s where you get the roll down until you reach kind of equilibrium on that.","Drew Babin","Okay. And secondly, some of the supply data that\u2019s out there suggest that while supply growth looks like it comes down a little bit in \u201818, it\u2019s still elevated relative to \u201816 in New York and so I was hoping I know not all of that likely gets billed, I was hoping you can give us some color on your read on how much of that ultimately gets build on and when \u2013 at what point during this year might those numbers kind of become a little more firm?","David Neithercut","Well, I think our \u201817 numbers are firm. I mean in most of our markets that is in our geographic footprint, this is vertical high rise, mid rise product that started 2 years ago. So we again, we reconcile our delivery numbers with axial metric data with our folks in the field, boots on the ground. So I mean I believe we have a very firm handle on what will be delivered in each of our submarkets in 2017.","Drew Babin","I am sorry if I said \u201817, actually I meant 2018?","David Neithercut","2018 got to be pretty firm to-date. I mean in order to build these - in order to deliver anything in \u201818, you have got to generally be pretty much underway in New York City.","David Santee","You had to be moving there today.","David Neithercut","So we do see from a completion standpoint, sort of defining completion, we do see \u201818 in New York a little more than \u201817. But as part of our budgeting process, we recognized that a good amount of that \u201818 will be available for lease, perhaps even in \u201817 and we have accounted for that in our budgeting process.","Drew Babin","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much.","David Neithercut","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Tayo Okusanya","Yes. Good afternoon everyone. Again, thanks a lot for the details for most of the market. I just had two quick ones, the first one, the $500 million guidance for acquisitions and dispositions again, granted it\u2019s not a big acquisition, disposition year, but could you talk specifically about if all that is opportunistic or if there is anything targeted in any of those numbers?","David Santee","Yes, very little. I mean there is almost nothing targeted on that. For some time, we have had just the very, very short list on the acquisition side, but it covers a little bare there at the present time, just given where we see valuations are at the present time relative to wanting to stop, but that we would sell. So I mean that is all I think speculative at this time. If and when we find good trade opportunities to finance that with proceeds from the sale, we will go ahead and do that. But that\u2019s generally been the way we thought about most of that activity even in last year. We had started with an expectation of perhaps selling some to redeploy that would be in addition in a way from the large disposition process. And we did last year, but they were ended up being very little of that activity actually taking place. So we continue to look for products that we can finance that we do think makes sense and the price would makes sense and we believe we can pair that up with appropriate sale, we will go ahead and do that. But we don\u2019t see a lot of that \u2013 we are not working a lot of that at the present time.","Tayo Okusanya","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then the development pipeline, I noticed with the Irvine, California development project, the stabilization date was to start a couple of quarters, any particular reason for that?","David Neithercut","Well, that was finally pushed out in response to having pushed out the completion of that some time ago. We had a particularly difficult problem with the general contractor there and nearly maybe suffering from the same sort of labor problems that contractors are suffering with across most of our markets. So the construction, the delivery of that was delayed. There was always a hope that that might not necessarily because you start building two different phases might not necessarily require us to actually change the complete \u2013 the stabilization date. But now we have done so, so that was really response to a several quarter delay during the construction process as a result of general contractor issues.","Tayo Okusanya","Great. Thank you.","David Neithercut","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.","Rich Hill","Hey guys, I know we are past hour, a lot of time, so I do want to maybe keep my question short. Going back to your comment that you don\u2019t really have anything to sell, I am sure I am putting words in your mouth, but if the right opportunities came about, you would sell and maybe rotate into something else, could you maybe give us some color just what you would find attractive in the current market, is it would you find New York City attractive, if cap rates widened enough, are you looking for markets with less supply, I am just curious what you would consider to be an attractive acquisition in the current market, if it was favorable enough?","David Neithercut","Well, again, it\u2019s attractive relative to that which we want to sell. So I can\u2019t tell you exactly what it might be, but we may find in a market that a reason why we might want to sell in one submarket and redeploy into another submarket or to sell in A and buy B or sell a B. I mean this was a market by market, submarket by submarket exercise, that is a function of what we can sell and where we can redeploy that capital and does that make sense relative to one another.","Rich Hill","Understood. But in an ideal theoretical world, I mean obviously, you have some assets that you would potentially sell, what sort of markets do you \u2013 are there any markets that you would specifically be targeting and view more favorably or is it really as dynamic as maybe it seems?","David Neithercut","I would not describe that as a market as much as perhaps as specific assets in a market. So there may be assets that we believe might be an opportune time to rollout of today. And I think that\u2019s not market driven, but more asset driven. So older assets, assets which require capital perhaps so we don\u2019t we want to put into it reasons why we want again, as I said earlier move from reduced that exposure in a certain submarket redeploy in another submarket. Just to make it clear, anything that we had really recognized or identified last year as an asset that we knew that was not a long-term hold for us was rolled up into large transaction we executed as part of the $6.8 billion of dispositions last year. So anything that we identified, anything we did not want to own, we tried to and we are successful in putting that in disposing of it a year ago. So anything now, again as assets, we would be willing to sell this, this is not necessarily something that has to be a long-term capability. But we would be willing to sell this if we could find the appropriate acquisition into which we would redeploy that capital. So again, it\u2019s an asset here, an asset there, that we would be willing to sell and we could find the right thing to buy. And again that\u2019s just a trade in, so that\u2019s all a function of the relationship between what we are selling and what you are buying.","Rich Hill","Got it, that\u2019s very helpful. So I sort of think about that in terms of just portfolio optimization, you would like the markets that you are in, you believe in them long-term, but from time-to-time, there might be an opportunity to sell one asset and buy another asset and you would take advantage of that if you could?","David Neithercut","I wish I have said it so clearly the first time.","Rich Hill","Well, thank you, guys. That\u2019s all I have.","David Neithercut","You bet.","Operator","And we will take our next question from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","Thanks. Good morning. You discussed spending additional CapEx as a response to new supply and I am wondering if this is market specific or throughout your whole portfolio and also is the $2,600 annual CapEx per unit, is that the new norm for the foreseeable future or just for 2017?","Mark Parrell","Yes. It\u2019s Mark Parrell and $2,600, that amount is just really spread throughout the portfolio. There are some larger projects here and there, but it isn\u2019t \u2013 could very over-weighted in one market or another. I did mention in my remarks, we think that $2,600 as an exceptional number and we would expect it to normalize back down to $2,300 or so. So $2,300 a unit is about 7% of our revenue and that\u2019s kind of a number we think is about right and shows very well, relative to a lot of our competitors. This year, it will go up to about 8% of revenue and that\u2019s again, I think our response to competitive pressures and because we got a few low-hanging fruits in some of the sustainability step that we would like to get done.","John Kim","And that can be more weighted towards revenue enhancing this year versus last year?","Mark Parrell","No, I don\u2019t see it as materially different. I think a lot of the stuff that we call rehabs is revenue enhancing, has a return associated with it, of course some of the replacements are just that. Replacements of worn-out equipment and maybe doesn\u2019t have a specific ROI, but certainly the rehabs of $50 million was all approved at investment committee. Those are all deals that have to meet rigorous hurdles.","John Kim","Okay. And then in New York, we have seen a couple of micro-apartment buildings emerge. And I am wondering if you have had any views on this, if you see this as an opportunity, a threat or no impact to your business?","David Neithercut","I guess, I would say that supply is supply. Rental supply is rental supply. And if it competes with us, we own some micro apartments in San Francisco and in Seattle and so have some experience with that and sort of understand how it fits into the marketplace, but I don\u2019t look at it as a specific threat. Just new supply is new supply and it competes with us.","John Kim","Is that a part of your portfolio that you maybe willing to grow?","David Neithercut","Again, as it makes sense, it\u2019s a very high turnover product and so it does require sort of a little bit different sort of management, but we wouldn\u2019t steer clear of it, but we are not \u2013 it\u2019s not part of a specific strategy to grow at the present time.","John Kim","Great, thank you.","David Neithercut","You bet.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay","Good morning, guys. Looking at your base case for demand in New York, are you assuming more of the same financial service jobs contracting flattish information jobs?","David Neithercut","Yes.","Wes Golladay","Okay. And then you have kind of mentioned rising wages to limit employee turnover. Are you seeing an uptick in turnover? And is there any property level impact when this happens?","David Santee","We do our best to retain our employees and there is many levers, benefits, enhanced department discounts what have you. There are a lot of team managers out there that don\u2019t necessarily have skin in the game when it comes to offering wages. And we have seen some how we call them outrageous offers to some people. But for the most part, I think, a lot of our people that work at Equity Residential are very loyal. And what we do see are people leaving for simply more opportunity. The good performers that when you are adding 30,000 units over a couple of years in New York City that creates a lot of new property manager jobs, regional manager jobs and what have you, but we don\u2019t see people leaving for lateral opportunities.","Wes Golladay","Okay. And then last one, have you mentioned where new and renewal leases are going out at, for January and for the next few months on renewals?","Mark Parrell","No, I have not, but I can. For January, we achieved 4.2% on renewals. February, which is almost closed out, 85% are closed out, we achieved 4.2%. And then March, 60%, we still have 50% to be worked, and we are at a 3.9%.","Wes Golladay","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Tom Lesnick with Capital One.","Tom Lesnick","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I will keep it short since we are pretty late in the call here. Bigger picture and I know it\u2019s early into the new administration everything. But given immigration policy and everything, have you guys looked at migration trends and how that sensitivity applies to your various markets? Is there some sort of demand elasticity that is sharper in some of your markets more than others? Just wondering if you could comment on maybe San Francisco, LA and New York specifically?","David Santee","So, we have begun to dig into our database. We don\u2019t identify the people on visas specifically. But there are other ways that we can query folks with no Social Security numbers or kind of an obvious first run. I would tell you that we are not ready to commit to any numbers. But I think what we have seen so far plays out matches up with our thinking in that Boston and San Francisco are very similar for different reasons, right? So San Francisco is more H1B visa. Boston is more international students. New York is probably in between those two places. So once we validate what we are seeing, we would be in a better position to kind of talk about that next quarter.","Tom Lesnick","Okay, thanks for the call. I appreciate it.","David Neithercut","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And we will take our last question from Nick Joseph with Citi.","Michael Bilerman","Hey, it\u2019s Michael Bilerman with Nick. So we spent a lot of time talking about I guess the outputs of your guidance. I am curious into the methodology, the process, the inputs that you used to kind of come up with it. And obviously after last year\u2019s guidance, perhaps, part of it was you are going to delay a quarter which you did. And I think you sort of earmarked a little bit that you are going to come up with a larger range. So how did the process, how did the methodology, how should we think about the guidance you have put out relative to your guidance that you had done last year?","David Neithercut","Well, I think when you look at 2016 we went into the woods unprepared. We thought \u2013 we assumed 2016 was going to be a repeat of 2015 and we didn\u2019t allocate the appropriate tools for a significant market downturn like we had in San Francisco. Also, San Francisco made up a very large percentage of our growth. So, the biggest market that contributed to growth at the most significant downturn in a very short period of time. And I think looking back that whether it\u2019s Axiometrics or any other shop, I think people acknowledge that San Francisco went south much quicker and much harder than even those folks expected. So this year, we have given ourselves obviously a bigger range. We \u2013 obviously, 2017 is going to be elevated supply, unlike \u201815 that had tremendous job growth and you packed in 1.5 year worth of growth into 1 year. So, I think we started from the ground up, looked at our trends on new lease, our lease-over-lease growth made our assumptions on rental rate increases in each of the markets relative to supply and job growth and how those flow through the year quarter-by-quarter. And I think we have developed reasonable ranges that cover some potential upside as well as looking where the volatility \u2013 most of the volatility is like New York and covering ourselves on the downside.","Michael Bilerman","Okay. And was there sort of top once you did all your bottoms up analysis and additional conservatism baked in top-down in your model? I guess I am just trying to really grasp how conservative you have put out this guidance knowing what happened last year? I just didn\u2019t know if there was any sort of methodology changes or data input changes that would lead to a different outcome?","David Santee","No. I mean, we did a sensitivity analysis market by market. We know there is a 50 basis point increase or decrease in revenue what that does to the whole company. And I think we have created the appropriate ranges given the expected activity in the market that gets you to our midpoint.","Michael Bilerman","And then so the streets got your NAV at $70 stocks, hovering around $60, so call it 14% or 15% discount, double to the discount of to where your apartment peers trade, you have a 13 million share authorization, call it $800 million or so, why wouldn\u2019t you be buying your stock today?","Mark Parrell","We have been using free cash flow Michael, as you know, to complete what has been a very successful development work. We are bringing that down and that creates capacity to perhaps do as you suggest as we get through the development that needs to be completed this year. Like I have said repeatedly on these calls that share repurchases are certainly part of what we will consider. We have bought stock back in the past and we will not be afraid to buy stock back in the future. We got limited bites at the apple and when you do, you would need to make it count and we will make sure that if and when we do it, it\u2019s at the right time.","Michael Bilerman","But I guess your stock is hovering around the levels \u2013 the low levels of the last number of months, I am trying to get a sense of whether that\u2019s \u2013 you know your capital needs are, you can certainly lever up knowing that you are going to have the free cash flow next year, whether this is an attractive enough entry point or do you not sort of see the same discount that the street is seeing?","Mark Parrell","We see the same discount as the street is seeing. I mean nobody is more aware of that than we are this management team and our Board. And when we act, we will let you know. But we won\u2019t \u2013 no need I think to say anything in advance of that activity.","Michael Bilerman","Correct, okay. Thank you, gentlemen.","David Neithercut","You\u2019re very welcome.","Operator","And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","David Neithercut","Thank you all for your time. We appreciate it and have a long day and we appreciate your tolerance with us today. We will see you all around the circuit. Thank you very much.","Operator","And that concludes today\u2019s presentation. We thank you, all for your participation. And you may now disconnect."],"8661":["Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) Q3 2012 Earnings Call October 25, 2012 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Marty McKenna - Investor Relations","David J.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded, October 25, 2012. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Marty McKenna. Please go ahead.","Marty McKenna","Thank you, Alicia. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's third quarter 2012 results. Our featured speakers today are David Neithercut, our President and CEO; Fred Tuomi, our EVP of Property Management; and David Santee, our EVP of Property Operations. Mark Parrell, our CFO, is also here with us for the Q&A.","Let me remind you that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Law. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. And now I'll turn it over to David Neithercut.","David J. Neithercut","Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today for our third quarter call on which we're very pleased to report that we continue to see favorable fundamentals across our markets. And this continued strong demand for rental housing produced same store revenue growth of 5.8% for the quarter ending September 30.","As we sit here today with almost 10 months in the bank and a good handle on expirations or renewals for the balance of the year, we're confident that same-store revenues for the full year 2012 will come in at 5.6%. This is just slightly ahead of our expectations at the beginning of the year. And this is a very strong level coming off 5% growth in 2011. And this will represent the first time in our history that we will have had 2 consecutive years of 5% same-store revenue growth or better. And I'd like to thank the hard-working teams across the Equity nation for doing all that you do each and every day to deliver these terrific results.","Looking into next year, we currently expect same-store revenue will grow 4% to 5% in 2013, which will continue a string of some of the best operating performance in the company's history. As we sit here today, a half of that growth is already embedded in our existing rent roll. So that if we maintained our current occupancy and every existing lease renewed at the same rent as we're collecting today, we'd see same-store revenue growth in the low 2s next year. And that's even if we didn't have any rent growth at all next year, which of course, we certainly will.","And to give you some perspective on that, I'm going to turn the call over to Fred Tuomi, our friend, our colleague, who will be retiring next year after nearly 20 years of leading our property management team. And Fred is going to address not just what we're seeing today, but what we're seeing for the balance of the year and how we expect to start the new year. Fred?","Frederick C. Tuomi","Thank you. As David mentioned, the fundamentals of our business still remain very solid. We enjoyed a strong leasing season and remain confident for our full year 2012 revenue growth will finish at 5.6% and by the end of the fourth quarter, we'll be well positioned for yet another year of very strong revenue growth for 2013.","And I'll now provide an update on the key drivers of our revenue in terms of how we will finish this year, and then more importantly, how that would carry over into 2013. The first turnover. We had a trend of higher turnover that we saw in the first half of this year, and that has reversed course. And we now saw that on the third quarter turnover we had levels below those of the third quarter a year ago in 2011. We expect this trend to continue into the fourth quarter resulting a full year 2012 turnover now at 58.2%. Turnover for the year 2013 should be in the range of 58% to 58.5%.","Now the markets with the greatest increase in turnover compared to 2011 still includes San Francisco and Denver, where we had very strong growth of base rents and not surprisingly, high level of move-outs due to those rate increases. But for the entire same-store portfolio, move-outs due to rate increases have moderated, moderated to 11.9%, which is down 210 basis points from the third quarter of '11 and down sequentially by almost 300 basis points. So this moderation indicates further acceptance of our pricing by our newer residents and reflects the seasonal moderation of our rents.","Move-outs due to home buying, I have still nothing to report here. This measure stayed basically flat sequentially from Q2. It's at 13%, which is up 110 basis points over the same quarter last year but still well below our normal levels. So our customers renting in high-quality urban core buildings are showing very little desire to purchase a home.","Now moving on to occupancy. We maintained strong occupancy through the leasing season and we're now well positioned as we enter the final 2 months of the year. Occupancy is 95.6% as of this morning, which is 60 basis points higher than the same point last year. Our exposure is very healthy, and we have a 7.1% left-to-lease today. The normal softening through the fourth quarter has already begun, and we expect occupancy to trend down and close the year at about 95%, a starting point for 2013 which will be 30 or 40 basis points higher than the starting point we had coming into this year, 2012.","And that leads to base rents. The strength of our demands in the leasing season allowed us to keep pushing the base rents through late August. We actually peaked for the year -- the intra-year on August 20. So this intra-year rent peak came 30 days later than it did in 2011, which is an indication of the strong leasing velocity we enjoyed through the summer of 2012. Now normally -- naturally, since then, rents have moderated according to our normal seasonal patterns. The strongest base rent growth continues to come from the Pacific Northwest. Again, as of this week, San Francisco base rents are up 10% year-over-year. Denver is up 7% year-over-year and the base rents from Seattle were up 6% year-over-year, however, with Central Business District and the Eastside submarkets significantly higher and, of course, Tacoma, significantly lower and actually slightly negative.","Southern California base rents continue to improve. Los Angeles is up 3.5% year-over-year as of this week. Orange County is up 4%. And however, San Diego is still lagging with base rents up 2% year-over-year. Regarding our new residents' ability to pay higher rent levels, the average rent as a percent of income remains very healthy at 17.6%. And all other income and credit quality indicators are keeping pace with rents in our portfolio. So as we finish 2012, base rents will be about 4% above December of '11. This gives us an excellent starting point for further base rent growth through the cycle of 2013. Therefore, we believe base rents next year will grow between 4% and 5%.","And finally, renewals. Renewals remain strong and continue to support our revenue growth through the fourth quarter. Recent achieved renewals have been: August, we booked 5.3%; September, 5.7% and October renewals finished up 6.1%. We're quoting November and December well above 7% and expect to achieve increases booked renewals for these 2 months at or above 6%. So for 2013, we expect to sustain renewal increases in the range of 4.5% to 5.5%.","So in summary, we're very confident the balance of 2012 will position us for another solid year of revenue growth in 2013. And as David mentioned, we have embedded growth for 2013 north of 2%. Again, what this means is that if we were to freeze all rents and occupancy as of the first day of 2013 and applied no further increases in base rents and absolutely no increases on any renewals, we would mathematically achieve more than 2% growth in revenue. Of course, that's not going to happen. So based on our current expectations of continued growth, if base rent and renewal increases, coupled with steady occupancy for next year and in-place seasonal lease expiration schedule, we foresee the resulting revenue growth for 2013 of 4% to 5%.","Now David Santee will discuss our expenses. David?","David S. Santee","Thank you, Fred. As we've discussed previously, payroll, utilities and real estate tax account for 68% of our total expense, with real estate taxes being our largest expense line item at 30%. As expected, our core property level expenses, meaning everything but property management costs and real estate taxes, should essentially end the year flat as we continue to leverage technology and find creative ways to reinvent our operations. Innovation and then executing on that change has become a hallmark of our organization, and I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the efforts of all of our employees, both here at Two North and across the country, for allowing us to realize our 22nd consecutive quarter of expense growth below 3%.","Over the last 3 years, it's no secret that apartment fundamentals have improved dramatically. This continued improvement, coupled with the ongoing economic challenges of states and municipalities has not escaped notice of the tax man either. I'd like to take just 1 minute to walk you through our 2012 real estate taxes and also provide some insight as to what the next year may look like as we have re-forecasted our 2012 tax growth from 5.5 to the upper quartile of the 6 handle.","Because most actual tax bills are not determined until Q3, estimating full year real estate taxes is both art and science. Relying on historical outcomes is key to estimating future taxes. However, present economic circumstances are in no way reflective of historical actions by states and municipalities. Consequently, the actions by 3 states far exceeded even our most aggressive forecast. The State of Washington far exceeded rate forecast resulting in a 6.1% increase. Both Florida and Virginia issued back-to-back annual valuation increases, with 2012 being more aggressive than last year. Historically, when valuations are aggressive, tax rates are softened. This scenario did not play out for this year, which resulted in an 8.8% increase for Florida and a 15.1% increase in Virginia.","As for the Q3 expense of 9.3%, had we known in January what we know today, we would have reported a consistent quarterly expense in the high-6% range. To achieve our year-end forecast, the 9.3% reported in Q3 is the accounting adjustment needed to achieve a fully loaded year-to-date and revised full year expense target.","Now as we think about the 2013 environment, we see a very similar scenario playing out for both core operating expenses and real estate taxes, minimal core growth and another 6-plus handle for real estate taxes. Now again, a key driver, about 150 basis points for both 2012 and 2013 real estate tax growth, is directly attributable to our 421a tax abatement burn-off for our New York City portfolio. The balance is based on our projections of value and rate increases by market. And for now, our assumptions are more influenced by 2012 and 2013 realities versus historical norms. David?","David J. Neithercut","All right. Thanks, David. Let me turn now to transactions, which as we've said for quite some time now is really a reinvestment process for us as we continue to sell assets in our non-core markets and redeploy that capital into our core markets that we think will provide a superior long-term risk-adjusted total return for us.","So in the third quarter, we acquired 4 assets for $236 million, each great additions to our portfolio, 1 in Manhattan and 3 in California, 2 in the North and 1 in Southern California. We acquired a 98-unit property on 37th Street in Manhattan between 9th and 10th Avenues. This project probably was completed this year and originally intended to be condo product. As such, it has a very high quality with terrific finishes. And unlike most of the other condo deals we've acquired, this one was actually fully leased and was acquired for $84 million, $771,000 a door at a 4.9% cap rate.","We acquired 241 units in downtown San Mateo, about 16 miles south of downtown San Francisco. This property was built in 2 phases, an older property, first phase in '64 and the other in 1972. It was acquired for $93 million or $386,000 a door. This is a value add deal in which we intend to invest another $35,000 a door, which will result in a sub-4% yielded in the first year, but will produce a 5% return in short order and will soon deliver 6%-plus returns.","We also acquired a small property on Bluxome Street in downtown San Francisco. It was built in 2007. And I say small, both because it's only 102 units, but also because the average unit size is 233 square feet. It's perfect for our target demographic. The property has average rents of $1,750 per unit per month, which is hundreds of dollars below rents on larger studios in the area. The property was acquired for $23.9 million, $234,000 a door at a cap rate of 5%.","We've added to our terrific portfolio in downtown Los Angeles by acquiring a property that was originally built in 1925 and was -- got renovated and converted into apartments in 2006. This property contains 99 units, was acquired for $35.5 million, which is $328,000 a door at a cap rate of 4.2%.","On the disposition side, through the first 9 months of the year we sold $617 million of non-core assets, $281 million of which were sold last quarter. And so in the quarter just ending, we sold 2,153 units. This comprised of 3 assets in Orlando and 1 each in Phoenix, Atlanta and Maryland. And our last 2 assets developed by joint venture partners, 1 in New Jersey and 1 here in Chicago, which represents our complete exit from our headquarter city.","We've reduced our transactional guidance for the year on each side of the trade by $150 million. So we're now down to $1.1 billion of acquisitions and $1.1 billion of dispositions for the year. Now having sold only 56% of our disposition goal through 9\/30, we will have a lot to do in the fourth quarter. But so far this quarter, we've sold or have under contract $160 million of product. We have another $140 million under letter of intent and another several hundred million more in various stages of marketing. So we do think, as we sit here today, we'll be able to accomplish that.","On the development side, we continue to be very pleased with the results of our new developments recently brought online, the rate of unit absorption remains very strong and net effective rents are in excess of our original pro forma in every case. We continue to look for new opportunities to add high quality assets in great locations in our core markets through development and acquired 3 new parcels in the third quarter to do just that. These 3 sites will produce 794 total units at a total development cost of $270 million, with a weighted average yield on cost at current market rents in the mid-5 range, and these are in markets where high quality assets trade today in the low 4s, being Seattle and coastal Southern California.","We started one project in the third quarter. That's the third and smallest phase, our Westgate project in Pasadena, containing 88 units for $54 million. And we have 5 additional projects that are slated to start yet this year, 2 in Manhattan, 2 in Seattle and 1 in Washington D.C. There's certainly no guarantee that we'll get each of these started this year, and if we don't, they'll likely get underway in the first quarter of next year. But assuming that we do however, starts for this year will total 1,051 units, $543 million and deliver a 6% yield on current market rents, which we think will provide a stabilized yield of 7%.","Now we currently own sites for an additional 3,500 units with the development cost of nearly $1.4 billion in great locations in Boston, San Francisco, Seattle and Southern California, and continue to pursue opportunities for several billion dollars' more development.","So with that, Alicia, we'll be happy to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citi.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Thanks for all the detail on 2013. I'm a little surprised that you provided so much detail so early on. So just curious what prompted you to put out the revenue guidance earlier than you normally would?","David J. Neithercut","Well, look, we got a pretty clear sense out there that there's a lot of questions about 2013. And we felt that there was a lot of uncertainty, a lot of questions. We just felt that we had a clear enough sense about where we were headed, that it was appropriate to let the investment community know.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then just trying to dig into that 4% to 5% revenue growth projection a little bit more. You said that you're going to get like 2% or just over 2% from the earn in from last year, and then you're going to get 4% to 5% on base rents, 4.5% to 5.5% on renewals. I think that's what you said at least. Shouldn't that bring you sort of closer to 5% revenue growth or are you expecting a little bit of a dip in occupancy next year?","Frederick C. Tuomi","No, Eric. This is Fred. We're assuming that it's constant occupancy, and maybe a slight uptick in turnover, but you can't just do that math that simply. You have to take into consideration the seasonality of the lease expirations. They don't all expire January 1 and we can move everybody January 1, nor do they all expire conveniently exactly in the middle of the year. So you have to roll that through the actual expirations that we anticipate throughout the year, both those that are according to lease expirations and those that may terminate early. So it's not quite that direct.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. And then I guess just from a seasonality perspective, you would expect things to sort of trend the same way that you're seeing this year? Or is there any sort of change...","Frederick C. Tuomi","No. We're definitely back to a normal market intra-year seasonality curve. Maybe for the years of recession and the first-year recovery was a little bit different but really not materially. But this year, clearly, was -- we ramped up Q1, really pushed things during the leasing season, separate from the comps, so you really get aggressive on the rents and then we start moderating as demand moderates. So you really have to follow the demand cycle, and demand cycle is certainly is seasonal in this business.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then just last question on supply. We've obviously seen the starts number continue to decline, I think 260 last month. When you look at that number, is there a certain level that starts concerning you? I know it's very regional for you. So maybe if you think about it just for your markets, like what's the level that starts concerning you looking forward?","Frederick C. Tuomi","We don't really react to an overall number. Just per our core markets, I did look at that. In 2012, we have 37,000 units coming in, which is the lowest we've ever seen it other than the 2011. And for '13, we see 54,000 units coming into our markets, and just for comparison, back in '09, we had 67,000 and in '08 we had 57,000. So still below those years. But that's really not that important. What's more important is that on a market basis and a submarket basis, and really down to the street basis, where are those new deals coming out? How are they pricing? How are they incenting their absorption, lease up schedule through concessions, and what's the impact on our specific properties? You really have to build it from property level up.","David J. Neithercut","Yes, and you also have look at the demand sides, also, Eric. I mean, we look at expected household formations and job growth in those markets and look at what historical average institutional-grade apartments sort of capture rate of that growth is. And frankly, in many of these markets, we don't think that new supply will meet that incremental new demand.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dave Bragg with Zelman & Associates.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Another question on the 2013 outlook that you provided. Can you talk about the markets that will be positive contributors to revenue growth in terms of better revenue growth in 2013 than 2012, and the markets that you expect to see the biggest -- the largest deceleration from 2012 into 2013?","Frederick C. Tuomi","Yes, Dave, this is Fred again. We're not going to give market-by-market guidance. We really don't give it even later in the process, we're certainly not going to give it now. But you can just kind of look at the trends. The trends are very strong. In the strong markets, those trends will continue because we have that embedded growth that's going to carry us forward, and the markets that a little bit weaker, less so. And I would say just generally, in terms of deceleration, the only one I would worry about would be Washington, D.C. We've talked a lot about D.C. It's still holding up quite well right now. In fact, it's looking great. But we all know there's 2 big things coming at us; the big supply coming at us in D.C, highly focused on the district and close in. And then the big question mark of the fiscal cliff or the sequestration, which if it happens, could be very disruptive to that market. So I would expect D.C. really to be the only market concerned about a deceleration, not negative, but certainly deceleration of growth. The others, I think, you just look at the current trends will continue.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Okay. And just on the lower turnover, what does this tell you -- that seeing these trends, which I don't think you necessarily expected. Does it mean that the renters that came in at -- during 2009 and '10 at discounted rents, they effectively traded up? That they have departed and now you're working through a resident base with a higher income and a better ability to take on these increases?","Frederick C. Tuomi","Thank you. I couldn't have said it any better myself. Yes, that's exactly it. The turnover being 58.2, that's right, really, on top of our original expectation for this year. But we did revise that expectation up after we saw turnover increasing in early part of the year. And I think that exactly kind of reversed itself, due to -- as newer residents coming in, they're used to paying those levels. They don't have the historical perspective of \"Gee, I was paying much lower rent back in '08, '09 and '10.\" And so it's not as much of a shock. And of course, the incomes, they're moving up nicely as well. So I think people are set and they're not buying homes. They are staying put with this urban core, great assets, great walk score, where they want to live. They're not buying homes because if they were to buy home today, they have to go way up the burbs and fight the inner city. So we're seeing very good stability in our resident base and our retention.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","And just one question for Mark. Mark, can you talk about the plans to address the line balance?","Mark J. Parrell","Yes. So the line balance is about $850 million. It'll get paid down about $250 million just because we're going to have a lot more in dispositions in the fourth quarter to meet our guidance numbers than we've had to date. So the real amount of issue here is really something like $600 million. Most of that is the term loan that we just recently paid off, which was floating rate debt. So we do want a portion of the revolver to stay outstanding and have a floating rate debt component. And finally, we still do have our hedges in place. We have about $200 million in swaps-to-fixed that protect us. So it isn't a matter of if, it's a matter of when we access the unsecured market. But it won't need to be a particularly large deal and doesn't need to be particularly soon, because I do want to have some floating rate exposure. And with the line, we can maintain exposure around 13%. If we termed it all out, we would end up having floating rate exposure of 5% or 6%, and I just don't think that's quite the number we're looking for. It is certainly a very attractive market to term debt out right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","I just have a quick question. I'm not sure if you can answer it, but I just want to talk about some of the acquisitions and dispositions and kind of the math. If we look at the assets that you are buying in aggregate in the quarter, what would you estimate the sort of 3-year growth rate would be on those rents roughly?","David J. Neithercut","I can't tell you what the 3-year average weighted growth rate would -- is going to be on these, but I will tell you that we will -- and these assets will be -- we're buying in the 4s and we'll quickly be in the 5s and moving towards 6. So -- but again on a dollar weighted average basis, I wouldn't have it off the top of my head.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Understandable. And then on the stuff that you're selling in the 6 cap, how would you put the -- how would you characterize the growth on those rents, maybe on a comparable period, whatever that might be?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I guess, we don't really look at it in that short of increment, David. We really look at over a longer period of time. And while some of those markets may have very strong growth in the next year or so, new supply will quickly put an end to that. We just think over an extended time period, which is really our investment horizon, that we'll have a better overall total rate of return by making these trades. We're also looking at just where we're trading assets, not simply on a cap rate basis but on an absolute basis, and where those dollars are relative to replacement costs in those markets. And we think that the absolute price per pound makes sense for us.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. My last question, and I apologize if you covered this. I jumped on a bit late. Are you seeing any -- in your transaction sort of pipeline, acquisition pipeline, are you seeing any upward movement in cap rates in some of sort of secondary, tertiary market that might come across your desk?","David J. Neithercut","Well, on the acquisition side, we're only in the primary markets, what we're acquiring. I probably see maybe a little bit on the D.C. side. But generally, I think on average, cap rates have held fairly close, been fairly stable through much of this year. And because of improvements on the bottom line, you've seen modest increases in value during the year.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And actually that wasn't my last question. I want to squeeze in one more. Are you seeing any change in the, let's say, on the buyer side for the assets that you're selling relative to how those parties our underwriting assets going forward? If there's no movement on the cap rate, are you seeing any additional conservatism on the part of the buyer relative to their outlook?","David J. Neithercut","No. I'd say I think a lot of this is sort of lender-driven. I'm now -- turning now to the assets that we're selling. I think that a lot of what people can pay is a function of Fannie and Freddie, but they're out there, they're lending. They're going to have big books this year. They're as busy as can be, and that's providing capital that actually allow us to continue to sell these assets and allow us to get disposition prices that are in the high 5s to mid-6s.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Maybe one for David or Mark. If I heard correctly, you guys were talking about 6% real estate tax growth in 2013. Did I get that right?","Mark J. Parrell","That's correct.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then sort of flattish to up slightly for the other 70% of your expense load?","Mark J. Parrell","That's how we're seeing it today.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. So that's going to basically put expense growth somewhere in the 2% to 3% for next year?","Mark J. Parrell","That's how the math works.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay, perfect. I wanted to make sure that I had all of that right. Okay. And I guess the -- a couple of quick other ones. The land parcels that you guys bought this quarter, is it -- is there still a lot of work that needs to be done there is why the construction is not starting there for another 18-plus months? Or is it something that you guys are looking at where you don't want to deliver supply into those markets in according to with the bulk of what's happening there?","David J. Neithercut","Well, most of what we've acquired, Rob, is zoned and entitled, and we just need sort of plan review, and it just takes a little while to get that stuff done. But there's not a lot of risk in getting consents and approvals, it's just getting plans done and plans reviewed and approved.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then, I guess lastly, what's the size of the redevelopment opportunity in your sort of ongoing core portfolio today that's over and above what is just sort of general sort of maintenance CapEx, which would actually be revenue-producing in terms of -- whether or not it's kitchens and baths or more wholesale stuff on well-located stuff that maybe just has a little bit of age on it?","Mark J. Parrell","Yes. I think, you should expect to see us -- we have something along the lines -- and we talk about that a little bit on Page 22 -- something along the lines of 4,000 to 5,000 units a year in a portfolio, give or take 100,000. So I mean a lot of our locations are just terrific locations and you just need to keep the product up-to-date. So I'm not sure that there is a cumulative number I can give you, which is I think what your question was. But I think a run rate of us doing rehabs that are fairly material on 4% or 5% of the portfolio is probably what we would end up doing.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","And, I mean, is that just what you think that you can do, or I mean, is there the opportunity for you guys if the acquisition market starts to become less attractive that you could deploy capital there faster than you would otherwise would have, or is it just mutually exclusive, that that's what basically your opportunity that is.","Mark J. Parrell","I appreciate the question, but just on order of magnitude, we spent $40 million on rehabs. And though the returns are very solid, they're -- I mean that's one asset we would acquire. So I'm not sure that toggling rehabs, even doubling them, to a company of our size is going to make a great deal of difference.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jana Galan of Bank of America.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I think you have a small handful of assets that cater to students. Given the increase in student housing communities marketed for sale, I was curious if you're looking at those or would want to expand in that business?","Mark J. Parrell","I'm sorry, to increase our exposure or decrease our exposure?","David J. Neithercut","Increase.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Increase.","Mark J. Parrell","No. I think that we certainly got -- have assets, and even assets that we have acquired in urban locations, that do have some students but the percentage is certainly smaller. We do have properties, for instance in Orlando, which would be part of assets that we'd likely sell in the near future. We also do have some development sites in Berkeley, California, which we intend to build, which would certainly be attractive to students. So it's not a big part of our strategy. It would really be just on the margin.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then Fred, thank you so much for your comments on the supply in D.C. I was just curious if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in Seattle?","Frederick C. Tuomi","Yes, Seattle is doing great right now, especially downtown and the Eastside. Snohomish is just a little bit softer. And then Tacoma -- we do have a fairly large portfolio in Tacoma, and it's still kind of underwater. But Seattle has a great run. I mean, tech employment is very high. Amazon is hiring a lot of people. Microsoft has a lot of different projects going on, hiring a lot of people. Google is moving in big time into Seattle. The biotech is great. So it's really a great story in Seattle all the way around. But the supply is an issue. We've got 3,000 units this year, 5,000 units next year, and that supply is pretty much concentrated in the downtown area and the fringe of downtown, in places like Ballard, and some are even in West Seattle. But the absorption is strong. And there's a lot of people in the renter demographic that are coming into the city. A lot of people from the other areas are moving into downtown and doing a reverse commute. So we think the absorption is going to be there to meet that supply. And if it doesn't, we may have a little bit of an issue in certain -- those concentrated areas, primarily the CBD, but it's going to be short-lived. So the supply for '13 and '14 -- I would say it's a moderate issue but not a big issue because the demand should be there to meet it.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then I guess I'm just curious if the 2013 revenue growth number, is there a certain job growth expectation in that?","Frederick C. Tuomi","No. We don't go from macro to micro. We consider the macro environment, but we build these things from the ground up, what's in place and the trends and asset by asset. So we don't really take a headline number and then peg our operations based on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Andrew Schaffer - Sandler O'Neill","Andrew Schaffer here. I'd first like to ask you about -- I think I heard you had $200 million of -- around unassigned hedges, and I was wondering what kind of effect that would have on the all-in rate of a 10-year or a 30-year unsecured issuance?","Frederick C. Tuomi","So that 10-year hedge is about $200 million or $44 million to the negative right now. So basically you'd take the $44 million divide it by 10 and then whatever the amount of the notional is. So I'm not sure I'm going to do that math in my head right now, but it's probably on a $400 million deal, something like 1%.","Andrew Schaffer - Sandler O'Neill","Okay. And does that change the way you think about the -- issuing 10-year versus 30-year paper, because I know in the past you said you kind of prefer to shy away from the 30-year?","Mark J. Parrell","The hedges don't really have anything to do with our thought process on 30-year debt. The hedges are there to just allow us to access the market at an opportune time. Our concerns about a 30-year debt have a lot more to do with just having covenants that are real and substantive continue on for such a long period of time. To handcuff our successor-successor-successor with those kind of important and substantive covenants on leverage is just something we need to be careful about. and to this point, we haven't had any appetite to do.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","You talked a little bit -- you gave quite a bit of detail on operations for '13 and you also talked about development starts in the fourth quarter. Can you give us a sense just as you're putting the plans together, what you're thinking on the development side, what you could start for '13 as well?","David J. Neithercut","Well, again, a lot of it is just timing and what can actually be started in the year, what might have to be pushed into the next year. But as we look at our agenda today, we've got $700 million of product that could start in 2013, Mike.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And that's in addition to the $540 million you talked about in the fourth quarter?","David J. Neithercut","That's correct.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Second question, you had a 170 basis points spread during the quarter. And I know you've talked about looking at price per pound as well, but at what point does that spread become too wide?","David J. Neithercut","Well, again, it's more value. Look, we have -- we're on record as having said that we're going to exit certain of these markets and try and redeploy that capital. And when we find assets to buy that we think makes sense for a long-term investment standpoint and can match that up against sales that we think make sense -- and it's not just simply cap rates. I mean, we certainly do pay attention to that delta, but it's also just where can we sell assets on a price per pound versus what we think replacement costs are on those markets and we try to decide if that makes sense. So I wouldn't focus so much on the 170. A lot of that is just the complexion of what happened to be sold in one quarter versus what happened to be acquired in one quarter. Historically, we've seen that delta to be about 125 basis points. It'll be a little wider now because we've seen more aggressive pricing where we want to invest, and cap rates, I think, being held up a little bit in the markets we want to sell. But we really -- we do look at the absolute values in those markets and still do think that those represent decent prices for us to exit that.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","But as you're underwriting these transactions, have you changed your rent growth assumptions at all in the last 6 months?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I guess -- I've been asked that question a lot. And I will tell you, our 2013 sort of rent growth assumptions are probably pretty consistent with what they thought they -- we -- they were going to be back in 2010 and 2011. So as we look forward 12 months today, they're probably less than what we look at 12 months forward, 12 months ago. But I don't think we're looking at 2013 today any differently the way we look at 2013 for a while.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then the final, where could you issue unsecured paper today? That one is probably for Mark. And then I'm just curious for your '13 outlook, what your expectations are for Southern California? Seems like you had a pretty decent ramp-up there. I wonder if you expect that to continue into '13, and if you expect Southern California to be among your better performing markets there.","Mark J. Parrell","I'm going to address the debt issue. It's Mark. Right now, I think, we could issue 10-year unsecured paper at something between, say, 3% and 3.1%. On the secured side, just by means of comparison, I think, that would be more like 3.3% right now. And I'll push it back to Fred for the SoCal question.","Frederick C. Tuomi","Yes. Southern California continues to improve. You can see that in our numbers. I wouldn't say it's like screaming back. But it's good, steady, consistent improvement, whereas 18 months ago, we were complaining that it was start\/stop, 2 steps forward\/1 step back, kind of lumping [ph] kind of thing. So it is consistent improvement in moving up. I'd say that both L.A. and Orange County have some good job growth rate now. L.A. is a little bit more back-loaded this year, so it remains to be seen. But Orange County has some good broad-based steady improvement on the job front. So rents are still below the peak levels. We still have a little bit more juice to get back to those levels. So I think it's to be expected they'll continue to be one of our better performers, I wouldn't say maybe the best, but one of the better performers next year. Now, there's 2 risk areas. The biggest risk is just California. It's still very messed up as we know, and they've got some serious fiscal issues in the state of California and some legislative things coming up here in this next vote which is really going to be an issue. If California has to really cut expenses, then there could be some severe cuts in government jobs and education, et cetera. So that could take some of the growth fervor out of it. And then also, we have a little bit of supply coming into L.A. On a macro basis, it's not a big number based on the size of that market, but it's highly concentrated in downtown, Wilshire and San Fernando Valley again. So maybe a little bit of issue there. Orange County looks great. San Diego has always been the laggard, but it's got a lot of good things going on, broad base, good job growth. But the military and defense sector overhang there is a little bit of a concern. It's going to keep San Diego, I think, still in third place.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Philip Martin with Morningstar.","Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","A question on just the overall Equity Residential portfolio. Nationally or by individual market, are you experiencing any meaningful shift in average length of stay by the tenant?","David S. Santee","This is David Santee. We look at that every quarter. I would say that -- well, as we continue to transition our portfolio, typically, high-rise buildings have much lower turnover than garden communities. When you look at on a market-by-market basis, the average length of stay in, say, a New York, a New England, a Boston, a San Francisco is double that, almost 3 years, versus the commodity markets like Phoenix, Atlanta, Orlando, which is about 1.6 years.","Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. Okay. And when you look at the 17.6% rent -- average rent as a percent of income, take us back over the last, call it, 5 to 10 years and what has been -- kind of pre-crisis, what was that number and how has that changed over the last 5 years or so?","Frederick C. Tuomi","This is Fred. I can't give you that number going back 10 years. But since we've been focused on here the last several years, it really hasn't changed. It's 17 range. The median is 21, 22. And it's been fairly consistent, and if there's been any movement, it's just getting more favorable. Again, related to what David mentioned about our portfolio shift, we're getting better assets, better locations, better residents, better incomes and much higher rents. So I think it's very steady and stable, and if anything, improving on the margin.","Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. Okay. My last question. In terms of the new supply, it sounds like in certainly your core markets, the supply -- existing and new supply coming on is not of this institutional quality where yours is. Is that a fair statement? Because, I mean, again, I know it's property-by-property as opposed to market-by-market, but I'm just trying to get a sense of -- because we hear \"new development starts,\" and it may look high, but is it really competitive product when compared to your institutional quality product or your location? I'm just trying to get a better sense of the competitive supply.","Mark J. Parrell","Right. Yes. I understand. We look at it really asset-by-asset, and what's coming into its location is going to be a competitive threat to our existing assets. Now, in some markets you do see a headline numbers, like say, Boston is going to have 3,000 units delivered. Well, if you look at those, we're not really too concerned because a lot it is out in the suburbs and a lot of it are small properties and a lot of it are affordable product. So you're right. So a lot of these are smaller in-locations that don't impact institutional assets and are affordable nature that don't compete with our resident set. But I can tell you too that we do have an issue. D.C., a lot of these products coming out are right in our wheelhouse. I mean they're institutional grade, high-quality, great located buildings are being developed. So I'm not going to say we're not going to have competitive threat, but you just can't react to a headline number.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Harris with Imperial Capital.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Excuse me if you did not cover this, because you've already made reference to these points. But NAREIT over the summer, David, you referenced to some elements of conditionality regarding the Archstone payments. Those no longer are relevant to the second payment that -- what you've referenced is being likely to be included in the fourth quarter.","Mark J. Parrell","David, it's Mark Parrell. That expired about October 4, that conditionality. So we will recognize the remaining $80 million in income in the fourth quarter.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Okay, good. And then one final question on the acquisition and sales, to meet your full year targets, it looks like you've got to be looking to buy about $200 million and sell $500 million, is that right?","Mark J. Parrell","That's the math.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","That's the math. Any idea or timing on some of that, David?","David J. Neithercut","Well, it will be in the fourth quarter David. I mean are you looking for November 17?","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Well, I don't know where I'm going with that question. It's always good to introduce levity into these rather [boring] [ph] conference calls, I have learned after all these years. The -- where I'm going with that is, are any deals this side of the election or are any people expressing any sensitivity, either both buyers or -- you as a buyer or potential sellers, around the election?","David J. Neithercut","No, I don't think so at all, David. I think that certainly you can see changes in activities result of year end. But I don't think -- we've got nothing that's contingent on the election that would change the sellers' mind or our mind. That's -- we're running our business, we're going -- doing what we can do, and are not concerned about the election.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Patinkin with BMO Capital Markets.","Joshua Patinkin - BMO Capital Markets","On the development side, you're underwriting projects to 5.5% yield on today's rents. Just trying to get a feel for if project costs or material costs are going to move commensurately with rent growth or how you're viewing that?","David J. Neithercut","Well, we do trend increases in construction costs from our underwriting to the time that we would expect to be able to start pricing jobs out. And I'll tell you that we think construction costs are still maybe down 10% from peak, but are rising. And most of our markets will be up sort of mid-single digits this year.","Joshua Patinkin - BMO Capital Markets","And how about labor costs, or is that part of the whole picture?","David J. Neithercut","Well that would be part of that calculus.","Joshua Patinkin","Okay. Great. I believe Rich is on the line with a question as well.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Let's assume for a second that the housing recovery is real and that we don't go to 59% homeownership rate. Tell me what the opportunity is from your perspective, the multifamily perspective, considering that people getting a job, rent -- building a home, for example, may not be your target tenant?","David J. Neithercut","I'm not -- I mean, people that are getting a job and building a home?","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Yes. I mean, everyone is saying, \"Well, this is great because it will create job growth,\" but are those the types of people that are going to rent an apartment from you? And I'm just curious if there will be downward pressure in that environment from people [indiscernible].","David J. Neithercut","I think that improvements in the single-family space is just good for the economy. And whether or not the guy who is now hanging drywall is our resident or not, I think that's good for the economy. And that will be good for everyone. So...","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","But as good, as good -- I mean, a moderation should be expected, correct, even in that improving economy environment?","David J. Neithercut","A moderation of what?","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Of growth, rent growth.","David J. Neithercut","Well, we just said we're going from 5-plus to 4 to 5.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","That's really not moderation. That's rounding or kind of...","David J. Neithercut","Well, call it whatever you want. I mean, look, we think that multifamily supply, new incremental multifamily supply will not meet what we think will be incremental new demand. We obviously targeted on this 80-million strong echo boomer generation, and we think they are interested in buying a single-family home, while they may want to, they'll act on that later. David Santee told you what the average occupancy is in our units. So we don't think the single-family homes are a huge threat to us. We don't think multifamily supply, maybe outside of D.C. and San Jose and maybe a little bit in Seattle short-term, will be long-term threat. We think that the space today is pretty well-positioned to perform above -- well-above trend for some time to come. I mean, I can't tell you that's -- what level of moderation that sort of means, but we're certainly not suggesting 2013 will show the same percentage growth we've seen the last couple of years. But still, we think very strong on a historical basis.","Mark J. Parrell","I would think that the majority of people who are going to be the first to jump and buy a home are probably those renting homes today, not living in apartments. And those that are come back onto the payroll, from the construction jobs and other homebuilding-related recovery, I don't think they're going to go from unemployed to employed to homeownership.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And just an unrelated question. Is -- in your mind, putting aside your involvement in Archstone, is an IPO from that company good for the space or bad for the space, in your opinion?","David J. Neithercut","I guess I'll leave that up to the analysts like you and to the investors. We -- they're hell-bent on going public. We continue to think and have thought as you know for a long time that it made sense to maybe do something with us. But looks like they're going to go public, and the market will react to that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies & Company.","Omotayo T.

Welcome to Equity Residential's Fourth Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded today, Thursday, February 2, 2012. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Marty McKenna. Please go ahead, sir.","Marty McKenna","Thanks, Camille. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's fourth quarter 2011 results and our outlook for 2012. Our featured speakers today are David Neithercut, our President and CEO; Fred Tuomi, our EVP of Property Management; David Santee, our EVP of Property Operations; and Mark Parrell, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before I turn it over to our team for their comments, I want to point out an error contingent of the release we issued yesterday. On Page 12 of the release, the data for our same-store year-over-year turnover is incorrect, as we inadvertently calculated the numbers using 9\/30 year-to-date data. The full year 2011 number should be 57.8% instead of 44.4% and the full year 2010 number should be 56.9% instead of 44.1%. Fred Tuomi will provide some color on our expectations for 2012 turnover in his remarks. We apologize for this error, and we'll issue an updated release after our call. And we thank Dave Bragg from Zelman & Associates for catching this error and bringing it to our attention. ","Lastly, let me remind you that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Law. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.","And now I'll turn the call over to David Neithercut.","David J. Neithercut","Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We're extremely pleased with the company's operating performance in the fourth quarter, which wrapped up a very good year for Equity Residential. And on behalf of everyone here, we want to thank the thousands of our colleagues across the country that continue to deliver these very strong results for us.","Our same-store net operating income for the full year of 7.7% was nearly spot-on the high end of the guidance range we gave you exactly 1 year ago. And this performance was a result of continued strength in fundamentals, driven by a huge demographic of our population that is not just simply in their prime rental years, but one that's currently shunning the commitment and financial risk of single-family homeownership, and is instead embracing the optionality and flexibility, the lifestyle really provided by rental housing. ","At the same time, new supply has been severely limited in some markets and almost nonexistent in others. And this leads to tight markets with high retention, low vacancy and rising rental rates. So we're very confident that 2012 will be another very good year. And Fred Tuomi is going to take a moment now and take you through the baseline assumptions for our key revenue drivers for this year.","Frederick C. Tuomi","Thank you, David. So as noted in our press release last night, our guidance for 2012 revenue growth is between 5% and 6%. And we continue to see strength in virtually all of our markets, actually in all of our markets, and the fundamental factors of supply and demand remain in our favor. The combined forces of demographics, household formations and the continued aversion to homeownership will ensure a strong demand for rental housing. And this is further supported by gradual improvements in job creation, especially within our younger, college-educated urban cohort for unemployment now stands at 4.1% versus 8.5% overall.","Our resident base is very healthy due to its high level of employment, good income growth and a demonstrated ability and desire to pay higher rents for quality rental housing. On average as a percent of income, our rent is currently 17.2%. This is a very good number and actually down slightly from last quarter. And this is versus the 33% threshold we typically use to qualify new applicants. And the household income of new residents acquired in 2011 was 4.4% greater than those residents moving in with us during 2010. So this year, some of the strongest revenue growth will come from Boston, New York and San Francisco. And in these key markets, we see continued stability in the financial sector and continued growth from technology, new media, business services and the health sciences. The more challenging markets will include San Diego and to no surprise, the D.C. Metro area. ","So regarding our 2012 revenue guidance, I'll again discuss the 4 key drivers in more detail. And those are: resident turnover; our physical occupancy; base rent pricing, meaning net effective rates on new leases; and then our renewal pricing. The first, turnover. One of the benefits we've seen from this renter nation phenomenon is structurally lower resident turnover, and this has been evident since really late 2008 and 2009. In 2011, as rents were recovering, turnover actually increased slightly but well inside of our expectations that we gave to you last year. So our turnover assumption for this year's same-store set is 58%, which is up slightly from the prior year.","Occupancy. Our occupancy assumption is 95.2%, which is no change from 2011. So with relatively stable turnover, solid occupancy, the revenue forecast really comes again down to rate, meaning base rents for new leases and then the achieved renewal rates. So base rent pricing. Coming into 2012, what we said right now today, our base rents are up 7% over the same time last year. We feel very good about this and the forward trend for the next several weeks looks very encouraging.","Throughout this year, base rents will follow the typical seasonal pattern, this means that we'll have continued growth from Q1 and Q2, we'll strike an interyear peak in Q3, and then the typical seasonal softening into Q4. So on average over the year 2012, we expect these base rents to run approximately 5.5% above the 2011 levels. And this implies a narrowing as we approach the peak Q3 comp period of last year.","And finally, renewal pricing. We achieved renewal increases above 6% during the fourth quarter and this trend is continuing as we've turned the corner into this year. January renewals are now done at 6.7%. February is at 6.2% so far, and we've booked 1,800 March renewals at an average increase of 6.1%.  So for the full year 2012, we expect average renewal increases of between 5% and 6%. And this also implies a narrowing as we again approach the peak Q3 comp period of 2011.","So to recap our explanation of our guidance, we expect turnover up slightly to 58% on the 2012 same-store set, occupancy very steady at 95.2%, average base rent pricing growth of 5.5% and average renewal increases of between 5% and 6%. Therefore, the revenue growth for the full year 2012 should come in between 5% and 6%. David?","David J. Neithercut","All right. Thanks, Fred. So as Fred said, the midpoint of our 2012 same-store guidance then is 5.5%, and that's actually 50 basis points higher than our actual results for 2011. I'll have to say that 2011 had a much easier comp set than 2012 will. So clearly, we see continued strength in fundamentals across our markets.","Now in addition to delivering great top line growth over the last several years, we've worked very hard to make our operations more efficient, and that's following an extensive review of our operating model several years ago. This has led a compounded annual growth in same-store expenses of just over 1 percentage point in each of the last 5 years. And our guidance for 2012 same-store expense growth is 1.5% to 2.5%. And David Santee is now going to break that down and give you some color as to how we're getting to this range.","David S. Santee","Okay. Thank you, David. For more color on our 2012 guidance for same-store property expense, I'll start with the 3 key drivers that account for 68% of total operating expense. These are real estate taxes, utilities and payroll. The headline for 2012 expense guidance can best be explained by this, what the gas man giveth, the tax man taketh away.","As expected, real estate taxes are on the rise and account for 29% of all expenses. On a GAAP basis for 2012, and GAAP is gross taxes net of all appeals and refunds, we would expect to see a year-over-year increase of 4% to 5%. 1\/3 or approximately 160 basis points of this GAAP increase of 4% to 5% is a result of our scheduled 421a tax abatement burnoff on 5 New York City assets. Given our ongoing portfolio transformation, Florida remains the only significant state with a potential to surprise and adversely impact overall expectations.","Utilities and energy, which account for 16% of operating expense, continue to move in opposite directions. Water, sewer and trash utilities continue to grow well above inflationary levels as municipalities scramble for revenue to deal with aging and antiquated infrastructure, as well as finding alternative measures to dispose of waste.  It's also important to note that we recover over 83% of this expense on an annual basis through our Resident Utility Billing System or what we called RUBS. Offsetting this growth was our decision to ride the natural gas market to new 3-year lows versus our execution of our annual rate lock in the deregulated Northeast markets. By our measure, lower natural gas rates should also lead to lower electricity costs as generation plants move away from coal as a result of more stringent emission requirements and a glut of natural gas. Additionally, our internal initiatives around waste management will also mitigate rate growth in this area in the near-term, resulting in a year-over-year growth rate for all utilities of 1.5% to 2.5%.","For on-site payroll, which represents almost 23% of total operating expense, we expect a year-over-year growth rate in the 1% range. Our laser focus on leveraging technology and automation continue to provide benefits that mitigate our annual merit increases and allow us to find optimal staffing levels across all asset types. All other account groups, making up the remaining 32% of operating expense, contribute an additional 20 to 40 basis points of growth, with property insurance up 6% to 7% and leasing and advertising costs down 7% to 9%. Maintenance, property management and other operating expenses combined are expected to be flat.","With that said, we're extremely pleased with our ability to deliver another year of exceptional performance in managing our costs, while continuing to increase our customer loyalty, employee engagement and other internal quality metrics.  David?","David J. Neithercut","Terrific. Thanks a lot, David. Well, turning now to transaction activity, you'll recall that we suggested at the beginning of last year that we expected our acquisition activity to be very lumpy, and indeed it was, having closed more than 50% of the entire year's acquisitions in the fourth quarter alone. ","In the quarter, we acquired 11 assets representing 3,669 units for $681 million. 4 of these were in Southern California, 3 in Northern California, 2 in Boston and 1 each in Brooklyn, New York and Bethesda, Maryland. Lastly, we also continue to sell noncore assets and reduce our overall exposure to noncore markets. We sold 47 assets during the year or just under $1.5 billion at a weighted average cap rate of 6.5% and realized a weighted average unleveraged IRR, inclusive of management costs, of 11.1%. And again, a very lumpy activity with nearly 80% of these or $1.2 billion being done in the first half of the year, when we aggressively hit good bids for our noncore assets, after which time we had to take a breather and let our acquisition activity catch up.","We begin 2012 looking at the transaction market as very similar to last year, and that means an awful lot of capital, chasing relatively little supply in our core markets, as well as continued demand for assets in noncore markets, with a cap rate spread between the 2 that remains as wide as we've seen for quite some time. Now brokers are telling us that they're being asked by owners to value more core assets, which lead these brokers to believe that more product might be coming to market. But I'll tell you, we haven't seen it yet. And cap rates on core product in our markets across country today remain in the 4s, as investors continue to underwrite strong revenue growth for the next several years as well as enjoy a low interest rate environment.","With the acquisition market intensely competitive in 2011, last year was a big year for our development business. We started construction on 6 projects last year, totaling $656 million in completed costs. Now of that, $423 million is really our share because 2 of those deals that we started were done with a joint venture with an institutional partner. We expect our 2011 development starts to deliver weighted average yields in the low 6s at today's rents and we started 3 of these in the fourth quarter. The Madison in Alexandria, Virginia, $115 million total cost, we have an expectation of a yield in the mid-6s on current rents in The Madison. We started the deal in Ballard, Washington, our Market Street Landing property with a $90 million total cost and a low 6% expected yield on current rents. And we also started construction on the second phase of a property in Pasadena, California for $125 million total cost at a high 4% or low 5% expected current yield on that property.","During 2011, we also acquired 6 land parcels that entered into a 1 long-term ground lease, all for future development totaling $725 million of new product. 4 of these properties or these parcels were acquired in the fourth quarter. A property in San Francisco's Mission Bay area for 273 units, $154 million total cost at a high 5% yield expected on current rents. We also acquired a land parcel on Anaheim, California for 220 units, $52 million total cost and a low 6% yield expected on current rents. And also a parcel in West Seattle, Washington for 206 units and $62 million of total cost, where we expect a 6% yield on current rents. Lastly, we also acquired a site in Manhattan, the southwest corner of Park Avenue South and East 28th Street. That property was acquired with Toll Brothers, with whom we will develop -- co-develop a 40-story building on the site. Of the $134 million paid for that land parcel, $76 million was contributed by Equity and $58 million was contributed by Toll Brothers. When completed, EQR will own 6,500 square feet of ground floor retail and 265 rental apartments on floor 2 through 22 and Toll will own and sell as condos 99 units on floors 23 through 40. Now Equity Residential's total cost or what we will own at the end of the day is $238 million. That's $897,000 a door and a little more than $1,000 per square foot. ","Well, we've underwritten an expected yield on current rents in the mid-5s. Now I'll tell you, current rents of what we underwrote were rents in the mid-$6 rent per square foot, and we're very pleased to report that our recently completed Ten23 asset on the High Line in Chelsea is at lease-up today and achieving numbers in excess of that. And as described in the footnotes in last night's press release, until the core and shell are complete, we will own the land and building in a joint venture with Toll. And as a result, we will have to consolidate all the costs for that project while it's consolidated. At that time though the core and shell are complete, our interest will be converted into condominium interest. They'll own their floors, we'll own our floors, each subject to a master condominium regime, and we will no longer consolidate Toll's interest in the building.","So in 2012, we currently expect to be in a position to start 8 projects, representing 2,014 units, totaling $750 million of total development costs. These land sites are all currently on our balance sheet, but will be by the end of February. We have 2 in New York City, 2 in South Florida, 2 in Seattle and 1 each in Southern California and D.C. Current underwriting suggests the yield line costs in the low 6s on current rents on these assets, and we're very excited to soon add them to our portfolio. I'll turn then the call now over to Mark.","Mark J. Parrell","Thanks, David. This morning, I'm really going to focus on 2 areas. First, our recent financing activity in our balance sheet, and as you can see from the release, we're very busy in that area this quarter, as well as our 2012 guidance. So we've been busy both refinancing our 2011 and early 2012 debt maturities and also lining up financing for our potential acquisition of an interest in Archstone.","So the first thing we really needed to do is to address our 2011 and early 2012 debt maturities. Up until December of 2011, we had raised almost no money in the debt markets to finance 2011 debt maturities of about $1.1 billion, so we had some work to do. There were really 2 reasons for that. Our large cash balance through most of 2011, as David said, we were big net disposers early in 2011, and the existence of our interest rate hedges. So through the third quarter of '11, we were such a large net seller that the substantial excess cash we had, we invested temporarily in repaying our debt. As I said in my third quarter earnings call remarks, it was always our intention to reborrow these funds once acquisition activity caught up with dispositions. As I also said on the third quarter call, we expected a catch-up in investment activity to occur in the fourth quarter, and that indeed is what occurred. We also had about $750 million in interest rate hedges, which locked in a borrowing rate for us. ","So on to the specifics. We did $1 billion unsecured notes offering in early December 2011. These notes mature December 15, 2021. They have a coupon rate of 4.625% and an all-in effective rate of about 6.2%. And that includes the effective fees and interest rate hedges. And really most of that difference between the 4.625% and the 6.2% is the amortization of the $150 million in swap termination costs that the company incurred. So we were very pleased with how the fixed income offering went. We had a terrific response from our investors. We had over $3 billion in solid demand, and that allowed us to substantially tighten the spread and increase the size of the offering. The remaining proceeds from this offering, which sit now on our balance sheet in cash, will be used to repay the $250 million in unsecured debt that matures in March of 2012. And this prefunding will lower 2012 Normalized FFO by about $0.01.","Now just a comment on the ATM . As many of you know, we use the ATM primarily to fund our normal investment activity, including our increased development activity. So we did access the ATM program in the fourth quarter. We issued about 828,000 common shares at an average price of $57.31 per share for total consideration of approximately $47.4 million. And we did access the ATM again in January 2012. We issued about 201,000 common shares at an average price of $57.87 per share for total consideration of $11.6 million. And there is no other ATM activity contemplated in our 2012 guidance.","And now just a bit of background on how we thought about financing the Archstone acquisition. In December when we made our offer, we created a situation where we needed to have substantial and certain liquidity available if we were successful, but we did not want to burden our balance sheet with the cash if we were not successful. In other words, we wanted certain but contingent capital. To accomplish this, we began by entering into $1 billion bridge loan, and that was done simultaneously with announcing the Archstone acquisition in early December. The bridge gets expensive the longer it stays outstanding, so we very quickly replaced the bridge with a $500 million expansion of our existing unsecured line of credit and a new $500 million delayed draw term loan, both of which are cost-effective, contingent and could be available to us, Archstone or not.","So just a few points on the expanded revolver and the delayed draw term loan. The revolver expansion took our overall revolver size to $1.75 billion. It did not change our July 2014 maturity date or any of the other important terms in that facility. The cost in 2012 from the revolver expansion will be about $1.9 million, and that will reduce Normalized FFO. Now a comment on the delayed draw term loan, which is a very interesting and useful financial tool. It operates much like a bridge loan, except it's cheaper, more flexible and has a longer term. At any time up to July 4, 2012, the company can draw on the delayed draw term loan for any reason. The spread on it is 1.25% over LIBOR and that's based on the company's current credit rating. Our guidance assumes that we'll draw on this loan in July of this year, July of 2012, until we pay at par the existing $500 million term loan that matures in October 2012. And this is the only material debt activity that company is budgeting in 2012. Fees from the delayed draw term loan will be about $1.9 million in 2012 and will reduce Normalized FFO. ","And I just want to express the company's appreciation for the overwhelming support we received from our bank group in the revolver syndication process and the delayed draw term loan syndication process. Both transactions were well oversubscribed. So with these financing activities, we created ample liquidity, not only for our normal investment activity and upcoming debt maturities, but also for our pursuit of an interest in Archstone. A few more notes on the balance sheet, and then I'll move on to guidance. ","In 2012, we expect to have free cash flow from operations of about $150 million. This is after capital expenditures, including rehab spending, and after payment of our expected higher dividend. David Neithercut mentioned that we could start up to $750 million in development deals in 2012. We expect to spend about $250 million on construction in 2012, including projects already in progress and projects slated to start. That $250 million amount does not include any yet-to-be-identified land acquisitions. We'll continue to be conservative in financing our development business. We'll use proceeds mostly from dispositions, free cash flow from operations and the ATM. This increase in development activity will result in an increase in capitalized interest, which I'll go over with you in a moment when we go through guidance. As of today, cash on hand including 10\/31 escrow balances stands at about $375 million. The revolving line of credit has about $1.72 billion in capacity and the $500 million delayed draw term loan is undrawn. At the end of 2012, we expect to be on our line to the tune of about $200 million. ","So let's go through guidance here. Normalized FFO guidance range for 2012 is $2.68 to $2.78. The $2.73 midpoint would be a 12% increase over our 2011 results. As usual, the biggest driver is our same-store operations, and Fred Tuomi and David Santee have already capably described that. But that same-store line will generate about $0.28, we think, in incremental Normalized FFO. Our nonsame-store properties led about $0.04 more of FFO to our Normalized FFO to our 2012 numbers. Our interest expense is going to increase Normalized FFO by about $0.01, but there's a bit going on here and I just want to go through that. We will benefit from the $0.04 per share of higher capitalized interest due to this increased development activity that both I and David Neithercut have referred to. And we'll also have $0.04 of benefit from lower secured debt balances. Almost all the debt that was repaid in 2011 was secured debt. And that's going to be offset by about $0.06 per share of increased interest expense due to higher weighted average amounts of unsecured debt. So again, this prefunding activity, this $1 billion issuance is going to create a higher unsecured debt balance for us. It also includes the swap termination cost I referred to. And we're going to have $0.01 negative from these facility fees from the revolver and the expanded revolver and the new delayed draw term loan. So again, about $0.08 to the good and about $0.07 to the bad nets out to about $0.01 to the good on interest expense for 2012. ","The last big driver is share count dilution. We expect our average share count to be about 5 million shares higher in 2012 than 2011. This will cost us about a $0.03 drag on Normalized FFO. This is mostly a result of employee stock option exercises in 2011, getting the share count for a full year in 2012, as well as expected 2012 employee stock option activity. We also expect to issue 1 million operating partnership units, which count as shares, of course, in our share count in connection with the planned 2012 acquisition, and all of that is in our guidance right now. A relatively small amount, about $0.01 negative of the $0.03 negative is the result of issuance that has already occurred on our ATM. As I said previously, no further ATM activity is contemplated in our guidance.","Just a reminder, all the numbers I've just gone through are on a Normalized FFO basis. Our guidance on Page 27 in the press releases is also on a Normalized FFO basis only. And on Page 28, we gave you all the information you need to reconcile Normalized FFO to either FFO as defined by NAREIT or to EPS. And finally, let me just reiterate that our earnings per share guidance, FFO guidance and Normalized FFO guidance assume no impact, positive or negative, from Archstone. Further, because our Normalized FFO definition is designed to eliminate noncomparable items, things like pursuit cost and break-up fees will not be included in our Normalized FFO guidance or results in any event. ","Now I'll finish up with capital expenditures. So guidance for total capital expenditures in 2012 is $850 per same-store unit without rehabs and about $1,225 including rehabs. And in 2011, we spent about $850 per same-store unit without rehabs and we spent about $1,200 when we included rehabs, so a slight increase this year. And details on all of our capital expenditures are on Page 24. We rehabbed about 5,400 units in 2011, and we expect to rehab about 4,700 units in 2012. In 2012, we expect to spend about $8,300 per unit rehab, and that's up about $1,300 from the $7,000 we spent per unit in 2011. We're going to be doing more rehabs this year in higher cost markets like New York, and we'll be replacing carpet with more costly hard surface flooring, which we believe in the future will lower our replacement costs. Now I'll turn the call back over to David Neithercut.","David J. Neithercut","All right. Thanks, Mark. So before we open the call to questions, let me just say a few more words about Archstone. And there's really not much I can say and certainly not much more than I can say than what many of you already know and we mentioned in the press release last night. But let me say that the Lehman estate has always had the right to match our first offer. They had an ace, an ace of trump, if you will, and they played it. And they did match our offer and they acquired the first half of the bank's interest that we put in play late last year.","We are currently now inside a 30-day window, during which time the banks are obligated to contract with us to sell the second half of their interest in Archstone, provided we offer to do so at a price that's no less than $1.325 billion. That's the same amount that we offered on their first half. Now I will tell you, we've not yet made any such offer, although I expect that we certainly would. But we're not obligated to do so. And any offer that we do make will again be subject to Lehman's right to match it. And if they do, we'll receive a break-up fee that's a function of the size of our bid. And that break-up fee could be as little as 0 or as much as $80 million. I'd tell you, we continue to think that much of the Archstone portfolio would fit hand-in-glove with ours. As Mark said, we certainly have the capacity to pay for it. Stay tuned, more to come. So with that, operator, we'll be happy to open the call to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Andrew McCulloch with Green Street Advisors.","Andrew McCulloch - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Can you guys talk a little bit about the trajectory of asset values in the quarter and if you saw any big divergence between markets and\/or product quality? I'm kind of just looking at the momentum of asset values.","David J. Neithercut","Of what we've acquired or just what we're looking at?","Andrew McCulloch - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Just what you're seeing in the market overall.","David J. Neithercut","Well, look, generally, let me tell you that we think that asset values today could be above peak levels in Boston, in Denver, in L.A. and San Diego. We think they're kind of back to peak levels in Orange County and D.C. and they're still below in Seattle, New York City and South Florida, as well as the commodity markets in the Northern Florida, Atlanta and Phoenix. I'd tell you recently, I don't think we've seen a great deal of change, Andy, in those values. But I'll tell you that there hasn't been much transaction activities, so the data set is reasonably small. Our team, led by Alan George, thinks that we're probably within the range of values across those markets and will likely stay within the current range of values for some time.","Andrew McCulloch - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","And then on supply. We know supply is not a big concern nationally this year. But can you talk about any specific markets or submarkets that maybe you're worried about actually near-term?","Frederick C. Tuomi","Yes, Andy, this is Fred Tuomi. I can talk about that. Really looking at this year, there's really no markets that I'm concerned about this year and same for 2011. And we had very good environment of low supply there. But where there's concern is kind of the building pipeline in a couple of markets, and most notably is the D.C. market. And there's a lot to talk about D.C. and which ways it's going to go on the demand side as well as supply. So D.C. has demonstrated it can absorb a lot of units. It absorbed a lot while the government was growing, so if the government becomes a factor in terms of either stopping the growth or receiving, then the coming supply pipeline is going to be an issue there. So in D.C., we see about between 6,000, 7,000, maybe 7,500 units coming in 2012, depending on what actually gets delivered. And then right behind that, the next year, you can see maybe another 7,000, 8,000 units. So D.C. has got the #1 supply issue. Beyond that, there's really no real markets of concern, in New York, no; Seattle, a couple thousand units but kind of distributed equally; San Jose, a couple thousand units, but I think we have plenty of demand to absorb that; and L.A, maybe San Fernando Valley, again, but again, small numbers. So really, it boils down to D.C. is going to be the issue.","Andrew McCulloch - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Great. And just one more question on capital recycling. David, you had mentioned, you talked a little bit about cap rates in your prepared remarks in core versus noncore markets and that, that spread is as wide as you've ever seen. Given that you're planning over $1 billion in capital recycling in '12, does that mean you think that spread is still not wide enough?","David J. Neithercut","No, I guess, I'd tell you, Andy, what we've given you in our guidance, not so much of what we think our budget is for sales or budget is for acquisitions, but more to tell you that embedded in our guidance is that assumption. Not unlike the beginning of last year, we'll go into this year and we'll try and transact if it makes sense to do so and we won't if it doesn't. So it's very difficult for us today to tell you exactly what we'll do on the buy side and the sell side. Our expectation frankly is that delta will narrow, that there just continues to be an awful lot of capital. We think that capital will be forced into the noncore markets or lesser-quality assets and we'll see a little bit more competitive pricing on that, and that will bring that cap rate down somewhat. But again, I'm not quite sure I said we thought that delta was as wide as we've ever seen. We just said it's been the widest we've seen for quite some time. I would tell you I think maybe 125 or so basis points is somewhat of a normal level, over an extended time period, we've seen that narrow to as little as 60. It was 130 or so in 2011. But I just do want to make the point that, that was wide, it was one -- on the wide as I remember [ph], but we do expect it could narrow during the year as capital gets forced into lesser core assets and noncore markets.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Dave Bragg with Zelman & Associates.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","A related question. If we go back a year and think about your disposition activity at the beginning of '11, it seemed to be front end-loaded due in part to your view of a risk to higher interest rates over the course of the year. And now the outlook is agreeably quite different. Could you talk about how that plays into your strategy on the transaction front?","David J. Neithercut","Sure. So we did start 2011, Dave -- and by the way, thank you for your catch on our earnings release last night. We did start 2011 with a desire to sort of hedge somewhat in what we thought could be risks of value of noncore product just as a result of Fannie and Freddie and uncertainty in issues like that. I think we're in a point today where we've done an awful lot of that heavy lifting. I don't think that while we continue to have questions about Fannie and Freddie, we don\u2019t think that there's anything imminent. They did big volume last year, and I'll tell you after being in South Florida earlier in January, they continue to talk about doing big volumes again this year. But I'll also tell you that last year, we were seeing what we thought were very reasonable prices per door, prices per square foot on that product. And we went ahead and hit that bid. I think that we'll continue to sell those assets or those noncore assets, noncore markets today, provided we find opportunities to reinvest that capital. And as Mark noted, one such opportunity is the development pipeline that will be up in 2011 and will be up again in 2012 and likely 2013. But I don't think that you'll see the rush to transact that we started in 2011 just as -- that we did as a hedge to what could happen, evaluations of those lesser-quality products.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Okay. And then shifting over to expenses. On real estate taxes specifically, can you talk a little bit more about the outlook in some of your major markets? You touched on New York and I think we could understand where you might lie on California. But can you talk through some of the other major markets in terms of your outlook and the risk to that outlook, given the different timelines in each?","David S. Santee","Dave, this is David Santee. When you look at the distribution of our increase, 34% of our increase is coming from the 421a burnoff. And then I mentioned the volatility of Florida. When you look at these other states, California, especially -- beyond that, there's just not a whole lot of risk. But California, we're subject to the 2% cap of the Prop 13. And even in New Jersey and some other locations, the ability to predict or at least understand what the ceiling is on real estate taxes from year-over-year is just much more transparent. So in the case of Florida, we won't know what actual rates are probably until October, November. And so we're having to make some assumptions there, just as we make assumptions every single year on our ability to drive lower valuations or win appeals. And then I'll just add an additional piece of color. When you look back going back all the way to 2001, the highest increase in real estate taxes that we've had occurred in 2007, 2008. 2007 was 5.6% and 2008 was 5.0%. And so I think, given that our industry really experienced a V-shaped recovery, perhaps this year is just a recapture and we could see a little more stability after 2012.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Okay. And one last question on expenses. Can you just put in perspective for us what you're doing on the payroll line? Perhaps talk about -- I don't know if you could relate it back to the number of people on site per 100 units or another metric such as that, and then compare that to what those on a same-store basis might be seeing in terms of wage growth. Just help us understand how this continues to be a flat line item.","David S. Santee","Dave, that's like asking me to give you the formula to Coca-Cola. Now really, it really is -- we continue to focus on specialization. Our industry, the folks at the site, they're running little cities, so they have to be well-versed in many different activities. And basically, when you're doing a lot of things, you don't do anything great. You just do a lot of things okay. And so what we've really tried to focus on is carving out specialized groups, whether it's procurement, obviously the pricing. We're in the final stages of centralizing our CBG group into Phoenix, which is really that is the key driver of some of our payroll growth, where we really just kind of peeled 400 some assistant managers out of the equation, with an average salary of -- base salary of $35,000. And we backfilled not all of those bodies, but we did backfill some of that headcount with additional salespeople or customer service people with a base salary in the $25,000 range. So we're still seeing some favorable impacts of that. And then for this year, we're even seeing efficiencies in that CBG group. We started with 50 people in that group. 2012, we'll operate at about 36 folks. So our ability to automate kind of -- instead of doing all the calculations, the cash register does it for you. We just continue to see benefits from this approach.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citi.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You mentioned that New York was one of your top markets this year. But just thinking about what's happened on the compensation side across the major banks and financial institutions, I'm wondering if you've started to see any sort of weakness in New York City markets or if there's any hesitancy you're seeing among the tenant base there.","Frederick C. Tuomi","Yes, this is Fred again. I'm happy to say no. And I stay very close in touch with the New York market. I love talking to our people there. And still, even though there's some -- more talk about cutbacks or lack of growth in the financial sector, again, in our properties, our resident base, we are not seeing any job loss and people leaving the market. It's very solid. And we're actually seeing growth in the area from some new sectors, as I think I mentioned last quarter. And that's the tech sector and the new media sector and some entertainment sector. It's become very vogue for companies like Google and a lot of these other tech companies to be hanging out around Chelsea neighborhood in New York City, having a presence there. So we're seeing strong demand, very strong demand at the high end. Again, our penthouse units, our larger units, our combined units and all the submarkets are well occupied, they're full. We're seeing very little kind of deviant behavior from our private competitors there, meaning concessions and the broker fees. There's still some of that in the downtown market, but very few compared to the last couple of years. And so I think New York is very solid and we're bullish on it. The current trend is still very favorable. And David mentioned Ten23, our building there on the High Line at Chelsea, and we were very confident on that one. I think we hit the timing just right with that one, and it's a great building and a fantastic location. And we took a little bit of a risk on the lease-up in that we decided to do it with no upfront concessions, no discounts whatsoever, where we just took the confidence route. And we actually released our highest ticket units for the lease-up, for the prelease-up. We held the studios, the lower-priced tickets back. And fortunately, that worked quite well. And so we preleased over 20% of those units before we opened. We opened right on time, and so we're leased like 25% now and actually occupied about 15%. And the kind of weird thing about that one is that the bigger the unit, the higher the rent per square foot. Our 3-bedroom unit that we leased was $8.90 a foot, okay? But on average, we're now at a little over $7 a foot. And as you remember, our underwriting on that one was about $5.60. So we're thrilled with the demand there. And again, that's fueled by this cohort of the young people, highly employed, making good wages and from great sectors who want to live right where the action is.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right, that's very helpful. I guess, we're probably more biased on our end in terms of what we're seeing. But just trying to get a sense of what the exposure is to financial institutions, I mean, do you track what percentage of your residence work at, I guess, those institutions? And is it a large number, like a 10% to 20%? Or is it pretty irrelevant kind of like in the low single-digits?","Frederick C. Tuomi","Anyone in business New York is going to be dependent upon, to certain extent, either directly or indirectly to your industry, the financial services sector. We look at that, and we're not concerned about a heavy concentration. In Jersey City at our 70 Greene building, we do have a lot of Goldman employees. But recently as last week, they're continuing to bring people in. So yes, we have that exposure if there was a mass layoff in that sector, but I think it's well-distributed amongst the firms and in the neighborhoods. And again, the neat thing is on the margin. The marginal growth of our demand there seems to be kind of led by this tech, new media, entertainment, lawyers, business services in addition to the finance.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got you. And then last question, for the Toll Brothers deal that you're doing. I think you said rents were in the mid $6 a foot range or that's where you intended them to be. Just curious whether it's going to be more expensive to rent there or just to pay a mortgage on the condos that Toll is selling.","David J. Neithercut","Well, I did say that we underwrote, Eric, $6.5 or so rents per square foot. And who knows where the condos will be sold? I think it'll be quite some time, won't be until 2014, 2015 when those condos will be sold. So my expectation is, I believe, it will be -- we'll continue to be cheaper to rent.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of questions. I believe on the last conference call, you had talked about renewal rates increasing, I'm going to say, I think it was 7.4% in November, 8% in December, 8.3% January. And I know those weren't your full resident base that was rolling at that time. But those actual renewal numbers came in, for instance, in the month of January, I think, was 160 bps [ph] lower. Were you surprised at that sort of differential between where you saw things back in the last conference call and where you are today on renewals?","Frederick C. Tuomi","Yes, this is Fred again. I think what you're referring to was our quoted rates versus the achieved rates and there's always a spread between those. We priced our renewals forward-looking. We see the trend where prices are going to be, not where they are today. So we'll price pretty aggressively, and then we'll actually quote above that. So it gives us plenty of room on the quote, the forward quotes. And then if rents escalate faster than we expected, then we kind of hit right on the mark. If they don't, then maybe we have a little bit of a margin where we can negotiate down. And we always give in the system just a little sliver of negotiating room for our folks to get the deal done to a point where we don't have excessive turnover. So there's always going to be a gap, a spread between what we quote and then what we actually at the end of the day on any given month. So those numbers of 7.5% and 8% were forward quote numbers that we talked about last quarter, and then what we achieved were in the mid-6s. So that delta's going to be anywhere from 150, sometime, some month maybe 200 basis points, depending on the trajectory of the rents. So that's continued what we see right now. So I said we achieved 6.7% in January, we actually quoted in January, 8.7%, so it's a 200 basis points spread there. At February, we're quoting an 8.1%, and I mentioned we're so far, it's not done yet, and that would probably come up. But so far, we've achieved about 6.2%. So again, you're going to be anywhere from 150 to 200 basis points spread between quote achieved.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That's where I was going. So for February and March, those are about 6.2% and 6.1% numbers you gave, those are actuals, those are not the quotes.","Frederick C. Tuomi","Yes, those are actual booked, signed leases in the hopper right now against quotes in the high 7s, low 8s. And those are early returns, so to speak. And by the time we actually close out the month, I think those numbers will move up a little bit.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. Okay, understood. David, you had referenced earlier in the call that you thought cap rates in core markets were in the 4s, I think, was your statement. And when I look back over the last year on the $1 billion plus you've acquired, I think it was around 5.2% or so. How should we be thinking about reconciling the difference in those numbers? Have you just been that good of an acquirer? Or is there a little apples and oranges in those statements?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I guess, if you go back to prior calls, we talked a lot about -- we were big acquirers of that core product in '09, in the first half of 2010. And then that market got very competitive, and we started to look for good acquisition opportunities that might not be the core stuff that a lot of this new money would be chasing. And so we started buying some older assets, some assets that needed repositioning. We bought a very interesting asset in East Palo Alto, California, a 6.5% cap rate and $71,000 per door. So we started doing some direct deals. So when I give you this cap rate number, I'm telling you, Ross, that, that's what we're suggesting are the rates for recently built kind of core product. And we bought some older product, again some stuff that needed repositioning, as well we've done some things direct that we think have maybe given us a little more yield than what the market might have provided.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That's perfect, understood. Last question, when all is said and done on Archstone, if I take the assumption for a minute that Lehman exercises their final ROFO, ballpark, where are your total cost on the transaction if I add up legal and advisory and financing? Do you have sort of a rough guesstimate as to where all those come in?","Mark J. Parrell","So Ross, it's Mark Parrell. We gave some idea just historical cost back in our reconciliation page, that's Page 26. So we've incurred right now about, call it, $4.5 million worth of costs as it relates mostly to the financing activity but also the pursuit cost. I would think if the transaction ended up the way you described, we'd certainly have several hundred thousand dollars more of legal and other fees to get ourselves under contract, go through the process with the banks, and then be ROFO-ed away. So I see that as almost certain that the cost would be kind of all-in $5 million to $5.5 million. If the transaction goes another way, of course, then it could be a considerably larger amount of transaction costs.","David J. Neithercut","But most of the cost really are sunk. It was the cost to get up to speed. Our deal under this option with the banks is to enter into a contract that's substantially the same contract that we've already negotiated. So Mark's point here is that not a lot of additional incremental legal expenses to incur, and he's outlined the financing charges that we incurred last year as well as those that we'll have this year as a result of the expanded credit facilities as well as the delayed term loans. So there should not be a lot of incremental costs related to Archstone to go through what would be the step 2.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Seth Laughlin with ISI Group.","Seth Laughlin - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I just had a quick question that was mentioned earlier, that interest rate expectations have moved decidedly lower. I was wondering if you could just kind of give us an update and sort of how that's impacting underwriting in terms of levered and unlevered IRRs, both for you guys and also what you're seeing in the market. I think what we're trying to get to is whether those have come down with a view that the debt costs are going to be much lower than they previously thought for longer periods of time.","David J. Neithercut","Well, I guess, I've said several times on this call that I don't think that we compete for the core product that we would like to buy with people that are that sensitive to interest rates, actual borrowing rates. I think they're probably more sensitive to just with their alternative reinvestment opportunities are for those dollars. We are more concerned about what happens with interest rates with respect to the deals that we're trying to sell, and that's why we think we've continued to see an increase in valuation over the year of what we consider to be our noncore product. But clearly, I think that with interest rates being down and given the lack of alternative investment opportunities, that's brought a lot of capital into the multifamily space to chase the few core assets that are available at any given time.","Mark J. Parrell","Just to give you a little color on what might affect disposition values, which certainly the GSE debt numbers do affect that. We see 10-year GSE money as between 3.6% or 4% right now, so very inexpensive. But the reason I don't think it's going to necessarily help that much more on asset values in some of those disposition markets for us is that the GSEs have rate floors. So the fact that your interest rate is 3.75%, they're underwriting at a 5%, 5.5% rate, so your proceeds aren't going up, so your leveraged IRR isn't going up that much. And so I don't think you're getting that as a seller in your price. So again, I think just some of the adjustments the GSEs had made lately to their underwriting means that I don't think asset values will go that much higher, even if rates decline somewhat because of these interest rate floors that they use for underwriting.","Seth Laughlin - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Understood. And then again, just quickly what are you guys targeting? I know it's maybe noncore, but in terms of levered and unlevered IRRs today.","David J. Neithercut","Well, I'd tell you, everything we've acquired this past year has generally been plus 8% long-term IRR. And that's why we've sort of had to back off chasing a lot of the core product. And I'm saying that's an unleveraged number.","Seth Laughlin - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Understood. And then maybe just one quick follow-up for Fred. Do you have any color in terms of how you expect D.C. to play out inside versus outside the Beltway in 2012, any meaningful differential in performance?","Frederick C. Tuomi","Well, it depends on which way it goes. If you think about D.C., we had a very strong run there, both inside and the near-term, the Beltway there while the government is growing. And even through 2009 and '10, we're delivering 7,000 units. I mean, the absorption was just phenomenal, actually record-setting absorption in there. So we kind of motored right through that. But we can't really expect that to be sustained forever because the government is not going to continue to grow at that rate, at least I hope it doesn't. So really, kind of the watchword on D.C. right now is we have to wait a few more months and see which way this goes because government jobs have slowed, it actually declined. There's a hiring freeze and loss through attrition that all the GSA functions.  The military is kind of in limbo right now. And on the private sector, we're still seeing growth from tech, education, health and business services, but these contractors related to the government have kind of -- they're dealing with a great amount uncertainty right now, so they kind of like stopped. They're not hiring ahead, anticipating the next big procurement contract, whatever it is, so they're just kind of stuck there. So we're dealing with uncertainty on the demand side. And then on the supply, it's coming. And it could be 6,000, 7,000 units this year, it could be more next year, and then after that, it remains to see how many deals will actually get delivered. So I think it's going to impact over -- I think starting in the second half of this year, late 2012 is going to impact in the district more, as you're going to see more these developments, all high-end, competing for the same renter cohort, whether it's U Street, I Street, the Triangle area, all Northwest D.C. is going to have these great buildings coming online. And there's going to be a little supply issue there. Perhaps at the same time, we're going to have more slowing in the government sector. So that's could be problematic for the second half of the year. We just have to wait. So I think by second quarter, certainly at third quarter, we're going to know how that's going to play out. The closed-in areas, Arlington, Alexandria, aren't going to have quite as much new supply. Our D.C. corridor will have a couple, but mostly small buildings. So I'm not as worried about those. It's really the district.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jay Habermann with Goldman Sachs.","Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So back to Ross' question, I guess, on sort of cap rates and returns. I mean, how much are you guys willing to lower your initial yields for the right product?","David J. Neithercut","Hard to say. It's difficult to say. But again, it's also a function of what we're getting for the assets that we're selling because we're really thinking a lot about it, Jay, as just a trade. So what can we get for that next incremental disposition in pick your market and what are our reinvestment opportunities. So we're really -- I mean, that's really just sort of a -- it's a trading process for us, and it remains to be seen on any individual asset. I mean, I just can't tell you anything specifically.","Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Well, I asked the question because you guys still feel pretty good about growth this year, same as you were last year, and you've obviously seen spreads compressed a bit in the last couple of months. But we're just trying to gauge your appetite there. And I guess, just a second question, you've mentioned as well rent as a percentage of income had actually dropped in the fourth quarter. And I know rents were up 7% year-over-year. Are you seeing income grow that much greater? And I guess, speak to sort of credit quality of the tenants that you're seeing coming in the door today.","Frederick C. Tuomi","Yes, this is Fred again. All fronts, we just feel good about our resident base, like I mentioned, in terms of their employment level, the types of jobs they have, where they're located, where they want live and then their ability and desire to pay the rents, including the increases for the people there. Our average income right now is $8,288 a month. That's just under $100,000 a year, which is remarkable. And if you look at the kind of the margin of people that moved into us versus people that moved in last year on a same-store set, I mentioned that the household incomes are up 4.5%. Now rents are up like 6% and the average rent as a percent of income over the entire portfolio stayed pretty flat, actually improved just a little bit to 17.2%. Southern California markets, again are the ones where you're going to see the higher. They're going to be in the low 20s, but they've always been higher in California. And then New York remains the lowest, where we have the highest rent. We also have even more so the higher incomes. So again, the credit quality is good. I think we continue to get people with higher FICO scores. That's the trend, that continues this quarter. We're seeing more automatic approvals, which means slam-dunk applications are approved right there on the spot because of their FICO scores, their incomes, et cetera. And we don't see any kind of a slowdown or hiccup or any pause at all to be concerned about on the credibility and the viability of the balance sheets and the income statements of our resident base.","Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And I know you mentioned tenants are shunning the single-family market at this point and homeownership is declining. I guess, with some improvement in consumer confidence, are you expecting that turnover to pick up? I guess, what's the catalyst to sort of turn things in a different direction at some point?","Frederick C. Tuomi","Well, eventually, it's going to happen. There's a pent-up demand for home buying. We're not going to say it's never going to happen. Although I wouldn't be surprised if it's going to be a long time before that paradigm shift is going to reverse. And it probably may never in a generation get back to the way it was. But we watch that closely. And Q4, we just finished at 13.3% moveouts for home buying, which is exactly equal to what it was a year ago. So no real shift. Within the markets, kind of no surprise. Phoenix is the only one that really moved up. They moved up over 200 basis points, and to a kind of a little bit of a higher number, 21%. Now in the heydays, Phoenix probably would have been 35%, 40% move up for home buying, but still it's kind of remarkable that Phoenix is now kind of the first market to get back up with the 2 handle [ph], so it's 21%. Other markets that moved up were Orange County, Inland Empire. Inland Empire is maybe just second to Phoenix, they're at 17% and they did move up 100 basis points. And so on those cheap, cheap single-family commodity markets, I think those are going to be the first ones you might see people eventually get tempted because the pricing is just so low, well under $100,000. But then in the core markets, New York actually went down, it almost got cut in half. Only 4%, 4.5% of our people moved up buying homes in New York, which was down significantly as well as Denver and D.C. So again, on that front, steady as she goes. We don't see any leading indicator of home buying picking up in a meaningful market. And then Phoenix and Inland Empire would be the only small exceptions, but again not a big, big move.","David J. Neithercut","Yes. I guess, I'd also add that even at the lowest down payments required to get into a single-family home, you're still talking about thousands of dollars that I don't think a lot of people might have. And I think while it's appropriate to think about single-family homes and the number of our folks that could -- that might have a desire to own a single-family home, I think that in a better economic environment, I also think you need to keep one eye on the millions of 20 some-odd-year-old people that are still living with mom and dad, where households yet to be formed. Because I think we believe strongly that if and when the confidence of the consumer and the strength of the economy will allow people to leave our apartments to go buy single-family homes, we remain confident that there will be ample backfilling of potential households that are still living with mom and dad.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just a question on Archstone, and I'm not asking for you guys to divulge your strategy. But in just thinking about it, you haven't exercised the option yet. The banks clearly want to sell -- Lehman has the ROFO right regardless of who tries to buy the bank's thing. There's also the ride-along, the tag-along right that they have. So in this scenario that's existing, you guys have the potential to get upwards of an $80 million break fee if you exercise the option, the bidding goes through and they ROFO. Is there a reasonable scenario where you wouldn't, you'd let the option lapse?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I guess, I'm not sure how I could answer that question without divulging any sort of strategy.  But I guess, what I'm trying to tell you that I think that there's an $80 million sort of payment sitting there on the table, and I'm not quite sure how we'd go forward without taking it, Alex.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, yes. That's my thought. I was just sort of intrigued that you guys hadn't exercised the option. So that's why I asked. Just switching to construction, it's a sort of a two-parter. One, you guys are ramping up the development program pretty strongly. Just curious if you're doing all this in-house or if you're sourcing some outside developers to help. And then along those lines, just given that construction lending remains really tight and a number of the merchant guys can't get financing for all their pipelines, are you seeing more people, more developers coming to you guys to either do presales or to ask you to come in on their deals?","David J. Neithercut","Well, the answer to your first question, Alex, is we're doing this all on our own. The only ventures that we've done are the ones in which we have brought an institutional partner into as a capital source to do the transaction with us. And then as I said, the codevelopment deal with Toll in Manhattan. But we're not doing ventures, where we're providing the capital and third-party developers are providing those services. We're doing it all on our own. I'd tell you that we have for some time tried to do kind of takeout deals for developers that owned land, that are having trouble getting capital, the debt capital or equity capital, whereby our contractual takeout upon completion might enable them to go get the necessary construction financing and done a lot of talking but have not been terribly successful. We continue to work on a handful of those deals. But I can't tell you that any of them are imminent at this time.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, is there a particular reason that they don't -- is it that the developers want too much or prior experience gives you some caution about entering those sorts of deals?","David J. Neithercut","Well, it's a lot of it is because we do get the developers pretty carefully before we consider them to begin with. A lot of this is just the availability of the capital from the banks. And the banks are interested in lending. They'd like to do more development lending. Many of them will say that to you, and they have relaxed spreads and they have increased proceeds. I think getting a 65% to 70% loan to cost construction loan is not at all that difficult. But what is difficult about that process is you need to have a real balance sheet behind it. The bank wants some principal recourse, the bank wants to see that you have net worth, the banks want to see that you have true liquidity and cash. And those are the things that we see holding up developers from being able to do that.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Rob Stevenson with Macquarie Capital.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","David, can you talk about what you see is the magnitude of the redevelopment or repositioning of opportunity in your portfolio, given the earlier comments on buying older assets today?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I guess, there are 2 comments. One is what Mark had talked about, Rob, with respect to our existing portfolio of assets currently owned. And we continue to think that there are opportunities to put $7,000, $10,000, $12,000 a door into those units and get a good double-digit of return on those transactions, and we've got a lot of history of actually providing that. If your question is about acquisition opportunities to do likewise, I'd tell you even those are becoming more challenging. It wasn't long ago when institutional money was no longer pursuing value add, but we're seeing a lot of demand for value-added transactions as well. But we bought some older assets, several on the Peninsula and we're doing pretty significant repositioning on -- by 3 or 4 deals on the Peninsula right now. So we'll certainly do that, but even those deals are becoming competitive to find.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Well, I guess, my question in essence is Mark said basically that you guys would do 4,700 units at $8,300 per. So that's a little bit under $40 million in '12. And given the historical returns that you guys and lot of the peers have been able to drive off of that type of program, I'm surprised it's not greater, given the lack of strong returns in either the acquisition or the development market today.","David J. Neithercut","Well, I guess, that's kind of been a pretty normal run rate for us. I think we've probably done $30 million to $40 million of spend in each of the past 3 plus or so years. And we just continue to churn through that. We haven't talked about ramping it up. We've just been talking about consistently spending around that amount of money each year. And I expect to do so for the next handful of years as well.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then turning to development. Assuming that you could find the land, I mean, what's the upper end of your comfort range in terms of the size of the development pipeline going forward?","David J. Neithercut","A good question, but one that's difficult to answer. We have -- we will have a higher level of activity over the next, last year, this year, maybe 2013. A lot of that is because we saw opportunity to acquire land in '09 and 2010, and we're executing that. I'm not sure that I'd expect that elevated level to continue. But I mean, it just remains to be seen what the opportunities are relative to the acquisition opportunities. But I think we kind of historically had a $500 million or $600 million run rate, and now we'll be maybe plus $700 million for a couple of years. And we'll see what the opportunities are come 2013, 2014 and kind of take it from there. I think that if you've seen the assets that we built, I encourage you to see Ten23. I think we've got a fantastic team that's delivering absolutely tremendous product. And if we felt that it was appropriate to build that up, I wouldn't hesitate to do it.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. So it sounds like, I mean, assuming that you don't get Archstone, there's probably not a high likelihood that you're going to take some of that $1 billion plus and either materially expanded the development pipeline from here or materially ramp-up or get more aggressive on your traditional acquisition program.","David J. Neithercut","No. I think that, that -- the availability of that capital has always been available to us. I mean, it wasn't like all of a sudden it's newfound capital, we just asked for it. But no, just because it's on or available we can mean draw on it, it doesn't mean we're going to change our investment activity or philosophy in a world that does not include Archstone.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So what would you prefer, as much as 1,600% return on $5 million investments to get an $80 million break-up fee or to own 26.5% of Archstone for like several years? What would be the better outcome for you?","David J. Neithercut","Look, I guess, I'll only tell you that we've not been in this for a break-up fee. We've been in this because we felt that those were a good quality assets that one way or another, we're at a time sort of in this life cycle that those they needed to come to market one way or the other. And it was an opportunity for us. So I mean, it's not an easy answer to your -- question to answer, but I can tell you, we didn't do this trying to play for a break-up fee.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. I mean, I wasn't suggesting that. But okay, just on the issue, a question was raised about interest rates and timing of acquisitions and  dispositions. Just from a pure modeling prospective, would it be fair to just kind of straight-line acquisitions and dispositions, unlike last year where it was more lumpy in the beginning and the end of the year?","Mark J. Parrell","Yes. Rich, it's Mark Parrell. Yes, our guidance does assume that acquisitions and dispositions are evenly spaced throughout the year.","David J. Neithercut","And again, that doesn't necessarily mean we think that's how it's going to happen, we're just telling you that, that is what is embedded in the guidance that we've given you.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. On the topic of development, a lot of talk here about expanding the development pipeline. I guess, what gets you comfortable 3 years from now or whatever when you ultimately deliver product that the market is going to be suitable to bring product to market? I'm thinking specifically about the Toll Brothers deal. But I mean, just generally speaking, how do you have that kind of vision 3 years from now?","David J. Neithercut","Look, I mean, therein lies the risk of development, but also therein lies the risk of underwriting even existing stabilized asset, right? I mean, we underwrite -- we buy assets today and we underwrite what we think rents are today and where rents are going. So it's just a question of are you willing to own an asset at this basis for the next x number of years throughout this marketplace. And while I'll tell you that I think that lesser capitalized companies have to really be more concerned about that, I think that we're in a place where we deliver a great product in a great location in a market that we know long-term is going to be fantastic. Whether or not it comes out of the blocks, a little underexpectation is not the big worry for us. We were trying to buy, identify for acquisition or development assets that we think we're going to own happily for 15 or 20 years. And what happens in the 6-month period that it gets lease up when it's delivered is not terribly important because we believe long-term, we're building the right product in the right markets, and we'll be properly rewarded. If we had a smaller balance sheet or we were a merchant builder and all of our upside was dependent upon what happened within 1 6-month window 3 years out from now, that would be a different story.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Right. Okay, that makes sense. So like if you say a 15- to 20-year time horizon on any kind of investment you make, be it a large portfolio or development, I mean, is there a timeframe from the completion of that project or the closing of the transaction where you would not want to see fundamental start to flow? I mean, in other words, if you take any portfolio, you need at least 3 or 4 years of pretty good stuff happening before it starts to slow down? Or does that not matter?","David J. Neithercut","Well, we've got land today that we're going to start building on in 2012 that we acquired before the bust that because of the carry -- and we're at a point where we probably have a carrying value for that land that is below real market value today. And that's why I mentioned the 1 deal in Pasadena, California will be a high 4%, low 5% yield. Well, that's because legacy sort of pricing. We could've started that earlier. We can kind of start it later. But again, we felt when we bought the property years ago, and frankly, now we're going to start building on it, we're quite comfortable that this will be a very successful project at the end of the day. It may underperform relative to our basis, but long-term, we think we'll do okay. But you just can't be as precise as I think you're suggesting one would like to be.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Right, and very well said. And then the last question is on the dividend. I'm not so sure I'm comfortable or I like the fairly kind of, I guess, clever dividend policy of kind of paying out the leftovers at the end of the year. It kind of demonstrates to me a little bit of a lack of commitment in terms of the full year. And I'm just curious, what would you say to somebody that kind of thought that way, that just from the starting point, you're kind of -- you never have a situation where you're going to have to cut the dividend because you're not committing to a full number at the very beginning of the year. How would you respond to that?","David J. Neithercut","I guess, I think you just did. I mean, we think an appropriate dividend policy is not to establish some number that if things go sideways, you have to fight to defend because you're so concerned about ever having to cut it. We think that like any partnership, whatever, we'll split the rewards at the end of the year. We do acknowledge that at points in time, we'll need to address how much of that we intend to pay in the first 3 quarters of the year. We didn't want to set a situation which we were constantly changing that. But at some point in time, I'm sure we'll address what is the appropriate payment for the first 3 quarters, what's the appropriate percentage it ought to be paid out in the first 3 versus the last 1. But when we established this level, we went back over the past 10 years of operations of the company and try to find something that we knew we would have been able to cover throughout some of the most challenging times. So whether it's clever or not, I mean, we're not trying to be clever. We just think it's frankly  more appropriate way to run the railroad.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","The legacy hedging there, was that all taken care of with the offering in the fourth quarter? And also, I believe you said a $250 million spend for 2012 without land purchases. Can you give us the number you're kind of baking in, in terms of your sources and uses for 2012?","Mark J. Parrell","So the hedges that were terminated, the $750 million of hedges, had about $150 million of costs that we talked about in the script. There are still a couple -- I think it's actually about $300 million worth of hedges that remain. They have a negative value around $35 million today. Those numbers sit in our deferred until we do our debt offerings in 2013. So that's the current mark on that portfolio of debt. In terms of the quotes on how much land, we don't have any land purchases baked in except for one. There is one land purchase that we are either under contract or LOI we're close enough. We've decided internally that we did include it in the number I quoted. But there are no other land purchases that are in our guidance.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Second of all, I believe you completed a couple of acquisitions since the beginning of the first quarter there. How much of the $1.25 billion has been identified? And also can you give us a sense of how much of the $1.25 billion of dispositions you guys are actively marketing at this point?","David J. Neithercut","There's been very little activity on either side of the ledger up to now. I guess, the guys will tell you that things don't get started until -- they've been slowed dramatically at the end of the year and don't start until after the National Multi Housing Council meetings. But I'll tell you, we had a lot of contacts and a lot of people there, and we'll begin to see more activity there. But there's a very small pipeline of transaction. But there is 1 large acquisition we're working on, and Mark noted that he had budgeted for 1 million OP units being delivered as part of that 1 acquisition. But that's really what the limit of what the supply looks like today.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Third question relates to Archstone. I know you guys are in active discussions with the banks. Have you engaged Lehman in discussions? Or can you comment on that?","David J. Neithercut","I guess, I really can't comment on that.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. I thought I'd I try. And then final question, just to go back to your opening comments and also understand the underwriting. As you're looking at this cycle, how long do you think the benefits of lower move-out to homeownership, how long do you think that could continue? And how long do you think that we can continue to see above-average growth in the multifamily space?","David J. Neithercut","Yes. It's very difficult to answer that question. But I just don't see any reason why we don't have several more years of above-average performance. As we mentioned earlier, and Fred acknowledged, I'm sure we've got people interested in buying a single-family home in our portfolio, but they either don't have a down payment, they've got too much school debt or other debt and they can't get financing. But if they do, I'd tell you, I think that there's an awful lot of people that, 20-somethings that live with mom and dad, are looking to create a household as soon as possible. And I'd tell you, I think that we'll see increased levels of supply this year and next year. And I think -- but it's still well below historical run rates. And I think you're really seeing the result of an awful lot of product being sort of held in inventory through '09, 2010, 2011 that's finally coming out. And I think that you'll see an elevated level of supply again well below historical run rates. And I think that, that number will then drop off because people have got to be working now for stuff for 2014, 2015. And so I mean, we're not terribly concerned about the supply side, also because of the financing challenges that Mark said. So I think the multifamily space is at a real sweet spot and will be there for some time.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And are you assuming that sweet spot continues in the 8% IRR you're underwriting? Or are you assuming normalized kind of growth patterns?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I would say a lot of the IRR is a function of what's your inbound kind of yield is. But we're still going to try and target that. I'm not suggesting that, that number can't come down. But as I mentioned earlier, that's going to be a result, if we're getting better disposition values on what we want to sell, well, that will influence what we'll be willing to pay on assets that we acquire.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies & Company.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question. I mean, this year, there's been some interesting trade between the homebuilders as well -- versus the multifamily REITs based on this whole expectations of Refi.gov. And Obama put another plan where foreclosed homes can be sold to private investors and kind of issued out as rentals. Just kind of curious, one, what do you think about this trade? And then two, if some of these proposals, what you actually think the impact of some these proposals could actually be to apartment fundamental?","David J. Neithercut","Look, I think that on the one hand, anything that can help stabilize the single-family home business or inventory is going to help our economy will be good long term for everyone. To the extent that some of these programs allow investors to acquire properties and lease them to people, we believe that most of the occupants of those homes will be those that had been previously dispossessed of their own home. We've not seen a lot of people come running back into our apartments who left us during the heyday of '06, '07, '08, and we think they're still out there. And if they're no longer in a home they own, they're probably renting a home. And also, I think a lot of is limited to a handful of markets that have seen a significant oversupply or significant inventory of unsold homes. And I don't think that's really a problem in the markets in which we have most of our capital committed.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Swaroop Yalla with Morgan Stanley.","Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was just wondering if you can tell us how you expect same-store revenues to trend for the year. Fred mentioned that we could see some narrowing of comps in Q3. Is that when you expect the inflection point to occur for the same-store revenues?","Frederick C. Tuomi","Yes. This is Fred again. When we look at a year forward, it's going to follow the typical seasonal pattern of our business, which means we'll start in January, and then we'll have gradual growth in February, March and then come April, start seeing demand pickup, and therefore, we see lift in our pricing, both in absolute terms and relative to a year before. So if you can imagine kind of the 2011 pricing curve, starting off low and then it peaks and then it falls off, that peak does happen sometime in the August timeframe. So that's what I inferred when I said that peaking in Q3 and then the seasonal softening again in Q4. So when you look at a year-over-year basis, it's really that gap between those 2 curves and what's the distance between those lines. And for this year, the midpoint of our guidance kind of assumes that, that gap is going to on average be 5.5% over the year, kind of the area between those 2 lines. Now this time last year, as we looked forward into 2011, for the mid-part -- midpoint of the guidance last year, which was between 4% and 5%, we said it was base rents that would go up 5%, kind of the same kind of the average for the year. Now what happened is we actually did better than that. We did 6% on base rent, actually a little bit more than 6%, almost 6.5%, and then renewals were 6% instead of 4% or 5%. And that's why we ended up at the top of our range instead of midpoint. So could that happen again this year? Absolutely. I think there's more of a chance that we could come out hotter than a chance that we would actually fall short on this. So that's how we look at it. But again for guidance, it's kind of that midpoint was going to happen, and then we'll know really when we update guidance at the middle of the summer kind of what the next leasing season is going to give us. Because last year as we entered the leasing season, that gap narrowed below 5%, it was actually 4.5%. But then once we hit like July -- actually no, really in the middle of June to July, we motored right on through and that actually expanded up to a 7% gap. So that's why we came out at the high end in 2011.","Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's helpful. The other question I had was on Southern California. I mean, you talked about L.A. and Orange County showing momentum. If you can talk about the markets which are showing momentum. And then most specifically, San Diego, you mentioned is challenging. What markets -- and what is really driving that? Is it supply pressures? Is it military rotations? If you can just shed some light on that.","Frederick C. Tuomi","Yes, San Diego is not a big market for us, but it's just been frustrating in that it really hasn't had a powerful recovery yet. We started off okay. It was actually one of the last ones to really go down back in '09 and '10. But I was expecting it to come back a little bit stronger, and it has not. The reason is military rotations. Okay, the big Navy base there. We've got all 3 of the big aircraft carriers are out, either on maneuvers or up in Bremerton for repairs. And that is a big sucking sound to the economy of San Diego when those things pull out. And all of them are out at the same time right now. And we don't expect any of them to be back until next year, early next year. So it's going to be kind of -- it is lower than average, still positive, still growth, but still lower performer in San Diego for the rest of this year. And we saw that, as they call it, go out, we saw immediate increase in military lease-up breaks. Almost half of our lease breaks were military, and then we have some corporate nurses. And that's affecting the South County and the Mission Valley markets in particular. And we have a big presence in our portfolio of South County and Mission Valley in particular there with La Mirage and others. The central business district, Downtown San Diego, continues to be hot. I mean, our Vantage Pointe deals is great. We're basically all done with the lease-up there, and then our 1 same-store property there is doing extremely well. So we kind of have suffering from our concentration. And then North County, with the Pendleton base is doing while they're building all that housing on base. But now it's done, so all these soldiers are moving on to base. That's really the military thing. The other sectors biotech, tech, healthcare, education in San Diego are favorable, but they're not big enough to overcome the military. And then L.A. and Orange County just continue to do good. The momentum we talked about last quarter continues. Orange County is going to have a good year, L.A. is finally seeing some job growth. And I think it's going to have a good year, especially the downtown and those areas.","Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Mark, can you just -- last question. Can you talk about the secured and unsecured financing costs you're hearing based on your discussions with GSEs and life companies and your bankers?","Mark J. Parrell","Sure, happy to do that. On the 10-year side, the unsecured market is actually a little bit more expensive right now. I would say EQR would issue debt about $200 million over the tenure, while I see on the secured side, we'd be issuing more like $180 million over the 10-year. So that's not surprising, that's a pretty common relationship for secured to be a little bit cheaper. That relationship very interestingly changes when you talk about 5-year debt. The GSEs are not particularly fond of 5-year debt, so they would price a 5-year note to us probably at $220 million over, which would give you about 2.9% to 3% note rate, whereas the unsecured market likes shorter paper, likes 5-year duration. And they would price it to us more like 2.6%. So again, the GSEs for a lot of reasons don't like 5-year paper. They also give you less in proceeds all things equal on a 5-year versus a 10-year deal. So again, for us, that's how we see. The life companies are active, they're in the market. There are selective about what they price. They like the core markets more than they like the noncore markets. The GSEs are beginning to skew some of their activity by submarket. They are still active in every market, but there are submarkets they're less active or less interested in.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.","David J. Neithercut","Great. Thank you, all, for your time today.

Thanks so much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Equity Residential Fourth Quarter Conference Call. Thank you for your participation.

Today's conference is being recorded. And I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Marty McKenna. Please go ahead, sir.","Marty McKenna","Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's Second Quarter 2014 Results. Our featured speakers today are: David Neithercut, our President and CEO; David Santee, our Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Parrell, our Chief Financial Officer.","Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the [indiscernible] law. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.","And now I'll turn it over to David Neithercut.","David J. Neithercut","Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. And on our last call, I told you that the EQR teams across the country had our properties very well positioned for the upcoming leasing season and that they were raring to go to maximize revenue during this very important time of the year. Well, here we are at the end of July, with a couple months of the leasing season in the bank, with August squarely in our sights, and I'm once again pleased to say that our teams have delivered on their promise.","As we announced last night, same-store revenues increased 4% for the first half of the year and 4.1% in the second quarter. As a result, we've increased our full year same-store revenue guidance to a midpoint of 4%, which is at the high end of our original guidance provided in early February. And we have also increased our normalized FFO guidance for the full year to a midpoint of $3.10 a share, nearly 9% higher than last year and an annual increase that is among the largest we've experienced in the last 15 years. And this is all because the fundamentals remain very, very solid with continued strong demand for quality rental housing like that provided by Equity Residential. We're also pleased that the continued strength in fundamentals is being experienced across nearly every one of our core markets.","Reaching the high end of our original same-store revenue guidance range is not due to any particular market or markets performing significantly better than what we'd expected, but rather nearly every market performing above our baseline expectations and more towards our best-case expectations. Across nearly every market, our occupancy is closer to best case, our retention is closer to best case and market rents and renewal rents are both better than we had expected, even in those markets where there was some concern about new supply. So we're very pleased about our performance so far this year and how things are shaping up for the entire year.","And with that, I'll let David Santee, our Chief Operating Officer, discuss in more detail what we're currently seeing in each of our core markets and how we performed during this all-important leasing season. And he'll be followed by Mark Parrell, our Chief Financial Officer, who will address our updated guidance and capital-raising activities.","David S. Santee","Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Well, it continues to be a great time to be in the apartment business as evidenced by our strong revenue performance in the quarter and first half of the year across our entire portfolio. In general, new deliveries that are coming to market are being leased up faster than expected while maintaining order and price discipline, with concessions at stabilized assets almost nonexistent. Continued improvement in job growth, consumer sentiment and added lift, both revenue and expenses, from the inclusion of the Archstone portfolio","[Audio Gap]","guidance for the year. Today, I'll provide color on our 4 key revenue drivers, briefly discuss our expense drivers, and then update you on each of our core markets.","To date, all 4 of our key performance indicators are stronger than expected. Net effective base rents have consistently exceeded our original expectations by almost 50 basis points and are currently 4.7% above same week last year. Renewal increases, originally expected to moderate slightly below 5%, have consistently exceeded 5% and accelerated from 5.4% in Q1 to 5.5% in Q2. With a 5.9% achieved on the books for July and August currently at 5.5%, which we know that will improve throughout the month, we should exceed our full year renewal growth expectations by 60 to 75 basis points.","Turnover for the quarter declined again from 14.4% in 2013 to 14.2%. If you recall, in the previous quarters we discussed our lease expiration management and moving more leases from Q4 and Q1 into Q2. So seeing a decline in both percentage and absolute terms in Q2 is even more meaningful as residents are less inclined to move from quality buildings and neighborhoods that shape their lifestyle. With July stats on the books and notice to vacates given through August and September, it appears that turnover will continue to decline, driven largely by fewer move-outs to buy homes. In fact, move-outs to buy homes declined over flat quarter-over-quarter across all of our major markets with San Francisco being the only exception, which had 3 more move-outs to buy homes. Occupancy improved 20 basis points for the quarter to 95.8%, which puts us right on top of our full year guidance of 95.5%.","Expenses for the quarter were up 1.4%, allowing us to make up some ground after the brutal utility expense for Q1. Excluding real estate taxes, all other expenses declined 1.05%, driven by our expected savings from the inclusion of the Archstone portfolio and a more efficient property management operation. As a result of staffing and process optimizations across the Archstone portfolio, on-site payroll costs for those assets were down 3.2% for the quarter and 10.2% year-to-date.","In the maintenance category, again just for the Archstone communities, turn costs were down 32% for the quarter and 40% year-to-date as a result of implementing our turnover philosophy, which emphasizes the use of in-house labor versus contract services. Additionally, the close proximity of both Archstone and legacy assets have allowed us to optimize our Internet spend and reduce L&A cost across the combined portfolio by almost 20% for the quarter and 17.5% year-to-date. As we discussed previously, the favorable contribution to same-store expense reduction for the Archstone assets will diminish as we move further into the year and begin to realize stabilized comp periods. Real estate taxes, which account for 35% of total expense, remain unchanged at a 6.2% full year growth rate. And we are confident that this number is a worst-case scenario, allowing us to tighten the total expense growth range between 2.25% and 2.75%.","And moving on to our markets. We continue to maintain our 3 buckets of revenue performance, with the top bucket consisting of Seattle, San Francisco and Denver producing revenue growth in excess of 5%. The middle bucket of 3% to 5% revenue growth includes all other markets, excluding D.C. which is in a bucket by itself, with a projected revenue decline of 1% for the full year.","So starting in the Northwest, Seattle continues its outsized performance with robust job growth and a per capita income 23% higher than the national average. Boeing, Amazon and Microsoft continue to provide a solid economic foundation. Our 2 lease-ups are above pro forma rent and well ahead on occupancy. 320 Pine, a 134-unit presale acquisition, went from 0% occupancy in February to 99% occupancy in June. Our Central Business District Bellevue and Redmond submarkets lead the way with plus 7% revenue growth year-to-date. There are marginal differences when looking at other in-town submarkets versus the suburbs, as all submarkets are producing average year-to-date revenue growth of 6.5%. While the recent Microsoft layoffs were troubling at first, the direct impact of the announced local reductions should have little impact in the Redmond submarket. With new deliveries in Redmond already leased and only 350 being delivered in 2015, Redmond should do just fine barring any further negative news.","Denver continues the outperformance despite delivering almost 10,000 units. With a high concentration of new deliveries downtown, growth in our CBD submarket is a meager 4.3%, while our well-diversified suburban submarkets range from 7% to plus 9% year-to-date. San Francisco continues to be the lead market for the fourth consecutive year. Net effective new lease rents and renewals achieved continued to be in the 9% to 11% range, and we see no signs of a slowdown. Even with elevated deliveries, the level of supply is simply not sufficient to meet demand from the continued tech boom. The Peninsula submarket continues to produce the highest revenue growth, followed by our downtown portfolio. However, the East Bay appears to be accelerating as renters look for more affordable housing.","Los Angeles continues to perform well and as expected. Despite new deliveries being concentrated in the downtown and Mid-Wilshire corridor submarkets, these 2 areas are accelerating and producing the largest revenue growth of our 8 L.A. submarkets, with 5.5% and 5.4% year-to-date, respectively. Our weakest growth is coming from Santa Clarita and West L.A, primarily in and around the Marina del Rey area. With such a diverse and improving economy, we would expect L.A. to continue its positive momentum with above-trend growth for an extended period of time. Orange County continues to produce accelerating growth as a result of few deliveries and well-diversified job gains. Move-outs to buy homes have declined in Orange County more than any other market, about 400 basis points. And it appears that both future supply and expected job growth are perfectly in sync over the next several years. San Diego, with 3,000 deliveries, is realizing price pressure downtown, our lowest revenue growth submarket. The I-5 and the I-15 corridor submarkets continue to do well as minimal supply and decent job growth provide a stable operating environment.","Moving over to the East Coast. Boston, like Denver, is feeling the effects of a concentration of new deliveries in the urban core, although neighborhood and price points can produce dramatically different results. With 6,000 units being delivered across the Boston MSA, and more than half of those in the financial district, there are pricing pressures at our assets that compete head-to-head with new product. We also have assets in that same submarket that are somewhat insulated from new deliveries that allow our in-town submarket to lead all other Boston submarkets with year-to-date growth of 4.6%. All other suburban markets show no signs of outsized growth in the near term as future development begins to move back to the suburbs. Additionally, our significant parking garage operations can impact reported revenue growth, depending upon the postseason success of the professional sports teams. Our reported number of 2.8% revenue growth includes those garage performance numbers. Stripping this out, residential results only were 3.2% for the quarter and 3.4% year-to-date and 2.4% sequentially.","Jumping down to New York. The pause button is off and the music is playing once again. After seeing rents flat for most of 2013, net effective base rents have bounced between 3% and 5% growth for much of the year. Occupancy has improved 20 basis points year-to-date. Demand has picked up noticeably and we appear to be on solid footing once again. Downtown Brooklyn leads our portfolio in submarket revenue growth year-to-date at 6.5%. The Upper West Side, at 2%, is lagging all other submarkets. However, most all New York City submarkets appear to have accelerating revenue growth as rental rate growth shows favorable [indiscernible].","South Florida. Well, the cranes are back and record prices are being paid for land. Miami-Dade leads the charge across the three-county metro area as wealthy South Americans continue to expand the job base by [indiscernible] their businesses in Miami. All 7 of our three-county submarkets are performing similarly as new supply is manageable in the proving economy.","Washington, D.C. continues to perform as expected. With lackluster job growth and outsized supply, positive revenue growth for the metro area continues to be elusive, although net effective base rents across our 8 submarkets can be up 2% one week and down 2% the next. Occupancy and current exposure are all favorable as demand for quality apartments in great locations remained steady and our current residents are staying put, as move-outs for the first half of the year are down more than 400 basis points while we continue to achieve renewal increases above 3%. For D.C. metro submarkets, the Maryland suburbs lead the way. Year-to-date, PG County and the I-270 corridor continue to enjoy positive revenue growth, while South Arlington and Alexandria bring up the rear at minus 2.2% and 1.5% -- 1.56%, respectively. Our district portfolio is negative 58 basis points year-to-date, but August billings are positive 11 basis points versus last August.","As we look back to our original guidance, we believed that many of the markets could absorb the new deliveries without major disruption. So far, they have. We also thought that if we could see improved job growth that we could produce better revenue results, and we have. And finally, we knew we had significant opportunity to optimize the Archstone portfolio and deliver exceptional results, and we did, which altogether give us the confidence in raising our guidance for the full year. Mark?","Mark J. Parrell","Thank you, David. I want to take a few minutes this morning to review our revised guidance for the year and to give the group some background on our recent debt raise and its impact on our balance sheet. We have provided revised guidance for our same-store metrics as well as our normalized FFO per share for the year. We now expect to produce normalized FFO of $3.08 to $3.12 per share. And that's up $0.02, or about 1%, at the midpoint from our prior range.","This growth in normalized FFO, as David Santee just described, is being fueled by our expectation of better-than-expected growth in our net operating income, and that's both in the same-store set and the lease-up set, offset by about $0.02 per share of additional interest expense as a result of our recent debt deal. Our previous guidance included a smaller debt deal later in the year than the one we ended up doing. On the transaction activity side, we did not change our guidance assumptions on volume or cap rate spread. And there was no net impact on our revised normalized FFO guidance from transactions.","David Santee reviewed the factors driving our same-store expectations. And I'm pleased to say that we have increased our targeted range on our same-store revenues to 3.9% to 4.1%. And that's up from 3% to 4% from our February guidance. And we've narrowed our expectations on expense growth to a range of 2.25% to 2.75%. And that all results in an expected net operating income range of 4.5% to 5%. And this continues the strong growth we have produced over the last several years and that we continue to expect to deliver. And as a reminder, the Archstone assets we acquired last year had been in our same-store numbers this year since the beginning of the year, both in our sequential, quarterly and year-to-date same-store sets.","In June, on the debt side we decided to take advantage of the incredibly attractive rates that were available to us. And we went ahead and issued $1.2 billion of unsecured debt. And we issued 2 pieces of debt. We issued our first true 30-year debt piece and a 5-year issuance. We issued $450 million of unsecured 5-year bonds at an interest rate of 2.4%. And we issued $750 million of 30-year unsecured bonds at an interest rate of 4.54%. We used the proceeds from this offering to repay our $750 million term loan facility, which was scheduled to mature in January of 2015, and to repay the amounts outstanding on our line of credit. These issuances were very well-received by our fixed income investors, particularly the 30-year issuance. In fact, the 30-year bond was issued at the lowest interest rate and the lowest spread above treasuries of any 30-year bond every issued by a REIT, while the 5-year bond issue was priced at near-record low levels.","The 5-year bonds were swapped to floating, and we will therefore actually be paying an all-in rate of LIBOR plus about 75 basis points. And right now, all-in that would be around 1% on the $450 million in 5-year bonds that we issued. About 11% of our debt now carries a floating rate. As we draw on our revolver during the balance of the year to repay our September bond maturity and to fund development, floating rate debt will increase until it is about 16% of total debt. And that's right in our 15% to 20% target zone for floating rate debt as compared to total debt. And at the end of the year, I expect our revolver to have a $550 million balance.","There were several advantages in our minds to issuing this debt now. The term loan facility was about 50 basis points more costly than the swapped rate on the 5-year notes, so we do have some immediate cost savings. But more importantly, our long-term cost of capital was reduced with such a cheap piece of long-term debt. Also these issuances extended the weighted average maturity of our debt to 7.9 years, which is the longest in the apartment space and one of the longest among all large REITs. When rates do begin to rise, this will be a big advantage to us. Finally, by completing all our 2014 debt refinancing activities and a large portion of our 2015 refinancing activities now, we are in an even better liquidity and funding position over the next couple of years.","And now I'll turn the call back over to David Neithercut.","David J. Neithercut","All right. Thanks, Mark. Clearly, we remain very excited about the strength and fundamentals that we continue to experience across our markets. And we're going to remain confident that due to a very favorable demographic picture and continued improvement in the overall economy, that we have a lot of runway yet ahead of us for continued favorable revenue and NOI growth, which will result in strong growth and normalized FFO and dividend payments and total shareholder return for years to come.","So I just want to make a couple of comments about transaction development activity. We did buy a couple of properties in the second quarter as noted in the release. In Seattle, we closed on a deal that we'd put under contract in 2011 before construction commenced. And that was the 134 units that David Santee mentioned, which we acquired for $36 million. Recently completed and 67% occupied at closing, it's now fully leased and occupied. It should stabilize at a return in the mid-6s. And that deal would trade at a cap rate today in the low 4s. And we also acquired 208 units in Glendale, California about a block from GGP's highly productive Glendale Galleria property. We acquired that property for $70.5 million. It was built in 2013 and was 81% occupied at closing. Today, that deal is 91% leased and 87% occupied and should stabilize at a yield of 5%. The one property we sold in the quarter was in Orlando, Florida, 336 units that we sold for $41 million. And in our press release, we reflect the yield that we sold of being one of 6.7%, and we refer to that as the cap rate. The true cap rate, however, that being the yield that the buyer acquired, would be closer to 6% when adjustments are made for real estate taxes and insurance.","Now as Mark said, our guidance for the year remains to buy $500 million of assets and sell $500 million at a cap rate spread of 100 basis points. That said, I'll tell you we are seeing a lot more product in the market, a lot of which we'd very happy to own by trading them with -- into them with proceeds from noncore assets. But bidding remains very competitive and pricing remains very aggressive. So if we're able to find more investment opportunities that make sense for us relative to the assets we desire to sell, and that's an important caveat, then our transaction activity this year could exceed current guidance. Interestingly, if that were to happen though, the cap rate spread might actually decrease or narrow because the incremental assets we might sell will be less desirable assets in our core markets. And these would trade at lower cap rates than the assets we've been selling in our exit markets.","Real quickly on development. While we may not have completed nor started any projects this past quarter, there was and remains a great deal of activity taking place. And we currently expect to complete another $254 million of development deals yet this year, which will bring total completions to $621 million or so for the full year. Starts this year currently look like they'll come in around $1 billion. That's slightly higher than our original expectations, which simply means that some early 2015 starts could now occur in late 2014. And that would suggest additional starts yet this year totaling about $500 million.","During the second quarter, we acquired one land site also in the Capitol Hill neighborhood due east of downtown Seattle for 140 units, which we'll develop for a total cost of about $45 million. That deal should -- would yield about a 5% at current rents today, and we'd expect to stabilize somewhere in the low to mid-6s. And with this newly-acquired land parcel to our inventory and assuming we do get to $1 billion in starts this year, that would then mean we'd have about 5 development projects that we'd start next year, for 1,200 units at a total construction cost of nearly $600 million. And similarly, those deals would lease at current rents in the mid-5s and stabilize yields in the low to mid-6s.","So with that said, operator, we'll be happy to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll hear first from Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","To issue 30-year debt. What made you change your mind on that?","Mark J. Parrell","Nick, it's Mark Parrell. Did you ask why did we decide to issue 30-year debt? You were cut off there.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes. David, you talked in the past about maybe reluctance to actually issue 30-year debt. So I'm wondering what changed.","Mark J. Parrell","Yes. Well, it's Mark Parrell. We have been thinking about it a while, Nick. And it's been attractive for awhile, but particularly so the last few months. And we've always thought it's a great way to match these long-hold assets we have that we've built and we've bought lately with a long-term low cost of capital. And our anxiety always centered on the covenants, the meaningful covenants that exist in REIT bonds in just binding ourselves for 30 years, who knows what will change in that period of time? But as you look at a rate as well as we were able to get at 4.5% and you look at the average rate the treasury has been, so imagine 10 years from now, we want to repay these bonds. We did a little research, and even in the low-interest climate we've been in lately the last 20 years, about 2\/3 of the time, the 20-year treasury has been at or higher than 4.5%, meaning we'd have no prepayment penalty. So in our minds, just boiling it all down, we were getting a great piece of debt. And there is a pretty fair probability that in the future, the company would have the opportunity to take it out for a small or no prepayment penalty if we ever needed to do that. So again, we think it's a great piece of capital to have in the structure long term.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then can you talk about what you're seeing in D.C. in terms of the transaction market and if there's any opportunities to acquire there?","David J. Neithercut","Well, we've seen a little bit of transaction activity other than a couple of deals that have traded before any lease-up occurred to avoid the TOPA transaction issues. But I will tell you that I'm not quite sure I can define any of that as an opportunity. We think those were still very aggressively priced. So not unlike what David has said just in terms of total operations, things are going reasonably well in D.C. given the supply. We're just not seeing a great deal of transaction activity at prices that we would consider to be opportunistic.","Operator","Nick Yulico with UBS has the next question.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just turning to your guidance and your outlook on the markets. I mean, if you look, it sounds like D.C. got a little bit worse in the second quarter. New York City got a lot better. West Coast was still very good, and Boston got a little bit weaker. How are you expecting those markets to play out in the second half of the year? Is it going to be something similar? And what's the big sort of variance -- where could the big variance to your guidance be? Is it Boston getting weaker, D.C. getting weaker or New York City getting even better?","David S. Santee","This is David Santee. We've already issued renewals out through August and September. And really when you just look at the flow of the numbers, once you lock down September, it's really hard to move the full year numbers. And really the only way to move the full year numbers significantly would be having a significant drop in occupancy. So that's why we're confident in our range, in our very tight range.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then your occupancy comps, I'm assuming you feel pretty good about in the second half of the year?","David S. Santee","Yes. I mean, we already have notices through September. Those are normal to lower than last year, which would imply we maintained the same level of occupancy. And then really, there are so few transactions in the fourth quarter relative to the full year, it's just very hard to move the full-year-number.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then just turning to the development pipeline, can you just remind us where you're expecting the stabilized yields for the pipeline in place today, and whether you've now think that those yields could be higher than you thought they were, say, last year?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I guess, everything that we delivered last year is probably performing better than expectations just because for all the comments David had said about how well we're doing in our markets. What we're working on today, starting today and expect to start is really a story of 5s and 6s. It's a story of deals yielding at current rents somewhere in the 5s and we think are stabilized 2 years or so out or 3 years out in the 6s.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And is that consistent with the existing pipeline? Or is the existing pipeline yield a little bit higher?","David J. Neithercut","Well, the existing pipeline, you mean those things under construction today?","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, that's right. And what's been recently delivered.","David J. Neithercut","What's been recently completed would be in excess of that. Right, so anything to start in 2011 is really gangbusters. Everything you start in 2012 would be a little lesser than, et cetera, et cetera. So now it's down to a point where anything started today would yield in the 5s at current rents and again we would expect to yield at 6%.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, got you. And just one last question, David. You mentioned acquisitions maybe being more attractive today, yet there's a significant spread where you could be buying at a lower initial yield than where you're selling. How do you balance that if you're also trying to create earnings growth? I mean, that sounds like that would be a dilutive process.","David J. Neithercut","Well, no company knows more about that than Equity Residential after all the activity we've taken place and we've conducted over the past half a dozen or so years. But that's certainly part of the balancing process. And we would balance that, as I noted in my opening comments, by selling assets in core markets that would be less desirable assets. And we would sell those at lower cap rates than exit markets. And again I don't -- didn't mean to suggest that we thought acquisitions were more attractive. What I suggested was that we expected to see more opportunity, but what we are seeing today remains very, very competitively sought for and pricing to be very aggressive. So we're going to see more product. We'll see if we're able to make sense of the pricing of that product relative to the proceeds and yields we'll be able to sell and raise capital assets to your point, because we do want to manage that dilution. Our sort of pledge to the market has been that the dilution experience is part of this transformation that we've taken place over the past 6 years or so will slow considerably. And we aim to deliver on that.","Operator","Moving on to Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","The cost savings that you outlined as having achieved on the Archstone portfolio are pretty impressive, especially considering that Archstone was considered to be a good operator. Can you talk about how those compare to the general cost savings opportunities you see in the broader transaction market? Were you able to save more or less on that integration than what you generally expect as you underwrite deals?","David S. Santee","I would say typically, we -- it's hard to look back and say what we actually say because we don't really have new acquisitions' previous results, so to speak. I mean, we just underwrite it. But I would say, typically, what we see are the 3 areas of opportunity are always leasing and advertising, payroll and turn costs. I can't say that most acquisitions produce that degree of savings.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then on the transaction market, David, can you just talk about why you think that you're seeing more opportunities than you expected this year? What's the nature of the sellers? Are these...","David J. Neithercut","I think pricing has been very strong, and I think sellers of assets that think that they will likely want to monetize their interests sometime in the near future are thinking this might be a good time. And a lot of that feedback comes from the brokerage network that do let us know that they've been requested by sellers to give their opinions of value. And normally, when more of those inquiries are made, that then does produce more deals coming to the marketplace. So I will say, however, though that there have been several instances in which properties have been pulled back from market because the perhaps sellers' overly-inflated expectations failed to be met. But the brokerages are telling us more is coming. We are certainly seeing more. And I think it's just more of a desire of shorter-term holders thinking today would be a great opportunity to monetize their equity investment.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And what's the landscape for portfolio purchase opportunities?","David J. Neithercut","There have been a few out there. Some concentrations in some markets, and then some larger portfolios of disparate assets across lots of markets, some of which would be considered as sort of noncore from our perspective. But I would not say that there has been an abundant amount of sort of larger portfolios. There have been just a small handful.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the last question is as you talk about starting to sell some of the noncore assets or less desirable assets within your core markets, can you just walk us through the process in which you analyze your own portfolio and discuss the attributes to some of the assets that you might be selling from these markets? Are they older? Are they more suburban? Any insight like that would be great.","David S. Santee","Yes and yes. All right. They remain older assets and more the sort of suburban circus park garden kind of product. Suburban D.C. is an example, Inland Empire, some stuff in various submarkets of Southern California, maybe even of Seattle. So if there are assets that ultimately we know that because of their age and location might not be long-term holds for us, and if there are opportunities to sell those at attractive yields relative to what we can buy, we'd be more than happy to make those trades. But there's no pressing need to do so today.","Operator","Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch has the next question.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","For David Santee, can you comment on what the new lease rent growth was in July?","David S. Santee","New lease rent, I have it for the quarter, which was 5.5%.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then any comments on As versus Bs within your portfolio?","David S. Santee","Well, when I look at our results, and I tried to allude to that in my prepared remarks, I guess I would just say, \"It depends.\" It depends on what the -- where you are in the market, what type of supply you have, what type of new product is coming online. We have some of our best-performing urban assets in Boston are B communities. Some of our best-performing assets in Seattle are B communities. So it's really a mix of location, which I think is becoming more and more critical. I think people are looking for a place that is going to shape their lifestyle. Neighborhood is ultra important. And I think if you're in those neighborhoods, both As and Bs will perform equally well.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then maybe just a quick question on the transaction market. Just maybe, David, your view on whether you're seeing any -- there's only a small amount of portfolios, but whether those are looking like they would get premiums. Or could they actually be at a little bit of a discount because there's only a limited number of buyers that could take down a very large portfolio?","David J. Neithercut","Well, it doesn't take an awful lot of buyers. It only takes 2. And I think it's very possible you could see some premium pricing on those portfolios because of size. Again, there's an awful lot of capital chasing few deals in the space. And if one has a desire to get capital out in the multifamily segment, a large portfolio may be a way to do that. And that could result in maybe some modest premium pricing.","Operator","Moving on to Ryan Peterson with Sandler O'Neill.","Ryan Peterson","You've talked about your ability to grow rents this quarter. There seems to be a lull in land large ability [ph] to push rents at the end of '13, the beginning of this year. Do you think that was seasonal? Or did it just take some time for renters to adapt to the new asking levels?","David S. Santee","I would say, in general, there is -- at the top level, portfolio level, there is definitely seasonality in the pricing. We track that. We've tracked it for the last 8 years. And basically, rents, call it, rents drift off 3% to 5% in Q4 and Q1 just because of lack of demand.","Ryan Peterson","And then on a separate note, do you think there's going to be a trend of more condo and apartment deals like yours at Toll Brothers? And if not, what are the challenges that would limit more of these deals?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I guess, it's -- we've had a very successful transaction that we've done with Toll Brothers. And I will tell you we have had numerous conversations with others on similar opportunities. But a lot of things have to come together. Pricing for the apartments have to make sense. Pricing for the condos have to make sense. The totality needs to make sense relative to the land pricing, et cetera, et cetera. And so I'm not -- I would not be surprised to see more of that, not unlike mixed-use projects you've seen. We've got a lovely property in Manhattan that's above a hotel, for instance. I think it's a great way to share cost and to mitigate risk. But again, it's just one of those things that's got to come together. It just adds more complexity and more moving parts that just makes it more difficult to accomplish.","Operator","We'll now hear from Ryan Bennett with Zelman & Associates.","Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC","I appreciate the color by submarkets in your prepared remarks. Just curious where you see the peak of new deliveries across your submarkets now versus what you saw probably at the beginning of the year.","David S. Santee","Well, you mean for '14?","Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Yes. I guess, when you're expecting the highest number of deliveries across your submarkets.","David S. Santee","Yes. So I think that the easiest way to look at it is just the calendar year. I mean, when we kind of review each of these markets on a quarterly basis, which we did last week, it was clear that about 60% -- we're about 60% of the way through our deliveries at the top level, so -- which means you have 40% to go.","Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Got it. And how do you see that playing out into 2015? Does the comp get significantly better across your submarkets based on the data that you have?","David S. Santee","Well, I guess, I would say we made some minor changes to deliveries this year. But they're only going to be pushed into 2015. So when you look at 2014 and 2015 combined, the totals haven't really changed. So we would expect declines in deliveries next year. And hopefully, with continued improving job growth, a great GDP number today, that the economy will continue to improve, and we'll continue down this path of absorbing units with relatively little disruption to our day-to-day business.","Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay, great. And then just to follow up. I think in your prepared comments, you mentioned Boston is typically seeing some increasing development shifting back towards the suburbs. Have you seen that in any other of your major markets?","David S. Santee","Yes. So when you -- probably the most obvious is Washington, D.C. You start to see development move back out to Reston and outside the Beltway beginning next year and beyond. Every other market, not so much.","Operator","The next question comes from Richard Anderson with Mizuho.","Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Just a couple maybe smaller events that maybe tell a bigger story. The first is to Mark Parrell, swapping to floating. It seems like you're getting a little greedy there. Can you talk about that strategy to go floating from a good rate to begin with?","Mark J. Parrell","Our thought -- we have a strategy on that, Rich. I mean, what we're trying to do is avail ourselves of 2 different points on that debt cost curve. And long is great, 30-year is terrific. And the other side we like is LIBOR. We think being floating rate and being short when LIBOR is 25 basis points, and feels like for the near term it'll be around that number, that feels pretty good to us. And I think with the kind of portfolio we have with the lease growth we expect, if rates do go up because, as David Santee just alluded to, we have more growth, then I think the revenue line and the interest expense line item will move in sync, and it will all make good sense. So I guess, I would say I don't get particularly greedy about that. I think that was part of the strategy.","David J. Neithercut","And we take[indiscernible].","Mark J. Parrell","Yes. I mean, we're incrementally down on floating rate debt. We're lower than most of the guys in the apartment space right now. But we'll end up at about 15%, 16% by the end of the year.","Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then to the land purchase in Seattle, despite the nice GDP number today, it seems like there and elsewhere you're kind of operating fundamentally at a hyper level -- good, solid demand offsetting increases in supply. And I'm just curious with Seattle, in particular, you have a lot of supply going on. The rationale to continue developing that market maybe, is that -- what's the thought process there? I mean, it seems like it's been great but maybe again getting a little greedy.","Mark J. Parrell","Well, again we've got a very low, relatively low, percentage of our income coming out of that marketplace. This was just about a $45 million total cost project, so not quite sure how a $35 billion company can be greedy with a $45 million development deal. And then I also suggested that in response to one of the other questions that some of what we may sell maybe some suburban Seattle stuff. I mean, what we're building is kind of downtown close-in, in Capitol Hill, in South Lake Union, in Ballard downtown. So we like those locations. And as David said, we're performing very well in those locations. So again, at less than 7% current NOI exposure, I'm not quite sure that doing a $45 million deal is getting us over our skis in Seattle.","Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. And then bigger picture, David, the 2 deals in the second quarter acquisitions were kind of a value-add sort of swing to it with buying some vacancy. Do you think that will be more and more a part of the acquisition story for you to get reasonable pricing on deals to take on a little bit of lease-up risk in the front end?","David J. Neithercut","Well, the one deal, we put under contract in 2011, so it was not a recent decision on that. The one deal we did buy in Glendale was that. And we bought vacant properties, maybe half a dozen vacant properties. So I think that anything that we do that we believe gives us a competitive advantage to buy a property at a more attractive price is something that we'll do. So we're certainly not afraid of that. And that again was an example of someone looking to monetize their interest in a good market, and not willing to sort of wait the extra 6 months or year for a deal to get stabilized. And we're happy to be there to take advantage of that. And again, we'd buy the deal at stabilized 5%, then trade it at a low 4%, maybe even a high 3%. So it's one way a company of our size can take advantage of our balance sheet to maybe get a premium return.","Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then last question maybe for Santee. 30 -- I'm sorry, $20 million in incremental rental revenue, second quarter versus first quarter, understanding the seasonality issues and the strong performance during the quarter. But is that a good number? Or is there anything kind of lumpy in the second quarter revenue number, top line?","David S. Santee","Just pure, good revenue, Rich.","Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Okay. So my NAV is now $80.","Operator","Vahid Khorsand with BWS Financial has the next question.","Vahid Khorsand - BWS Financial Inc.","First question, on the Washington, D.C. market, it looks like it's stable but has -- could grow and could improve. Is that what it looks like to you?","David S. Santee","Well, D.C., we have, what, 20,000 deliveries this year? We're roughly 60% through that. However, when I look at our billings today, we are, for the month, minus 10 basis points. So we are seeing better occupancy. We are seeing the net effective base rents stabilize. I mean, as I mentioned, some weeks, they can be up 2%. Next week, they could be down 1%. It really just depends on what's available and where and to what degree that impacts the portfolio. But I guess, I would say that I'm very pleased with how D.C. is behaving. And if the next 6 months are like the last 6 months, then I think we're setting the stage for some reasonable stable performance.","Vahid Khorsand - BWS Financial Inc.","With that in mind, do you think we're approaching a timeframe where you might be looking to add assets in the D.C. market?","David J. Neithercut","Yes, I responded to a similar question earlier suggesting that what we've seen in terms of pricing, what's taken place, is that there have been not anything we define as opportunity. So I don't think that's a market that we're going to be pursuing at the current time. But we never say never. If, not unlike the lease-up deals we just did, we found something that we thought we could do at a premium, we may very well do that. And we'd pair that with a sale of something onto the suburban market so that net exposure would not increase.","Vahid Khorsand - BWS Financial Inc.","Okay. And my final question on the leasing and advertising line, what do you attribute to the drop that seems to be happening every quarter on that? Is that related to the efficiencies through the Archstone deal? Or is that something else?","David S. Santee","Well, I guess, I would say that it's related to the Archstone inclusion. However, the savings is spread across the entire legacy portfolio. And probably the best example, if you go to New York City, where we have 2 properties right across the street, Archstone used to be in ForRent, in Apartments.com and what-have-you. And we would have our property in all those same 3 or 4 ILSs. And basically, what we do is we go in and we optimize so that perhaps the Archstone property goes from 4 ILSs down to 2. And our property goes from 4 ILSs down to 2. And we'd cross-sell those properties on our website, so you're basically eliminating half of your ILS spend due to the closed proximity of the assets.","Operator","We'll now hear from George Hoglund with Jefferies.","George Hoglund - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I just have 2 questions. The first one is on Orange County. Since it's had some strong performance this year so far, they've got increasing supply coming on in the first half of '15, how do you view that market being able to absorb that supply?","David S. Santee","It's -- we've seen extremely good job growth in Orange County. I would say that there's maybe 1 or 2 large deals that could have some short-term impact. But we feel very comfortable that, that market can absorb the supply that's on the books as of today.","George Hoglund - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just the second question is with the homebuilders moving moreso into the multifamily development, how do you view that going forward as sort of impacting things in terms of will it be moreso deals like your existing deal with Toll? Or do you think that it will be moreso homebuilders just doing these deals on their own? And do you think this will have a significant pressure on supply or potential pressure on supply going forward?","David J. Neithercut","Well, from what we understand, from my conversations with the few that are doing it, is it's more of the latter. It's just them thinking it's a good business for them to be in directly. But I think thus far, it's really been in markets in which they've got large single-family home presences and just really haven't bumped up [indiscernible]. It's a lot of Sunbelt product that we just don't think competes with us. So at the present time, we don't see it as a competitive threat to us.","Operator","We'll now hear from Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Michael Bilerman. I just had a couple of quick follow-ups. One is just sort of capital structure. If your thinking has evolved on the 30-year debt, I'm curious how you're thinking is on common equity. And the reason I ask is when you did the Archstone deal, you obviously issued a billing in the, call it -- I think it was $54.75-ish [ph], if I remember correctly, stock is up north of 20% since then. I guess, how do you think about using equity? If you can't find the dispositions or you haven't brought stuff to market and you find some acquisition opportunities, would you use equity?","David J. Neithercut","It's certainly [indiscernible] in our quarter. I guess, we're at a point, Michael, where we continue to have some odds and ends of assets that we'd like to use as the capital to provide proceeds to buy whatever we think we may like to do out there. I don't think there's anything that's terribly important or strategic or overly compelling for us at the current juncture. So my guess is our expectation would be to buy with what we can with what we can sell, to buy assets at these prices and issue stocks at these prices. I mean, maybe there's some modest kind of arbitrage in there, but over 375 million shares I'm not quite sure that there's a whole lot of purpose there. But we certainly do look at all of the [indiscernible] capital -- all of the different segments of capital. And Mark and his team have done a great job across the debt side. And obviously, we're very pleased with where our stock is today and have that be at a place where it might make sense to actually do that. But again, that's also a function of what [indiscernible] you can buy and what the right proceeds. And we always consider all of those options.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I guess, there's no need for what you have on your plate today to even tap the ATM?","David J. Neithercut","That's correct. I mean, our development pipeline, as Mark has said over the past several calls, between free cash flow, the disposition of proceeds, we can manage the pipeline of development that we have. So we are not obligated to go into the market to address them.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then I assume there's been no change or evolution in terms of how you're thinking about some of the adjuncts to housing, whether it be single-family rental, student housing, senior housing. There hasn't been any shift in your or Sam's thinking on any of that, has there?","David J. Neithercut","That's correct. There has been no shifts. We looked at single-family years ago and didn't see it as anything but a distraction. And as we think about the markets we're in today, the assets we own and operate, they're attractive to students. They're attractive to seniors. And we don't think we need to move into sort of purpose-built product to access those 2 segments.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Just last one on conversion to condos, anything that you're sort of working on where you can sort of raise capital that would be a pretty low effective cap rate? I know you talked about selling some potential core assets -- noncore assets in core markets, but I'm curious as the conversion play.","David J. Neithercut","Well, so far, I think that's been a little bit more talk than action. I think that certainly, we look at our assets and there could be condominium premium embedded in those. But so far, that's probably been more talk. We've seen pricing on the post trade that seemed to have been gone off at some kind of premium. Again, a lot of that is a function of what are you going to do with the proceeds, because those have to be reinvested. But certainly, it's something that we're thoughtful of and keeping an eye on.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Can you do that on any of Upper West Side buildings, the Trump buildings?","David J. Neithercut","You mean structurally?","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Well, I just think the pricing of what Extell is doing.","David J. Neithercut","Say it again?","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","The pricing of what Extell is building south of that obviously would mean a very high value as condos for some of those buildings.","David J. Neithercut","Well, obviously, that's extremely brand-new product being built to a particular spec. You can't necessarily extrapolate that directly to a product that was built as apartments that could be now 15 years ago. But clearly, we're aware of what's happening and the timing of activity around our properties. I'll also sort of tell you that much of what you read about condos in a place like New York City with a very high-end luxury, large price point stop, and you read very little about what's happening at the more middle range. But it's something we'll keep a close eye on.","Operator","And our next question will come from Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","A couple of quick follow-ups there. David Santee, you mentioned a 5.5% on new leases. I think that was second quarter. Do you have the -- is that a year-to-date? Or do you have a lease-over-lease rate there? And then also given the occupancy and lower move-outs that you're seeing, can you talk about the strategy with new leases in the back half of the year, whether you expect to continue to hold that out a bit more or you expect that to follow more normal seasonality?","David S. Santee","Yes, I'm glad you asked that question because I quoted the renewal rate at 5.5%, 5.5% versus the new lease. So the base rent year-over-year is 4%. So new leases are 4%, renewals are 5.5%, and then the combined for Q2 is 4.1%.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then how does that translate to the back half of the year strategy in terms of new lease rates? Do you expect anything different relative to the normal seasonality we've seen the last couple of years?","David S. Santee","No, I think what we see year after year is that rates will drift down. I mean, we are attempting, as we discussed previously, to minimize those expirations in Q4, to minimize that drift in both the occupancy and rental rate. In a place like D.C., we're probably going to be a little more defensive in maintaining that occupancy only because we're not done yet. We still have another year of big deliveries. And the stronger we can maintain occupancy in a market that's delivering units, the more pricing power or the less susceptible we are to having to give concessions. So that will be our strategy in that market. But typically, the seasonal pattern is identical year after year after year. It's just -- but what we see is that we see the same gaps. So if rents are up 4% today, we would expect that -- those rents to drift off, but still be 4% above last year in Q4.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And then David, just the $500 million you've identified as your acquisition and disposition target, how much of that has actually been identified at this point? You talked about a potentially large pipeline. But just curious of the opportunities you're looking at today, how much of that has been identified?","David J. Neithercut","I mean, I guess, enough of it that we think that the $500 million and $500 million can and will be achieved. And I guess, again my comment is we think that as the year progresses, there will be more opportunity and perhaps we'll have an opportunity to identify more. But as we looked at what was kicking around out there that we were working on under contract, et cetera, we've felt confident that $500 million and $500 million was still doable.","Operator","And gentlemen, we have no further questions. Mr. McKenna, I'll turn the conference back to you for closing or additional remarks.","Marty McKenna","All right. Thank you all very much. Enjoy August and the rest of summer. And I'm sure we'll see a lot of you around in September. Thanks for joining us today.","Operator","And again ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you all for your participation."],"8852":["Equity Residential.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I'd like to turn the conference over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead.","Marty McKenna","Thanks, James. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's third quarter 2017 results. Our featured speakers today are David Neithercut, our President and CEO; David Santee, our Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Parrell, our Chief Financial Officer.","Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.","And now I'll turn the call over to David Neithercut.","David Neithercut","Thank you, Marty. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for today's call. We were pleased that across our markets we continue to experience very deep and resilient demand for apartment living. As David Santee will explain in more detail in just a moment, despite elevated levels of new supply our portfolio performed very well during the lease confusion. Driven by great property management and operational support teams that will now deliver results for the full year that will meet or exceed our original expectations for revenue growth in every markets day one","Across our portfolio we see the benefits to our business with an expanding economy producing jobs, loans, unemployment, and rising incomes which continue to drive strong and steady demand for rental housing in our core markets. As a result we now expect to achieve year-over-year growth of same store revenue and net operating income towards the upper end of our original expectations and our year-over-year growth in normalized funds from operations will be the upper end of the range we provided last February as well.","So I\u2019ll let David Santee go into more detail about how our markets performed during the extremely important third quarter and then Mark Parrell will give some color on operating expenses and our guidance for this year.","David Santee","Okay. Thank you, David. I am extremely pleased with the performamce of our property teams during our busiest quarter of the annual business cycle as they continued to deliver remarkable service and renewal results despite elevated deliveries across all of our markets.","In addition to the 4.7% renewal rate increases achieved for the quarter, our annualized year-to-date retention improved 230 basis points which was up 80 basis points from Q2.","In addition to renewing 54% of our expiring leases for the quarter, occupancy improved by 40 basis points sequentially and was 20 basis points better quarter-over-quarter. And as I said on the previous call, physical [ph] occupancy continued to hold which it has, we would deliver full year results at the high end of our original guidance which we will. ","With 2017 deliveries peaking in the second half of the year across most of our markets, our results demonstrate that demand for quality, urban apartments, continues to be very good. And as I\u2019ve stated last quarter, we see no indications that demand will soften beyond the normal seasonal trends for the balance of the year.","Renewal rate thus far for October are 4.6%, with occupancy 20 bips higher than same week last year at 96.3% and available inventory flat we are in a good position to end the year and deliver full year revenue growth of 2.3%.","Moving out of the markets, again no different than last quarter, Washington DC is our only market that will fail to meet or exceed our original expectations. As peak deliveries from Q2 led into Q3, rates have stabilized community further deteriorate in the Central district sub market.","Federal job vacancies and weak government procurement further pressured this sub market as new development came online in a lot of front sub markets. However, the fall-off in demand that we experienced late in Q2 did recover allowing us to achieve a fully basis point increase in sequential occupancy to 96.2%.","Renewal growth moderated to 3.8% for the quarter as DC is our only market to experience an increase in year-to-date turnover. New lease pricing was a minus 2.6% driven mostly by the Central DC and the FAS [Ph] to submarkets.","While all indicators signal an improving local economy, the pace of improvement is only sufficient to absorb new units at market rental rates that were below expectations. Better clarity on federal initiatives and improving job growth will be the necessary catalyst to absort future deliveries with positive late growth.","New York city was stable in the quarter and continues to outperform our relatively pessimistic expectations. Today, we enjoy a very strong occupancy of 96.9% an exposure that is 30 basis points better than same week last year. Renewal increases were 3% for the quarter and combined with higher retention mitigate the minus 4.1% renewed lease over leased results that combine to achieve the positive 10 basis points revenue growth year-to-date.","Compared to Q2, these results are very good as New York had more leads available in Q3 than any other quarter in 2017. Moving two sessions of one month or more are still mostly limited to new lease ups, concessions on stabilized assets across our portfolio which again are very targeted to certain properties and unit pipes ticked down slightly from $485 per move in to $436 per move in or from an average of 3.8 days to 3.5 days per move in for the quarter.","Our net effective rents which factor in concessions are currently flat from the same time last year which is an improvement from last quarter when they were down 2.3% compared with the same time the previous year.","Additionally, we have not the need to use non revenue incentives such as gift cards. And as a result New York City list in advertising cost are down almost 39% for the quarter. These have been positive signs thus far but we acknowledge that the market still faces a significant amount of supply and slowing job growth.","For Boston, the summer student churn proved to be a little more challenging than previous years, but recovered quickly to deliver a 30 basis point quarter over quarter improvement in occupancy.","Renewal growth of 5.2% was very strong in addition to 130 basis point improvement in retention. New lease pricing was positive 30 basis points for the quarter. New deliveries and downtown in Cambridge continue to weigh on new lease rents, however recent annoucments with large office space leases by Facebook, Bristol-Myers Squibb in these sub markets are encouraging for demand and above average led growth in the future.","Seattle remains on track to be our top performing market and will exceed our most optimistic expectations. Renewal increases for the quarter were 7.8%, however new leased pricing weakened either in quick reaction to the news of Amazon HQ2 or due to rate pressure as new deliveries peaked in Q3.","New lease rate increases were 2.6 for the quarter which was down from the 10.4% increase realized in Q2. Occupancy also dipped 50 basis points, but this reaction proved to be short lived. Today, new leased rates are now back up to 6.9% versus same week last year and renewal increases for October are 8%. They have averaged 8% going all the way back to May.","Today, both occupancy at 95.7% and normal seasonal exposure are now back to the same levels that we\u2019ve experienced in 2016.","Estimates are that Amazon still has approximately 10,000 new jobs to fill before they begin to level off in 2018. The Jury is still out on the full impact of the HQ2 decision, but given the City has not kept pace with infrastructure and transportation needs perhaps a few years of moderation is the best interest of everyone for the long term.","Recent announcements of large office space leases other than Amazon or related entities is welcome news in the interest of a more diversified economy. More down to San Francisco, San Francisco continue to be steady through the quarter as deliveries reached their lowest level in seven quarters, while job growth was near than the national average and the lease up environment remained accommodating there was little momentum to overcome the rental rate hangover we experienced in 2016.","New leased rents improved modestly resulting in a leased over lease decline of 1.9%. Renewal rates continued to improve and increase to 4.6% for the quarter. This combined with a 260 basis point increase in retention drove revenue growth of 1.6% that far exceeded our original expectation.","Southern California still remains the story of submarkets and the story is playing out as we expected. The LA region downtown in Pasadena was weakest as new supply pressured new lease rents. West LA, this valley in Santa Clarita delivered exceptional results as new supply is nonexistent. Job growth remains healthy and economy that relies heavily on the film industry is being bolstered by outsized demand for original content as code cutters sneak out alternative forms of entertainment.","While leased out release rates were up 80 basis points, renewal rates were up 5.9%. We also had a 100 basis point improvement in retention and a 30 basis point within occupancy. In both Orange County and San Diego, new deliveries fell off significantly in the back half of the year. This helped drive lease over lease growth of 2.3% and 2.5% respectively and renewals were second only to Seattle at 6% and 6.9% respectively.","So all-in-all we had a very strong quarter, given the level of new deliveries across our markets. I am extremely proud of our team\u2019s ability to achieve the renewal results in both rate and retention and know that all of our employees out there are the secret sauce that allows us to happen. So thank you all. Mark?","Mark Parrell","Thank you, David and good morning. I want to take a couple of minutes to talk today about our same store expenses, our revised full year normalized FFO guidance and our capital markets activities. Our same store expenses were up 1.7% for the third quarter and this was driven by a relatively modest increase in payroll and utilities and an increase of 2.9% in property taxes.","On the plus side, the third quarter property tax increase was considerably less than we had expected due to favourable results we obtained on several property tax appeals. Our annual property tax expense guidance included an estimate of appeal success based on the many years of experience of our in house property tax team and we had a few large appeals that were resolved sooner than we had anticipated in our guidance.","And as we discussed on the July call, leasing and advertising expense growth has as expected turned negative for the quarter and year-to-date , newly non-existent spending on resident gift cards as David Santee mentioned is driving the reduction.","Switching to the year-to-date numbers, our same store expenses are up 2.9% for the first nine months of 2017, again increases in real-estate taxes and onside payroll continue to be the primary drivers of this growth. Same store payroll expense was up 4.7% through the first nine months of the year. As we have discussed on previous calls we continue to be impacted in this category by a combination of wage pressure to retain our property level employees in a very competitive market and the addition of staff in some markets to provide even better service to our residents and the support resident retention.","These factors and a higher estimate for certain employee medical insurance and workmen\u2019s comp claims have caused us to maintain our estimate that on-site payroll will grow about 6% for the full year.","We have revised our full year same store property tax expense increased guidance to 3.4% and that\u2019s down from our previous 4% to 4.5% growth expectation all for the reasons I just mentioned. This improvement in our estimate of real estate tax expense growth in turn drove the reduction and our same store expense growth guidance to 3.2% which is slightly below the low end of our previous guidance range.","Moving onto normalized FFO, in our earnings release we provided a full year same store revenue increased guidance expectation of 2.2% and that\u2019s at the high end of our previous range driven by the factors that David Santee just discussed. This revenue number and our new expense growth guidance of 3.2% will lead to an increase in same store NOI of 1.8% which is slightly above the top end of our previous range.","For our annual normalized FFO guidance we are picking up two pennies per share and higher property NOI with a contribution from both our better same store performance and strong performance from our leased up properties. We will see a one penny offset to this improvement due to slightly higher interest expense due to the size of our debt issuance as well as other items including a slight increase in corporate overhead.","Combining all of this the result is a modest increase to our normalized FFO guidance midpoint to $3.12 per share from $3.11 per share. Now going to the balance sheet, as we discussed in our earnings release, we issued $700 million of unsecured debt in August and that consisted of $400 million of 10-year notes and $300 million of 30 year notes.","Our July guidance included an assumption that we would issue about 500 million in tenure notes this year, recognizing the strength of a third year market, we decided to add a third year issuance while slightly pairing down to 10 year note issuance and indeed overall demand was exceptional for us. We were over four times oversubscribed, our tenure was down at a coupon of 3.25% and an all in rate of 3.32% and the third year has a 4% coupon and an all in effective rate of 4.11%.","The third year was our lowest cost third year issuance ever and one of the lowest third year unsecured bond coupons and REIT industry history. We used the proceeds to pay down our outstanding commercial paper and revolve the balance. We thank our many strong supporters in a fixed income community for this terrific result.","So all-in-all better than expected revenue, expense and NOI results, a slight increase in our normalized FFO and a very good unsecured debt issuance.","I\u2019ll turn the call back over to David Neithercut.","David Neithercut","All right thanks, Mark. Just a moment, a quick moment in capital allocation. As we know it in last night\u2019s press release, our transaction activity picked up some in the third quarter with the acquisition of three assets. A stabilized 301 unit property completed in 2016 in the Wiltshire Center submarket in Los Angeles was acquired for $117 million at a cap rate for 4.5%.","During the quarter we also acquired two brand new assets that were both nearing completion of their initial lease up, one in Boston, 160 unit property acquired for $116 million has stabilized cap rate of 4.5%.","We also acquired a 350 unit property in Bellevue, Washington for $178 million at a stabilized cap rate of 5.3. During the quarter we disposed off one asset a 120 unit property in [Indiscernible] California built in 2002 for $53 million at a disposition yield of 4.3% and we realized a 10.1% unleveraged IRR on that investment.","Now at the present time we do not expect to acquire additional assets before the year is up. So as a result the $468 million acquired through the end of the third quarter will most likely be our number for the full year, but that could change if the seller needs to complete a transaction by year end and we are incentivized to help make that happen.","We also continue to actively work on the disposition of a handful of assets that could close yet this year, so we have every expectation that we will get closer to the original guidance and dispositions of $500 million for the year.","On the development side, in the third quarter we were very excited to essentially complete the construction on our new 398 unit high rise tower in Seattle, just two block from high place markets. Rents and absorption rates are well above our original pro forma and we expect this asset to stabilize at a yield on cost of about 5.6%.","You\u2019ll note that the budget for this development has been increased by the $11.5 million and this represents changes in scope that have occurred since construction began on this asset in 2014.","As rents continue to increase across the Seattle market, we were compelled to increase the quality of the unit appliance packages and the overall finishes of the property including the amenities in the common areas. We could not be more pleased with the job our team in Seattle did delivering this asset and the market reaction to it has been tremendous thus far.","But during the quarter, we also completed our 178-year development in Washington DC's Mt. Vernon Triangle Submarket, this asset is also been very well received by the marketplace. Since occupancy began in June they\u2019re already 69% occupied and 80% leased as rents that are very much in line with our original expectations. We expect to realize the stabilized yield on cost of this new development of 5.7% this was a job well done by a DC team.","During the third quarter we started our first new development of the year, a small one, 137 units in the Capitol Hill market in Seattle. This project has a $62 million development cost and we project a high 5% stabilized yield on cost in this transaction. And it remains possible that we will start construction and one more development project before the year is out, also small 84 units in Cambridge Massachusetts.","This is adjacent to an existing 186-unit asset we have in that market in the construction budget and this deal would be about $50 million and the yield on cost currently projected in the mid-5s.","So before we open the call to Q&A I just wanted [Indiscernible] one additional time on having been recently recognized by GRESB for the fourth consecutive year as a leader in environmental, social and governance performance. We take our responsibilities and our commitments on these matters quite seriously here and everyone at Equity is honored that we recognize that this year's global residential listed leader. My thanks to everyone at Equity for helping, make that happen again this year.","So with that James we\u2019ll open the call to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question today from Nick Yulico with UBS.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. I wanted to start with the topic of supply. In your view is this year the peak supply impact for your markets overall? And then I was hoping to break down which cities are still are seeing your supply ease versus get worse. I think New York City, Seattle and San Francisco are couple controversial markets that come to mind?","David Neithercut","Okay. Nick, this is David. I\u2019ll just kind of give you a higher, lower by market. Starting with Boston, 18 deliveries slightly lower, New York slightly higher, but -- or higher but some of that is push from 17 and 18, Washington D.C. pretty much identical to 17. San Francisco little bit lower. Seattle lower, Los Angeles significantly higher 8000 up to 14 14,500, Orange County about the same 5,000, San Diego just a little bit more at 3,500 units.","Just to be clear Nick this is the way we look at the \u2013 with our competitive set those projects in these marketplaces that we look at that would compete with us. So this would not be a holistic amount across an entire marketplace, but those that are within that, so defined boundary that we look as competitive to us.","Nick Yulico","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. So I guess, David putting this all together. It has been several years of him slowing growth -- revenue growth and multifamily. You\u2019ve gone to this year you're seeing some stability in your markets. There is some supply pockets of pressure still next year. Hoping to just get any earlier thought you\u2019ll be willing to share on next year and whether your same-store revenue growth could excel a great next year? And what would be a driver for that with certain markets or not? Thanks.","David Neithercut","Well, I guess I would say, job with full employment it's probably difficult to expect outsized job. And then when we go across the markets we just look at where the supply is going to impact us. So, as an example Boston 50% of the new deliveries will be in the urban core and 20% are going to be in Cambridge. But there\u2019s announcements of Facebook taking a sizable office spaces in Cambridge which I discussed previously. So even though there is elevated supply there we expected to be absorbed with minimal impact to rate.","You know, D.C. is really, it's pretty much everywhere, but 45% of those deliveries are very concentrated in the Riverfront D.C. Central and NoMa Submarket, so places like RBC corridor where we have little \u2013 where we have a lot of product we\u2019ll see little deliveries. Kind of going on to New York, I mean, when you look at the deliveries or even the delayed delivery, 57% of those numbers both really this year and next year are in Long Island City will we have no presence. And then Midtown West where we don't have a large presence, adding that in Jersey Waterfront is 23%, so 70%, 80% of the deliveries in New York are really not directly competing with our assets.","So, I mean, I can go on through the rest of the markets, but I think that\u2019s how we\u2019re kind of looking at next year and our ability to drive rates and retain our residence and grab good renewal rate growth.","Nick Yulico","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I mean, just a follow-up here. So is it, when you look at everything you look across your markets right now and everything you talked about supplies is just too early to get a read on 2018 showing you better rent growth and revenue growth for your markets?","David Neithercut","It just too early, we\u2019re not prepared to give guidance at this at this juncture, Nick.","Nick Yulico","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll hear from Nick Joseph with Citi.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. David, you talk about the acquisitions in the third quarter, but just more broad there, are you\u2019re seeing more opportunities for acquisitions that you have over the past few years? And what do you think is driving that, if so? ","David Neithercut","I\u2019ll be careful with the use of the term opportunity, Nick. Are we seeing more product? No. I think the volume is, I guess, okay. It\u2019s still down from a year ago. I don't think we\u2019ve seen the same amount of product that we had seen kind of in the past. And I wouldn't characterize any of it\u2019s from an opportunity. I think there\u2019s a lot of capital that\u2019s maybe backed away maybe from core product, but there's still enough out there that what is getting done is getting done at the same kind of cap rates and valuations that we\u2019ve seen first for some time. But I would not suggest that we\u2019ve seen anything would represent as opportunities.","Nick Joseph","David, you had talked with Michael Bilerman and its probably going back 18 months that there were as more merchant development or the potential for merchant development deals to start to crack and that was in the serve potential as an opportunity to put a lot of capital to work sort of within this timeframe. Is that not coming to fruition at all?","David Neithercut","Well, I guess I'm not sure, my comments Michael should have interpreted expecting something to crack, but more that there just would be deals that one could acquire that been recently built that might represent better sort of risk-adjusted opportunity to deploy capital rather than develop oneself at least in the marketplace today. Now as I noted, what we acquired in the third quarter two of those were deal that had been recently completed and that were in their final stages of lease-up.","So we have executed couple of those. I think we got decent going in yields relative to what stabilized product might have traded for. So I wasn\u2019t -- I'm not sure we expected anything to sort of crack, but rather there might be a flow of product. We demonstrated by buying two and my guess is that there will be opportunities for us to look at more of that product from 2018.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. And then, just one more follow-up. In terms of the free cash flow for next year I think you talked about the 275 million or so. Just curious what is most attractive where we stand today for the use of that in terms of additional acquisitions, development, paying down debt, raising the dividend. Just your thoughts on that where we stand today?","David Neithercut","Well, I guess, I\u2019d say, we will consider all of those, Nick. We had board meeting in September and Mark Parrell laid out that exact situation and the options we might have with that free cash flow now that our development spend has decrease considerably over the past several years. So, we\u2019ll consider when the time comes what we think is the best execution on behalf of our shareholders and won\u2019t be afraid to buy if it make sense, address the dividend if it makes sense, or think about development if it make sense.","Nick Joseph","Thank you.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll hear from Rich Hightower with Evercore.","Rich Hightower","Hi. Good morning guys.","David Neithercut","Good morning, Rich.","Rich Hightower","I wanted to quickly follow-up on Nick Yulico\u2019s question about New York. Just with respect to your outlook for submarket supply next year, but does your experience in 2016 where I think you sort of discovered that renters were submarket agnostic in many ways in New York. Does that sort of temper your view on what New York could be next year in terms of rent growth despite the fact that you're fairly well protected from a submarket perspective currently?","David Neithercut","Well, I think the biggest most obvious discussion for our portfolio would be Long Island City and we just haven't seen \u2013 our concern was with value hunters be willing to move out of the city into Long Island City for a better value. And we just really haven't seen that materialized. And then when you look at a big portion of what's being delivered in Brooklyn is further east. Brooklyn pretty much held up reasonably well for us. So we don't see a big chunk of these new deliveries next year really impacting us if the market continues to be disciplined the way it has this year.","Rich Hightower","Okay. That's helpful. And then back to third quarter results really quickly in Seattle. So pretty strong on the rent growth side, but there was a pretty significant delta between rent growth and in total revenue growth. Can you tell us what was going on in some of those other revenue categories during the third quarter in Seattle?","Mark Parrell","Hey, Rich, it\u2019s Mark Parrell. So just going over to the quarter-over-quarter numbers and giving you a little bit of background. Average rental rate physical occupancy and turnover are all numbers we compute solely with regards to the residential portfolio which is 96 plus percent of our income. We do have as you know, retail in the base of our buildings as tenant amenities dry cleaners and the like. That number that we report, the revenue number for the quarter for Seattle which was 4.9%, that number does include retail garage than anything else.","So we had some retail vacancy in the third quarter in Seattle. We also had some stuff that was really a timing issue that will correct itself in the fourth quarter. So if you would've look at that number, 4.9 it would have in the 6% number just on residential. But again it's not anything particularly material and a great deal that will reverse itself in the fourth quarter.","Rich Hightower","That\u2019s perfect. Thanks Mark.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll move to Conor Wagner with Street Advisors.","Conor Wagner","Good morning.","David Neithercut","Good morning, Conor.","Conor Wagner","David Santee on the bay area can you give us some color on the difference between the performance in Oakland, San Francisco and then San Jose?","David Santee","Sure. So we don't have anything in Oakland.","Conor Wagner","I mean the East Bay in general.","David Santee","Okay. So, the downtown market continues to be under pressure. That is the b bottom performing submarket. The best performance is in the Peninsula, and then East Bay, South Bay, Berkeley kind of all in between, but very similar.","Conor Wagner","Okay. And then in South Bay, that's your in San Jose there in Silicon Valley?","David Santee","Yes.","Conor Wagner","Okay. And then on that transaction activity, David Nethercutt, can you just remind me, the numbers you are putting in cap rates, is that one year forward nominal or on the lease-up what rent is that on? Is that on the assumption of stabilization?","David Neithercut","The transactions that are stabilized that would be our forward 12 across the acquisition. And on the lease-up it would be the second 12 month period of ownership.","Conor Wagner","And on that second 12 month are you assuming some rent growth in that interim period? Or is that based on today's rents?","David Neithercut","Depending on the marketplace it would either be \u2013 that could include some combination of burn off of perhaps what the developer might offered in concessions, as well as some sort of rent growth. Yes, there would be some view as to what would be taking place on the rent side in that second 12 month period.","Conor Wagner","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","David Neithercut","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America.","Juan Sanabria","Hi. Good morning. I was just hoping you could talk to the concession environment for lease-up across your major markets and whether you've seen any step up in the amount of free rent or other forms of concessions into the fourth quarter today?","David Santee","Juan, its David Santee. As far as concessions on lease-up, I mean, it\u2019s been very stable and within expectations places like Seattle, even our Brannan deal in Downtown San Francisco. We had very strong demand, so we didn't come out of the chute with the standard one month concession. And everywhere else it's pretty consistently. I mean, there's not no markets that are giving more than one month on lease-up at least in the lease for our portfolio and we don't we haven't seen any change through the peak season.","Juan Sanabria","So its fair to say you aren't seeing the same panic that we saw in 2016 at least to date despite the peak supply at this point in 2017?","David Santee","Not even close, no, very stable.","Juan Sanabria","Okay. And then just on the new lease growth. Could you give us a sense of the trend throughout the third quarter, and kind of where you are fourth quarter to date for the portfolio as a whole?","David Neithercut","Well, all I could give you today would be kind of a snapshot of our market rents relative to our exposure and today across the portfolio, market rents versus the same week last year are up about 2.5% which bodes very well considering we\u2019re in the entering the slower time of the year.","Juan Sanabria","And the churn on the new lease signed during the third quarter decelerate throughout the third quarter given seasonality?","David Neithercut","Well, I guess that would be a market by market discussion, but I gave you all of the Q3 lease over lease numbers in my prepared remarks.","Juan Sanabria","Great. Thanks. And one last quick one from me, any reason for that we saw a couple of development delays in the expected delivery dates, any reason for that it seem to be more on the West Coast?","David Santee","Well, there is several reasons. I can tell you that our property in San Francisco our Brannan asset is just having some issues getting sufficient labor to close out the last 122 or so units on that property. And then on property cascade in Seattle, we had some issues completing some of the exterior work because of some work that we'd be done \u2013 being done across the street that was sort of closing down some streets or some sidewalks that caused delay. But its very important sort of note with respect to these two deals. Each of them have been pushed back maybe one or maybe one a couple of orders, but that did not push back at all the date upon which those properties were first made available for lease.","So I think it\u2019s a very important thing we get ask a lot of questions about what's happening with \u2013 is your performance and the result of property being pushed back or completion being pushed back and this is a perfect example of why we don\u2019t really pay a lot of attention to those being pushed back. These deals were pushed back but did not affect when they open and available in the marketplace, and it will not affect the overall leasing velocity and overall performance of these assets despite that one being pushed back a quarter and I think being pushed back a couple of quarters.","Juan Sanabria","Thank you.","David Santee","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Dennis McGill with Gilman Associates has our next question.","Dennis McGill","Hi. Thank you, guys. First one, just for the portfolio as a whole do you have the new on the renewal rate increases in third quarter? Sorry if I missed it.","Mark Parrell","The renewal for the portfolio was 47 and the lease over lease was minus 90 basis poins.","Dennis McGill","Okay, great. Thank you. And just back to the supply conversation. When you noted the different increases across markets are increases or decreases, as you said, it was on how you define the boundaries and what\u2019s competitive with you. Can you maybe just elaborate on how you do define those boundaries? Is it a distance from the property? Is it qualitative at the market level? Any thoughts there would be helpful?","David Neithercut","Well, I think if you look at some of the data stops, they\u2019re using the statistical MSA which if you use New York as an example goes all the way down to almost Philadelphia far west into New Jersey, further up into outer New York almost Connecticut. And in our portfolio in New York is really Manhattan, a little bit on the Jersey waterfront and then a little bit in Brooklyn.","So we just kind of draw a circle around all of that and focus on the deliveries within that boundary. This year or last year we decided to include Long Island city which really is a different price point probably a different -- a little bit different demographic knowing that new submarket could draw residents from the city. So, I think we\u2019re very conservative in giving ourselves, being intellectually honest withdrawing these boundaries plus we\u2019re going all the way down to kind of five level \u2013 five-unit communities, so we\u2019re including everything knowing that anything that's on the market for lease could impact demand in our footprint.","Dennis McGill","So that the radius of that circle is defined at each level with the local teams, or is there uniform definition?","David Neithercut","Yes.","Dennis McGill","Okay.","David Neithercut","So, we \u2013 go ahead.","Dennis McGill","Okay. So on New York specifically earlier you had said in New York that the supply in 2018 would be slightly higher, I think are higher versus 2017. But then later you said that about 80% of what's being delivered is not directly competing with your assets? So the increase encompassing some of those areas like Long Island city that you mentioned are not directly competing or is that slight increase versus 2017 just in your competitive set?","David Neithercut","So the increase in New York for 2018, some of that is a push going back back to that delayed units, it's you probably couple thousand units that are being moved from 2017 in the 2018. Now when you look at where all of these deliveries are, the largest concentration and when I say concentration I mean literally within a couple of blocks of each other. 57% of the number for 2018 is 19,000 units. So 57% of those 19,000 units are predominantly in Long Island city and Far East and North Brooklyn.","Okay. So we have probably four smaller assets in Brooklyn. We have nothing in Long Island city, but we have incorporated that into our own customized but competitive set knowing that because of the value opportunity in Long Island city that some folks could [Indiscernible] to save on rent.","Dennis McGill","Okay. That makes sense. And then I\u2019m just venting [ph] to compare against?","Mark Parrell","Well, we started out the year with I think a little above 15 and now were down to 13\u2026","David Neithercut","It\u2019s about 15 to\u2026","Mark Parrell","15 to 17 and 19 for 18 [ph], yes","Dennis McGill","Okay, great. Thank you, guys. Good luck.","Mark Parrell","And I\u2019ll just, before we go to next question, I had one little other piece of information to you Dennis with respect to that lease over lease. The number that David gave you 90 basis points is our total lease over lease. 12 month lease expiring over a 12 month lease which's been writing is half that amount, so it's about negative 40 basis.","David Neithercut","Right.","Operator","Next over here from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Good morning. Dave, just going back to the comments on the lack of opportunity from the Merchant, you had to pick up deals from the Merchant guy. Is that, you think that's more just where your portfolio is in terms of timing of deliveries and maybe those deals that you thought would crack this year getting delayed until next year or is it something else going on.","Because obviously from some of your peers, they've said differently. So, I'm trying to figure out if it's deals getting pushed that's causing the lack of opportunity versus literally in your markets, it's just you're not seeing it because of capital flows et cetera?","David Neithercut","I guess, it's perhaps all of the above, Alex. And again, I'm not sure that I ever implied there is going to be some tsunami wave of these deals coming but you also many of these markets see them all going up and our expectations is over some accretive time. May not, maybe that's some of them had been delayed because construction has been delayed, some maybe want to get stabilized, maybe some have got some institutional capital it's willing to sit for several year. I mean, it's all of the above.","But we certainly will expect to see some of those brought to market as I know we bought two. So, certainly they, some of them are already are being brought to market. I'm sure we've underwritten scheds more than just the two that we've acquired and I'm sure that we will look at more yes this year and certainly into 2018. But I'm not so sure that there is any reason why there's a fewer today that I may have led you to believe when we talked about this pool of potential investment opportunities have on horizon.","We're looking at them, we bought a couple and we'll certainly look at more. But I don\u2019t think there's been any change necessarily in the flow of that product.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then, David Santee, when we look at Seattle, I mean, clearly Amazon's been the 800 gorilla as far as job worth and expansion, in all facets. But at the property level, are your teams seeing just predominantly Amazon employees or companies that are spawned because of Amazon or it's a view that there is sufficient other tech growers and other companies that are going to Seattle that even if Amazon dials back there's still sufficient demand.","I'm just trying to get a sense from you guys from what you're hearing from your local teams how much of an impact they think it's going to have?","David Santee","Well, I mean obviously the closer you are to closer to property is to it sounds like giving in the more it's going to be influenced by Amazon. But we have a wide range of people living with the works for different employers but again I mean we measure that every so often but it's not necessarily concerning at any one community. I guess that's all I could give you for now.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then just final question. I just saw the news item on the litigation or I guess class action whatever in California. Is there anything that you can provide some more color on this or perspective?","David Neithercut","Well, 2014 a lawsuit was brought against us because of our late rate late payments and process and procedures and I will just sort of tell you things like this and sort of standard operating procedure for a company like us and particularly in complex in California.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. I appreciate it, thank you. Good luck.","David Neithercut","Very welcome, Alex.","Operator","Next we'll hear from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","Thanks, good morning.","David Neithercut","Good morning.","John Kim","In Seattle, David Santee referenced Amazon HQ2 and its impact on new leases. But I was wondering with that announcement in combination with the approval of a new municipal income tax because that's impacted your underwriting for Seattle investments going forward.","David Neithercut","Well, we haven\u2019t, we're not really underwriting anything new at this point in time. But we certainly there have been numerous city council initiatives what have you that involves fees and taxes and we always update those items when we are underwriting either an acquisition or a new development.","David Santee","Yes. David's comments about HQ2 weren't specifically citing that but just mentioning that we did see a little kind of wobble if you will of some of our pricing around that time. But as you also noted in his prepared remarks, the markets recover and he's now operating the same levels that it had from most of this summer.","But certainly as we think about looking at Seattle which represents maybe only 8% or 9% of our NOI, we take all of these things into consideration, the impact of gorillas like Amazon and Microsoft and issues with fees and regulations and all those things will be part of what we'll consider is we underwrite the future cash flow streams of the assets we want to either build or acquire.","John Kim","Okay. Next question maybe Amazon related. But on the discussion of wage pressure, can you just clarify is this the direct result of new multi dynamic supply and also there was some commentary on additional staff needed to provide better service. And I was wondering if that was in relation to packets delivered?","Mark Parrell","Hey John, it's Mark. Some of this is just wage growth as we said because there are wage pressures in the field. But there also are and we mentioned this on the prior earnings call as well, some adjustments that we are making that are very hard for us to predict. To work means comp and medical insurance reserves, we are self-insured.","So, as a result of that when those items run through the numbers, they can impact on the margin a bit. So, when you look at what's going on and we talk about a 6% number for the year, a fair amount of that kind of part over 4% is probably driven by these workman's comp and medical insurance reserve adjustments that we made the last few quarters.","And that we're making estimates up in the fourth quarter that could change a fair amount. We're wrong, that number could be a fair amount lower than 6% or a bit higher, it's just very hard for us to pack.","John Kim","Thanks, Mark. And any commentary on additional staff needed?","David Neithercut","Well, I think, I mean we targeted several of our larger buildings or buildings that were across the street from one and other that we may have used one manager to run two or three buildings and we felt that in this very competitive environment we want to make sure that our residents were being serviced that we had appropriate resources to administer our renewal programs, to ensure the sales were in tip top shape.","And when we discussed that at the beginning of the year, most of that was put in place and we really have it made any further adjustments since then. We don\u2019t see we have not really added staffing solely because of packages. We are more focused on 24\/7 package rooms that we have been extremely focused on delivering to our employees this year.","So, I mean when you look at the wage growth wage pressure, with the retail slowdown however you want it to categorize what's going on with retail, office employees are not really that under pressure. It's more on the service side, the guys that know how to fix refrigerators and HVACs and what have you. So, we feel good about the changes that we made year-to-date for the most part where pretty stable right now.","John Kim","Thank you.","David Neithercut","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird.","Drew Babin","Good morning.","David Neithercut","Good morning.","Drew Babin","Have you heard anecdotally from a couple of your peers that the bay area's maybe benefit as a little more than other markets from construction delays over our competitive supply this year. I just wanted to ask A) is that accurate with what through second system with what you're seeing in the Bay area. And B) what sub markets maybe benefitting the most from projects being pushed out in the next year?","David Santee","Well again, I mean, I know there was a large buyer in the East Bay in a new development that certainly would help the East Bay. David just discussed our experience at our Brannan property in downtown. But again the fire certainly is taking something out of the mix and pushing it out another year or two.","But we have not seen anything that is categorized as delayed but has not begun to lease up. So, the units coming to market are still coming to market as we expected when we began the year.","David Neithercut","Yes. And just to reiterate what we said earlier. Just because projects are being quote-and-quote delayed from their final completion, does not mean their doors did not open for occupancy when originally expected and certainly they begin marketing those units 60, 90 days in advance. So, just because something gets quote-on-quote sort of delayed or its completion gets pushed back, it does not mean it was not in the competitive set during the third quarter.","That was possible but it's just and in our own experience it's been on two deals that on this press release we're notifying you for the first time have been delayed, their doors were open as we expected and first occupancies took place as we expected and the delays did not impact any of that. So, we'll just use that as an example of being careful about drawing too much out of the fact that things have completions have been pushed back.","Drew Babin","That's helpful, thanks for that. And I'm also to some Merchant did this year, there's been a lot of more discipline in the market obviously with the concessions and things like that with your competitive set. How much of that would you attribute to kind of earlier this year maybe interest rate expectations being reigned in a little bit.","Is anything changing or do you expect anything to change, should depend your treasury creep up over the next couple of quarters. Which will determine that?","David Neithercut","I guess I'm not sure I understand about maybe you can rephrase that for me, Drew?","Drew Babin","Sure. The questions really on the correlation between kind of the urgency of merchant builders to lease up their properties and interest for short term interest rates because your interest costs are going up now.","David Neithercut","Oh, I see. Okay, I got it. So, with respect to the urgency. I think what we saw a year ago primarily in San Francisco was people could cut rents from the marketplace and still exceed the original expectations of other rental levels, that's not the case now. I think that people that rent today are in the ballpark of what people underwrote and they have to preserve try those levels.","And so, they have to be disciplined with respect to achieving those. And I think that may very well explain what we're seeing this year relative to what we saw in San Francisco a year ago.","Drew Babin","Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you.","David Neithercut","So, it's less the financing market and more just where rents are today relative to their original pro formas.","Drew Babin","Okay, great. Thank you.","David Neithercut","You're very welcome.","Operator","Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank has the next question.","Vincent Chao","Hey everyone. I know this is probably more of a regional impact but just curious given that there has been labor shortages already from the natural disasters we saw this fall. I was just curious if there is any noticeable change in that dynamic post some of the hurricanes?","Mark Parrell","We've had labor challenges particularly on the construction side across all of our markets and those continues. I noted actually in San Francisco our Brannan property has been in the last 120 so wide units have been delayed because of this challenge is getting people on site. I have not heard anyone attribute any marginal worsening of that problem because resources have been deployed in taxes of our floor.","So, I can't tell you that's the case but we continue to just see labor shortages and our contractors whereas our tradesman are all kind of continuing to sing the blues in that regard. But haven\u2019t heard anyone suggest it that's got worse because of the hurricanes.","Vincent Chao","Okay, thanks for that. And then just maybe from guidance from the same store revenue I mean just seem like there is an implied a modest flourishment in the fourth quarter. Is that really just a reflection of the timing of some of this supply that had there really expected some was getting pushed out maybe into the fourth quarter from the third?","Mark Parrell","Again it's Mark Parrell. I mean, no just the map here means that in the fourth quarter, our quarter-over-quarter number could be anywhere from 1.9% to 2.3% and still map out to the two two number that we put out to you. And really it's very small changes in occupancy and as we said a moment ago, we're really not buyers in the thesis that there are delays that are meaningful in deliveries that are impacting our numbers.","So, there is a margin air in these numbers but we would generally expect the number in the fourth quarter that we report quarter-over-quarter to be reasonably consistent with third quarter number or quarter-over-quarter that we just reported.","Vincent Chao","Okay, thank you.","Mark Parrell","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley.","Richard Hill","Hey, I guess it's still good morning for you guys. Hey, just a quick question on the tax appeals. I want to make sure, was that related to the LA market and can we attribute that to the sharp declines and expenses that we saw this quarter?","Mark Parrell","There is two markets were impacted by the appeals in the same store set New York and LA.","Richard Hill","Understood, thank you. And are there any other markets where you have ongoing appeals right now?","Mark Parrell","We have ongoing appeals in every market. And we underwrite and try and guess and it's really a very good educated guess as to how many of those appeals wind up getting recognized as income received or reduction of our taxes. But it's an estimate and sometimes things happen a little faster or a little slower than we expect.","Richard Hill","Got it. And then on your FFO guide increase, you noted that it was a combination of tax appeals and NOIs. Do you have a breakdown or can you provide any guidance of how we should be thinking about the benefit of tax appeal versus the NOI growth?","Mark Parrell","I think you can think about the tax appeal as worth give or take $2 million and then the rest of it is a combination of revenue being better than we thought in the same store set and non-same store predominant lease up income being better than we thought.","Richard Hill","Great, thank you very much. I appreciate it. That's all.","Mark Parrell","You're very welcome, Rich.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Tayo Okusanya","Yes, first for all congrats on a great quarter. Following-up on Rich's question, how do we start to I know again you're not giving a lot of insight into 18 yet. But from an operating expense perspective, how do we kind of start thinking about kind of same store FX growth kind of on a regular run rate basis, these to kind of say an opportunity it's kind of keep driving things down or this quarter was specifically unusual and you expect a higher run rate going forward for same store FX was?","David Santee","So, this is David Santee. I think we've kind of talked previously that real-estate taxes are a big driver. It's 40% of our total operating expense and one of the key inputs to that are the increases or the step ups in our 421-a in New York which will add probably a 150 basis point to normalize real-estate tax growth up through 2020.","So, for the past several quarters or year we've talked about real-estate tax growth of 4% to 5% up through 2020. And then everything else is payroll is obviously our second biggest expense group wage pressures this year. We probably would expect a little bleed in the next year. And then utilities we are trying to or making investments into LED lighting, a lot of energy conservation.","At the same time, we kind of try to lock in future natural gas prices that add significant discounts year-over-year. So, all in all I mean I think expenses going forward, we kind of always said three handle.","Tayo Okusanya","Got you. Okay, that's helpful. And I know this is not part of your normalized FFO per share number but could you talk about the legal settlements during the quarter what that was about?","David Neithercut","Sure. That was a construction defect lawsuit and lawyers were able to resolve in a favorable way for us. So, we received the money and you can't capitalize it, it has to go through an income account. And so we do exclude it from normalized FFO even though it's a benefit.","Tayo Okusanya","Got you. Thank you, very much.","David Neithercut","You're welcome.","Operator","Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets has our next question.","Wes Golladay","Hi, good morning guys. Could you guys give us the new rent growth for October yet?","David Neithercut","No, we did not. We do not have that number.","Wes Golladay","Okay. And then looking at the Seattle market, you mentioned the supply will be down next year. In particular I see looking at hosted date of the CBD would be arriving next year. Do you agree with that and how do you view your trade area, do you lump it together as Queen Anne -- like Union or just a little bit more color on how you see supply going down?","David Santee","So almost all of the delivery in 2018 is going to be in downtown CBD. So that is compared to this year, it\u2019s a pretty meaningful reduction, relative to what was delivered this year in North Seattle. I mean the bulk of it is really CBD.","David Neithercut","And we do consider all those areas within our competitive sort of trade areas, they are going back to the conversation about sort of the boundaries, Belltown, Queen Anne, downtown Salt Lake Union Capital Hill, Belleview -- I mean they are all considered part of that trade area.","Wes Golladay","[Indiscernible] sorry go ahead. You go finish, sorry about that.","David Neithercut","No it\u2019s just \u2013 since its a trade area, I just want to make it clear that area that we consider new product being built to compete with us, so that would, all those markets would be included in that area.","Wes Golladay","No I\u2019d just say then that you guys have walked all those areas, the sights right. I believe you mentioned on the last call.","David Neithercut","Our local teams?","David Neithercut","Oh yes, my guys certainly are tracking all those things, they now examine, we\u2019ve got platforms you can go online and see every potential site who owns it, what\u2019s being contemplated to be built, when our teams expect it to start, when our teams expect it to be not just completed but available for occupancy and they track all that information absolutely.","Wes Golladay","Okay, thank you.","David Neithercut","You\u2019re very welcome.","Operator","That will conclude the question and answer session. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Neithercut for any additional closing comments.","David Neithercut","Yeah well thank you everybody. We\u2019ll see a lot of you in Dallas next month. Thanks for your time this morning.","Operator","That does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation.

We're extremely pleased to have delivered normalized FFO for the first quarter of $0.71 a share, and that's an amount that's near the high end of our previously provided guidance range, and one that represents an increase of nearly 11% over the first quarter of last year.","For the first quarter of '14, our same-store revenue, which includes nearly 18,500 Archstone units, grew 4% over the first quarter of last year, which was slightly better than our original expectations. And it is no surprise that San Francisco, Denver and Seattle continue to lead the way, with Washington, D.C., bringing up the rear by a very wide margin.","Fundamentals in the business remain favorable. David Santee will go into more specific market-level detail in just a moment. But from a portfolio-wide perspective, current occupancy is 95.9%. And through the first 4 months of the year, we've achieved average renewal increases in excess of 5%, a level we expect to achieve in the coming months as well. So we're confident that we are well positioned as we approach our primary leasing season, and I can assure you that our teams across the country are eager and very well prepared to maximize revenue during this very important time of the year.","So now I'll turn the call over to David, who will take you through what we're seeing across our specific markets today and how things are setting up for the summer leasing season.","David S. Santee","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll round out our Q1 performance results with a brief recap of our key drivers of revenue growth, provide some color on our expenses and how that plays out for the balance of the year, and then give you current pricing, renewal rates for April and May, coupled with some brief commentary across the core markets.","Now in addition to the renewal and occupancy results David gave you in his opening remarks, turnover for the quarter continued its decline with an 80 basis point reduction from Q1 of '13, translating into a 300 basis point decline on a year-to-date annualized basis.","While managing lease expirations is a never-ending but critical process, the percentage of residents electing to renew with us is at the highest level we have seen in the 7 years we have been tracking this metric. Also fueling the lower turnover is less home buying. Move-outs for home purchases decreased 30 basis points, to 11.9% of move-outs. But more telling is the absolute number of residents buying homes, declining in 9 out of 10 of our core markets, the lowest we have seen in the last 5 quarters.","Net effective new lease base rents for the quarter averaged above 3% through March, and have averaged slightly above 4.5% April-over-April. While a much stronger start to the leasing season than last year, improving rates are simply reacting to the normal season patterns that occur every year.","Also contributing to our favorable revenue growth for the quarter is the ancillary income growth in the Archstone portfolio. Plugging these assets into our platform allows us the visibility to fully realize the benefits of our centralized and subject-matter expert approach to day-to-day property management activity. Simple things like late charges, which were up 50%; pet rent, up 250%; transfer fees, up 220% all add up to being very accretive to our total income growth. As we say internally, the next big thing at Equity Residential is doing many small things extremely well, if not perfect.","As we look out over the next 90 days, our exposure is dead on to same week 1 year ago. Renewal offers have been issued above 7% through July and achieved renewal results for April and May are on the books at 5.3%, with net effective new lease rents approaching 5% year-over-year.","With all these indicators flashing green, we remain extremely optimistic, but mindful, of the magnitude of new deliveries across all of our markets, and that the full year revenue growth targets are achieved over the next 90 days.","Expenses for the quarter came in on the high end of our expectations, due to utilities and real estate taxes. As we have discussed previously, real estate taxes, payroll and utilities make up 68% of total operating costs.","So by now, it's no surprise that utility costs had a significant impact across all types of businesses as a result of the extreme temperatures. More telling are the significant price spikes that occurred in the deregulated electricity markets in the Northeast, with unprecedented increases of 300% to 400% across all of the regional pricing indexes.","Consumption of energy in the EQR portfolio was up a modest 5% to 7%, as we continually to -- as we continue to aggressively invest in LED lighting, solar and cogeneration opportunities that provide outstanding rates of return on investment.","More recently, with global forces having tremendous influence on energy costs here at home, vigilance will be necessary to keep these costs in check going forward.","Additionally, since our initial guidance in February, we have revised real estate taxes upward to 6.2% from 5.2%, both for the full year, as a result of Washington, D.C. valuations increasing more than expected and higher-than-expected taxes in King County, Seattle, Washington.","Now mitigating these costs are the operational efficiencies realized through the addition of the Archstone portfolio to full year same-store. Comparing Q1 '14 costs on the EQR platform versus Q1 2013 costs on the Archstone platform allowed us to reduce total costs in leasing and advertising, which were down 23%; turnover cost, down 19%; property management cost, down 2.3%; and most importantly, making up 20% of our total expense, on-site payroll, which was down 4%.","So excluding real estate taxes and utilities, our controllable operating expenses declined 2.1% for the quarter. While we expect these expense levels on the Archstone portfolio to continue to offset legacy portfolio growth rates, the impact will diminish over the course of the year, primarily in the next 2 quarters. Archstone Payroll, as an example, was not fully optimized until mid-Q3 of '13. For modeling purposes, we would not expect any material expense mitigation beyond Q3 and the mitigation in Q2 to be less favorable than Q1.","Now moving on to the markets. I'll provide you with our occupancy today. April and May achieved renewal rates and then net effective new lease base rents 4 weeks out. For California, I'll only quote April renewals, as these are 30-day markets and May has yet to firm.","As David said, we continue to maintain our 3 buckets of performance across the portfolio. In our top-performing bucket we have San Francisco, Denver and Seattle, with expected full year revenue growth well above 5.5%. The bottom bucket remains Washington, D.C., down 1%. And all other markets, making up the middle bucket, with expected full year revenue growth of 3.5% to 5%.","Seattle continues to be a great job producer and systematically absorbed the expected 7,500 deliveries without material disruption to the market. With occupancy at 96% and exposure on top of same week last year, renewal rates achieved for April and May are gaining momentum at 8.3% and 9%, respectively. Net effective base rents 30 days out are up 6% to 7% versus same period last year, with impressive strength in the CBD and Belltown, Queen Anne submarkets.","San Francisco continues to be our top market for yet another year, with the Peninsula and South Bay leading the way in year-over-year revenue growth, while North San Jose continues to absorb units at a reasonable pace. After a slow start to the year, occupancy is now 96.3%, and renewal rates achieved remain strong at 8.8% for April, with net effective base rents up 8% to 9%.","Denver, despite delivering almost 10,000 units this year, remains resilient with a bustling energy and tech-driven economy, and is producing some of the best job growth numbers in percentage terms in the nation. With concentrated deliveries in the urban core and our portfolio concentrated in the South and Southwest, we would expect another banner year from Denver, with occupancy today at 96.6%. Renewal rates achieved remain very solid at 8.3% and 8.5%, with net effective base rents above 7%.","So jumping down to Los Angeles. Results, thus far, while solid, unfortunately do not paint the picture of the breakout year that many had hoped. L.A. continues its slow and steady improvement in fundamentals, with occupancy at 95.4%, although employment remains stubbornly high at 8.7%. Nevertheless, renewals achieved are solid for April at 6.1%. Net effective base rents are up 5.8%, again this is versus same week last year, and are poised have a good run over the next 3 months, based on our historical seasonal pattern.","Orange County, after dealing with a constant stream of elevated concessions in Q1, primarily from the overhang of delayed deliveries, has now returned to good health. Occupancy today is 95.9% and achieved renewal rates improved to 4.9%, with net effective base rents up 6%. Our outlook for Orange County is a bit brighter than that of L.A.","San Diego, good news. The ship is still in, with occupancy strong at 96.7%. Renewal growth rates are some of the highest we've seen in years, at 5.2% for April. Net effective base rents are steady, up 6% over same week last year. With 5,000 new units sprinkled throughout the market, we would expect smooth sailing through the balance of the year.","So jumping over to Boston. The urban core deliveries have arrived, and are in full lease-up mode. Across the street and down the block, we continue to see favorable demand in our downtown submarkets and steady absorption of quality assets, with only minus price -- modest price negotiations on renewals, at 96.8% occupancy, and renewals achieved having remained solid at 4.1% and 4.3%. Net effective base rents remain strong, up 4.5%, versus same week last year.","Now New York fared better with occupancy in the quarter. However, the pause button remained in the on position relative to net effective base rent growth, which remained at or below 2% for much of the quarter. Job growth remains solid, but many are on the low end of the pay scale, with fewer in the higher-paying financial services sector. Today, the portfolio is 96% occupied, with achieved renewal rates of 4.7% for both April and May. Net effective base rents were up 4%, versus same week last year. So the next 2 months should set the table for full year revenue growth.","Jumping down to South Florida, and saving Washington for last. South Florida remains a steady performer with occupancy at 95.8%, about the same position they were last year. Achieved renewals of 5.7% and 5.8% for April and May are very strong, with net effective base rents well above 6%.","Given our diversified 3-county portfolio, we would not expect, nor are we seeing, any impact from the expected 7,200 new deliveries this year on top of the 6,000 units delivered in '13.","And last but not least is Washington, D.C. Occupancy pressures are starting to mount as our portfolio occupancy sits at 95% today, roughly 30 to 40 basis points less versus year-to-date last year. Looking at our dashboard, there still appears to be a healthy level of demand across the MSA. Net effective base rents continue to fluctuate between flat and minus 2%, as the various submarkets react to the deliveries. Achieved renewal rates are still holding at 2.6% and 3.3% for April and May. And our experience during the last downturn leads us to believe we can continue to mitigate the effective lower new lease rents with more favorable positive renewal growth.","Jobs will continue to be the governor on how this all plays out for 2016. Today, though, interestingly, aside from PG County, Maryland, the District and the Rosslyn-Ballston submarkets are performing the best, making up 41% of our portfolio. Both have the least negative year-to-date revenue decline, with current month revenue growth improving versus Alexandria and South Arlington submarkets, which are further out and declining, a potential signal that many are taking advantage of moving closer in while rental rates become more attractive.","So all in all, everything appears to be on track as we enter the peak leasing season. Seattle takes first place for the unexpected upside surprise, while New York City brings us back to even. We know there are major delivery hurdles out there, but to date, the markets are absorbing these units with little dislocation or concessions.","We have our platform tuned up. We have some of the best and brightest in our industry across many disciplines, and we're all anxious to deliver our 2014 goals.","David J. Neithercut","Terrific. Thank you, David. Just a little bit now on transaction and development before we open the call to questions.","For the first time in nearly a year, we acquired a one-off asset in the first quarter '14 in Los Angeles, where we bought a 430-unit project built in 2008 near LAX. The deal was acquired for $143 million at a cap rate of 4.9%. You'll recall that we exceeded our original disposition guidance in 2013, when we opportunistically sold a 1,400-unit asset in San Diego late in the year for $366 million and a cap rate in the mid-5s.","Now in addition to lower annual sales volumes going forward, that sale and this acquisition are examples of the type of transaction activity you should expect from us. The sale of older, surface-parked properties in our core markets, but more suburban in nature, with proceeds reinvested in higher-density, more urban assets at a much narrower cap rate spread than it's been [ph] in recent years, in this case, about 70 basis points.","The development team continues to be extremely busy with an elevated level of activity, thanks to our legacy land inventory and the Archstone land sites that we acquired in 2013. During the first quarter of this year, we completed construction in 5 projects, 1,290 units, with a total development cost of $370 million. Now we expect to achieve yields from 6% to 7% on current market rents, inclusive of management costs, on those transactions. During the first quarter, we also started 3 new projects, 1,145 units and a total project cost of $614 million, and we project yields of mid-4 to mid-5 on current market rents on those starts.","So with the starts in the first quarter, that leaves us today with 9 land sites in inventory that we expect to develop soon, representing a pipeline of just over 2,500 units in terrific urban locations in our core markets, with a development cost of approximately $1.1 billion. And of this current inventory, we expect to begin construction on several hundred million more yet this year with the balance to begin in 2015.","And with that, Camille, we'll be happy to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of David Toti with Cantor.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","I just have 2 questions. First, sort of stepping back in terms of operations. The quarter saw slightly higher occupancy and lower turn, which to me seems a little bit counterintuitive in this part of the cycle. Is that characteristic of sort your first quarter dynamics in your opinion? Or was that intentional -- intentionally somewhat defensive?","David S. Santee","I think we're managing lease expirations. We're being intentional in trying to mitigate the volatility that we see in Q4 and Q1. So I mean, like I said, one of the biggest benefits is just significantly fewer homebuyers, and then just a tendency for people to stay put.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","And do you find this, in general, kind of surprising at this point in the cycle?","David S. Santee","No, I think we -- I don't find the home buying surprising. We saw turnover drop pretty dramatically in Q4, and we had hoped that would continue through Q1, and it did.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then my other question just has to do with the acquisition, the $143 million. Can you give us maybe some detail on the underwriting that made that price attractive in terms of your expectations for occupancy perhaps or rent growth? Or is there material synergies in terms of operating savings? What's the driver of that being a good fit at a 4.9% cap?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I guess we identified this asset in a higher density kind of urban location. We think we bought at a favorable price. I'm not sure the deal was heavily marketed. And we were able to just plug it into our platform there in L.A. and run it very efficiently. As I say, we bought it at about a 4.9% cap. We think that year 2 could be in the mid-5s. And it's just a nice complement to our existing portfolio.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Do you think it'll top out in the mid-5s? Or do you see more upside in sort of a 2- or 3-year window?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I don't think rents are you going flat, if that's the question. I mean David commented about L.A. We think Southern California is beginning to show improvement, and we think it'll be a very solid, long-term deal, and it'll be very strong, high-single-digit IRR for us.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Recognizing that Archstone is now in the same-store portfolio. But could you give a breakdown of how same-store revenue growth differed between the EQR legacy portfolio and the Archstone portfolio?","David S. Santee","So I think the best way to say this is that the Archstone portfolio is performing as we expected relative to our underwriting in the various submarkets. So head to head, when we have a couple of Archstone properties in Chelsea and we have our legacy properties in Chelsea, those properties perform very similar. When you start looking at market dynamics, there are anomalies that kind of create some differences, but we know what those are. So head to head, they perform as expected and very similar.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then you quote the 5% average renewal increase. How does that compare to where the renewals were actually sent out?","David S. Santee","So historically, our spread has always been in the neighborhood of 180 to 200 basis points. And that's where it stands today. Some markets are a little tighter. But rarely do markets exceed 200 basis points.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","David, it's Michael Bilerman. I just had a quick question. In your opening comments, you talked about transfer fees being up, I don't know, something like 200%, and you talked about the retention and that people are staying in place, so it was the highest rate in 7 years. And I'm curious, when you step back from that, how much of it do you think is just the new EQR portfolio, that more people sort of like the places that you offer? How much of it's the services and the customer things that you're doing? How much of it's maybe not charging high-enough rents to the tenants? And how much it maybe was just weather-related where no one wanted to move and were willing to pay whatever it was to not schlep their stuff around?","David S. Santee","Well -- gosh, there's a lot of questions there. Let me deal with revenue first. I think if you remember a few years back, we set up this business group and we've taken a lot of, if you want to call it, authority or some of the decision making. At the property level, we simply automated a lot of that. So no longer can -- do we leave it up to property managers to charge late fees or settlement fees or -- all of these fees and additional charges are built into our platform and automatically billed. And then, if they want to waive that, then they -- there's a process and the support group that helps them with that. But when we set this up on our legacy portfolio, I think 3 or 4 years ago, we saw the same thing, 50%, 60% increases in late fees. It's just the same. It's just we're seeing the same thing that happened to the legacy portfolio when we implemented those types of activities on these ancillary income items. So what was the -- what was your next question?","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Well, I'm just trying to figure out. I mean, you have -- you said there was higher transfer fees that you got as people transferred in the equity res portfolio, and there was a much higher retention rate of people staying and renewing. And I think you said it was the highest in 7 years. And what I just wanted to try to figure out is, is that a sign of the portfolio that you have? Or is it a sign that maybe you're not pushing rents enough? Or was it just happening in the first quarter where a lot of people just didn't want to move and were willing to accept whatever rent they got? It was -- I was trying to put those 2 things together.","David S. Santee","Yes, I guess I would say, it's probably a bit of all of that. But I would tell you that when we look -- let's talk about the renewals, the percent of residents renewing. We see that across almost all of our markets. It's not just a Archstone-related thing or a new portfolio. I mean, Seattle, we added 3 Archstone properties, virtually 0 impact on our overall staff. So I think there was some of that. On the other side of lower turnover, in raw terms, let's talk -- it was about 700 move-outs for the quarter. Consequently, we had 700 less move-ins than we had last year. So it becomes a little murky because when you get up to 96% occupancy, you start having availability issues. But could the weather have played a role in that? Certainly, it could've. But I don't know how we would measure that.","David J. Neithercut","And Michael, it's David Neithercut. Just to make one clarification here. The increase in the fees really came from the Archstone portfolio, where a lot of -- in which we collected more in the first quarter under our ownership than they had collected in the first quarter under their ownership. So I just want to make sure it was clear that these -- it wasn't kind of -- increased fees across the board, but rather a significant increase in those collected as a result of plugging their assets onto our platform.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","David Santee, at the beginning of the year or on the fourth quarter call, you laid out your revenue growth guidance, and you've appended [ph] it with your assumptions for base rent growth, renewal rent growth and occupancy. And through the first 4 months of the year, it appears as though you're tracking well ahead on all 3 of those metrics. Is -- are we correct in that interpretation? And is that steering you towards the top half of your growth guidance for the year?","David S. Santee","I feel good that we would be in the top half of the guidance, just as I would expenses.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And another question relates to your March investor presentation. I think you talked about this on the fourth quarter call as well. Equity Residential has put out a view that apartment completions in your core markets will be significantly lower in 2015 than 2014. And you must have a very sophisticated way of looking at this. But we're looking at permits in all of your key markets and on a year-over-year basis, in nearly every market, permits are up still pretty significantly, and that would translate into starts a year from now -- I'm sorry, into completions a year from now. So can you talk about the process that gets you to this much lower level of completions next year versus 2014?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I guess that process is the result of the investment professionals and the management professionals we've got in each one of these core markets, that really do bird-dog this process extensively and are aware very specifically of the sites and the activity and what to expect. So that's simply what is being -- permits being pulled. But they have a very good sense as to the real activity that they expect to see happen. So that kind of creates our view of our expectation that deliveries will -- should be down. And also, as we look at, again, what's happening on the demand side and the continued expectation for household formations in these markets gives us the view that things will be back in balance as early as next year.","David S. Santee","And then also, Dave, we're talking about deliveries of apartments. And when -- the permit numbers are generally anything 5-plus units. That could include college dorms. It could include senior housing. It could include any type of dwelling that would house 5 or plus more units. But like David said, I mean, we use our BI platform. We update it every quarter. We recently made a 1,500-unit adjustment to deliveries in D.C. next year. So I don't know that there's a one-to-one correlation on permits versus deliveries in '15.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And just on that point, are you increasingly hearing from your staff on the ground that planned projects are getting shelved?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I guess I'm not sure that I'm hearing that specifically, as this process that we went through recently in preparation for this call led us to really no changes from the last time we went through that process.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's Ross Nussbaum here with Nick. I've got 2 top-down industry questions for you. The first relates to the bill that's making its way through the Senate banking committee that would, I guess, preserve the liquidity that Fannie and Freddie are providing to the multi-family housing business. And curious what your take on that is and the success of that actually moving through the pipe.","David S. Santee","Well, I guess I'll let the Vice Chair of the NMHC Finance Committee answer that question.","David J. Neithercut","I don't think that comes with any compensation, so I won't honor it. To answer the question, Ross, we think that bill is very favorable. This is the bill that's now being considered by the banking committee, the multi-family. We think it preserves many of the best aspects of the existing system and will provide a great deal of liquidity in good times and bad for the sector. In terms of probabilities, what we're sort of hearing is that it's increasingly less likely that anything will happen this next month or so. And if that's the case, then with the election, in a lot of respects, right around the corner, that means nothing will happen in this Congress, and it'll all be deferred. So our best guess is that nothing will occur. But certainly, that's subject to change. And they're working on the markup, as we understand it, right now. So certainly subject to change.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, appreciate that. Second question, on the homeownership rate. I'm sure you knew that Sam was speaking earlier this week and talked about the rate, which is at 64.8% now, potentially going down to 55%, which is a pretty bold statement. And I'm curious if you all are in full agreement with your Chairman's view on the home ownership rate and the direction of it.","David J. Neithercut","Well, I guess I'll just say that Sam is making more sort of points than making very specific declarations about levels. I -- he believes that there is no reason why the homeownership rate needs to stay back at this historical level of 64%, as a result of just sort of changing demographics and preferences and delayed marriage, et cetera, et cetera. Now whether it's 55 or not, you're absolutely right, that's a very bold statement, and I think he's trying to be provocative. But he certainly is trying to make a point about, that at least for this demographic that rents a significant percentage of our apartments, they are staying with us longer and we expect them to be in the -- rental housing occupants much later, as they do delay marriage, as they enjoy the lifestyle we provide in these high-density urban markets.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And I think Nick had a question.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, just on New York City. I'm wondering if you've, at all, explored a sale of one asset or more assets to test the condo conversion bid for your portfolio.","David J. Neithercut","Look, we like our assets in New York. We think we're very well positioned, and we're certainly keeping an eye on what's happening there. And who knows what it might provoke us to do, but we haven't done anything at this time.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, just the one other one on New York is this development right that you added. Can you just remind us, where is that parcel?","David J. Neithercut","Well, it's by the Lincoln Tunnel. And those rights were against an easement, and there was a subdivision of a neighboring parcel, which gave us some more rights. But that's a property we own near the Lincoln Tunnel.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then that -- what -- I mean, how soon might that be a start that would be possible?","David J. Neithercut","It will be some time before that's a start. That is not one of the transactions that's included in our expectations for '14 and '15.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ryan Bennett with Zelman & Associates.","Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Most of my questions have been answered, but just one point of clarification on the quarter. David Santee, I think you mentioned utility -- had brought up utilities being up significantly year-over-year. Just in terms of the impact on your revenue, given your recoveries on utilities, was there a material impact this quarter and how did that compare to the first quarter of last year?","Mark J. Parrell","It's Mark Parrell, just answering the question. But just a little bit of context on utilities for us and the RUBS income, which is the sort of contra to that -- which is the number in our revenue. 75% of the RUBS income we have is water, sewer and trash, which does have energy-related components, but it's not a direct kind of item that's hit by an energy cost change. So what we did, as David Santee mentioned, when we plugged all these new acquisition properties into our system, was also to plug it into our RUB system. So sequentially, the 0.5% revenue increase we reported was unchanged of RUBS. So if you had taken RUBS out, you still would have had 0.5%. Quarter-over-quarter, it was a 19 basis point improvement, so benefit to our numbers. And again, that's because of this, I think, permanent plugging in of these acquisition assets into our system and better utilization of it and better acceptance by residents of these charges being part of their responsibility.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jana Galan with Bank of America.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a quick question on Boston. It seems that you benefited 120 basis points from year-over-year from nonresidential-related income. Is that the ancillary income you spoke about earlier? And will you continue to see that benefit for the remainder of the year?","Mark J. Parrell","That's really -- it's Mark Parrell again. And that's really the garage, Jana. We have a garage near the Boston Garden. And depending on the sort of ups and downs of the Boston sports teams. And also, we did some substantial rehab at that garage that closed it down in part during 2013. So this benefit will exist in Q1 and Q2, and will get smaller through the year.","David J. Neithercut","We did reference by footnote in our 2013 statements, Jana, the impact of the garage being down. And we're now just being -- trying to be consistent by showing you exactly what the positive benefit was of the garage, bringing it back online.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just some quick questions here. David Santee, I think in your opening comments about New York, where you said the pause was still on, and you commented about lack of financial service growth. Just sort of curious, I mean, any of us looking around the Street can see that -- I don't think -- unless you're compliance, Wall Street's really not hiring. Do you feel that your mix in New York requires financial service or that growth in the TAMI industries are enough to -- those income levels are enough to pay the rents at your portfolio here in the city?","David S. Santee","Well, I mean, when we look at our resident makeup, we still have 51% of our New York units occupied by one person. So that goes to more unit makeup, so to speak. Also, when you -- what really doesn't get talked about much is just the level of new development. And there has been a lot, quite a bit, of new development in New York City, all at the very high end of the range. So I think with the -- just the lack of growth in the higher-paying jobs, you have significant deliveries in the luxury Class AAA apartment market. You have other neighborhoods, like Brooklyn, Williamsburg, that were, at one time in the past year, deemed more affordable. Now those rates are approaching New York-type rates. I think there's just been this movement around that's kind of just put a temporary ceiling on rents. So I hope that answers your question.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","But are you seeing -- so are your folks, when the applicants come in, the people from the ad agencies and social media and all the growth industries, are your leasing people seeing comparable income levels that support where the rents in your portfolio are right now? Or do you think that it may cause a shift in how you allocate capital in the city going forward?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I mean, if people are renting these units, they're obviously qualifying with their income.","David S. Santee","Yes, and I think it's more -- when you just look at the different neighborhoods in town, I think that's very telling, to some degree. I mean, the Upper West Side has been a little soft for us. But Williamsburg, Brooklyn, those are doing plus 8%, 9% revenue growth. So -- but even in midtown, Upper West Side, we have all different types of quality and price points available, with our Parc Cameron, Parc Coliseum assets. You have Trump. You have 101 West. All those assets have various price points that could really fit or meet the needs of any renter [ph], I think.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, great. And then the second question is, on the acquisition disposition guidance, you guys maintained it, but it definitely seems like the disposition market has heated up a lot, whereas the acquisition market is a lot tougher. So your view is -- I mean, obviously, you maintained it, so your view is that you can still keep it. But it would almost seem like we could see you guys end up being net sellers this year, just as the acquisition market is very competitive. Is that a fair view? Or are you comfortable that there are enough off-market deals or what have you that there's still some attractive acquisition opportunities?","David J. Neithercut","I guess that remains to be seen. I will tell you that we are beginning to see a reasonable increase in potential activity on the acquisition side. I will tell you that, that seems to be very aggressive in price. So there remains to be seen what activity we'll have in pursuit of some of those opportunities. But the disposition activity will be a function of the kind of reinvestment opportunities that we find. So it's hard for me to answer that question, Alex, except to tell you that we are seeing potentially more assets being offered in the marketplace that we'd be happy to own. It's just a question whether or not pricing makes sense for us relative to the dispositions that we'd incur in order to fund that.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. So bottom line is, you're not -- you wouldn't want to sell more and just take advantage of the current strong bid for assets? You want to do really matched transactions?","David J. Neithercut","That's correct. We've discussed on multiple calls. Now, really, our acquisition activity will be funded by the disposition activity. And following the $4-plus billion of product that we sold last year, we're not in any hurry, have no immediate need to sell anything. It'll just be a function of the reinvestment opportunity.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just coming back to the housing market commentary. Just -- we continue to see a slowdown in the overall housing market. And just curious in terms of your outlook, I mean, what level of deceleration sort of was anticipated in the overall housing market? And if it continues to slow, I mean, does that add incremental potential upside for you guys?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I guess I'll tell you that our expectations or our planning, our budgeting for any one given year doesn't start with a sort of big macro view on single-family housing. It's really just looking at each individual asset, each individual submarket and what we think is going on in that market. So the fact that fewer people are moving out of our apartments to buy single-family homes really doesn't surprise us much. Nearly 50% of our units are occupied by a single individual. I mean, that's just -- we just don't have in our properties sort of the most common demographic that would be buying single-family homes, that of 2 adults and a child. I mean, that represents about 9% of our units. So I guess, what's really going on in the greater housing market -- and I'll also tell you what's going on in the housing market in Atlanta, in Phoenix, in Las Vegas doesn't really concern us. So as we look at the individual markets in which we've been concentrated and we've been focused, we're not terribly surprised to see the numbers that we're seeing.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just to go back to a couple of questions. On dispositions, just to Alex's question, how much is actually being marketed right now? And is it more dependent upon the opportunities coming in? I mean, is there a portfolio that you're marketing that you're just waiting to pull the trigger on right now? Or how should we look at that -- think about that?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I guess I'm not quite sure why it matters, Mike. I mean, we do have identified the assets that we would sell. And so in order to make those ready to go we've got brokers' opinions of values. We're prepared. But in terms of actively marketing, there's not a great deal. We don't have a large number of assets that are being actively marketed out there. But we know which ones they would be, and we'd be able to get them to the market very quickly if we felt like we needed to or wanted to.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","But there's no tax situation or anything like that, that would preclude you having you do a 1031 or anything like that? You could sell more if the opportunity arises.","David J. Neithercut","No. No, the level of activity we would expect to do, we could be doing without concerns of 1031.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's more of what I was getting at. Mark, what was -- what's debt pricing right now? And is there still -- is still the bond offering dialed in for the mid part of the year?","Mark J. Parrell","Yes. So we really put that, Mike, both in February and now, the bond offering, in the third quarter, just for purposes of your modeling. And we've got something like a 4% rate on that. I think we would do better in the 10-year market by 20 basis points or so than that 4% number. And we also have hedges that have a positive mark that would also lower the rate further. But we're going to be flexible and opportunistic that may occur a little earlier, may occur a little later, it may not be an unsecured offering. So -- but right now, to answer your question about pricing, the secured market is worse, probably by at least 0.125% and probably 0.25%. So again, I think EQR could borrow at 3.80% on a 10-year basis or so in the unsecured market -- or 3.65%, pardon me, and 3.80% in the secured market. So I do think the unsecured market is probably a little more favorable to us at the moment.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. David Santee, the 3%, isn't that effective rent you quoted, is that a lease-over-lease number, like a blended number in the quarter for the quarter? And if not, what was the actual rent change on leases signed in the first quarter?","David S. Santee","Yes, the 3% is really just the net effective base rents that come out of LRO average for the whole portfolio. The actual checkbook number, like every year, tends to be pretty flat because you're renting apartments at the lowest point in the cycle. You have folks breaking leases that rented in the summer. And so when you turn that lease, you're operating at a negative gain to the previous lease amount. So that number, really, for the last 7 years, has always pretty much been 0 to very minimal growth in Q1.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So no real change then year-over-year in terms of average...","David S. Santee","Yes, no real change. I don't like to quote that number because I just don't think it's representative of the direction that the business is going. It's just a anomaly that occurs in our business cycle.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Understood. Just helpful just to gauge kind of how it's change -- how that -- how it's changing year-over-year, though.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies & Company.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just trying to get a better understanding of the intricacies of Boston. I was hoping maybe you could give us particular submarket information about renewal rates and as well as new rental rates, what those trends look like for particular submarket?","David S. Santee","I couldn't give you any specific rates at the submarket level today. But I can tell you that in the financial district, where our 600 Washington community is, you have probably 3 or 4 lease-ups in that immediate area. That's probably the most impactful. When you go over to West End, where we have our large West End, Charles River Park, Emerson over by the Garden, we're doing extremely well. 6%, 5%, 6% revenue growth. Cambridge is doing well. And I think if you take the numbers that I gave you, those are pretty representative of the entire market, other than the financial district where you have a lot of high-end luxury communities coming online pretty much all at the same time putting pressure on the immediate comps.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","All right, that's very helpful. Then the other thing, just some of the papers coming out in San Francisco about some new tenant protection ordinances in East Palo Alto. Could we just talk about that a little bit and if that has any meaningful impact on your operation?","David S. Santee","None whatsoever.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Vahid Khorsand with BWS Financial.","Vahid Khorsand - BWS Financial Inc.","Could you provide some insight into how D.C. is tracking compared to what you expected at the beginning of the year and where you think that market is headed for the rest of the year?","David J. Neithercut","Which market?","David S. Santee","Yes, which...","Vahid Khorsand - BWS Financial Inc.","The D.C. market.","David S. Santee","D.C? I guess I would say, late last year, I said that D.C., at best, would not go negative until Q2. And would it have not been for a lower occupancy in Q1, we probably would have ended the quarter flat. So other than being lower occupied, rates did exactly what they thought, and we just achieved -- arrived at minus 50 basis points about 2 months earlier than expected.","Vahid Khorsand - BWS Financial Inc.","Okay. And how do you think that's going to track for the rest of the year? Is it going to continue down the same path with lower occupancy than expected? Or will there be a swing upwards?","David S. Santee","Well, like I said in my comments, when we look at our -- when we look at the markets, there's varying degrees of levels of deliveries in some of the submarkets, the R-B, Rosslyn-Ballston corridor has seen a lot of deliveries in the last couple of years. They will continue to have deliveries. But yet, on a year-over-year revenue basis, revenue growth basis, that market is doing better than we expected. Alexandria, South Arlington, the further you get away from downtown D.C., it seems to be more problematic, but you also have equal amounts of new product coming online there as well.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.","David J. Neithercut","Well, thank you, all, very much for your time and attention today.

Welcome to the Equity Residential's Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] I would like to remind everyone that this conference call is being recorded today, February 5, 2014. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Marty McKenna. Please go ahead.","Marty McKenna","Thank you, Sarah. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's Fourth Quarter 2013 Results and Outlook for 2014. Our featured speakers today are David Neithercut, our President and CEO; David Santee, our Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Parrell, our Chief Financial Officer.","Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.","And now, I'll turn it over to David Neithercut.","David J. Neithercut","Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everyone. As shown in the results we released night, both the fourth quarter and full year 2013 ended up pretty much right on our original expectations.","Same-store revenue growth for the full year came in at 4.5%. That was comprised of very strong revenue growth in the first quarter of 5.1%, which weakened, as we expected, during the year and ended with still strong but moderating revenue growth of 4% in the fourth quarter.","Not surprisingly, San Francisco, Denver and Seattle continue to lead the way, with Washington, D.C. bringing up the rear. Also as we noted last summer, real estate tax increases would come in well above our original expectations, pushing same-store expense growth to the high end of our original guidance. And all that resulted in year-over-year growth in net operating income of 5.0%.","So we're extremely pleased with the property performance delivered by our teams across the country because 2013 was no ordinary year in Equity Residential. Our teams produced these results, while at the same time seamlessly integrating $9 billion of new assets and handling nearly $4.5 billion of dispositions, all at the same time.","So to everyone across the Equity platform, we send our thanks and congratulations for what was an absolutely incredible year. In last night's release, we also confirmed our 2014 guidance for same-store revenue growth of 3% to 4%. And note, again, that our same-store stat for the full year will include the nearly 18,500 units that we acquired in the Archstone transaction.","Not surprisingly, our revenue growth estimates for next year are impacted significantly by having 18% of our revenue coming from the Washington, D.C. market, which we expect to produce slightly negative revenue growth this year.","More importantly, however, we expect many of our markets to continue to deliver strong above-trend revenue growth in 2014. And lastly, I want to note that our 2014 guidance also calls for an increase in our normalized FFO of 8% at the midpoint of our range. This is very significant because after many years of elevated levels of transaction activity as we work to reposition our portfolio and assets located in high-density urban markets along the coast, a process that we believe was hugely NAV accretive for one that significantly diluted our normalized FFO growth each year.","Beginning 2014, the earnings dilution from this activity will significantly reduce. And like the first 15 years of our life as a public company, we expect that once again post-recurring normalized FFO and dividend growth, in excess of our same-store NOI growth, reflecting the benefits of both modest levels of leverage and the benefits of our size, scale and our operating platform.","Now I'm happy to turn the call over to David Santee, our Chief Operating Officer, who will take you through what we are seeing across our markets today and how we're thinking about revenue and expense growth in 2014.","David S. Santee","Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'd like to provide color on our revenue and expense guidance for '14, give a brief overview across our core markets and let you know where we sit today.","During Q4, turnover continued to decline and net of intra-property transfers, our full year 2013 turnover decreased 145 basis points to 50% from 51.45%. Our added focus on minimizing Q4 lease expirations continues to pay off, as our January move-outs showed a decline of 5% year-over-year.","Move-outs to buy homes generally continues to be back-page news as 2013 move-outs for this reason were 13%, an increase of only 70 basis points, or 202 more move-outs across 80,000 plus units. Similar to 2013, we start the year from a solid foundation of pricing, occupancy and exposure across most of our markets. Today, occupancy sits at 95%, with a 7% exposure, identical to same week last year, with a net effect of new-lease pricing up 3.5% versus same week last year.","Renewal flows issued for January and February combined are identical to January and February last year, albeit a different portfolio. And we would expect to achieve renewal increases in excess of 5.5% for this period. These early indicators, coupled with improved job growth and consumer confidence, lead us to believe that 2014 will be a solid year for Equity Residential. However, we are mindful of the potential impact from outside supply across most of our markets.","Our 2014 revenue guidance of 3% to 4% is muted by one constant thing: All roads to revenue growth for EQR lead to Washington, D.C. At 18% of total revenue and our assumption of 1% decline for full year 2014, D.C. will shave approximately 80 to 100 basis points off of revenue growth for the entire same-store portfolio.","With expense guidance of 2% to 3%, it's d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again. Real estate taxes representing 34% of total expense are estimated to grow at 5.25%, which has improved from earlier estimates, as a result of California limiting the tax factor to 1% for 2014, a very rare event. The 2014 tax factor is the second lowest in 40 years, and, as a result, it's also only the seventh time in 40 years.","Utilities, accounting for 15% of total expense, are expected to increase in excess of 7.5%, as a result of outside percentage increases in natural gas commodity prices, outside consumption of both gas and electric due to historically low temperatures, and an ever-increasing cost in both water and sewer, as many municipalities grapple with antiquated systems and limited revenue for modernization.","Mitigating these sizable increases are our efforts to leverage the geographic locations of our new same-store portfolio. Through reengineering our leasing and advertising costs, on-site payroll and management company structure, delivering only expected synergies as we discussed prior to and during the integration of the Archstone assets.","Our top-level assumptions that drive our revenue model and guidance for 2014 assumes average rent growth of 3.25%, achieve renewal rate of 4.75%, occupancy of 95.4% and turnover at 51.5%. Aside from D.C., we would expect the repeat of 2013 and maintain our same 3 buckets of revenue growth markets for 2014, which are San Francisco, Denver and Seattle buckets, which will produce combined revenue growth in excess of 5.5%.","The second bucket contains L.A., Orange County, San Diego, Boston, New York and Florida, which will produce revenue growth from 3.5% to 5%. And in the last bucket, of course, is Washington, D.C., delivering a 1% decline.","Now starting with Seattle, I'll give brief market highlights, some revenue expectations and expected deliveries that, combined, drive our thought process for rolled [ph] up revenue guidance. 2014 will see record deliveries in Seattle, with 8,600 units expected, amounting to a 46% increase over 2013. As a very manageable percentage of existing stock and knowing that Amazon will continue its large capital investment, following the split -- the union contract dispute successfully behind them and Microsoft has chosen to make the safe decision with its new CEO, we are optimistic that Seattle will be able to absorb this new inventory with mild disruption and remain in the top bucket of revenue growth similar to 2013.","No surprise that San Francisco continues to lead the pack, as the cost to own far outpaces the cost of renting. With much of the first wave of North San Jose product leased-up, with virtually no impact to existing assets, the next wave is upon us. We would expect that any softness in the South Bay would be mitigated by increasing rents in Oakland and the East Bay, as the shortage of affordable housing pushes existing and prospective renters to lower-cost submarkets. Net affected base rent for this week are up 10.8% over same week last year, and renewal offers for February exceeded 12.5%. While they will see record deliveries of 5,500 new apartments in 2014, the rate of deliveries for '15 will decline 40%. We see nothing on the horizon that will impact the strong fundamentals that exist in San Francisco today.","Now Los Angeles fundamentals appear to be in a continuing improvement pattern, with the anticipation of a breakout year for the L.A. economy and a new pro-business city government, the rebranding of downtown as a world-class city, coupled with meaningful additions to infrastructure and transportation, cause us to be very optimistic in L.A.'s ability to absorb the 11,000 new deliveries expected in '14. Also, given the centralized nature and small percentage of existing stock and a 30% -- 37% falloff in 2015 deliveries, we again see no major hurdles to improving fundamentals and revenue growth.","Orange County and San Diego will continue to see above-average growth. With 5,000 new units expected to deliver in '14 for Orange County, we see little direct impact to the EQR portfolio, primarily due to the coastal nature of these new developments. San Diego will also see 5,000 new deliveries this year, but is also one of the few beneficiaries of the budget sequestration. With the military's reorientation to the Pacific Rim and sizable allocations of increased spending, we see economic stability near term; however, some potential price pressure in the high end of the market in downtown submarkets.","Boston is currently delivering 5,500 units, with the majority of those units in the urban core, going head-to-head with many of our assets. We expect rents to moderate without serious disruption, given the net effect of rents these new buildings must command. Today, new deliveries were absorbed fairly quickly, especially during the fourth quarter. Given continued strong job growth and a 62% decrease in 2015 deliveries, we would expect any market disruption to be short-lived.","New York, in our assessment, is simply taking a pause, with mild, elevated deliveries in both '13 and '14 at the high end of the market and increase move-outs to buy homes, which were up over 20%. New York has seen steady demand and moderating new lease net effective rent growth, as the job machine has produced more jobs on the low side of average income. Our outlook remains positive with renewals achieved still exceeding 4% for Q1.","Washington, D.C., despite having 19,000 new deliveries in process as we speak, remain -- we remain very positive as the long-term owner. Near-term pricing pressure will net new average lease rents of negative 3% to 4% or greater, while achieved renewals that are already on the books for January, February and March exceed 2%, netting a 1% revenue decline for full year 2014.","Detailed traffic statistics on our existing communities and new lease-ups in D.C. tell us that the private sector continues to hire, many prospective renters are coming from other states. And while the government is smaller today, they continue to fill positions and move forward. Without a material catalyst in place for significant increases in job growth, we would expect D.C. revenue growth to decline even further in 2015.","And last, but not least, to South Florida. With its strong South American influence, the condo market in Miami is back and having a favorable influence on the economy. Modest levels of new deliveries will occur across the 3-county MSA with little, if any, disruption to the broader market.","So in summary, we continue to see strong fundamentals across all of our markets. 2014 will see record levels of deliveries in the urban core; however, 2015 deliveries across our core markets will decline by 40%. We see nothing on the horizon that will negatively impact the continued improvement in the macroeconomic that drive our business and would expect solid performance through 2014 and beyond.","David J. Neithercut","All right. Thank you, David. For the first time in many years, there's clearly very little to report on the transaction side for the quarter just ended. Because for the second consecutive quarter, we did not acquire any new assets. We did, however, sell a couple of assets in the fourth quarter, one in Atlanta and one in Tacoma, bringing the total sold for the entire year to just shy of $4.5 billion. And I'm very proud to say that this enormous level of disposition activity was accomplished right on our expectations with respect to price and cap rates, as we planned and budgeted for the Archstone acquisition. And is yet, another example of the incredible work by our teams across the country in successfully managing the execution risk of that extremely important transaction.","The development team continues to be extremely busy with an elevated level of activity, thanks to our legacy land inventory and the Archstone land sites that we acquired early in 2013.","During the fourth quarter of '13, we started 2 new projects totaling $382 million of total cost, bringing our starts for the entire year to nearly $900 million. The disclosure of our development business in last night's release shows about $1.7 billion of active development currently underway and nearly $500 million completed and in lease-up. I remind you that of this $2.2 billion total, 5 assets totaling $300 million, which came to us as part of the Archstone transaction, are not considered core investments and we would expect to sell these following lease-up and stabilization.","During the quarter we did sell one land site in Miami, Florida, which was acquired as part of Archstone transaction. And we sold that for $22 million and, essentially, that was the basis that had been attributed to that. And we continue to hold 2 Archstone land sites that we expect to sell in the near term.","So today, we hold 12 land sites in inventory that we expect to develop, representing a pipeline of just over 3,500 units in terrific urban core locations in our core markets, with the development cost of approximately $1.5 billion, and 60% of which is in the San Francisco Bay Area.","We currently expect to start about half of this product this year and the other half in 2015, which will require an additional $1.1 billion or so of capital since the land has already been taken down for all of these deals. This incremental capital can be totally self-sourced with free cash flow, disposition proceeds or use of our $2.5 billion credit facility, while still maintaining conservative credit metrics. So we should average about $750 million of starts in each of the next 2 years. And by 2016, I would expect that our starts will average less than that level and be in the range of $500 million to $750 million a year.","Now I'm happy to turn the call over to Mark Parrell.","Mark J. Parrell","Thank you, David. I want to take a few minutes this morning to give some detail on our guidance for 2014 and our capital and rehab plan, and I also want to discuss our projected capital [indiscernible] activities for the year.","For the year, we have provided a normalized FFO guidance range of $3.03 to $3.13 per share. The 8% growth we expect in normalized FFO is being fueled by our expectation of continued solid operations, as well as the normalization of G&A and interest expense at much lower levels, which we think approximate our expected future run rate.","As David Neithercut noted, another substantial contributing factor to our expected FFO growth in 2014 is the absence of transaction dilution from our investment activity. We are forecasting acquisitions and dispositions of just $500 million each at a narrower cap rate spread than in the past, reflective of the fact that the heavy lifting of our portfolio transformation is complete.","Moving up to G&A. We have given annual G&A guidance of $50 million to $52 million, down from $62 million in 2013. We believe that our number in the low $50 million in G&A is a good approximation of a normal annual run rate for our company. The increased level in 2013 was driven primarily by Archstone-related and other one-time items.","I also would like you to note that we have many G&A costs that are front-end loaded in the first couple of quarters, including compensation matters and certain reserves, and we expect 60% or so of our G&A spend to happen in the first 6 months of 2014. And then as a reminder, our 2014 same-store pool includes all of the Archstone stabilized assets that we own and operate, as if we own them for all of 2013.","Because some 2013 and 2014 numbers, like property taxes, are impacted by the acquisition, some of the expense comparisons early in the year may require further explanation. We will keep you advised of those items, but we do not expect them to be material.","Onto the dividend. As we previously announced, we have made a couple of adjustments to our dividend policy. With respect to timing, we now expect to make 4 equal dividend payments, starting with our April quarterly dividend. Also, we expect to continue our policy of paying a dividend equal to 65% of our normalized FFO guidance. But we will fix the total dividend amount at the midpoint of our initial guidance range, and do not expect to change our dividend during the year, even if our normalized FFO ends up being somewhat higher or somewhat lower than our initial normalized FFO guidance for the year.","So applying all this to 2014, we have given a normalized FFO guidance range of $3.03 to $3.13 per share, with a $3.08 per share midpoint. Multiplying that $3.08 number by our 65% payout ratio leads to a projected annual dividend of $2 per share to be paid in quarterly installments of $0.50 each. As a reminder, all future dividend decisions are subject to the discretion of EQR's board.","Now switching over to our capital spending. We have provided guidance on Page 24 for our capital expenditures, which we estimate will be $1,700 per same-store unit. That's a pretty significant increase over the about $1,200 per same-store unit that we spent in 2013.","We expect rehabs, which I'll go over in more detail in just a moment, to ramp up and see them constituting $450 per same-store unit, while routine in unit replacements, like flooring and appliances, should be around $325 per unit. And that's really quite consistent with prior years.","The major ramp-up in capital expenditure is in the building improvement category, and that includes things like roofs, mechanical systems and siding. That's what we expect to spend about $925 per unit in 2014, which is up about 50% from the $615 per same-store unit we spent in 2013.","There's really 2 things going on that explain the increase. First, the 2014 same-store pool includes the Archstone assets, which include many assets with much higher rents, but also with higher building improvement costs. And second, you may recall that our initial 2013 capital expenditure guidance was $300 higher than the $615 per unit that we actually spent in 2013. Some large building improvement projects that we had hoped to complete in 2013, when we gave you guidance earlier in the year, ended up falling into 2014 and are impacting our 2014 numbers.","On rehabs, we will continue to aggressively harvest value from our properties by doing those rehabs that meet our investment parameters. In 2013, we completed rehabs, and these are mostly kitchen and bath rehabs, on about 3,800 units, of which 2,560 were in same-store. The other 1,200 units rehabbed in 2013 were primarily Archstone assets. This effort will accelerate in 2014, and we expect to spend about $45 million, or about $8,500 per rehab unit, to rehab kitchens and baths and do other related work on about 5,300 units, all of which will be in same-store. This program is very scalable, and we will continue to show good investment discipline in terminating asset rehabs that failed to hit our return targets. And those targets are generally in the annual return on cost in the mid-teens.","Finally, switching over to the capital market side. We are extremely well positioned headed into 2014. Our debt maturities in 2014 are modest, about $550 million, and are mostly back-end loaded. We have $400 million in hedges that lock in an approximate 10-year treasury rate of 2.5%, so we've mitigated most of the late risks in our refinancings.","Our guidance assumes a midyear $500 million debt deal. We will also spend $600 million this year on the development activities that David Neithercut described. We will fund these development activities with net cash flow of about $250 million, and we will reborrow in 2014 some of the debt capacity created from the disposition activity we had in late 2013 that exceeded our $4 billion Archstone funding target.","We expect to have about $53 million in capitalized interest in 2014. We also expect to maintain an average balance on a revolving line of credit of about $500 million this year, and end the year with about a $600 million balance. This will still leave us with $1.9 billion of capacity on the revolver that does not mature until 2018, and will help us maintain our target of having the company's floating rate debt exposure be between 15% and 20% of total debt. We like the very short end of the curve and think some modest exposure to it is appropriate.","I'll now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Sarah? Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dave Bragg of Green Street Advisors.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Question is on your expected trajectory of revenue growth throughout 2014. Do you expect a stabilization in the year-over-year growth later in this year? Or given your comments on D.C., should we expect continued deceleration throughout the year?","David S. Santee","Well, if you look at our quarter or sequential numbers, it's really about the Northwest continuing to offset D.C. and then some help from L.A. and Orange County. So it really comes down to what happens in D.C., like I said, always relate to D.C. I am encouraged -- I mean, when we look at our rents today, our net effective rents were only down 2%. And there's been some strengthening in the last month or so, but you still have 19,000 units to come and another 10,000 next year.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC","And a follow-up to Mark's commentary on CapEx. What was the impact of revenue enhancing CapEx on NOI growth for '13? And what are your expectations for the impact in 2014?","Mark J. Parrell","Yes. Hi, Dave, this is Mark. Historically, it's been between 10 and 30 basis points beneficial to same-store growth. It was about 20 basis points beneficial to 2013. And we'd expect about the same in 2014. But the other point I just want to make to that is we really aren't doing it to juice any of the same-store numbers, we're really doing it because we think it's a good investment and we get a good IRR on it. and if we're not, we stop. And it's really as simple as that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Toti of Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","My first question is, going back to D.C., it seems that most of the market is pretty fearful of what's happening relative to revenue growth. Is this actually an opportunity in your mind or could it create opportunities going forward for acquisitions in that market, given relative weakness and probably some upward pressure on cap rates?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I'd say we haven't seen any upward pressure in cap rates just yet. I will also say that the sample size have been pretty small to draw any conclusions about what we think happened to value there. And while, I guess, I would always consider us to want to be opportunistic, and all -- at 18% of NOI already, I think it would have to be extremely compelling for us to want to add to that. But we've been active in all of our markets and we'll sort of see what the opportunities are and make the appropriate decision at the time.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And my second question just has to do with condo conversion and condo mapping in the portfolio. Given your CBD concentrations, do you think there's some opportunities there for those assets into a relatively strong housing market?","David J. Neithercut","I think that there's an awful lot of potential condo conversion potential in our portfolio. I don't see -- think you'll see us do what we have done sort of the last time through. But I think that there are -- you look at what's happening in New York City and what's happened to the increase in value of assets on a per unit, per-square-foot basis in New York, on the condo side versus the residential side or the rental side, the separation has been significant. So there certainly is, I think, some potential there. I'm not quite sure if it makes sense for us to try and sell into that. I don't think you'll see us do conversions ourselves. But you could see us explore from time to time the ability to maybe monetize something into a condo bit.","Mark J. Parrell","And we did repurpose some of our people during the downturn and had them get condo entitlements in California and Florida and other places just to have that optionality, really, for a buyer from us.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","I guess, if you think about from a yield perspective, if you can sell to a -- if you don't want to do it yourself, but sell to a converter, sell for a 3 cap or 4 cap, and then redeploying to developments, even at a 5 and 6, I think that would be an attractive churn.","David J. Neithercut","That would certainly be accretive, yes, it would. We will be open-minded about that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph of Citigroup.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Full year guidance of $3.08, at the midpoint, assumes a substantial ramp throughout the year from first quarter guidance of $0.70. What's driving that ramp? And how do you expect it to track throughout the year?","Mark J. Parrell","Nick, it's Mark Parrell. Part of that is that comment I made about G&A, where we have a lot of front-loaded G&A, so just as you go through the quarters. And this is very similar to '13. If you look, the difference between the first and second quarter in '13 was about $0.07 a share. And that's really without getting too precise about what's going to happen this year. You just also have a very large ramp-up in NOI in the portfolio between the second and the first quarter. So interest expense pretty constant, G&A tapering off and NOI going up throughout the year. As the expenses taper off from the high energy costs of the first quarter going into the second. So really, it's not all that unusual for us to follow this pattern.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then, you touched on it a little, but can you give some more detail on what's driving that G&A savings this year relative to last year?","Mark J. Parrell","Well, sure. It's a couple of different things. And the biggest is that there were compensation costs relating to Archstone that were running through our numbers in 2013 that won't exist. There also was a rebalancing of the company that occurred in terms of staffing. And so, there were employee termination costs that went through there as well. So all of that will not, we believe, repeat itself in 2014. And thus, we are going back to a more normalized G&A rate, which is really close to the number we had in 2012. So really, '13 ends up being a bit of an aberration.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico of UBS.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","On the same-store revenue guidance, when you went through the market expectations, D.C. was similar to what you talked about in third quarter. But it sounded like the West Coast and the New York, Florida guidance was a bit better. Is that right, I mean, are you feeling a little bit better about those markets today versus the last guidance?","David S. Santee","I guess, I would say we're unchanged on New York, but more positive on L.A.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So everything else is roughly the same?","David S. Santee","Yes.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then on the same-store expense guidance. Is there anything besides property taxes being a little bit easier this year that's driving the easier same-store expenses this year versus 2013?","David S. Santee","Well, I think because we're adding the Archstone portfolio in the same-store, you do have quite a big pickup in Q1. As we -- as soon as we plugged them in, we discontinued a lot of the things that they did. Over the months, we've resized the portfolio. So payroll is helping. But also, the management company costs, we did some restructuring, no different than the G&A conversation that Mark just had that -- that's really offsetting a lot of these costs.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, I was hoping to get some numbers on -- in the rehab units that last year and this year, I think a fair amount of those are -- were in D.C. or going to be in D.C., some of the Archstone assets. Could you quantify a bit how much of the -- what percentage of your D.C. portfolio is sort of undertaking rehab last year and this year?","Mark J. Parrell","I'm sorry, as a percentage of the total portfolio or...","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","The percentage of your D.C. portfolio.","Mark J. Parrell","I'm not sure we have a percentage of D.C. portfolio. As much as we can tell you, about 20% of our dollars of that sort of $45-odd million will be spent in D.C. Between D.C., L.A. and San Francisco, that's about 70%. So the amount of contribution of the rehab properties has a lot to do with what market you're doing the rehabs in. I mean to move the average up from our midpoint you have to do those rehabs in markets that have growth that's higher than the average. So -- but we are not doing them, again, primarily to just move same-store numbers, we're doing them because they're good investments. So in D.C., I can't quantify, but I can tell you there's a lot of runway, and we expect to be doing 5,000 units a year across the whole...","David S. Santee","Probably on a property count, it's about 10% to 15%. So 5 to 7 or 8 properties.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then that's what is -- or that is what is going to be done this year? What's going to be the combined 2013, '14?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I mean, we've got -- you just keep reloading, right? You have 7 or 8 you did and you're going to do another 7 or 8. And it's just going to keep kind of going through the system. I mean, this past year, we did -- it looks -- in D.C., there were 4 fairly large ones going on and several other smaller ones. And next year, I guess, another 7 or 8. And a few of these -- that will be at '13, will continue into '14 as well.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just want to continue on with the expense question. Again, you guys have been very good at managing expenses and almost, for us, it becomes -- we get sort of lulled into the sense of no matter what expense pressure you guys have, you seem to find offsetting savings so that net, it's 2% to 3% a year. As we think -- obviously, we're not -- you guys aren't providing '15 guidance. But is it reasonable to think that ongoing as a platform, with all the expense pressures that you guys have outlined, that 2% to 3% is sort of manageable over the next several years or should we think that maybe this year have some aberrational savings, at which point, years forward would be -- would see some higher expense growth?","David J. Neithercut","I'll let David go just a minute. But I think that what you're seeing is the benefits of the size and scale being brought to bear. A lot of companies out there are looking to get scale. I mean, we've got it. And while there's not much you can do about real estate taxes, which is the lion's share, it's 30-some-odd percent, there's certainly ways that David and his team can continue to use our scale. And now, with the concentrations we've got in individual markets, I certainly have an expectation, and I can't -- so David will tell you what he thinks the 3-or-so percent of that. But I certainly see no reason why we shouldn't do better than others just because -- in any given year, because of the benefits of that scale that we have.","David S. Santee","So not that I'm giving '15 guidance but I guess what I would say is go back to the big 3. Real estate taxes, payroll and utilities, make up about almost 70% of our total expense. This year, when you look at the makeup of the real estate tax, almost half of the 5.25% increase is in New York and about half of the half is the 421a. So that's known, it's planned. When you look at the utilities -- look, this is going to be a big year for utilities only because of the consumption, the rates on natural gas, electric. But then, when you look at payroll, I mean, I think we've been pretty disciplined in how we look at payroll. And we constantly try to reinvent how we run our portfolio. So I think there's no reason why next year shouldn't be any worse than this year.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then the next question is for Mark. You commented on that you still have a hedge outstanding. Obviously, I'm sure bankers parade to your office every week, if not more often than that, pitching new ideas, especially in this interest rate environment. Is your view to continue to do more hedging given the prospect for higher rates, or your experience in the past is such that calling interest rate is difficult and, therefore, it's not worth bearing the cost when the hedge goes the wrong way?","Mark J. Parrell","Yes. We don't really try to call interest rates. We try to manage risk. I mean, interest rates changing is the same as utility consumption cost changing, it's just another material expense of running the company. So what we do, Alex, is we look at how much outstanding debt we have, what the rollover rate would need to be for us to accretively refinance it and then what the curve requires us to pay for this insurance going forward. And we've been very consistent over the last 10 or 15 years of kind of hedging about half of that risk under the theory that we don't know where rates are going. We're not taking a view, we're just buying some sort of insurance against rates getting away from us. So when rates end up lower, as they did the prior 3 years or so on us, we still got a good part of the benefit. And where, like this year, rates ended up getting away from everyone a little bit, we had insurance already in place and we'll get some benefits. So for us, it's just a risk mitigator over time, and there really isn't anything about guessing that we try to do that process.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. So from, I guess, Sam's perspective, it doesn't matter that you had to pay a higher rate over the past few years because you locked in the hedging. The view is that if you look over the life of you guys hedging that net EQR's come out ahead, I guess that's the view?","Mark J. Parrell","Well, I'm not in the position to speak for Sam Zell. I would say that we're happy how everything turned out in general. And I would say that over a long period of time, I think our weighted average cost of capital was lower than, really, anyone else we compete against. And that's a very important strategic advantage to us. But again, I mean no one could guess as to the exact moment is a good day to do a debt deal. And I think it's a bit of a fool's errand to try to do that, so we don't even attempt it.","David J. Neithercut","Alex, I think the way that we've managed the interest rate risk the most is by laddering the maturities out over a 10-year time period, so that in any one given year, we don't have a great deal of debt maturing. I think Mark and his team did an unbelievable job of managing that risk away as part of the Archstone transaction. And then, as he said, as we see debt issuances coming up in the future, we begin to sort of take some of that risk off the table with the -- within 9 months or so or a year of knowing that we'll likely to have to do some kind of issuance. But I think probably one of the most important ways we do it is just by making sure that we don't have any -- an awful lot of debt maturing in any one year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky of RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","First question, just relates to Archstone, obviously, a lot of synergies recognized in 2013. As you look at 2014 across the portfolio, it sounds like redevelopment's an opportunity. But where else do you see cost savings opportunities or integration opportunities relative to your existing portfolio?","David S. Santee","So this is David Santee. I guess, what I would say is that all of the low hanging fruit was harvested pretty much the day we plugged the Archstone portfolio into our platform. So now, it's more sharpshooting and we've already kind of done a review of payroll and leveraging the fact that some of these properties are down the block, across the street, what have you. And there will be many, many opportunities, of small opportunities, but combined, they'll be material over the long run. But I think you're seeing kind of the full impact in the Q1 expense numbers.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And second question, David, as you look today where your cost of capital is, you look at the stocks trading, where do you see the best investment options today? Is it -- at this part of the cycle, does it still make sense to be doing core acquisitions or does it make more sense to be doing value-add acquisitions? And as you kind of look forward, how do you weigh in development on that?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I guess that's a constant discussion here, Mike. I mean, on one hand, we will always be trading out of some assets and into other assets. We've given you guidance of the $500 million of buys and sells. That's just the budget that the guidance is based upon. If we can find good acquisition opportunities, the appropriate spread to move capital from one asset or one market to another, that's something that we will always do. And then, I think it really comes down to, as we think about free cash flow and that amount of capital that we can raise without having the 1031, right, we've got limited amounts of capital that we can raise in any given year without having it impact our taxable income, what do we do with that money? And we look at a development. To tell you, we've been open-minded, we'd consider stock buybacks, and we'll be thinking about what to do with that every step of the way. There's -- we had a board meeting here in December, as I mentioned to everyone on our last call, and we talked about uses of that capital and what the opportunities might be and what the stock price was and what we thought NAV was. And that's all part of the calculus. So we've got $1.5 billion of potential development that we could start. None of it's committed to be started. And we'll ask ourselves that question every time there comes an opportunity to start to go vertical on any of that, if it's the right thing to do, if there's not some other alternative use for that capital.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then just finally, you put -- it's an ad disclosure there on the Lehman stock sales. Were you approached by Lehman in the fourth quarter or year-to-date about the sale of the stock or repurchase opportunities?","Mark J. Parrell","Mike, it's Mark. Like with many of our large shareholders, there's constant communication. We did not facilitate any of those transactions, Lehman did those on their own.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Pehl of Goldman Sachs.","Jeffrey Pehl - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was just curious if you can give us an update on your development pipeline, what's the current yield you're expecting on that.","David J. Neithercut","Well, of the projects that are under construction today?","Jeffrey Pehl - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes.","David J. Neithercut","We've got a high -- so of about $1.7 billion underway today. We've -- on the current yields, we underwrote those at high 5s. We think that those deals could stabilize in the mid-6s. And that's on average across that entire portfolio of business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just sticking with the development yield side of things. As you think about the 750 million of starts this year and next, is it your expectation that rental growth can keep pace with any sort of upward pressure on construction, particularly on the construction and payroll cost? And where do you think we should expect yields to come in a little bit?","David J. Neithercut","I think that right now what we're seeing for -- we think construction cost for 2014, I think, will be okay. I will tell you that 2013 probably saw across some of the markets a little bit more increase in construction costs than rental growth. But I think, as we sit here and we think about 2014, I think we'll be okay.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So yields can be maintained. All right. And then just a cleanup question. We talked a lot about the utilities and G&A impacting sort of the early part of the year. But just in relation to the minus $0.05 noted in the press release on OpEx and minus $0.02 of other, is that entirely related to the utility costs and G&A or is there anything else that's causing some downward pressure quarter-on-quarter?","Mark J. Parrell","It's Mark. You're also giving people pay raises and resetting your payroll run rate, resetting all your medical and workman's comp and other accruals. So all of that happens between the quarters, the first and the fourth, along with utilities, which is the biggest single thing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Frost of Bank of America.","Scott Frost - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to just make sure I understood the debt issuance here. The $0.5 billion you expect to issue midyear that's to refi the September maturities, and then an incremental $600 million on the revolver and that's how you get to your average debt balance you expected on the guidance. Is that -- that's correct, right?","Mark J. Parrell","That's correct. And you need to factor in the $250 million in net cash flow that we get through the year from the operating business.","Scott Frost - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And should we think of that $600 million to sort of -- from your comments, it seems that we should think about that as a permanent part of the capital structure, it's floating rate debt, that's what you want to have in your capital structure, that's correct, right?","Mark J. Parrell","Yes. I think for the indefinite future. We like the very short end of the curve, and I think a little exposure to it makes sense. And again, it's pretty modest, we have maybe 15% to 20% floating rate debt, and this will get us there. And I guess, if there's some great opportunity, we'll think on it. But right now, we think it's best to leave it there.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of David Harris of Imperial Capital.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Did you sell that German unit that you had in joint venture with Avalon that was left or was it a part of the Archstone transaction? Bloomberg was carrying the story that you might have been doing that before year-end.","David J. Neithercut","Well, that's all in process.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","All in process, so not yet done. Is there much left in joint venture from the Archstone transaction that's left aside from that German unit?","Mark J. Parrell","No, there isn't a great deal left, David. I mean, there's -- we may have $80 million, $90 million of JVs total, putting aside the Germany investment, which we do hope goes away soon.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then this is a sort of a big picture question. Obviously, you've done tremendous work in repositioning the portfolio. You've got the assets where you want them now. Any thought other than perhaps a focus on redevelopment as to strategic growth initiatives that the company might have? I mean, the position of the portfolio is where you want it to be, the balance sheet is terrific, your dividend policy is completely transparent. Where do we go next?","David J. Neithercut","Well, we've got a $30-some-odd billion portfolio that we could continue to work. And back to one of the original questions, there will always be opportunities to sell assets and reallocate that capital of what we think are better investment opportunities. So I think David and his team, David Santee and his team, will continue to work very hard to deliver the best performance they can from it. And Alan George and his team will continue to manage the portfolio and try and reallocate capital as best possible. And I think Mark Tennison and the development team will continue to find opportunities for us to redeploy our free cash flow. So we are now at a point where we're going to work very, very hard on what we've got, continue to improve it on the margin. But a lot of it is just blocking and tackling with the portfolio that we've got today.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson of BMO Capital Markets.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So just quickly, where are you on the rebranding of the Archstone assets and is there any kind of material costs embedded in 2014 for that?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I mean, just rebranding is just renaming.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Yes, I mean, taking down the word Archstone.","David S. Santee","Yes, I mean, basically, we have -- we are pulling the trigger, as we speak. I would tell you that most of the times, we're keeping the core part of the name, whether it's Archstone, Alban Towers or whatever. And there's not a significant cost in doing this. And we have -- we'll be working on it all year basically.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Enough for me. And then, just a bigger picture, Dave, for -- with Archstone now mostly in the rearview mirror, some opportunities for synergies on a go-forward basis. But you still, as Mr. Harris said, it's still a great balance sheet. Where do you put the probability in the next couple of years where EQR could, again, be a participant in some type of an M&A deal? I mean, is it like forget-about-it kind of mindset right now or maybe moderate or low probability? Where do you think you stand on that issue?","David J. Neithercut","Well I guess I'd answer on that question by asking you what you think is out there that's terribly strategic for Equity Residential and will make us a better company after the fact?","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I don't want to name names.","David J. Neithercut","Well, I mean, I guess just maybe just think about it. I mean, we did not participate in the last event that occurred. And we just didn't see it as important or strategic in any way. So I think that there will be opportunities for us probably more on the private side than on the public side. I just don't look at the landscape and think that there's anything that's terribly strategic and important for us that would make us -- certainly, things could make us larger, but that's certainly not our goal. We want to be better, and I'm not sure there's anything out there that would make us better.","Operator","Mr. McKenna, there are no further questions at this time.","Marty McKenna","All right.

These results are slightly above our expectations at the beginning of the year and are among the best numbers in our 20-year history.","We're very pleased that for the very first time ever, we've had 2 consecutive years of 5% same-store revenue growth or better. So we're very pleased with our operating performance last year and we wanted to acknowledge the contributions of the Equity team across the country and here in Chicago that delivered such strong performance for us.","And I'm pleased to say that as we sit here today, we continue to see favorable fundamentals across our markets and expect to achieve yet another year of operating performance above historical trend in 2013, and now will continue to string some of the best year-over-year results in our history.","Clearly though, with same-store revenue guidance of 4% to 5% and NOI guidance of 4.5% to 6%, we're not expecting our same-store result to be quite as strong this year as they were last year. But things are still very good across our markets. Occupancy is currently 95.1%, which is very strong for this point in the season. We put 5.1% more money in the bank this January compared to January 2012 from our current same-store set of nearly 108,000 units.","More than 4,000 January leases were -- lease renewals were completed, up 6%. Nearly 3,500 February renewals have been completed, up 5.4%. And a limited number of March renewals have already been done, up 5.1%. So thus far, the year is setting up pretty much as we expected.","To give you more perspective on our operating outlook for 2013, I'll turn the call over to David Santee, who, as most of you know, has been responsible for building and running our centralized operations platform, which has been so important to our past and will be to our future success. And with Fred Tuomi's pending retirement, David has taken on the added responsibility of overseeing our day-to-day on-site property management business, and I know that Fred agrees with me that he's leaving the business in very, very capable hands. David?","David S. Santee","Thank you, David. As noted in last night's press release, same-store guidance for 2013 is based on an expected year-end unit count of 80,120 apartments versus the 107,870 we have today. The vast majority of the 27,750 units, which by the way was the size of the company when we first went public, slated for disposition are expected to close prior to or shortly after quarter end, which gives us the confidence to provide you the impact to year-end results today.","The net change as a result of these dispositions is favorable to improve revenue growth, neutral to total expense growth and significantly lowers our forecasted resident turnover. What this all means is that we expect same-store revenue growth to improve modestly as a result of the change in our same-store pool. But our number will still be within the range, so we are leaving our 2013 same-store projected revenue growth unchanged from our earlier Q3 guidance of 4% to 5%.","Fundamental factors of supply, while increasing, appear to be manageable, while demand continues to be steady, as the economy continues to pick up steam, fueling increased job growth and household formation. As we have discussed previously, we expect short-term disruptions to pricing power in specific neighborhoods in Washington, D.C., North San Jose and Seattle. However, the combined dynamics of favorable long-term demographics and the continued aversion and economic challenges to homeownership will ensure steady demand for rental housing for the near term. Seattle proved to be a testament to this model by absorbing almost 8,000 units in 2012, while increasing occupancy 120 basis points. Move-outs to buy homes, purchased homes for our Seattle portfolio only increased by 65 for all of 2012.","For all of our core markets, this is further supported by recent improvements in job creation, especially within our younger college-educated urban cohort, were unemployment dropped from 4.1% last year to 3.7% in January. Our resident base remains very healthy, with rent as a percent of income remains steady in the 17% range and the percentage of FICO score is above 720, continuing to grow.","For 2013 revenue guidance, I'll now address the 4 key drivers in more detail. Those are resident turnover; physical occupancy; base rent pricing, meaning our net effective rates on new leases; and renewal pricing.","For 2013, we expect adjusted same-store turnover to be approximately 160 basis points lower to 56.2% from 58.2%. This reduction is a direct result of exiting higher turnover Sunbelt markets, like Atlanta and Phoenix. We would expect turnover in our core markets to remain virtually unchanged or slightly lower as move-outs due to renewal increases continue to decline, as renters reposition themselves at their appropriate price point. In other words, residents who have experienced back-to-back, double-digit renewal increases have since moved on and been replaced by higher-quality residents, who on average will receive a mid to high single-digit rent increase going forward.","Our occupancy assumption of 95.3% is not impacted by dispositions and is identical to full year 2012 actual, although we are trending ahead of target by 20 basis points for both January and February. As David mentioned, renewal pricing continues to be strong, and we would expect renewal rents achieved to exceed 5% on average throughout the year.","And finally, base rents. As we sit here today, base rents for all 107,000 same-store units are 3% higher versus same week last year, as we begin to gradually move them up from their normal seasonal lows. For the full year, we would expect base rents to average 4% to 4.5% growth with lower growth in the first and fourth quarter and higher growth during peak leasing season. This is no different than years past.","So to recap, resident turnover will decline to 56.2, as a result of higher turnover at market exits; occupancy of 95.3%, identical to 2012 actual; renewal increases in excess of 5% for the entire year; and base rents to average 4% to 4.5% for the full year.","For expenses, guidance on adjusted same-store unit count of 80,120 units is 2.5% to 3.5%, which is no change to our full 107,000 units same-store unit count. And this is in line with our discussion on our last call in Q3.","As we've discussed previously, real estate taxes, payroll and utilities make up 68% of total operating expense, and there is no change to this percentage as a result of the expected dispositions. However, the percentage of real estate taxes to total expense does move from 30% to 33%, offsetting a 30 basis point decline in growth, from 6.5% down to 6.3% to really achieve a net 0 impact for full year same-store expense growth.","Utilities will have marginal growth of 2.5% as we continue to invest in green initiatives, like LED lighting retrofits and upgrading and optimization of central systems. Payroll should again be well under control at sub-2%, while all other core operating counts are flat to down, as we continue to find innovating ways to leverage our platform, optimize costs and realize immediate benefit to our same-store portfolio as a result of adding the Archstone assets.","With that said, I'd also like to recognize everyone for the tremendous effort put forth over the past several months, and especially those who are involved in the huge disposition effort. We are all energized by the tremendous amounts of activity and even more invigorated and excited about what lies ahead.","David J. Neithercut","All right. Thank you, David. Normally, at this time, I describe our investment activity and try to give a little color as to what we've acquired and what we've sold during the quarter. Clearly, with the Archstone announcement and all that's been going on around here last 6 months, there's been very little normal activity taking place here.","Now in just a moment, Mark Parrell will go through the specifics about the capital market activities necessary for us to move towards -- forward towards the late February closing of the Archstone purchase along with our partners, AvalonBay.","But in addition to the capital market execution, there remain another critical part of our funding plan that I want to talk about, and that was, frankly, a very significant but manageable execution risk for us. And that's the disposition of approximately $4 billion of noncore assets, representing 40% of our $10 billion share of the purchase of Archstone.","But this was among the most important strategic benefits of the entire transaction for us, so not only acquire a portfolio of high-quality assets in our targeted high-barrier markets, but to do so with proceeds from the sale of assets in our remaining noncore markets and the sale of often older, more suburban or otherwise nonstrategic assets in our core markets. And thereby, complete the last piece of the transformation of our portfolio, which will soon be comprised nearly entirely the best assets in high-barrier markets, with housing cost far in excess of the national average, which we believe will provide superior long-term total returns.","So for the last years we'd worked to acquire all or some of Archstone, we had identified the assets that we would target for sale should we be successful in our pursuit. We did all the work necessary to understand the value we might realize from their sale, and we readied those assets for an immediate sales process.","Throughout the fall, as the possibility that we might be successful in our pursuit of Archstone increased, we slowed our acquisition pace and prepared for the launch of an accelerated level of dispositions. At the time of our late November announcement of our partnership with AvalonBay to acquire Archstone and as we discussed during our secondary equity offering, the funding strategy call for the sale of $4 billion of assets. And that activity is projected to take place ratably over the year, averaging about $1 billion per quarter.","Now since we will be borrowing at historically low floating rates to finance this disposition plan, the longer it took to sell the assets, the more positive arbitrage we'd enjoy in 2013. And during which time this portion of the Archstone purchase will be very earnings accretive. But the longer we took to sell the assets, the more overall market and execution risk we faced.","While we are ready to bring assets to the market upon announcement, I'm happy to say the reception to our offerings has been very strong. We now expect to close nearly $3 billion of dispositions in the first quarter, another $1 billion of dispositions in the second quarter and $500 million in the second half of the year, significantly mitigating the execution risk of our purchase of Archstone.","Now I'm a very pleased to say that all of this disposition activities has been done at our expected pricing. So this accelerated activity and risk mitigation did not come at a discount to any value whatsoever. However, as noted in the last night's press release, it's a fact that this accelerated disposition activity reduced our expectations for 2013 Normalized FFO by $0.13 per share, from what we thought at the time of announcement of the Archstone transaction. It's equally important to note that the timing of these sales will have no impact on 2014 performance.","On the development side of our business, we continue to be very pleased with the results of the new properties brought online or soon to be completed. The rate of unit absorption remains very strong, and net effective rents are in excess of our original pro forma in most every case, leading the pack with our Ten23 project in Manhattan, which is now 97% occupied. At rent, they're 13% above our original pro formas.","During the fourth quarter, we continue to look for new opportunities to add high-quality assets in great locations in our core markets through development, and we acquired 4 adjacent parcels in Los Angeles located around the Howard Hughes campus on the west side of the 405 Freeway. These sites are entitled for 970 total units. And at the present time, we plan on building 545 units on 2 of the parcels at a cost of approximately $194 million, at yields on current rents in the mid-5s and the expected stabilized yield in the high-6s. And at the present time, we'll either inventory the other 2 parcels for future development or consider selling them.","We did start 1 development project in the fourth quarter last year. That's our co-development project with Toll Brothers, 400 Park Avenue South in Manhattan. When completed, we will own and operate 269 apartment units on floors 2 through 22. And Toll Brothers will offer for sale its condominiums, 99 units on floors 23 through 40.","Our share of the development costs are approximately $252 million. Project is expected to be ready for occupancy in late 2014, and our expected yields on cost at current rents is in the high 5s with stabilized yields in the high 6s.","We currently own 14 land sites and control 2 others, representing a pipeline of about 4,800 units, with a development cost of nearly $1.8 billion in great locations in New York, Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Seattle and Southern California. And in addition to the 6 projects currently under development by Archstone, we will also take ownership of 4 land sites and gain control of 2 others that we would expect to acquire. 5 of these 6 sites are in the San Francisco Bay Area and the other in Washington, D.C., and have a total development cost of $1.1 billion.","We have the potential to begin construction this year on as many 7 of the EQR land sites. Several of which, we're ready to start last year, but we put them on ice while we dealt with the execution of the Archstone acquisition.","And with that now well in hand to our dispositions, our starts this year on EQR owned or controlled sites could total more than $500 million in New York, Seattle, San Francisco and Southern California.","Several of the Archstone land sites may also be ready to start in 2013. But like our own pipeline, we'll address all potential development starts on a case-by-case basis, with an eye on appropriate sources of funding.","So we remain very excited about our development pipeline and that which we will acquire from Archstone, and think we'll be able to add great assets to our portfolio in key locations, continuing to create value for shareholders through our development business.","So now I'll ask Mark to take you through our capital markets activities and our 2013 guidance. After which, we'll be happy to open the call to Q&A.","Mark J. Parrell","Thank you, David. I want to take a few minutes this morning to review our recent capital markets activity, and then give some color on our Normalized FFO guidance and our disposition and funding strategies impacting our Normalized FFO numbers.  I will also discuss how we expect our balance sheet, our credit metrics and liquidity to look post Archstone and give you some thoughts about accessing the debt markets. I will end with a couple of accounting housekeeping items.","So we've had an extremely busy few months getting ourselves positioned to fund the Archstone deal. So just a quick review of that activity. Immediately after the deal announced that we began, our public equity offering in which we sold 21.9 million common shares at a gross price of $54.75 per share for net proceeds of approximately $1.16 billion, which is about $53.11 net per share. We are very appreciative of the support of our investors in this extremely successful offering.","In January, we entered into a new $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement, with a group of about 25 financial institutions. This new facility matures in April 2018 and has an interest rate of LIBOR plus a spread, which at our current credit rating is 1.05%, the spread is, and has an annual facility fee of 0.15% or 15 basis points. This facility replaced the company's existing $1.75 billion facility, which was scheduled to mature in July 2014. The bank syndicate is broadly diversified and all our existing banks renewed and increased their commitment in Equity Residential, and we added several prominent financial institutions to the syndicate as well.","At the same time, we entered into a new unsecured $750 million delayed draw term loan facility with the identical bank syndicate. The maturity date of the facility is January 11, 2015, and it's subject to a 1 year extension option, exercisable by the company. The term loan has an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.2% at our current credit rating. The facility is currently undrawn and is available in 1 draw made on or before July 11, 2013, and can be used to fund the Archstone acquisition or for any other corporate purpose.","With the completion of these financing activities and along with the cash on hand that we have, the company has sufficient capital to fund its portion of the Archstone acquisition cash price, also fund transaction costs and required debt pay-downs at closing. So we were comfortably able to terminate our $2.5 billion bridge loan facility commitment.","So with the capital markets activity understood, I want to move on and speak a little bit about guidance. Year in and year out, the performance of our same-store pool of properties is the biggest driver of our Normalized FFO. But in 2013, there certainly are a couple other important pieces to the puzzle that can move our 2013 Normalized FFO numbers materially. First, as David noted, the timing of dispositions to fund the Archstone transaction and the use to which we put those disposition proceeds will have a major impact on 2013 Normalized FFO. And second, new store activity in the form of net operating income from the Archstone acquisition, will constitute more than 20% of our total operating income in 2013 and will be a major factor in Normalized FFO. But of the course, it will not show up in our same-store annual set numbers.","So now just a quick reminder on our funding strategy for the Archstone acquisition. Our plan for funding our $10 billion of the transaction has not changed. We already sourced $3 billion of equity from the public markets and from Lehman. We expect to obtain $4 billion from dispositions of noncore assets, which as David Neithercut just said, is a process that we have well in hand. We plan to use our new expanded revolver and our new term loan to fund this portion of the deal, these dispositions, until these disposition transactions close.","And the final piece is we will assume slightly more than $3 billion of Archstone fixed rate and tax exempt secured debt for a total of $10 billion.","While our funding strategy for Archstone has not changed since the announcement of the deal, our expectation of the time it will take to complete our disposition plans has. By taking advantage of the strong market bid for our noncore assets, we have greatly reduced funding risk that does cause an increased amount of dilution.","To be able to do the dilution calculation, you need to understand how we plan to use the $3 billion of disposition proceeds out of the 4 I mentioned before that we expect to receive after the Archstone closing.","We anticipate taking $1.5 billion of the $3 billion of disposition proceeds and using them to pay down our revolving line of credit. At the end of 2013, we expect that the revolver will have a balance of slightly less than $200 million. We have included in the guidance the use of $1 billion of these disposition proceeds to pay down $800 million in principal of Archstone secured debt that would otherwise mature in 2017 that we are assuming, along with the related $200 million prepayment penalty. This payoff reduces our 2017 debt maturities to a more manageable level.","Otherwise, our 2017 debt maturities, inclusive of the Archstone debt we're assuming, would have increased to a number slightly over $3 billion. But prepayment penalty and the related write-off of the unamortized mark-to-market premium are detailed for you on Page 28 of the supplement.","The remaining $500 million we used for various corporate purposes, including retiring the $400 million in unsecured debt that the company has maturing in April 2014 -- or 2013, pardon me.  We are planning on leaving the entire balance of the term loan outstanding from closing until the end of 2013.","Because of the accelerated pace of dispositions and because of the new term loan, we no longer anticipate assuming any short-term floating rate secured Archstone debt. As David said, it was very important to us that we derisk the Archstone deal as quickly as possible. The steps we took with regard to the financing of the deal were done with that goal in mind. The actions we have taken on the capital market side and the expected dispositions leave as very pleased with our balance sheet, with our debt maturity schedule and with what our liquidity will look like at the end of 2013.","Measured at year end 2013, we would expect to cover our fixed charges at about 2.5x to have a debt to undepreciated book value of assets ratio of about 40% and have a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 7.0x.","Without the Archstone transaction, we would have expected that our debt-to-EBITDA ratio in 2013 would have been in the mid-6s and our fixed charge coverage ratio would have been around 2.8x.","We expect liquidity at year end, and that will be mostly in the form of undrawn capacity in our $2.5 billion revolving line of credit, to be substantial at about $2.2 billion.","We see development spending in 2013 of about $500 million, which has been factored into the liquidity planning and all of the credit metrics that I just discussed.","Overall, we think it's wise to match the long duration of our expected ownership period of the Archstone assets, with a set of liabilities that have a similarly long duration. Over time, we will look to extend or term out the $950 million in Archstone debt, maturing in 2015 -- or 2014, and the $1 billion in Archstone debt maturing in 2017 that we are assuming.  We will be opportunistic in looking at the unsecured market and we'll also take advantage of the favorable extension terms offered us by the existing lender on some of the 2017 debt, and we'll also consider the preferred market as well.","And finally, just a couple of quick details to cover on the accounting side. Just as our normalized 2012 FFO did not include $150 million of Archstone termination fees, our normalized 2013 FFO will not include approximately $189 million of primarily Archstone-related transaction costs or any prepayment penalties that we may end up incurring.","On Page 28 of the release, we have added a new disclosure schedule that lists 2013 noncomparable items. The dollar amounts on Page 28 tie to the per share numbers at the top right corner of Page 29. We think this disclosure will help investors bridge the larger-than-usual gap this year between our Normalized FFO guidance and our funds from operation, as defined by NAREIT.","Now I'll turn the call over to Alicia for the question-and-answer period.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","I have one question for you, David. It's kind of more of a strategic one around, obviously, commentary that your sales have accelerated beyond your expectation, which is a great sign. The question then is why not be a bigger seller in this market? Why not take the portfolio and distill it even further and intensify that quality in that growth profile from your current projections?","David J. Neithercut","Well, $4 billion is not enough for today. Look, selling these -- our disposition program this year will put us in a position where we will have exited Tacoma, Jacksonville, Atlanta and Phoenix. We'll still have some exposure in some markets, such as Orlando and the Inland Empire and sort of what we call our non-Boston, New England portfolio. So we'll still have some product to sell. And as we get further in the year, we'll see what the market brings. But we acknowledge we have a little bit more to do. We think we can be -- do that over more extended time period and perhaps be more strategic with that. But I think $4 billion is an awful lot of dispositions. And, again, most of them will be done the first part of the year, we'll just see what that -- what happens in the second half of the year.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Yes. I won't argue that's not a big number. Are there other markets that you would say would be potentially flagged as kind of the second level of exit? Could you disclose something like that?","David J. Neithercut","The second level of what?","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Of exit. Are there markets that you'd say, \"Okay, if we get down to the number...","David J. Neithercut","No, I think we're getting to the point where most of the dispositions will be sort of noncore assets in our core markets, so more older, suburban sort of things that, frankly, we'll be able to rotate out of in the new assets at a much tighter spread than when you're selling noncore markets and allocating in the core markets.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then I just have a follow-up question relative to the dynamics in some of your markets where the affordability inversions are somewhat extreme, like in Atlanta and the Southern California. Can you just comment relative to those 2 markets on turn rates and move-out rates? And in some cases, you're seeing some rents strikes, and those dynamics don't really make sense to me on the surface.","David S. Santee","Dave, this is David Santee. You cracked up on me a little bit at the end. As far as Atlanta goes, Atlanta is doing very well. I think that's more about -- we've sold down that portfolio. Historically, we were an outside perimeter organization early in the 2000s, we acquired assets in Midtown Buckhead area, and that's really the last of our remaining assets there. So I think Atlanta is probably no different than any other market. You're seeing an urban attraction, people looking for great walk scores. And so those properties are doing well, and Atlanta is -- they're doing a -- billing a 6 year-to-date so far. Southern California is a very vast area. And I would say that the rent income really hasn't changed there. It's been 20. It's always been 20. We continue to have assets up in Santa Clarita. We have a lot of new store assets that are more urban, near more urban centers, L.A., West L.A., what have you. So again, I think one of the more important things to remember is that L.A., Orange County, San Diego, those rents are still not at peak levels that we saw in 2008. So I think we still have a lot of runway left in Southern California.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just some quick questions here. First, big picture and then just some guidance stuff. Archstone obviously spent a lot of money establishing a brand. You guys have gone the opposite route and not gone the branded strategy. Now that you're going to have all these Archstone communities and have Archstone plastered everywhere, are you going to keep that brand for a while and see maybe if it is worth keeping? Or your view is, \"You know what, let's just bring it -- let's just rename all these properties to a generic?\"","David J. Neithercut","Well, I'll answer that question in 2 parts. I'll let David talk about our perspective about branding. But I'll just start out by telling you that our arrangement with AvalonBay is the name will be off all of the Archstone buildings by the end of 2014. So the Archstone brand itself will not continue. And I'll let David talk a little bit about the way we thought about branding.","David S. Santee","Yes. So I've been to most of the Archstone communities. I would tell you that -- I mean, in their structure, I think they had probably 14 different marketing regions, so to speak. And each property is branded to varying degrees. I would say the more high-end communities are more hotel-like. I mean, there's not a lot of Archstone logos everywhere. But then again, some buildings have pretty significant Archstone logos and what have you that we're currently having our marketing folks go property-by-property, assess what we need to do, and then we will make decisions over the course of next year and then most likely execute into 2013 or 2014.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then second, just a few quick guidance things. Does the guidance for the year, does that reflect the accounting treatment for the Archstone acquisition?","Mark J. Parrell","As best -- it's Mark Parrell. As best as we can determine it. And I make that answer for this reason. Because the accounting rules require us to book the acquisition at fair value. And because fair value includes our stock price, the $2 billion or so of stock that we gave to Lehman will be repriced on the closing day and issued to them on that day. And so that will have a big impact on how all the assets and all the rest of the things look. And on certain fair value adjustments we make to like things like retail leases, I'll tell you at the margin, it doesn't matter much and we gave it our best guess. But there could be a little bit of noise there as well.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. But as far as the debt coming over and what have you, I mean, all that, basically, the numbers are pretty good. There may be some tweaks, it sounds like. And then just finally on that front, what is the impact to Archstone on a same-store perspective, if you have your guidance, the 4.5% to 6%, Archstone, you expect to do better than that, worse than that, on par?","David S. Santee","This is David Santee. I mean, basically, when we're head-to-head, block-to-block, say, Manhattan, say, D.C., I mean, we would expect those properties to perform very similar, identical to our own properties. Again, we've had a long-term relationship with Archstone. We know what their previous performance has been. It hasn't been too dissimilar from our own. So on the revenue side, we would expect to see similar performance compared to similar geographically located assets.","Mark J. Parrell","And on the expense side, Alex, and some other things, it's just not comparable because the companies have different capitalization policies and things like that. And they're just really -- and plus when the acquisition occurs, real estate taxes will be repriced and things will occur. So a same-store kind of expense comparison won't really make any sense.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dave Bragg with Zelman & Associates.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC","On G&A, is $14 million a quarter an appropriate run rate going forward? Or is this outlook for 2013 inflated temporarily as you work through this integration of Archstone?","Mark J. Parrell","Yes. No, that's not -- it's Mark Parrell. That's not a correct sort of -- I mean, the guidance number that we put out there of $55 million to $58 million, it is going to be front-end loaded because of some accounting conventions that we use, mostly related to compensation-related grants. So you can spread it evenly. But I'll tell you that the number will start up higher and will end up, so call it in the first quarter maybe $16 million. And by the end of the fourth quarter it will end up something like $10 million. So it will go down quarter-by-quarter over time, and we think end up right in the middle of that range.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay, great. That makes sense. And then on a related note, Mark. The property management cost as a percent of revenue, I think over time, you've been successfully pushing this down to now below 4%. Once you have the dispositions executed on and Archstone integrated, where does that ultimately settle out?","Mark J. Parrell","Yes. I think that goes -- and this is, again, there is some variability here. So that probably goes from about 3.75% to 3%. And some of that has to do with just revenues going up so much. But property management costs in total are very well in check, as David Santee has said. They will go up in total this year. So property management costs in their totality, not the same store but in totality, will go up somewhat this year. But as a percentage of revenue because revenue is growing so well, it will go down in approximate sort of call it 3.5%.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay. And the last question is on development. Last quarter on that call, you suggested near-term start potential of about $450 million, and then an additional potential $700 million of starts in 2013. Now you're talking about $500 million of potential starts in 2013. So is this pullback on development solely due to the focus on Archstone? Or are you finding development to be less compelling right now?","David J. Neithercut","No. I would -- certainly it'd be the former, Dave. We slowed down, as I said in my prepared remarks, we had development deals on our inventory that could have started in 2012, which we've postponed, unwilling to make the capital commitment, that capital obligation, with all of the execution risk we were looking at as part of the Archstone transaction. And so we just sort of postponed that, but we continue to think that development makes a lot of sense for us. As I said in the past, I don't think you'll see us ramp development up as a percentage of our balance sheet as some of our peers. But I think you can count on us as a $500 million to $700 million or so annual starts on an average basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citibank.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You talked about the great demand, I think that's how you put it in your press release last night, for the assets and how this has allowed you to sell assets a little bit earlier than you thought. Just looking beyond the Goldman-Greystar deal, can you talk a little bit about the buyer pool you're seeing for your assets and how this might compare to what you were seeing last year?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I guess on a one-off basis or small portfolio basis, I don't think it's changed at all. It's a lot of local and regional people, many of whom have got access to institutional money to do smaller transactions. The one thing that did change as a result of selling so much property was we had a lot of big buyers come to us, people that might not be interested in a $50 million one-off deal but be interested in deals of size. So that did open up the buyer pool somewhat for us, and that did lead us to doing the Greystar transaction. But most of the deals are being done on a onesie-twosie kind of basis to the same kind of local and regional fellows that might have been buying these assets back in 2012.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got you. And I guess these bigger buyers that you refer to, I mean, these are institutional buyers that are always active? Are they sort of, I guess, new buyers who are looking to put new money to work? Is there a way to sort of qualify those types of buyers?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I guess these are kind of more financial buyers that are looking for almost any kind of real estate in size, or they need to play in size, which has made it difficult for them to play in the multi-space. And obviously, we're not selling as much as we did. They came knocking on our door. We were reluctant, frankly, to do a big deal because we did not want to get ourselves in a position where we had a lot of eggs in one basket. But we had enough going away from Greystar that we were comfortable to do this transaction with them, and they were willing to do it in a structure that gave us confidence that they would be there at closing, and they have $150 million up at risk. So but again, there's -- these are financial buyers who needed transactions of size, and this was an opportunity for them to get into multi because many of them are short multi today.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right, understood. And then just in terms of the pricing, you said that the pricing was in line with your original expectations. It sounds like from commentary from you and your peers, cap rates really haven't moved up all that much, which I guess is a little surprising because growth has slowed. So I'm wondering kind of why you think that's been the case that your cap rates have stayed somewhat stable even as growth has decelerated a little bit. Obviously, it's still very, very strong, but it has slowed, as you mentioned in your remarks.","David J. Neithercut","Well, look, these are still huge spreads to underlying treasuries. And on a spread to financing cost, it's the best arbitrage even at these rates that people have seen in their careers. So you can finance it in the mid to low 3s today. So even at this rates, these continue to be very good leverage returns. And frankly, there's a shortage of product, and I think there's a competitive bid for product.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got you. And but the financing on the private side, I mean, have you seen that change at all? I mean, as you've gotten more aggressive in terms of leverage, or it's just been -- is it just literally just the dearth of supply out there of quality assets that's making people chase a little bit?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I'm not sure I could comment. It's Parrell and all the buyer motivations. But on the debt side, I mean, Fannie just announced a record year at $33 billion or so of -- and I understand that Freddie has done something pretty close to that number. So I think the unsecured market is just -- the GSE market is just very good. And when you can borrow for 10 years in the low to mid-3s, maybe not have many amortization for a couple of years, the cash-on-cash return when you're buying product from us is 6. It just makes a ton of sense, and I think it's compelling in a world starved of yield. So I would say, to me, none of this is really all that surprising. Fannie's rates haven't changed, their advanced rates. They've just tightened a few things but not materially. And so Fannie and Freddie continue to be very good sources of capital for our buyers, and almost all our buyers are utilizing GSE debt at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Mark, in your same-store expense growth of 2.5% to 3.5%, can you talk about what the underlying sort of major bucket there are? I mean, it seems kind of low given less than 25% or so of your assets are in California and sort of limited from a property tax standpoint by Prop 13. Just what you guys are doing to control expenses around the other buckets?","Mark J. Parrell","Sure. Well, I think David Santee is going to give some specific color. But I can talk about a couple of the line items. I mean, he's talked a lot about real estate taxes and that is certainly the negative. That's the item that's going up the most. In general, schematically, everything else is kind of well under control. And then you've got insurance, which is a small line item for us, about 3% of our expenses. That's going to go up again. And our budget this year is 12% to 13% increase in that line item, driven by probably a 15% or so increase in our property insurance premiums, which renew every year in March. So I'll let David Santee give you some commentary. But we don't -- again, we didn't see a difference in expense results between, I'll call it, current same store of a hundred and some thousand units and new same store of 80,000 units, the year-end same store of 80,000. So David, do you want to?","David S. Santee","Yes. Well, as far as real estate taxes go, on the original same-store set of 100,000 units, we were anticipating 6.5% growth, and really almost half of that comes from California as well as our 421a abatement or burn-offs in New York City. Everything else is very small percentages, so that's kind of the key driver on real estate taxes. And then when you look at the 3 groups, when you take real estate taxes, payroll and utilities, which is 70% -- or 68%, that group is growing at 4.2%. And then everything else -- so as an example, selling all of our garden communities in Phoenix and Jacksonville and Atlanta, I mean, there's pickup in grounds expense. But it's just, they're small numbers, so I think we're very comfortable with our expense range. And really, just like 2012, real estate taxes is the key driver.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","How much is real estate taxes as a percent of the operating expenses? If the charge is 3%, what is taxes?","David S. Santee","In the current same-store set, the full 107,000, it's 30%. In the year-end same-store of 80,000 units, it moves up to 33%.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. All right. Great. And then, David, what's been the conversations that you guys have had with Lehman about the holding period for their shares? And has the board discussed putting in place stock repurchase plan or some other mechanism to make sure that if they decide to exit in a sort of relatively quick fashion, there's not a material disruption to your stock price?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I guess, I'll start by saying first things first, Rob. We've got an awful lot of work to do to get to the closing table and actually acquire Archstone and issue that stock. I would tell you that the registration rights agreements were among the most heavily negotiated parts of the entire transaction. And I can tell you that shortly after closing, we will take the time to sit with them and make sure that we have an open dialogue with them about doing what we can do to help them meet their goals and have it not be disruptive process. The only thing I just ask you to sort of bear in mind is that they are not in any hurry. They've got quite a long -- quite a bit of runway in which to complete the liquidation of the Lehman estate. If -- and I feel if Archstone truly was an option for them, they would have been looking at an awful long time to monetize their interest. So these are very smart people. I think they're very patient people. They're charged to maximize the returns to the creditors, and I don't think they will have done all they've done here to do anything hasty. I think it will be a very thoughtful process, one that I know that we'll be engaged in with them and try to help them do that in the least disruptive manner as possible.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","David, just a follow-up on that point with respect to the registration rights. Is there any ability to sell the shares in the open market versus a block trade or an overnight offering?","David J. Neithercut","There is an ability to both dribble the shares out in what amount to a reverse ATM transaction. There is also the ability to do block trades that Lehman can do. They can use executives to go on road shows. They have a fair amount of flexibility. And understand, I mean, that flexibility inerts to our benefit. I mean, we'd like them to get out of the stock in an orderly fashion. And as David said, we intend to facilitate that exit to the best of our ability.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. On the FFO front, can you clarify specifically what is in the guidance with respect to the mark to market on the Archstone debt? Is this -- we're coming up with a number, is it $0.11 a share, give or take?","Mark J. Parrell","So let me just direct you to Page 27. So this is the Archstone interest expense and just total interest expense. So we give you detail both, again, on Page 27, of interest expense inclusive, of course, in both cases of Archstone, but also as the capitalized -- or excuse me, the mark to market in it. So you can see 2 different numbers. At the top, it's kind of got a $477 million to $498 million range. And then in the footnote, $518 million to $541 million range. So the effect of the mark is, give or take, $41 million, $42 million. You asked about what the interest expense is for Archstone. It's about $0.11, call it, $0.12-ish for the mark -- I'm sorry, the mark is about $0.11 or $0.12-ish. And the total amount of Archstone interest expense for the year -- let me see if I can find it for you here, balance effect. Yes, that's about $0.19 a share is our calculation. Remember, we have in our guidance the probability of repaying some of that Archstone secured debt in the second quarter. If you remember that comment I made about repaying $800 million. So that -- that's a second quarter event, give or take, for us. So I have $0.19 of Archstone interest, using the mark to market in our guidance rate now.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Finally, David, on Avalon's call, they used the term transition, transitional year in some of their markets to describe 2013 with better time, potentially heading '14, '15. At the risk of asking you to comment on what a competitor said, I'm just curious what you thought of that kind of comment because your numbers wouldn't suggest, necessarily, that this is any kind of a transition year.","David J. Neithercut","Well, I've not -- in preparation for our own, I've not spent a lot of time reviewing or reading anything what our peers or competitors have said. I guess I'd suggest to you that, depending on who you speak to, there's an expectation of better job growth and better household formation down the road. And based upon what we see as new supply in 2013, 2014, 2015, I think the fundamental, if those household formation expectations and if those job growth expectations hold true, you'd see better supply-demand fundamentals in future years. Now who knows what those numbers will be. I can tell you that estimates for 2011 will roll back and for 2012 will roll back. So one never knows. But based upon what we see as supply in '14 and '15 and what other people say about job growth and household formations, you do see, if you use those numbers, a better supply and demand picture.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Rosivach with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Rand - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Matt Rand on the line with Andrew. Two questions for you. First, AvalonBay gave a sense that there was $0.15 of dilution in their 2013 guidance as a result of the common stock offering held before the Archstone deal close. Can you say what the comparable number would be for you guys?","Mark J. Parrell","Yes. I would say that number would be give or take $0.05. The fact that we have -- we're carrying around $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion of cash and the related shares for January and February, not really using the money till the end of the year, not giving the Archstone NOI till the end of February, has that general impact on us. But remember, our offering was smaller than theirs by half.","Matthew Rand - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. Got you. Okay. And then the second piece is you gave the guidance of how much doing all of these asset sales is going to dilute calendar '13. What's the run rate once it's all in place? So what would be, say, your fourth quarter level of dilution from these sales?","Mark J. Parrell","By the time you get to the fourth quarter, you've got, pretty well, all the dilution you can have, right? Because there's only -- in our current guidance, all but say $200 million to $250 million of the sales that we're projecting will have occurred. So when you get to the fourth quarter, there isn't between the third and the fourth quarter, if that's your question, much in the way of incremental dilution. In fact, looking at the numbers specifically, it really -- there isn't much between those 2 quarters because, again, you've not sold a great deal of incremental product between those quarters.","Matthew Rand - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. Got you. So I guess, said a little bit differently, what would be kind of a run rate almost like a '14 dilution number relative to the calendar '13 that's in your guidance?","Mark J. Parrell","'14 dilution number. So the question is the remaining dilution in '14 that is not recognized in '13?","Matthew Rand - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Exactly, yes.","David J. Neithercut","Okay. I'm not sure I have an exact number, but we'd say maybe, give or take, on the order of $70 million.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Truxillo with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Thomas C. Truxillo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You mentioned leaving the $750 million delayed draw term loan out until the end of 2013. But that seems like a pretty cheap cost of capital even in today's environment. Why not just plan to leave that out until '15 or '16 with a 1 year extension? And then secondly, you mentioned the $950 million of Archstone maturities in '14 or '15, I missed which one it was, and $1 billion in '17. And that you'd look to refinance that. Can you talk about prepayment penalties associated with that, and maybe what those rates are to see if it would make sense to do so?","Mark J. Parrell","Sure. You are breaking up just a bit. But the first question on the term loan, I did not mean to imply that we will definitely pay it off at the end of 2013. In fact, that isn't the plan currently. It is cheap money. We don't have that much floating rate debt on the balance sheet in general. And so as opposed to doing some long-dated swap, it seemed to us that using this delayed draw term loan and having a little bit on the revolver that's this big was a thoughtful way to balance our fix-to-float mix. On the Archstone '14, as I recall, that interest rate and I don't have that rate in front of me, being give or take 6%. When we affect it by the mark to market on that debt premium, it will be more in the 3s. So there is that accounting difference. The 2014 Archstone debt, becomes due in November 2014, prepayable at par in May of '14. Probably not a lot of reason to run out in deal with that by prepaying it. The prepayment penalty is very substantial. Again, I can't give you an exact number offhand, but I'm guessing you can do that calculation pretty readily. 2017, that debt is the same structure, prepayable at par in May of '17, maturing finally in November of '17. That debt is, I think, a little over 6%, maybe 6.5% as a coupon rate. We have the right to extend some of that debt with the lender, and that is one thing we're considering doing. We could term it out in the unsecured market. I think the unsecured market, and you'd know it at least as well as I, is very open to companies like EQR, in the low 3% range for 10-year money. We would think about doing preferreds as well and we would consider taking advantage of this extension option with the secured lenders. So all of those are kind of on the table to deal with the '17s. I'm not particularly worried about the '14s. We'll just deal with those as they come. But it'd probably be a good idea to add some duration to those '17s, but we're in no rush to do so.","Thomas C. Truxillo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And you talked about leaving some floating rate out there. How do you feel about your secured debt mix right now, given what you're assuming from Archstone? Does that have any -- is that an impact on what you decide to do with this 1.9?","Mark J. Parrell","Yes, great question. Absolutely. I mean, the implication is that the unencumbered pool is smaller because of Archstone. That's absolutely true. That's mostly true because every Archstone asset we're acquiring has secured debt on it. And all the assets we're selling have no secured debt on it. So there is a little bit of a pinch point in 2013. That said, I still expect total unencumbered NOI to be 55%  of -- 55% of our total NOI will be unencumbered in 2013 at the end, and that number will just improve. All things being equal, we probably would like to do a little more unsecured debt and have that number go up. But we're going to just -- we have enough debt to deal with here where I think we could access the unsecured market. We could term some out in the secured market, and it still would leave us with some great numbers. Our debt yield on the unsecured side is 17%. So unencumbered NOI divided by kind of a cap rate, right, divided by the whole unsecured debt, that's got to be one of the best numbers out there. I mean, this unencumbered NOI is approaching $900 million in its totality. It's a very, very strong company on the credit side.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So you've been a very active capital recycler and once Archstone and your disposition is closed, you'll kind of have the target portfolio that you've been working toward. And I was curious if this will change your focus to do more redevelopments. And if maybe you could talk about what the potential is for enhancement CapEx in your portfolio and in the Archstone portfolio?","Mark J. Parrell","Well, just to give you some additional disclosure on CapEx. So first of all, just to comment on the Archstone CapEx, our view and we're not, of course, yet in the properties as the owner, is that these properties were pretty well maintained. We're not seeing a great deal of deferred capital in the Archstone system. We are saying potentially, and we're still diligence-ing this, some opportunities on the rehab side. And there'll be more detail about that later in the year, and I'm not in a position to kind of give you much there. But certainly, there was probably less capital to spend on rehab than maybe there is at EQR, and we're going to take a hard look at that. We've revised our CapEx guidance on Page 24. You can see that. We now expect to spend about $1,500 per same-store unit. These are EQR 80,000 units versus $1,200, which is about what we spent or $1,225 in 2012. So our remaining 80,000 units have a lot more rent per month. So our average rents per month are going to go from $1,700 now with 100,000 units to about $1,900 with 80,000 units. You're going to see an increase in CapEx consistent with additional building improvement-type costs that you have in high rises, which is a lot of what we'll own when you get down to that 80,000 units. So your question on Archstone, just to sum it up, is we feel very good about where we stand on the capital side with Archstone. We see some opportunity there. But again, we need to get into the properties and really run them for a little while to be more definitive on that.","David J. Neithercut","And just in terms, Jana, of capital recycling, we will always be a capital recycler. We will always be trying to sell slower-growth properties and reinvest that capital in higher-growth assets. We may not be doing it at the same run rate that you've seen us go run at over the last 6 to 8 years as we've changed the complexity of our portfolio. But you also won't see that be done at the cap rate spread that we experienced over those half a dozen or 8 years or so. We'll be selling assets in core markets to buy assets in core markets, which means the dilutive impact of that -- the initial dilutive impact of that capital recycling will be significantly less than what it's been over the past few years. So yes, we'll always going to be looking at our assets, reviewing our portfolio, ridding ourselves of slower-growth assets and try to reallocate that capital in the deals that we think will provide us a better long-term return.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew McCulloch with Green Street Advisors.","Andrew McCulloch - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked, but just one follow-up for Mark. As you guys continue to sell assets and refortify your balance sheet, do you see a A credit rating as a possibility come '14?","Mark J. Parrell","I guess, again, it's sort of a first things first. Right now, to do that, I think we would need to complete the disposition program as we plan. We need to be very -- kind of get the whole integration done and over. I guess, what I would say mostly is what's the advantage of that? I'm not sure that we would get much of a savings in terms of debt costs to make a promise to our fixed income investors and the rating agencies and tie up our equity investors with a much lower leverage ratio than we have already. so I guess I just don't know that I think the risk reward there is all that beneficial. But I think, over time, naturally, this portfolio gravitates to that sort of rating. It's just whether as a management team, that's the right thing to do as a trade-off because it does come with obligations that relates to leverage that I'm just not sure we want to undertake.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","David Neithercut, if you have known -- you've seen deceleration in your same-store performance this year. If you knew that, say, '15 would be flat or negative in terms of same-store growth, would you still have pulled the trigger on this with a long-term mindset? Or would that have held you up?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I guess I'll answer your question just by saying, Rich, that we think that over the long term, trading out of the assets that we're trading out of to buy the Archstone portfolio is a terrific long-term opportunity. And I guess, regardless of what we thought 2015 might bring or might not bring, just looking at the -- what we thought we could sell our current portfolio at, what we could buy the Archstone portfolio at, we thought that was a great trade. And again, maybe there'll be bumps in the road in sort of later years, but we think that we'll look back on this in 2020 and think it was absolutely perfect, spot-on, strategically important thing for us to do.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, fair enough. You mentioned always kind of constantly looking at the portfolio and -- portfolio management type of activity on an ongoing basis. Do you think that there'll be a larger percentage of kind of dispositions out of the Archstone portfolio than the EQR portfolio? Or do you think it will be kind of equivalent?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I think at least for the foreseeable future, you'll see more EQR assets. The Archstone...","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I mean, after -- I should say after the $3 billion -- $4 billion or so that you're doing now, but once you're kind of in a steady state.","David J. Neithercut","Well, as I say, we're still going to have exposure in Inland Empire. We'll have some exposure in Orlando. We'll still have some exposure in, again what we call, our non-Boston, New England portfolio, which for those of you who've been around a while, means growth. And so I think you'll probably see more sales of EQR assets in the foreseeable future than of Archstone assets.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Interesting. Why do you think -- maybe a question for Mark or someone else, why do you think your acquisition costs were $26 million and AvalonBay's were $123 million? Obviously, there's -- they're too different -- they must be 2 different numbers, but maybe you can help me with that.","Mark J. Parrell","Well, they are just estimates. We give a little bit of a break out. I thought, when I looked, that I thought they were broadly consistent. I mean, clearly, we're doing the same things here. Most of these costs are terminations and severance costs. There's also some transfer taxes that there's been developments on the positive side, and that's a very large number in between our 2 earnings calls. And that also, I think, probably influences that estimate. So I would say that's the answer.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And as long as I got you, Mark, you mentioned 7x debt to EBITDA as a year-end target. What will that number be right when you close Archstone? I'm trying to get a sense of how significant of a change that will be.","Mark J. Parrell","I'm going to have to do this a little off of memory because I don't have that here. But I think it will be probably in the order of 7.3x to 7.4x.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Okay. And I guess on the issue of Normalized FFO definition, you're including the mark to market in that number?","Mark J. Parrell","We are. So our guidance does benefit from that mark, correct.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Interesting. And then I guess last question to David, not to forget about you. Very early on in the conference call, you said your higher-quality residents coming in replacing those that are leaving that got set up with the big rent increases that they've been enduring. Why do you think they're higher-quality residents?","David S. Santee","Well, they can afford the higher rent.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Why is that? Are they more wealthy than the people leaving?","David S. Santee","One would assume. I mean, it's really -- probably the -- if you want to take it to the extremes, go to San Francisco and Boston. I mean, that -- those are the 2 highest turnover markets. Boston saw 900 basis point increase in turnover last year. Reason for move-out due to rents being too expensive for most of last -- well, for all of last year and still through this year is increased to expenses. So 30% of move-outs in San Francisco were too expensive. So one can only assume that if someone moves out, that can't afford to pay $2,000 and someone moves in and can pay $2,000, that's probably a more healthy resident.","David J. Neithercut","Yes. And as David said, we've seen our FICO scores continue to improve.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just 2 quick questions. Could you talk a little bit about Archstone integration and what ultimately the plan would be to make sure you kind of get the best of both worlds in regards to what you like at Archstone and what you want to kind of continue to keep at EQR?","David S. Santee","So this is David Santee. I will tell you that this has been a very exciting exercise. And again, we've had a long-term relationship with Archstone, going back to our partnership with LRO. So I wouldn't say that there's anything surprising. I think we've known our philosophical differences from an operating perspective. I think that, a, they have some great ideas. I think that we see things that we're well ahead of them on from a technology perspective. I think we will -- as I talked to the board early in December, I mean, we're -- our portfolio is improving. Our portfolio is different than it was 5 years ago, 10 years ago, and certainly very different than 20 years ago. And our thinking has to continue to evolve. And I think that's what we're doing, is we're evolving as our portfolio evolves. There are definitely synergies. There are definitely immediate benefits that we'll accrue to our same-store portfolio more from just how we expense items. But more importantly, as an example, giving us high concentration in D.C. just gives us more bargaining power on a lot of goods and services.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then, again, post Archstone with the increased exposure in D.C. and some of the supply issues going on in the D.C. market, can you kind of talk about how you're thinking about that? And if there's any possibility of you guys reducing your to exposure to D.C. as part of your future asset sales?","David J. Neithercut","Well, I will say that we've current -- of the properties that we have either sold or have under contract since the announcement of Archstone, about 3,000 units are coming out of Washington, D.C. But just in terms, in general, how we're seeing the D.C. market with new supply and all, why don't you comment on that, Dave?","David S. Santee","Yes. So relative to Archstone, I think that's a very favorable picture from the D.C., Downtown D.C. perspective. We've plotted all of our communities, all the Archstone communities, all the new construction on one of our math applications. And the great thing about D.C. is all of the Archstone assets are pretty much in a straight line, Northwest, straight out Mass Avenue and Connecticut Avenue. There's virtually 1 development that has just broken ground that's remotely close to those properties. Now when you go down to -- when you get to NoMa, you can stand on the roof deck of 425 Mass and scan the horizon and see 15 cranes, which is primarily NoMa. It's not all apartments, but certainly most of the apartments, and then north up U Street. So for the most part, I think D.C. really is really suffering from the fog of the uncertainty of the fiscal cliff. And I think most of the damage that -- I think the fog has created more damage than actually the outcome of going over the fiscal cliff. Does that answer your question?","Omotayo T.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to today's speakers. Please go ahead.","Marty McKenna","Thanks, Joe. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's third quarter 2015 results and our asset sale to Starwood. David Neithercut, our President and CEO will be our featured speaker this morning. David Santee, our Chief Operating Officer, and Mark Parrell, our CFO, are here for the Q&A.","Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities law. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. And now I'll turn the call over to David Neithercut.","David Neithercut","Thank you, Marty and good morning everyone. And thank you all for joining us on such short notice. Because of the additional news we released this morning, we're going to break from our normal earnings call routine where we would go through prepared remarks on our markets, quarterly acquisitions, disposition and development activity. As a lot of comments on any capital market, balance sheet and liquidity topics. Instead I'm just going to make a few brief comments about first about the earnings release and then about the portfolio sale with Starwood and as Marty mentioned after that, we'll open it up for questions where Mark Parrell, David Santee will also be able to jump in with their insights.","So, first as to our third quarter earnings release, in the last 20 years we've had only four years in which same-store revenue growth was 5% or better. And three of these have been in the last five years including 2015. And we've had only five instances in the last 20 years when annual same-store NOI growth was 6% or better and three of these have occurred in the last five years again including this year. And our current outlook for 2016 in which we've given an initial range of same-store revenue growth with a mid-point of nearly 4.9%. So, just the 2016 is expected to be yet another of extremely strong growth.","And you\u2019ve heard us say numerous times since the recovery that we felt and were looking at an extended runway of above the trend performance and that continues to be the case. It\u2019s no secret the fundamentals remain very good, the demographic picture is incredibly favourable, the economy continues to improve, perhaps not at the rate many would like but improve nonetheless which is generating job growth again less than some might hope for, but the employment rate has continued to drop, which creates new households and millennials and have a high propensity to rent housing, many of which, which do so in 24\/7 cities across the country that have very high cost of single-family home ownership.","And this time we'll continue because even with the improvement in jobs and the growth in new households there still remain an elevated level of these young adults continuing to live at home with their parents. And I know, because I've got one of them myself and we're quite confident and in my case quite hopeful that they will some time, some day leave home and even create even more new households and those few households will be renters. If we see here today, occupancy has withheld strong and we're at 96.3%. Achieved renewal rates averaged 7% in the third quarter with October, November and December at 6.7, 6.1and 6.3 respectively.","We're very excited about delivering 5.2% same-store revenue growth this year and same-store NOI growth of 6.2%. In addition, we currently expect normalized FFO to grow nearly 9% this year over last year. So, like every call we had with you over the last several years, we're pleased to tell you it remains really very good time to be in the multifamily business and we think we are extraordinarily well positioned to benefit from the continued strength and demand for high quality rental housing in a high-density urban coastal markets.","And that leads me to the other release we put out this morning, regarding the sale of 23,000 units to Starwood for $5.365 billion. The decision to sell these assets was the result of a process we began late last spring as we were looking at a stock price that was trading at a meaningful discount to NAV. And we were assessing the best course of action. We thought about selling core assets, we thought about bringing some JV partners into some core assets. We kept coming back and kept asking ourselves about what to do with assets in those markets that we did not consider long-term core markets, and assets in core markets that might not fit our longer term strategic vision for the company. These assets would generally be described as older, mostly suburban in nature with limited access to public transportation services. The majority of which are surface parked, two to four storey walk-up garden properties not the high-density urban assets, but high walk scores that we've been focused in the past 10 years or so.","And while we have historically considered all of these assets as warehouses of capital that could at some time or another be sold and reinvested into core assets. Overtime we became more and more concerned that recycling $6 billion of capital is going to be a real challenge going forward. Because of the strong institutional demand for core assets in gateway coastal cities and the competitive pricing that is a result of that demand causing very dilutive trade between what we wanted to sell and that which we'd like to buy. Yet we thought that absolute valuations of the assets we knew were not long-term pulls were quite good and if those valuations might be at risk by any upward movement in interest rates, as well as of any future changes in liquidity provided the multifamily space by Fannie and Freddie.","So, we began to think that may be the best thing to do would be to monetize the value we have in these assets today and do a special dividend. And the more we thought about that the more we became convinced that it was the best capital allocation decision that we could make for our shareholders which kind of ironically is also very similar to what we\u2019ve seen take place in our space several times recently, associated states, home properties and campus communities kind of a partial go private for cash deal.","So we talked to a handful of folks to be able to acquire a portfolio of this size and work with Starwood over the last few weeks to put a deal together that accomplishes several things for us. First, we realized a very good pricing on assets in markets not considered poor for us and on assets in our core markets that do not fit our long-term strategic vision. And the second thing we accomplished is that we can now focus solely on our strategy of owning, building and operating assets in higher density urban locations with close proximity to public transportation, job centers and other amenity subsidies have to offer.","In the investor presentation circulated last night, you can see that our urban concentration increases 13% to a total of 78% as a result of these transactions, that our NOI for mid and high-rise properties increased 21% to a total of 69% and that our total walk score increased 9% to a score of 75%. And each of these another metrics, we clearly lead the multifamily space and our belief is that long-term risk adjusted returns in the urban core will exceed those in other markets.","So in summary, fundamentals continue to be very strong and should remain strong for quite some time. We feel very good about how we are positioned going into 2016 and beyond. We are also very pleased to be able to monetize our interest in a large portfolio of assets that don\u2019t fit our longer term strategic vision of the Company in a single transaction and believe that returning this capital to our shareholders and delivering unleveraged internal rate of return of 11.1% is a good capital allocation decision, and by doing so in a leveraged neutral way, we retain a lot of balance sheet flexibility going forward.","So with all that said, Joe we will be happy to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors.","Dave Bragg","The first question relates to the 5.5 cap rate, can you just confirm is that a forward nominal cap rate or something else?","David Neithercut","That\u2019s our sort of forward 12 with about $300 replacement reserve Dave.","Dave Bragg","And can you share a little bit more about the process itself including how big was the bidding tent for portfolio of this size?","David Neithercut","Well again as I noted Dave we just talked to a handful of players that we thought demonstrate the ability to do a deal of this magnitude as well as the ability to move quickly on a deal of this magnitude and after a short period of time we decided to move forward with Starwood.","Dave Bragg","And a question for Mark, can you just address the 2016 debt maturities?","Mark Parrell","Sure, hi Dave. So the thought process is that let\u2019s say which is our name for this process will generate give or take $2 billion of cash that we will use to repay debt. So we may end up repaying the vast majority and probably will of our 2016 maturities. But we are going to undertake a liability management discussion and process and it may end up that we also do some later maturities as well and retire some of that debt.","Operator","And our next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Michael Bilerman","Yes, good morning. It\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Nick. David I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about use of proceeds in the decision on the special. I think back to last summer when Taubman did their big fail, actually to Starwood as well and they sort of left the door open a little bit to potential acquisitions which they said were going to be very unlikely as given the marketplace but also the share buybacks and then ultimately to a special dividend which is what they ended up doing. We have seen a lot of volatility just this year in revaluations and I am just curious are you completely vetted to doing the whole $9 to $11 special or would you consider potentially one if an acquisition came up, doing an acquisition, or two, buying back stock?","Mark Parrell","Hi Michael it is Mark Parrell I will start and I am sure we will get some supplement from David Neithercut as well. So as you know we bought back material amounts of stock before and we would do so again but this particular transaction had a huge amount of embedded gain in it and in order to keep the balance sheet by there any tax embedded gain and to do just a leverage neutral transaction really requires us for every dollar of sales to put about $0.35 towards our debt maturities. Our gain percentage here approaches 75%. So as you can see there really wasn\u2019t any room to capably or easily do a stock buyback with the excess proceeds. That said there is flexibility on the margin we certainly could do 10.31 transactions and tax free exchanges if we wanted to and if the opportunity presented itself.","Michael Bilerman","And just out of curiosity did you look at stay count at all the number sort of shape up pretty well from a $5.3 billion perspective?","Mark Parrell","We did not, no, not this time nor the last time, the first time I guess I should say.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. And then this is Nick here. For the 2016 same-store revenue growth guidance that you gave does that exclude the assets in the markets that you are selling?","David Santee","I think -- this is David Santee yes it's, the guidance should based upon [indiscernible] 240 units for next year which really isn\u2019t that just similar than what we're doing this year.","Nick Joseph","Okay, so if so if you stripped out the assets that you are planning on selling what would same-store revenue guidance for 2015 be?","David Santee","It would be about 10 basis points less.","Nick Joseph","Okay, so it\u2019s like deceleration from call it 51249 roughly as what's assumed?","David Santee","Roughly yes.","Nick Joseph","And then just in terms of the market commentary are you able to go into expectations but do you see North California kind of the six core markets for 2016?","David Santee","Sure. I can go around the whole in pretty quick let\u2019s start with Boston I think if you look at our Boston results I was a little bit bearish on our ability to achieve the three but I think if Boston had a great lease up I think a lot of the head-to-head competition has been leased up and so I'm a little more bullish definitely more bullish on this year and going into next year. New York I think is just New York, Manhattan specifically is going to be stable again this year it's our lead submarket I think 4.8 for the quarter then you jump over to Jersey City it's a 3.8 and then everything else is a 2.8 so Manhattan continues to be a strong steady market for us and we wouldn\u2019t expect anything different next year.","Washington DC is still I would say bouncing along the bottom we are going to produce positive revenue growth we have in our guidance we factored in some modest improvement call it 100 to 150 basis points for next year. But really it's just about were the new product is how and what proximity is to current assets but DC we see deliveries are going to be 10 or less next year and with a lot of the chatter in the government sector yes it seems like DC has turned the corner and the largest sector of job growth best sector of job growth is professional services which bodes well for our portfolio.","Seattle. Seattle we are expecting another strong year still a lot of companies regional headquarters moving to Downtown with Amazon continuing to produce profitability that bodes well for the urban core, Boeing is doing great, backlogs so we don\u2019t really see any change for Seattle next year and kind of expect very similar growth to what we have seen this year.","San Francisco we are always -- we keep moderating with it's probably going to be less next year but we've been around the last four year so we are backing off a little bit in San Francisco, but certainly deliveries are not going to be an issue a lot of these deliveries are downtown so we kind of expect more the same out of San Francisco and then all of the total really is just been is going to be a plus five if not better market all three of those submarkets continue to just deliver solid steady growth there might be a little pressure in Downtown with the new deliveries, but that will be more than made up by the coastal communities like Marina Del Rey so to summarize it Washington DC would be in its own bucket next year, Seattle all the west coast markets will be in the plus five bucket and then New York and Boston will be in that 3% to 5% bucket.","Operator","And we will move forward to our next question. This one comes from Nick Yulico with UBS.","Ross Nussbaum","Hi. This is Ross Nussbaum here with Nick. David when you answer the process specially the assets. Did you also entertain selling the whole company or were you exclusively focused just on this portfolio?","David Neithercut","This process was focused strictly on this portfolio Ross.","Ross Nussbaum","Did any of the people you are talking to you try to make an offer or you just didn\u2019t go to tell them?","David Neithercut","Conversation never came up.","Ross Nussbaum","Okay. As I'm sure you might imagine some folks this morning are drawing some parallels to when Sam accepted the god father offer back in \u201907 for equity office. It seems pretty clear what you are doing here to focus on your urban CBD high rise assets. Is there a message that you want to deliver on Sam's behalf that you know should people be reading in somehow that is Sam going to call the market top the market twice in a row?","David Neithercut","Well I don\u2019t speak for Sam but I think that in my opening remarks I think pretty much described what the process does and in my conversations for Sam on the matter. It was -- we achieved a couple of things we thought were very important here I think suggesting that this is Sam calling any kind of market call is sort of friendly because we are really not selling the company, we are selling a portfolio of assets and we remain you know firmly committed to what we are doing in the identity urban core market, so I think that\u2019s a little of a stretch. And I think this was just kind of a smart portfolio move and a smart capital allocation -- execution.","Ross Nussbaum","Okay I think Nick\u2019s got a question as well.","Nick Yulico","Just a question in terms of next year are you using a sort of tax playing strategy, pulling forward income from future year to -- that\u2019s going to affect your special dividend payment in relation fee sales?","Mark Parrell","Hi Nick, it's Mark Parrell, we are going to pull forward somewhere between call it $300 million to $500 million of 2017 dividend into 2016 is what our base case model implies right now, as we get closer and get in the next year we will give you more details on that. But if you recall my prior comment in this call when I said $0.35 plus $0.75 well that gets you more that a $1 of sales proceeds and by pulling those dividends from \u201917 to \u201916, we balance the transaction out slightly lower the dividend and give ourselves enough cash to keep our debt metrics even.","Nick Yulico","Okay and so the extent that you sale more, your net sale are more on top of what you have announced today, it would likely require more special dividends next year?","Mark Parrell","I should be careful there. The thought process, the $3.8 billion projected dividend and the $2 billion projected debt pay down encompass all of the sales. The sale to Starwood today for a 5.365 billion as well as the additional 700 million and the reconciling item is wholesome costs which are actually relatively low sale cost and also $200 million to $300 million of 10.31 exchanges that we must do in 2016 due to obligations we have the various OP unitholders.","Operator","And we will move forward to our next question from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI.","Steve Sakwa","A lot of my questions have been answered but I guess two to David just in terms of kind of shrieking the footprint, this does do anything to kind of G&A should we be thinking about any kind of cost savings? And then secondly just where is your that process on development today, as we get later in the cycle and how do you think about maybe purchasing land today?","David Neithercut","As to your first question Steve, yes we lose a little bit of efficiency both in property management and G&A as a result of this. We are able to scale up very easily very efficiently and sort of work sequentially when you go backwards but we think it's an outcome that is satisfactory just given the execution that we think we are getting. And then we talk a lot about development over the last few earnings calls and we sort of have begun to back away from really chasing land at current pricing, we did announce the acquisition of a couple of sites that will be assembled with the third cycle we had acquired previously this year, so we have done a little bit the land acquisition in San Francisco but generally we have talked about we have been adding land to our inventory at a much slower rate than what we have been putting into under construction and what we are completing. So after elevated levels of new development starts last year, in this year you could begin to see that reduce going forward.","Operator","And we will move forward to our next question from [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Some of them have been answered already. I have got one or two here in addition. I\u2019d like to start on I guess the question on the portfolio of assets that you are selling and maybe some potential readers. As you mentioned in your comments, you have been conspiring to sell these assets for over a year going back to last spring, so I am trying to figure out if you are trying to tell us anything on what the market on either secondary market or suburban asset value set by selling these assets today, do you think that suburban or secondary asset values have peaked or at least the cap rates have stopped compressing? And then maybe some color on the differential between the IR for what you are selling versus the retained core portfolio?","David Neithercut","Well I guess last spring was not a year ago, we are talking about more of a six month process, as opposed to a 12 month process.","Unidentified Analyst","I think that\u2019s spring...","David Neithercut","But I guess I know this is just a reaction to a recognition as I said in my remarks that we owned assets that we didn\u2019t think were long-term core assets, we were looking at a challenging market in which to redeploy that capital going forward as well as what we thought was a pretty descent bid, to own those assets today and so rather than treat these assets like we have in the past, where they were reservoirs of capital that we used to sell assets and redeploy that in our core markets we just didn\u2019t feel that might be a successful going forward and in fact the matter is that we are now very much firmly in each of our core markets and have got good portfolios and have got that good allocations in those markets and didn't have the need to take that capital and put in a market so as to achieve some kind of total. So whether or not we are $40 billion company with capital deployed across these sort of six coastal markets or a $35 billion of capital deployed across some six markets we didn't really map and so as we were seeing what we thought would be the private equity bid for these sort of assets, we thought that they tend to go ahead and see what we could achieve from that segment and if it meant a special dividend we thought that was okay.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, I appreciate that and then a follow up on the process itself, you mentioned that there is descent interest, you focused on a proven better to you felt with more certain to close and quickly close, curious if there was any negotiation back and forth on the price given perhaps some more limited group of buyers you're discussing and the size of the deal itself?","David Neithercut","I mean, it was sufficient negotiation for us to get a price those acceptable to us at terms that were satisfactory to us and again it came together very quickly.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay but to be clear, was there you need to have discounts given here to what you were expecting or the pricing came in spot on to what you were underwriting?","David Neithercut","Again we're very pleased with the pricing that we achieved in the transaction and in the entire process.","Operator","And we'll move forward to our next question coming from Ian Weissman from Credit Suisse.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys. This is Chris for Ian. I was just wondering if you could walk through each of the disposition markets and can you talk a little bit about the pricing and potentially cap rates on how they rolled up to the 5.5% overall cap rate?","David Neithercut","Well I guess that the level of detail that I'm not quite sure that we're prepared to go into we've really looked to this as a portfolio. I am not sure this is a wide range of cap rate spread between the individual markets but we've really looked at this not as a collective individual assets at one large portfolio.","Unidentified Analyst","When we look at the overall portfolio Orange County and San Diego kind of stick out as the submarket assets but are less than other suburban in Sydney asset plus and the company, did you have any thoughts of selling or downsizing those markets and I guess secondly, was there any other assets that you're trying to -- when you're negotiating on the sale that you would like to have included in the disposition?","David Neithercut","Southern California is sort of buyers nature mostly suburban I mean, all of California of our assets, are really we have got some Downtown San Francisco, we have got some Downtown LA but generally if you look at the difference between what I've said, with our urban concentration and what was that, it is not high rise or mid rise that's really a lot of California. So no, we did not consider selling anything more in any of those markets. And we sold everything in this portfolio that we wanted to, the only things we did not included in this portfolio, those assets that we've indicated in the release this morning that we intend to sale during the balance of 2016 which we thought weren\u2019t necessarily additive to this portfolio but would be a better execution in a one-off small portfolio like execution throughout 2016.","Operator","And we'll move forward to our next question from Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jana Galan","David, maybe following up on those comments, I'm curious whether you would think the private market is giving portfolios at premiums or discount and maybe why you chose to earmark those assets for a portfolio and versus the 26 assets were you looking to do individual or small portfolio sales?","David Neithercut","Well I guess, I want to tell you, that we are obviously satisfied with the execution of this pricing and we had an expectation that we get good pricing just because of the activity we've seen in the marketplace and we did want to go through a lengthy process of trying to sell these on a one-off sort of basis. I mean, this makes sense in a one big portfolio that we can than think about a onetime special dividend and just have the whole thing sort of makes sense, this would have been a very difficult process to achieve any other manner and we do not believe, we had to get anything on pricing in order to get it done in one fell swoop and we're getting a -- very satisfied with the overall pricing.","Unidentified Analyst","And David, this is Jeff, just one quick question. A key focus for us has been the rise of secondary cities and I'm just curious, if EQR is messaging here making a statement that EQR does not really believe in the longevity of the rise of the secondary cities, let's called them the coming 24\/7 although realistically, there is not that many 24\/7 cities in the world but I understand your strategy and it's consistent what you've said, just on these other markets is it just not something you believe in long-term?","David Neithercut","What I think all these markets are really good apartment markets Jeff. We really do, we think Denver is a good apartment market and we think Sao Paolo is a good apartment market. What we've been unable to sort of see our way into owning these sort of higher density kind of assets in those markets and believe that the suburban garden likes product that we're selling to Starwood are better owned by people that have a different capital structure than we do and then our focus has been toward owning what we consider to be more forever like assets in the high density urban core are better assets in our capital structure. So, I think that these are terrific markets. They've been doing very well. I think they are a little more susceptible to supply over the longer term and we think that within our capital structure the launch from this adjusted returns will be better in the urban core than in a suburban product.","Operator","And we'll move forward to our next question from Tony Paolone with JPMorgan.","Tony Paolone","Can you talk a little bit about what you think the longer-term delta is between the NOI growth in your six key markets versus say these assets that you're shedding here? Just seems like in the short run it's not that appreciably different, wondering longer term what you think?","A - David Neithercut","Yes and look as David indicated I have been selling these assets would actually be dilutive to 2015 same-store revenue growth but if we think about total return over an extended time period and if you think about what are real cash and cash return of these assets would be as opposed to just kind of a cap rate, it's less than this level. And we also think that the -- there's more width to value of these assets as I said during my opening remarks with respect to rising interest rates or any change in liquidity that Fannie and Freddie provide. So, this is like simply a call about long-term revenue growth although I do believe that history will prove out that the urban core has over an extended time period done better in longer term top-line and probably bottom-line growth but it's also just I think a little bit a hedge about potential valuations and we just think is the right longer term per se.","Tony Paolone","And, Mark, I think you went through this and I'm probably going to make you repeat this for a second. But the 2 billion in cash available to repay debt next year, that's inclusive of the Northeast assets that you intend to sell?","Mark Parrell","Yes Sir.","Tony Paolone","So, we should think about is like 6.1 billion producing the 2 billion of cash roughly?","Mark Parrell","Yes, so just reconstruct that for you, the sources and uses so call it about 6.1 billion of sales proceeds call it around 300 million that we have to reinvestment in assets, we have to do tax free exchanges for us so that reach a 5.8 billion. When you try and solve backwards to keep your credit metrics about constant than needs up that 5.8, 2 billion will be used to repay debt and about 3.8 billion will remain for the special dividend, there're some immaterial costs and rounding in there as well, but it's not significant though.","Tony Paolone","And then last question on the 4.5 to 5.25 revenue guide for '16. Can you put some just maybe broader economic brackets around that in terms of what kind of job growth do we need to see to kind of come in at the higher end or lower end of that range? And perhaps maybe what's in the bag at this point from the earn in just trying to understand the sensitivity around that right now?","Mark Parrell","So, we kind of think about it in very simple terms. So we have about 2.3% embedded growth in our rent roll and we think just like this year that the new portfolio will see rent growth in the call it 5.5 you need to figure that the easy math as you get about 45% of that which is 2.5, two or three quarters and so 2.3 embedded, 2.5 to 2 and 3 quarters gets you to 495. We're not underwriting any additional pickups in occupancy although that certainly could be the case if the markets continue to tighten but as far as forecast for the next year, we're just kind of holding occupancy flat.","Tony Paolone","And so, does that imply to that job growth in your six key markets needs to equate something fairly comparable to '15 to kind of hit that similar top-line number is that fair or is...?","Mark Parrell","I would say as long as we hover around 175 to 200 jobs that we'll be just fine.","Operator","And we will move forward to Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","So quick questions here, Mark, the common dividend, should we anticipate that getting resized or you guys will maintain it?","Mark Parrell","As we said in the release just to be clear the dividend that we are going to pay in January that will be declared in December won\u2019t be affected by this transaction, whatever the trustees\u2019 do for that but it won\u2019t be affected by this transaction. I would expect this resize the annual run rate dividend that would be then payable in April of 2016.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then you guys in the market with one year apartment towers here in New York to a condo converter. Are your thoughts to contemplate other condo conversion sales?","David Neithercut","So we are offering for sale a property in the East side of Manhattan which we think is one that I would lend itself better to condominium type ownership and this is the kind of activity I think you will see us more do going forward Alex and we are now focused solely on our core markets and here is an opportunity we think to monetize hopefully good value in this asset and redeploy that into something that might be a better longer term rental play. So I mean if possible we will see what happens. If we don\u2019t get a number, we realize we won\u2019t play, if we do it will be because we think it\u2019s a good price a good value relative to how we think we can redeploy that capital into another asset either in New York or in one of our other core markets.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And just finally, the military assets it seems like that one would be sort of next for this division but don\u2019t know if there is anything contractual or tax or anything like that, that would make it stay within EQR, so future of the military assets?","David Neithercut","Well we have no contractual obligations to continue to do that to sell those require some approvals, from lenders and the army. So if and when that happens, it would be subject to their approval. We have no contractual obligation to continue for any length of time, of our management and ownership of that asset.","Operator","And we will move forward to Rob Stevenson with Janney.","Rob Stevenson","Mark, I know you used 300 of CapEx in the cap rate calculation. But on a real dollar basis, what\u2019s the maintenance CapEx per unit on the sales portfolio versus EQR as a whole for \u201915?","Mark Parrell","We don\u2019t have that level of detail right here in front of us I don\u2019t think.","David Neithercut","So I can tell you though that on a forward sort of run rate the 5.5 cap rate of this portfolio we think after CapEx is more like a 5.3 so on a real sort of AFFO basis Rob.","Rob Stevenson","And then is there anything that you are sitting here today that you guys see hitting same-store expenses materially over the next five quarters other than the typical property tax and wage growth that\u2019s going to drive you much above the sort of 3, 3.25 run rate on the same-store expenses that you guys have been averaging recently?","David Santee","This is Dave Santee. Here is how we think about 2016 taxes. We know that -- I am sorry expenses. We know that 2016 real estate taxes are going to have a 5 handle primarily because of the step up in the 421(a) tax abatements. We know that payroll should probably come in 3% or less. We know that we\u2019ve already locked in material discounts and some commodity costs for next year. So those three categories make up 70% of our total expense. So when if you do the math on that there is no reason why 2016 shouldn\u2019t look very similar to 2015.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And then last question, you talked a little bit about development earlier on but when you are in terms of the shadow development pipeline the stuff that\u2019s not ready to start yet. I mean how big is that today that you can envision starting over the \u201916, \u201917 period?","David Neithercut","As you know it\u2019s not as big as what we\u2019ve done in the past several years Rob. In \u201916 we start call it $500 million or $600 million I suppose, and I think that\u2019s a pretty good run rate for us going forward.","Operator","And we will move forward Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao","Just a quick question going back to the assets that is for sale in New York that\u2019s above and beyond the set of 100 that\u2019s contemplated in \u201916 I believe just curious given all the commentary about how difficult it is to deploy, what would be the most likely use of proceeds there and for any other sort of condo type conversion or other asset sales similar to that and what do you think that the best use of capital is today it sounds like starts are coming down so I mean developments will be part of that but I'm not sure if that's really will be able to absorb all of that?","David Neithercut","While the difficulty to redeploy the capital I was really relative to the yields that we would realize on those assets we want to sell and so this is the 5.5 cap rate transactions deal with Starwood difficult to think that we could redeploy that at a reasonable relative cap rate seeing it how assets is our core markets today generally trading with a three handle if we are successful upon getting the bid that we hope we could keyed out of the market on a deal New York we may actually be able to redeploy that asset accretively in one of our core markets. So our expectation of current time is that that is what would happen with the proceeds if we are successful selling this particular property in the New York City.","Vincent Chao","And then just going back to the 700 million of dispositions six in a quarter cap rate on those relative to the 5.5 for the Starwood portfolio assuming that's just general geographies that you are selling being different as well as some asset quality but curious is there any embedded assumption of just general cap rate increases in that 6 to 6.25 given some of the about the noncore nonurban assets you mentioned being more a price sensitive?","David Neithercut","Now so to this end this difference shows cap rate has nothing to do with an expectation of a changing cap rates between now and then it's just simply a recognition or it is different type of property that would likely trade in a slightly wider cap rate.","Operator","And will move forward to our next question from Dan Oppenheim with Zelman & Associates.","Dan Oppenheim","I was wondering if you can just talk about the your view in terms of volatility as you now focused on to fewer and fewer market probably and it's more volatility into the results but I guess as specially in terms of this area here in terms of North how you think about that in terms of the exposure going up we have seen extremely strong rent growth as it's been you are delivering couple of more projects and here plus buying more land sounds that you are more bullish although the comments were about thinking of it as going to moderate a little bit here how do you think about the market overall?","David Neithercut","Yes. We don\u2019t suggest for a minute Dan that San Francisco does not have its ups and downs and in fact it\u2019s probably had perhaps more downs than other markets but we do recognize that it is a marketplace that has always come back and come back fairly quickly and established sort of new so when we look at the assets where we own there and look at the asset that we are building and the prices per foot per pound that we are building those units we ask ourselves not how do we feel about this asset assuming these trees continue to go to the sky or how do we feel about owning these assets at these levels for the next 25 or 30 years and with that perspective we are quite comfortable with what we own and comfortable with what we have underway as a present time and again this was not mean that things can't stop from that marketplace we've not underwritten them again with these kinds of year-over-year revenue growth that we've seen over the past half a dozen years.","And we just think that over the longer term it's -- these will be good assets to own. And I just so to mentioned that when we build the tower in Brooklyn half of dozen or so years ago when that deal was delivered it was maybe worth what it cost to good but we knew on firm was the great asset we are located and we do very well with anyone when the market stabilized we do work very well with it and it is worth a considerable premium today if were to cost build on I think we can take the same approach on really on anything that we build we look at the location, look at the quality of product what we are basis per unit per square foot in and ask ourselves how do we feel about being in this product over an extended time period not just are we going to ramp merchant builders right we are just not worried about what the spread is 24 months after delivery but it is the right asset for us and for our shareholders over an extended time period.","Operator","And will move forward to our next question from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.","Rich Anderson","Mark Parrell you said 300 million you are obligated to sell or buy through 1031 exchange what are the tax protections are lingering in the remainco portfolio after the sell if any?","Mark Parrell","Yes. I should have been a little more precise Rich with that. We are obligated we\u2019re inclined to 1031 that $300 million just because of the implications it has to us in our OP unit program we don\u2019t have to. We have relatively few assets that are covered and I think that would probably be something between around 30 after this transaction and might have some sort of obligation maybe a little bit less of one kind or another where you would need to do some sort of tax free exchange or you would have some amount you owe to your partner.","David Neithercut","Let me follow-up on that just a little more Rich. I do want to make it clear that these are unrelated unaffiliated OP unitholders but would have taxes in the 100% very significant tax and we feel that inclined as Mark said to the limited amount of this particularly relation to the size of this transaction to try at 1031 those vehicles and we are quite confident that we will be able to do so in assets that we will be really delighted own over the long term.","Mark Parrell","And just to finish the thought I mean we think that protects the OP unit currency, if you are able to take care of these partners even when you don\u2019t have to we think as we go out and trying do more and more deals that you have OP unit components because we do think it's attractive to do that certain place in the cycle that that will be appreciated by the market and by our sellers.","Rich Anderson","And so David another you mentioned these are markets not necessarily grow to your markets over the long term that you are holding but just better from a perspective of 25 years, so you were saying like as the environment changes, interest rates go up these coastal barrier markets you just think will perform better or what is the reason that it's not about growth?","David Neithercut","I wasn\u2019t clear I guess then, and while I was thinking about in terms of absolute value with respect to interest rate.","Rich Anderson","Okay.","David Neithercut","You said in our in the materials that we sent out as part of the press release, that there is a good bid for these assets today from leverage buyers taking advantage of lower interest rate, so I think that these assets as I have mentioned earlier are better owned I think by a leverage buyer and as favorable debt today at favourable rates and should that change we think we\u2019d see a bigger impact on value here, but if you would if any in the higher density core markets we have had the most for capital in investment today.","Rich Anderson","Did any REITs get involved in the process for the asset sale?","David Neithercut","We did not have any conversations with any other REITs.","Rich Anderson","Okay and last question, you mentioned the 700 million to go will be kind of one offish or a smaller portfolio, is any chance of that could actually give more sense to a single buyer situation?","David Neithercut","I suppose it's possible, we\u2019d probably be delighted if that were to occur, but just given the nature of these assets and for those of you who have been around the blog for a while, these are a primarily assets and we acquired in a growth transactions so there are a lot sort of smaller assets or smaller unit out, smaller price points that we think that we might achieve maximum operable pricing and on one off sort of basis, but if there were someone who are interested in meeting our expectations on a one off deal we would be go delighted for that to happen.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Tom Lesnick with Capital One Securities.","Tom Lesnick","So on the 700 million, knowing when the portfolio for next year, I think like you guys are pretty confident on pricing and have a pretty type band there on cap rates, I was just wondering how far along you were in the market process for that and if you could offer any commentary on timing for next year whether it is probably more weighted towards the first half or second half or whatever?","David Neithercut","I guess, we had several of these assets sort out in the marketplace before we really got on the way with this larger process but we have a good sense of pricing. And then also just sort of to tell you that we are acted in the markets, following deals and so we just a kind of very good handle on what we think valuations are, I\u2019ll remind you that when we announced the Archstone transaction, we have given our Boards the guidance just to we thought, we\u2019d achieve and selling the $4.5 billion of assets and we used during the 1031 trade in Archstone we sold those at something like 99.7% of our expectation, so we have got a terrific team out there that are in these markets every day, taking care of these assets trying to understand them and understand the marketplace and we just have a high regard for the intelligence that these guys give us and expectations to what we will be able to achieve on this portfolio.","Tom Lesnick","And then on the land acquisitions in San Francisco, just curious if you could shed some color on where in the city those are exactly and when you might expect commencing of those development starts?","David Neithercut","Well, this two sites have been assemble with a third site and we have clearly that we acquired earlier in the year and are adjacent to our SoMa Square in the SoMa sort of submarket on San Francisco. The expectation there is that we can begin to start in maybe in the first quarter of 2017 that will be $170 million project. We love Downtown in San Francisco, we think it will be very well with that transaction.","Tom Lesnick","And then most of my questions on the Starwood transaction have been answered at this point but just a housekeeping question. Looking back at your 2Q supplement the asset count and unit count is slightly different than what's presented in the transaction said actually in the market, I think you guys had 19 assets in Denver and 35 assets in South Florida, I just want to what the couple of assets there were that were the difference?","David Neithercut","Yes well following up on Rich Anderson's question I answered a moment ago, there are few assets that are tax protected or are JV assets in Denver and in South Florida and that\u2019s the difference in the count and those will be sold or dealt with separately over the course of 2016.","Operator","And we'll move forward to our next question from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay","Congratulations on the transaction and thanks for providing individual look in 2016 and when you look at 2016, which markets were the hardest to forecast?","David Neithercut","Well, I guess by default Washington DC. We were starting off the year with pretty much flat embedded growth so anything we achieved will have to earn next year either through rate or occupancy.","Wes Golladay","Okay and then for the transaction the asset dispositions, is there any deferred CapEx associated with that transaction price?","David Neithercut","No.","Operator","And we'll move forward to our next question from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Tayo Okusanya","Just along those same lines with the 2016 same store revenue guidance. Could you just talk a little bit about market where you actually think you should see better same store revenue growth in '16 versus '15 and markets where you actually expected to slow which I mean where you kind of rule everything else becomes the slight slowdown versus overall 2015?","David Neithercut","Well so the markets that we think, we'll do better would be Orange County, potentially LA and Boston and potentially New York and DC. Seattle, I think is not less but closer to the same and then San Francisco, we hope that will do the same but we're just cautious about forecasting any gains over this year in the next year.","Operator","We have another question from Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird.","Drew Babin","I was hoping you could in more detail for example what you're seeing on the supply side in the markets that you're exiting on '16 deliveries across the board higher than they're in '15 or is it more of a long term issue?","David Neithercut","And those that we're exiting?","Drew Babin","Correct.","David Santee","Well this is David Santee. Denver is delivering over 12,000 units this year and I would tell you that we would expect a good portion of that to bleed into next year with a lot of concentration in the downtown area. Then for 2016, as of today our forecast already gross down to 6,500 units but when you're talking about garden communities, there is no lot of barriers temporary in Denver and the 6,500 number could grow to 7,500 or 8,000 very easily. South Florida really is almost the same picture, 10,000 plus units being delivered again in 2015. I think what is different in South Florida is that a lot of these new deliveries are pretty much all along I-95, if not all east of I-95 stretching from Miami all the way from West Palm Beach and then very similar to Denver, we dropped down to 5,500 for 2016 but again with the lower barriers to entry permitting what have you to scrape and build two storey, three storey garden walk up can be done very quickly in those markets.","Drew Babin","And secondly, you're just talking about kind of this is the broader cycle, I was wondering if you could highlight the key differences between now time period versus going back to 2005, 2006 and cap rates seem to be kind of in the same place or even lower than they were at that point in time, what are the key differences that you're seeing sort of on the supply side or relationship versus that cost things like that?","David Santee","That cost are about the same, there continues to be a great deal of equity, chasing deals, it might be less absolute leverage available but there is still a lot of them at that very attractive rates.","Operator","And we have another question from Aaron Hecht with JMP Securities.","Aaron Hecht","I was just wondering if you could outline your NOI exposure by market following these dispositions?","David Santee","NOI exposures [indiscernible] we're digging for that but hold on just a second.","Aaron Hecht","No Problem.","David Santee","And this is after all the expected dispositions.","David Neithercut","Completing the Starwood transaction and the 700 that will occur later in the year.","David Santee","So, we expect and I would say these are all kind of grounded numbers around New York to be around 20% of NOI, maybe a bit more, Washington DC to be in the 19%, San Francisco to be about 18%, LA about 15%, Boston give or take 11, Seattle about 8 and then the rest really San Diego and Orange County each 4% and that's just about it. Little bit less than Inland Empire that are likely be included the next time we report next year in our Los Angeles country that is around the far west and really are driven by West co -- by Orange County or LA more so than the Inland Empire.","Aaron Hecht","And then just, we all saw the article in the Wall Street Journal about the partial volumes increasing based on Web services and there are some quotes from you guys in that but just wondering what you're take is on how that's impacting expenses in NOI? Does this become a bigger issue now with the dispositions given the higher exposure to mid and high rise buildings?","David Santee","This is David Santee certainly, there is a much bigger burden on garden communities, because they don't have doormen, they don't have concierges what have you so, I mean we evolved in working my partner at hand and we've been at conversations with UPS and FedEx and what have you but we've had a very -- we build a proprietary package notification system probably four or five years ago. Is it a burden on some of the properties? Yes. We have tried several pieces of technology which are only real partial answers to the problem, but I think over the next year or so we will be close to providing 100% solution in buildings where we don't have concierges or doormen but we do believe that if you live in a doormen building or concierges building that accepting packages is a basic expectation of our resident.","Aaron Hecht","And is there a solution in those other buildings electronic lockers is that what you're trying to?","David Santee","No, I think I don't want to think we've ruled the lockers out but there is a lot of nuances with the lockers. When someone orders four tyres they don't fit in one of those lockers. And remember it's all these unique jockeying between the kinds of postal person FedEx and UPS guys or whoever may jockey for last position for so and hoping that the lockers are filled so that they can just dump the packages. So, it's a very interesting subject that, that we hope to solve over the course of the next year or so.","Operator","And we have a follow-up question from Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Michael Bilerman","Yes, it's Michael Bilerman, just a quick follow-up. Obviously, as a seller you are most concerned with the buyer's ability to close and fund the transaction. I'm just curious as I assume this is going to be a leveraged transaction. How much have you already been working with Starwood in terms of the debt financing and what can you tell us about that today?","David Neithercut","Yes, all I can tell you Michael is that we've done the appropriate diligence that we would need to do on a transaction with this magnitude with respect to equity sources and debt sources to give us great comfort that they will perform as expected which would be very similarly to the way they've performed over the last several weeks between the time we sort of agreed on doing this deal and today announced. So, they have done everything they've said they would do and we've done our diligence to get us comfortable, we're able to continue to do that and close on time as we expect.","Michael Bilerman","Is there any financing contingency at all in the transaction?","David Neithercut","No, sir.","Michael Bilerman","And then I noticed there was -- the deal was on a ten separate person and sale agreements and the closing is in seven different buckets. Can you just talk about what the rationale or is it are they slitting it up to multiple equity partners and their different leverage profiles and their different buckets, is it timing in terms of getting it that package, what drove that?","David Neithercut","Mostly it is because of some properties that we acquire, some consents and approvals, there are some rights of first offer that some county has, there's also our desire, the properties that Mark suggested, that that we would want to temporarily want to have ourselves gated and we\u2019d get a little bit of extra time that need be. So, a little bit -- the lion\u2019s share of this will happen in one fell suit and then there will just be and even in those multiple buckets could be at the same time but we just a way to sort of facilitate the overall transaction and allow for some of these other consents and approvals to be able to see.","Michael Bilerman","And is there any G&A savings at all even few million dollars that we should be thinking about as we are modelling through what the company is post the $6 billion of asset sale?","Mark Parrell","It\u2019s Mark Parrell Michael. At this point what I would tell you is we run a pretty tight ship already and I think Dave Neithercut spoke to the scaling comment it was relatively easy for us to scale up to Archstone which does imply it\u2019s really relatively difficult for us to just suddenly scale down. So at this point wouldn\u2019t have you project anything meaningful.","Operator","And at this time, we have no further questions in the queue.","David Neithercut","All right, thank you all again for your time today and look forward to seeing many of you in Las Vegas in just a few weeks. Have a great day."],"8847":["Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) Q2 2016 Earnings Conference Call July 27, 2016 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Marty McKenna \u2013 Investor Relations","David Neithercut \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer","David Santee \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer","Mark Parrell \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","David Bragg \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Rich Hightower \u2013 Evercore ISI","Nick Yulico \u2013 UBS","Jeff Pehl \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Rob Stevenson \u2013 Janney","Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies","Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O'Neill","John Kim \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Ivy Zelman \u2013 Zelman and Associates","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Tom Lesnick \u2013 Capital One Securities","Wes Golladay \u2013 RBC Capital Market","Nick Joseph \u2013 Citigroup","Operator","Good day and welcome to the Equity Residential 2Q 2016 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded.","Now at this time, I'll turn the call to your host Marty McKenna. Please go ahead sir.","Marty McKenna","Thanks, Jay. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential\u2019s second quarter 2016 results and outlook for the year. Our featured speakers today are David Neithercut, our President and CEO; David Santee, our Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Parrell, our CFO. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.","And now I'll turn over to David Neithercut.","David Neithercut","Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. Clearly 2016 will not turn out to be the year we had originally expected due to deteriorating market conditions in San Francisco and New York City, which combined made up 50% of our initial growth forecast for the year. As David Santee will address in greater detail in just a moment. At the time of our first quarter earnings call nearly all indicators suggested that while the top end of our original expectations was off the table another year of solid up with 4% growth in same-store revenue was most likely.","As strong demand continued to absorb new supply with little impact to existing inventory. The month of May however brought sudden and material changes to the fundamental picture particularly San Francisco and a 50 basis point reduction in the Company\u2019s expected revenue growth for the year. Last 60 days fundamentals have continued to weaken in this markets causing us to yet again reduce our expectations for full year of revenue growth, in which for the first time in many years we now expected to have a free handle. And as a result after five years of extraordinarily strong fundamentals revenue growth this year will not be more in line with historical trends.","Like many of the participants on today\u2019s call, we too would prefer revenue growth with a four, or even at a five handle but markets do reset from time to time either due to new supply or changes in the demand side of equation. Unfortunately, the present time we\u2019re experiencing both factors in two of our most important markets. The weakness we\u2019re experiencing in San Francisco, New York City is driving reductions in our revenue growth expectations for the year.","So with that said I\u2019ll let David Santee go in to more detail about what\u2019s occurred over the last 60 to 90 days, how it\u2019s impacted us during the primary leasing season and our expected results for the year.","David Santee","Okay. Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. This morning I\u2019ll address or advice same-store revenue guidance and give you some color on overall operations. As Boston, DC, Seattle and Southern California are all generally performing in line with our expectations. I\u2019ll focus my commentary on San Francisco and New York. We welcome any questions you have on our other markets in the Q&A. Today Mark will address our same-store expenses in his remarks.","As David said in his comment, we would not meet revenue expectations that we announced in June and that is due in large part, to the continued volatility that we\u2019re seeing in San Francisco and to a lesser extent New York as these markets work to absorb new supply. Together these two markets accounted for approximately 50% of our expected revenue growth in 2016. The deterioration in both markets is driving more volatility than we have experienced in our portfolio over the last half dozen years.","Now that markets are less stable as a result of elevated supply and pressure on the highly compensated job sector optimizing occupancy comes at a cost for rate growth. Now when we gave revised guidance in June, San Francisco new lease rents had gone from being up 5% in Q1 down to flat in a matter of weeks. We assumed as a result of some of the irrational pricing we saw on new lease-ups, that we would see rates deteriorate further into negative territory. But that we could still achieve similar occupancy as we move through peak leasing season. We felt comfortable about occupancy because the last week of May occupancy was 20 basis points higher than the same week last year and exposure was 20 basis points lower.","We thought certainly if Seattle could absorb elevated supply with minimal disruption, San Fran could do the same. Our forecast for San Francisco new lease rents to go negative proved to be true very quickly as new lease rents are now negative 3% versus same week last year. Unfortunately over the next four weeks our occupancy assumptions for San Francisco missed the mark and today we sit at 95.8% occupied, a 110 basis points lower than the same week last year.","The deterioration of both metrics and the knowledge that new supply continues to be delivered in to rest of this year and heavily in the first half of next has led us to lower our full year growth expectation for San Francisco to be around 6.5%, down from our expected 7.75% in June and the original 9.5% growth we expected when we gave you our original guidance in Q4 of last year.","San Francisco accounted for about a third of our same-store revenue growth in 2016 and so this decline along with New York City accounts for the 100 basis points off of the entire portfolio. In San Francisco, we have seen a sizable amount of new supply over 8,000 units being delivered in 2016 and it is all at the high end of the market. This supply has hit the market at the same time that job growth in the tech sector has hit the pause button. We still see good demand for units as evidenced by how well our newly completed developments are leasing up. But we are feeling the impact of our target demographic having more choices than before.","In the second quarter, our lease over lease Delta was up 2.1%, in July was up 95 basis points, while renewals were up 8.6%. Occupancy was 96.2% and turnover excluding same property transfers increased 30 basis points from same quarter last year. Through Q2 turnover excluding transfers is down 30 basis points from 25% to 24.7%. Looking forward new lease rents are expected to remain in the minus 3% range for July and August, our renewals achieved for July are 8% and currently 6.9% for August. Again, occupancy is 95.8%, but is on the expected seasonal upswing as students return to school.","Now switching to New York, when we gave guidance in June, it was clear that New York was going to deteriorate further. We are comfortable that we have forecasted the appropriate mix of rate and occupancy for the balance of the year. New York job growth expectations were at the time stable. While the economy there appears to be on solid footing and the overall job growth is at expected levels. The bulk of job added today are mid-level compensation types jobs dominated by hospitality, leisure, followed by healthcare.","Professional services, our demographic typically the higher paying jobs held by our target demographic was a close third. The New York market continues to work to absorb approximately nearly 9,000 units this year and with the great majority of that supply at the high end absorption has not been as robust as we would expect. As a result, it\u2019s possible that 2016 deliveries will carry over into 2017 lease ups. We are already expecting a more elevated pipeline of new products scheduled for delivery in both 2017 and 2018.","The concern in New York is that these elevated levels of supply mainly private and fee managers to elevate upfront move in concessions beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016. Now in our shop as we immediately take a cash charge in our same-store revenue of the full concession in the month of move-in our revenue stream would be more impacted this year than if we amortize those concessions over the term of the lease. For example, year-to-date we would have reported a 4.5% if we have straight-line concessions versus the 4.4% that we reported.","As a result sequential quarter over quarter and full year revenue growth will be more impacted this year. Much of the new supply delivered in 2016 has been focused on the left side Jersey City and Brooklyn, all very competitive to our same-store portfolio in the market.","2017 we\u2019ll see deliveries across a number of submarkets especially Long Island City and Brooklyn, but the left side we\u2019ll see continued deliveries as well. Our current expectation for full year same-store revenue growth for New York is now around 1.5%, which is down from the 2.25% growth expectation, we had at the beginning of June and the 3.75% growth expectation we had to start the year.","New York accounted for about 15% of our expected 2016 same-store revenue growth. In the second quarter, our lease over lease Delta was minus 80 basis points, in July is minus 95 basis point. Renewal rates achieved were 4.3% for the quarter with July at 3.3%. Renewals achieved thus far for August and September are 3.4% and 2.8% respectively. Turnover excluding same-store, same property transfers increased a 100 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 10.1% and a 100 basis points year to-date to 17.4%. Today occupancy is 96.2% with new lease rates slightly negative.","Now before I close I want to assure you that no one is more disappointed about having to lower our guidance again and more than the entire team here at EQR as well as myself. I can also say that each stop along the way we were diligently to give you our best estimate at the time based on our collective experience.","As David said at the end of April occupancy, exposure, turnover, renewal rents, new lease rents, all indicated another good year in San Francisco. Unfortunately as we continue to increase rents in May, the market decided to get conservative and we had to react accordingly. We are obviously experiencing extremely volatile markets and this volatility is very difficult to predict. Perhaps in hindsight we were initially over optimistic on San Francisco given the levels of new supply bottom line this year, but based on our dashboards at the end of April and later in the early June, we would never have predicted the falloff in new lease rents and occupancy that we experience today. David?","David Neithercut","Okay. Thank you, David. As noted in last night\u2019s earnings release, we\u2019ve also made some changes toward expected transaction activity for the year. Dispositions have now been reduced to $6.9 billion down from $7.4 billion. This $500 million reduction has resulted three factors. First, about a $150 million of the non-Boston [indiscernible] assets that are in various stages of the disposition process. We\u2019ll not likely close this year, will carry over into the first quarter of 2017.","Second, the original disposition guidance included a $200 million portfolio of assets we have decided to hold for the present time as we see continued upside in both operations and valuations there and think that sale at this time would be premature. And lastly, as noted in last night\u2019s release, we did not acquire any assets in the second quarter and reduced our acquisitions expectations for the year by $150 million.","Since any incremental acquisitions will be funded by sales proceeds we\u2019ve reduced dispositions by a similar amount. During the second quarter we did sell three non-core assets for $112.5 million at 5.7% disposition yield and a 9.3% unleveraged IRR. In addition to selling these assets in Arizona, Massachusetts and Connecticut, last quarter we also sold our entire interest in the military housing at Joint Base Lewis McChord in Tacoma, Washington, in realizing a gain of $52.4 million. Now we\u2019ve been involved with Lewis McChord since 2002 during which time we renovated over 2200 homes and built more than 800 new homes for men and women who called the McChord Joint Base Home while serving our country. We\u2019re very proud of our work at Lewis McChord last 14 years and it was really our honor and privilege to be involved there.","With regard to our development business we commenced construction of the one small development project in the second quarter in Washington D.C., we\u2019re billing 222 units or $88 million or $396,000 a unit. At an expected yield on cost at today\u2019s rents in the mid 5s. The deal was in the NoMa market and will be delivered in late 2018 and is expected to stabilize in late 2019.","We\u2019re also currently working on two small projects totaling $90 million that could start construction yet this year, with a weighted average cost on at today\u2019s rents in the mid to high 5s. During the second quarter, we also completed construction in our lease-up of three new development deals all in the San Francisco market, two Downtown and one in North San Jose. These assets are leasing extremely well and are experiencing monthly absorption rates in excess of original expectations. From a pricing standpoint like our same-store portfolio we\u2019re not achieving the rents we\u2019d hoped at the beginning of the year, but the rents we are achieving are well in access of those underwritten at the time these sites were acquired and constructions commenced. And as a result these assets will provide stabilized yields from the high 5s to high 7s, which are well in excess of our original expectations.","I\u2019ll turn the call now over to Mark Parrell.","Mark Parrell","Thank you, David. Today, I\u2019ll be giving some color behind our same-store expense guidance and the change to our normalized FFO guidance. I\u2019ll then discuss how the change to our normalized FFO guidance impacted the remaining special dividend payment and our debt issuance guidance. In all these cases I\u2019m comparing the guidance numbers we gave you in late April 2016 as part of our first quarter earnings call to the revised guidance that we provided last night. As you might recall the June 1 press release only revised our same-store revenue and NOI ranges.","So moving onto the same-store expense side, we have left our annual same-store expense range at an increase of 2.5% to 3% and this is not withstanding the fact that same-store expenses year-to-date have only grown by 0.9%. This implies so we expect second half same-store expenses to grow at a considerably higher rate of about 4.6%. As usual our big three expense categories of real estate taxes, utilities, and payroll will drive these numbers. ","We now expect property taxes to increase at a rate of about 6% versus our previous expectation in our year-to-date number of 5.5%. This increase is due to a recent adverse legal decision regarding the calculation of property taxes, with several of our properties in New Jersey City. We also previously forecast payroll growth up 2.5% to 3% and we still believe that forecast to be accurate. Year-to-date payroll has only increased 0.3%, so we see most of the expected increase in payroll as backend loaded. ","For the year, we expect utilities expense to decline by approximately 3%, year-to-date utilities expenses down 8.1%. Mostly expected growth in the second half on the utility side is due to our expectation of somewhat higher commodity prices later in this year as compared to the historically low commodity prices we have in the third and fourth quarters of 2015.","Moving onto normalized FFO, the reduction in the same-store NOI from a midpoint back in April of 5.5% to a midpoint now of 4%, causes a normalized FFO reduction of about $23 million or about $0.06 per share. Going the other way an increase in our normalized FFO estimate we now expect an additional $4 million in NOI or about $0.01 per share for the positive due to the reduction in dispositions combined with these asset sales being pushed back further into the year. ","David Neithercut previously discussed the reasons for this reduction in our disposition activity. Our reduction in acquisition guidance from $600 million to $350 million and disposition guidance from $7.4 billion to $6.9 billion has only had a very modest impact on the amount of taxable gain that we only incur in 2016 and need the special dividend.","This is because the specific assets that we removed from our disposition guidance just specifically at relatively little tax gain and because we have already paid with the $8 per share March 2016 special dividend, the preponderance of the tax gain that we will incur in 2016. We therefore left our guidance for the annual special dividend in the range of $2 to $4 per share with the thought that the ultimate amount that we will pay is likely to be at or slightly lower than that midpoint. Our guidance assumes that this payment will be made in the fourth quarter of 2016. All dividend payments are subject still to the approval of our Board of Trustee.","Moving on to the debt side, because our next disposition activity is about $250 million lower than we expected back in April our projected line balance at December 31, 2016 is anticipated to now be about $430 million versus the $130 million we previously estimated. For now we have left our debt issuance guidance at about $225 million. But if our disposition process goes as expected we may do a larger offering than is now included in our guidance in either the secured or unsecured markets later in 2016.","And I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to the operator for the question-and-answer session period.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll hear first from Nick Joseph, Citigroup. Go ahead please. ","Michael Bilerman","Hey, it\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Nick. Santee, thanks for the color surrounding from the guidance moves and look we can certainly appreciate you in the short-term business. Your portfolio is more concentrated in the two of the biggest markets that you are in have some more volatility. And I don\u2019t want to get into the specifics of the numbers, but I want to focus on your processes and procedures in terms of forecasting and the results. And there was many of us have been to your offices, we've seen all the reams of data, we\u2019ve seen all the pricing systems that you have and you\u2019ve now reduced guidance three times.","So we were trying to figure out sort of what are the issues in terms of, is your assets forecasting system, not driving the right rates and so are the inputs not right or the outputs not right is it in operations issue or is it a FP&A issue that\u2019s causing this because you can have one strike, two strikes, but doing it three times, one could imagine that there are other issues at play here than just the market in terms of how the data is coming in relative to your expectation and also what you put out to the street. And on the slight side, I don\u2019t think a 500 unit building sort of popped up overnight, It would be input that you would, so maybe other, I don\u2019t know if you want to take that, but sort of give some color around some of the processes and procedures that are going on.","David Santee","Well. I guess I would say that our process is very collaborative. These decisions are not made in a vacuum. There is probably six of us that run our models from different perspectives, but at the end of the day, we all kind of lined up in the same place. I think a lot of the volatility has been very quick and at very in opportune times. One of the things that makes it very difficult to forecast is when we look at the precipitous drop and new lease rents in San Francisco. And look, we\u2019ve had Boston, DC, all of these other markets have delivered outsized supply, but have relatively strong occupancy. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we were prepared for rents to go down. When you look at the new lease ups, if the new lease ups are giving one month free basically you can move into a brand new building at 2015 rent.","If new a lease up is giving two months free, you could move into a brand new building at 2014 rent. I think to some extent, we are a victim of our own success on the renewal side. When you look at San Francisco 35% of our expirations are almost 5% above current street rents and with volatility ranging from plus 2% to as much as down 10% at certain properties in San Francisco it really comes down to who moves out and at what property do they move out of. I mean at with rents down 10% a person could be 6% above current market rents, a 16% decline on $4,000 month rent and at times a couple 100, couple 300, each month for a couple of months winds down your revenue stream pretty quickly.","So I hope that gives you a little more granular explanation of why it is very difficult to predict \u2013the rate of decline that we can expect especially in the peak season where you have 15% of your leases expiring in June, July and August, each month. So extreme volatility, with the highest number of transactions in the year, with job growth really coming to a halt at the high end of the market, is just making it very difficult to forecast forward. New York is kind of in the same boat 45% of our expirations.","Michael Bilerman","You don\u2019t think it\u2019s an input issue for how you are managing your business in terms of, you know, that you\u2019re just sort of rolling with market. I think the market has come to expect that you have a little bit better insight into the day-to-day incident especially the time where you had to already lower guidance twice, one would imagine the second time you did it, one would hope that you\u2019ve built enough conservatism. I guess what I\u2019m really asking is the whole processes that you have in place off, right? Is it not producing what you wanted to produce? The markets going to do what the market's going to do you\u2019ve built some tools and you seem to be disproportionately having to play catch up a little bit. And so that's what I'm more curious is about the processes and procedures you have rather than what's happening in to the marketplace.","David Santee","Well. I guess I would say that our processes that we have in place especially at the top level, the company level, certainly worked with a lot of big numbers. Certainly I don't think with fixed markets today, that you would expect us to give or see us give guidance in October. I think that some of the \u2013 I mean basically I think that we were overly optimistic about San Francisco. And really just kind of mirrored at some point in time judgment has to come into play. But what's different also about California, is that California is a 30-day market. All of our other markets are 60-day market so you have a longer runway to see, who is giving notice. You have longer runway to react to pricing and what have you. And so this is, the San Francisco in the 30-day market with these dramatic changes within 30-days and is just very hard to forecast and very hard to react as quickly to adjust.","David Neithercut","Let me just add one thing there Michael, just general serve the philosophy we have with respect to this. Our intent every time is to give our investors our best guess as to how we see our business performing going forward. Not 90% of that best guess or 80% percent of that best guess, or 75% of the best guess but rather our best guess based upon the tools we have at our disposal, bills we have on the ground and the judgment of people who have been doing this for a awful long time. It's not intended to give you the range of all possible outcomes, but those outcomes that we think are most probable based upon the tools that we have in the judgment that we use. And as David said, these markets have turned to become quite volatile, it's become far more difficult to do that, but each step of the way we try and give you our best guess and again, whereas David said, we are as disappointed as anyone about where we are relative to where we ended up but, we believe we have an obligation to be as transparent with the Street as we can. And to give them our absolute best guess, not build in all sorts of cushion but to tell out like we see it. And we think we have done that every step of the way and it is just difficult to do so when things are moving and moving very quickly in markets that were budgeted to deliver 50% of our growth.","Michael Bilerman","Yes, okay. Thanks for the time.","David Santee","You\u2019re very welcome.","Operator","Now moving to our next question David Bragg, Green Street Advisors. Go ahead please.","David Bragg","Thank you. Good morning.","David Santee","Good morning, Dave.","David Bragg","You still have a reputation as an operator that can outperform or perform in-line with your comps in your markets. What can you share regarding how your portfolio is performing relative to your comps in your markets?","David Santee","Well, when you \u2013 if you want to talk, markets and submarket, I think if you look at San Francisco, we\u2019ve delivered a 9.9% CAGR over the last four or five years. I think if you look back over the last five years, I think all but one we had the highest revenue growth especially in San Francisco. You know, we \u2013 after every quarter, we kind of take our portfolio \u2013 because a lot of this is just about location, location, location, location. One of our competitors in Boston, they have fewer properties. We have many properties. We go through an exercise where we take our properties that are in, the two or three properties that are in the suburbs and the other two or three properties that are up North, and we look at our \u2013 we create a similar portfolio to our competitors.","And I would say that, every time we are very comfortable with our performance when we create similar portfolios to our competitors.","David Bragg","Thanks, David. So I think your investors are trying to discern the degree to which you are having forecasting versus execution challenges and you're saying that, as far as you can tell, there's no difference in the execution relative to that of your peers this year, than in the past. Is that fair?","David Santee","Yes. That is fair. And I would add a comment. In the case of San Francisco, I don't think it's, you know any surprise or secret, that some of our competitors, have agreed or self-imposed renewal limits. Where we have not done that. That is also been a key driver of our leading the market in San Francisco for the last four, five years. But at the same time, when you reach an inflection point and the market comes down very quickly, we're going to come down just as quick and we\u2019re going to come down much harder than our competitors.","So, again, I \u2013 we will go through this exercise again after everyone reports. And we will matchup our head to head properties with theirs. And like previous years, I expect that our execution will prove to be very good.","David Bragg","Okay. Thank you for that. And a question for David Neithercut, what are your thoughts \u2013 how does this experience so far this year inform you\u2019re thinking on your strategy? Are the markets and submarkets that you're in truly as high barrier as you believed? And they\u2019re clearly priced in the private market for superior NOI growth, which at least over the near-term is not what was expected. To what extent is the transaction market for these assets weakening along with the fundamentals?","David Neithercut","Well. I think they might be priced for superior total return over extended time period. And I just simply the NOI growth in the short-term. I'd say the assets in these markets continue to trade at very low cap rate stage with three handles. In some instances even through a three handle there continues to be perhaps not as much demand, but certainly sufficient demand for these hard assets that in these Gateway cities that we've not seen any change in value at least for the present time. Now there may be because there might be fewer tours and potentially fewer buyers, maybe did ask spreads widening in certain instances, but the transaction that we are seeing getting done in the market in which we operate that continues to support the valuations that we've been talking about.","Just with respect to strategy, I think we've gone in with our eyes wide open that by operating in fewer markets were likely to have more volatility. But again, we think these are the markets that are going to create jobs and these are the markets where people are going to want to live, work and play and they\u2019ll perform best over the long-term. As David noted, we've had 10% compounded annual growth rate in San Francisco over the past five years. If it was flat jobs \u2013 flat revenue growth for the next five, over 10 years it would still be 4.5 which is very, very strong revenue growth.","So we remain very committed to the markets we are in. We think that again these are the place where the economy going forward will drive and that we\u2019ll see better overall risk adjusted total returns in these markets. We've seen construction costs continue to go up in these markets and replacement costs going up. But I guess I'd also say that in these markets, while there is elevated or more supply than we\u2019ve seen in the past as a percentage of existing inventory, these are troubling amounts of new supply and in a historical context, unprecedented levels of new supply. So it's more than we\u2019ve seen, it's disrupting us somewhat but a governance by just our lease ups particularly in San Francisco that you\u2019ve gone extraordinarily well, demand is there.","And we couldn't be happy with the product we\u2019re delivering and will outperform our original expectations and we think we are in the right place for a long-term perspective.","David Bragg","Okay. Thank you for that. One last one if I may, in light of the underperformance of the stock and the fact that it's discounted on an absolute basis and cheaper than its peer set or cheaper than it's ever been, versus its peer set, can you update us on what you can do proactively to attempt to narrow the discount between the private and public market values? What are you evaluating or thinking about doing in terms of asset sales or joint ventures?","David Neithercut","I guess we\u2019re selling almost $7 billion of product of this year and returning a significant amount of that back to our shareholders in the leverage neutral basis. So I'm not sure there's anybody who's done more this year than we have in that regard. But I guess as I've said, too many of our investors that [indiscernible] and have said repeatedly, I mean everything is on the table. We are up-to-date painfully aware of where the stock price trades relative to those values. And we'll pursue and consider everything. I\u2019d just would reiterate what I think I've said on our last call and certainly as evidenced by the gains that we\u2019ve realized on those assets that we've sold as part of this larger process. We've got significant gains in almost everything we\u2019ve owned. I think we\u2019ve been very good capital allocators and we made a lot of money.","And as a result of that, by the time after one looks at the gains of assets and run those things on the balance sheet repo basis, if things went off on a lot of asset sales to have any real impact on stock buybacks. So it's just been more challenging than what I think many investors might think. But everything is always on the table and will look at everything between now and the end of the year.","David Bragg","Thank you.","David Neithercut","You\u2019re welcome, David.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019re now moving to next caller Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Rich Hightower","Hey good morning, guys. Thanks for taking\u2026","David Neithercut","Good morning, Rich.","Rich Hightower","So I wanted to hit on David Nethercutt\u2019s comment earlier on the probable outcome versus the range of outcomes with respect to guidance. So specifically on the topic of the range of outcome, how bad you think San Francisco and\/or New York could actually get? And then, I don't believe this was actually answered earlier, but does the guidance as it currently stands build in some cushion against current trends as you described them or as it simply a extrapolated what you are seeing in the market currently?","David Santee","Well, this is David Santee. Someone asked me could New York, be negative? It\u2019s certainly possible. I mean we are focused more on this year. We certainly have as I noted in my comments, we are already seeing a lot of the marketing employees in New York, one private company is offering a $1,000 gift card on any rental. So we are just kind of playing off there at knowing that we were kind of forced to use can set upfront concessions in Q1 in New York. Knowing that the level of supply that's still in Lisa, knowing what's coming next year \u2013 we have built-in what we think are necessary levels of concessions or commissions or what have you to get us through the end of the year.","Rich Hightower","Okay. And the same would apply in San Francisco?","David Santee","Yes, we really haven't seen a lot of the marketing items or move-in concessions, for that matter are in the legacy portfolio. I mean the only concessions that we have seen thus far, are on the new lease ups. And I think people are rushing to get these buildings filled. Whether it's because they have occupancy requirements by their lender or a variety of other reasons. But we really haven't seen anything out of the ordinary other than rapidly declining new lease rents and less demand on the older type property.","Rich Hightower","Okay. Thanks, David. And one quick question on the demand side of the equation, so and it's not something unique to what EQR is doing this quarter. But it does seem that there has been a shift in tone or shift in the data perhaps with respect to tech sector job growth or wage growth or both. Would you say that is a material shift in what you're seeing in your tenant base or perspective tenant base versus three or six months ago?","David Santee","Absolutely. I mean if you look at the data, first it was, DC funding. Then your tech jobs, the high-paying tech jobs peaked in Q1 of 2016. I just read the other day, DC spending was down another 20% in Q2. So certainly, the tech jobs are not growing at the pace that they were last year. If they are growing at all. But at the same time folks that lived in a 30-year-old, two-story walk-up paying you know, $3,000 for a one bedroom, can move uptown into a brand-new, highly amenitized, glass tower with gorgeous views of the San Francisco Bay for about the same money.","So the people that can afford it are moving into the better properties, but then there's less demand for the older properties as a result the further you get down the peninsula as a result of a lower job growth in the tech sector.","Rich Hightower","All right. Thanks, David.","David Santee","Thank you, Rich.","Operator","And now, Nick Yulico with UBS. Please go ahead.","Nick Yulico","Thanks, everyone. Just going back to the visibility question. I'm wondering as we were now almost through seven months of the year in a lot of the prime leasing season, can you quantify how much of the year's revenue results are sort of baked in and not at risk. Assuming you don't have a meaningful occupancy problem. I mean is it 60% or is it something higher? Can you give us some visibility into August and September at this point. So I'm trying to figure out, with all debate out, may be what happens in 2017. How much debate is a really left about what could happen in 2016 versus your guidance?","David Santee","Well, and that's a great question. Because over the last, six, seven years we've kind of always said, once you get to August or September that your year is really baked. And if we look back, the last six or seven years, all of the markets really had the same momentum, I mean all of the markets went down in the great recession. And then all of the markets kind of came up together. During those years, you really had virtually no new supply to speak of. So it was very easy to forecast just based on momentum.","Certainly when you get to August, the rate portion that drives revenue growth in the current year is baked. I mean, those there's just not enough transactions remaining in the year to meaningfully impact the full year revenue. But what can meaningfully change your revenue September, October, November, December is certainly occupancy and more importantly concessions. Because as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, if we give a full month concession, that's an 8% discount that we take a full charge on in that month. So if concessions \u2013 upfront concessions really ramp up, which we are not a fan of where we tried to be a net effective rent shop. Then that will seriously impact your revenue stream, in that month and for the next that couple of months.","Nick Yulico","So obviously \u2013 I don't know if you gave this or not, I think you may have given just it for New York and San Francisco but where is sort of overall occupancy in the portfolio as of today?","David Santee","Overall occupancy today, I think is 95.9. And some of these markets like Boston is a little lower because Boston is a heavy student oriented market. But occupancies and SoCal are great, probably a little bit better than we expected. Washington DC's occupancy is right where we thought it would be. Seattle is doing great and accelerating. So again physical occupancy is not necessarily the driver of revenue. A dollar \u2013 assuming, occupancy is worth $1, occupancy in San Francisco is worth $1.50, right? Versus a point of occupancy in Inland Empire might be worth $0.75. Physical occupancy does not necessarily translate into economic occupancy.","Nick Yulico","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess David Neithercut or Mark Parrell, how much room is sort of left to do more asset sales this year from a tax standpoint special dividend standpoint, if you wanted to do a stock buyback \u2013 I mean, at what point does the board start thinking about doing something more strategic about a stock buyback is it a period of several quarters for the stock to really trade at a discount of [indiscernible] or I mean how should we sort of think about that from a timing standpoint.","David Neithercut","I just have you and I\u2019ve already mentioned this Nick. Everything is always on the table. We consider these things and will be very thoughtful about what it is, what our options are to deal with the disconnect between the stock price and to NAV. But again as I served in response to some are the brighter questions, it's challenging with the gains that we had that we realized and having been pretty good capital allocators over the past dozen years to be able to really move the meter in a huge way. But there's no timing thing, it's just something that we we'll consider and we can be believes on the table all the time. ","Nick Yulico","Okay. Thanks, everyone.","David Santee","You\u2019re welcome, Nick.","Operator","And now we\u2019ll hear from Jeff Pehl with Goldman Sachs.","Jeff Pehl","Hi, good morning.","David Santee","Good morning.","Jeff Pehl","Just a follow-up on a question on performance, how do you think A assets performing versus B assets, and are there any markets were B asset to outperforming is? ","David Santee","Well. I've always said its kind of location. I mean yes, we own A assets. We own B assets, the B assets and D, C are you doing the same as A assets. We don't see any difference. I mean if you look at our portfolio in San Francisco o or New York, you run the gamut of A's and B's and they are performing differently depending upon where are the new supply as on the demand for that product in the location that they sell. ","Jeff Pehl","Great, thanks. And just another quick one, can you provide an update on the amount of new move out to purchase a home?","David Santee","Yes. It's really negligible. So bought homes move out to buy homes this year is actually year-to-date, is down 20 basis points, of that 12.1% of move out. ","Jeff Pehl","Great. Thanks for the color. ","David Santee","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Rob Stevenson with Janney. Go ahead please.","Rob Stevenson","Good morning, guys. ","David Santee","Hi, Rob.","Rob Stevenson","So you previously talked about the deliveries in Manhattan being Westside just heavy this year along with some of the other submarkets, but then when we got to 17, it was mostly Long Island City and Brooklyn. It sounded like today, you through the Westside in there again. Is that a change are seeing now when you are looking at those likely 17 deliveries? Are you seeing more in Manhattan especially on the Westside then you have been you would have seen three or six months ago.","David Santee","I think what \u2013 well, first of all, we are now kind of combining the upper Westside with Midtown West when we talk about new supply. So Midtown West, and upper Westside are going to be delivering probably 2,400 units Next year, which relative to the overall supply is what 15%. I think the concern is that we do have some very large deliveries that occurred early in the year in the upper Westside, 1,100 unit property that is still only 50% leased. That\u2019s going to start running into renewals before they are least up. While at the same time adding a little more supply will kind of compound the rate challenges that we see in Midtown West and the upper Westside. But the upper Westside, specifically as a neighborhood is only expected to deliver 2,000 \u2013 I'm sorry 214 units into 17. ","Rob Stevenson","Okay. So it's really Midtown West that still going to see the supply within Manhattan in 17?","David Santee","Yes. ","David Neithercut","As well as continued lease up in 17 and product delivered in 16. ","David Santee","Yes. ","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And then one for Mark, the difference \u2013 the $0.07 gap between the third quarter guidance between NAREIT FFO and core FFO or Normalized FFO, what is that?","Mark Parrell","So I\u2019m sorry, you're talking about the difference in our guidance change or the difference between\u2026","Rob Stevenson","So you got 82 to 86 range for NAREIT FFO and is 75 to 79 for Normalized FFO. What is the difference between 82 to 75 and 86 to 79? ","Mark Parrell","So we have some land sale gains, but we really have their as Fort Lewis. And then the third quarter that $0.07 is going to be some land sale gains.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. So Fort Lewis and land sale gains makes up that $0.07 differential? ","David Santee","I want to correct that. The $0.14 to the last two columns is Fort Lewis. To the right the $0.07 you referenced are the land sale gain. ","Rob Stevenson","Okay. So there's $0.07 of land sale gains in the third quarter? ","David Santee","That are projected. Sales haven\u2019t all occurred. They may not. But that\u2019s what we would expect based on what we have under contract now. ","Rob Stevenson","Okay, perfect. Thanks, guys. ","Operator","Now, we\u2019ll move to Tayo Okusanya. Please go ahead, with Jefferies.","Tayo Okusanya","Yes. Hi, good morning. I'm just trying to reconcile the new guidance versus the old. The midpoint of guidance when it comes down $0.02, but just from the comments \u2013 kind of talk about the $0.06 loss from NOI and then the $0.01 gain from the delay in the asset sales. That's about $0.05 of downside. So I'm wondering why the midpoint of guidance really went down $0.02.","Mark Parrell","Hey Tayo, it\u2019s Mark Parrell. Absolutely rightful question, the issue there is that we sort of started from a point that's higher than our midpoint. So when we talk back in February about our guidance we put out a wider, you might recall Normalized FFO range than usually a $0.20 range.","We told we had more variability in our numbers because we had all of disposition activity and we didn't know when it would occur and obviously the later it occurred, the higher FFO would be in the earlier more we de-risk the special dividend. But we really didn't have all of that and certainty, we also did know when we would paying special. What debt we pay off. There's just a lot of moving pieces. So when we put our range together, and we spoke to you in February, we spoke to you in April, we saw on our range a way in which we could get modestly above the midpoint of our range and into the upper half of our old range. If we sold our assets relatively slowly. And so we gave ourselves a little flexibility.","As our operating conditions deteriorated as we became more certain about what debt we are paying off, when we're going pay the specials and what assets are going to be sold, that what caused the whole thing to gravitate down. So the map is actually like $0.06 down on same-store, $0.01 up on transaction. But I\u2019m starting from a higher point in the 310 you are.","Tayo Okusanya","Got it, okay. That makes sense. Thank you.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","David Santee","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Go ahead please.","Alexander Goldfarb","Good morning, there. Just I\u2019d some quick questions here. David Santee, you had mentioned New York that you expect supply to extend through 2018, just in general, looking across all your markets including San Francisco, when do you think \u2013 do you see the current supply wave continuing to be an issue through 2018? Or do think that maybe by mid-17, based on what you're seeing most of the market should have everything absorbed?","David Santee","Well, for New York I guess its kind of a good news, bad news. I mean there is still not a 421 A program in place. So nothing is being really considered today. But we're looking at roughly 14,000 units [indiscernible] in New York for 2017, and I believe another 14,000 again in 2018.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And what about the other markets? You have San Francisco? What will be the other markets?","David Santee","Yes, I mean San Francisco is going to deliver 7,000 units next year. Next year is going to be a very similar delivery cycle as we saw this year. Let's see \u2013 Washington, D.C., 10,000 this year, 9,000 in 2017; Seattle, 70 to 80 this year, about 7,000 next year; Los Angeles, 9,000 this year, 8,800 next year; Orange County, 3,900 this year, 5,400 next year; then San Diego, 1,600 this year, 2,700 next year.","But I think it's important to note that as an example Orange County, a lot of the deliveries that are occurring this year are in North Orange, Anaheim, where we have no product versus last year all of the deliveries were centered in Irvine, where the bulk of our properties sit and we were greatly impacted. So we're seeing great results in Orange County as the result of the supply \u2013 the new deliveries being in a totally different submarket and far away from our existing portfolio.","David Neithercut","But I'd say beyond that Alex our expectations as for deliveries to come down are being built to yields that we are seeing markets today are extremely low. And we certainly understand that the lending community is becoming much more conservative with respect to advance rates and who they\u2019re willing to sponsor. And I hear more and more \u2013 transaction team is seeing more and more inquiries about capital needs for developers who might have land tied up to complete the capital stack et cetera. So our expectation is just given to where our built to yields are today and what we understanding and we are seeing what\u2019s happening in the construction loan market are \u2013 we will expect the deliveries to come down from new 16% and 17% levels.","Alexander Goldfarb","Right. But what you guys have just outlined, it just sounds like collectively we've got another sort of full year through end of 2017 to get through the supply before we\u2019ll get to the benefit of the tighter lending standards. Is that seems to be a\u2026","David Santee","Yes, I think that's right. But again as we look at what these unit counts are as a percentage of the additional stock, these are again not unquestionable levels. We believe our levels might put these markets for some period of time more in equilibrium after they have been [indiscernible] equilibrium over the past half a dozen years.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then for Mark Parrell, if we look at the sequential San Francisco revenue and rent growth, second quarter versus first quarter, there\u2019s still positive growth for San Francisco in its physical rental rate and in the revenue growth? Should we expect \u2013 based on the comments, should we expect these numbers to go negative in the back half of the year or just because how much you\u2019ve already locked in for the year, these numbers will actually still stay positive despite the commentary you discussed?","Mark Parrell","I want to have the clarifying question. Do you mean quarter-over-quarter do we expect to have a negative NOI number in the third or fourth quarter? Or do you mean our sequential revenue numbers?","Alexander Goldfarb","The sequential \u2013 on a linked quarter basis not a year-over-year basis.","Mark Parrell","I think it will be slightly positive the whole way through. You probably would see it and it wouldn\u2019t be unexpected to see declines in the fourth quarter than the first just as you sort of see the normal seasonal pattern. But you're talking about this year. I guess at this point we don't see that.","David Neithercut","None of us.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. So really next year we're going to see the bulk of this softness in next year's numbers?","Mark Parrell","What is given the 2017 values, then yes, that\u2019s probably likely.","Alexander Goldfarb","Awesome. Listen, thanks a lot guys.","David Neithercut","You're welcome.","Operator","We have John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","John Kim","Thank you. Given your portfolio quality you underweight affordable product in your portfolio, is that something that you think needs to be addressed? Not necessarily different market, but maybe different product or different submarket.","Mark Parrell","Well, I think I\u2019m not sure, by affordably you just mean lesser Christ more workforces by pricing or you actually mean product that has requirements to meet certain income restriction or requirements of residents? I will tell you that we \u2013 as David Santee already said, we do operate in A product quality, we operate in B product quality across our portfolio and we do have various price points across every market and some market in which we operate.","John Kim","Okay. And then David Neithercut, you mentioned the challenge of moving the needle with buybacks. But so far you\u2019ve done no credit from the market on your special dividend and your asset build a huge gain. Going forward on dispositions, would you consider joint issue asset sales, which may provide some more flexibility on proceeds?","David Neithercut","That\u2019s certainly something we considered on the table as well.","John Kim","Is there are difference in pricing on joint ventures versus complete asset sales.","David Neithercut","Different in pricing? No, I think that, I think that there is sufficient price discovery in these markets that whether it\u2019s an outright sale or a joint venture type transaction, I think similar pricing can be achieved.","John Kim","Great. Thank you.","David Neithercut","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And [indiscernible] with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, thanks for the time. I was just hoping you could clarify some comments you made about San Francisco concessions. Were you saying that there\u2019s no concessions on your existing product and relates only at the new sort of lease up developments and is that true outside of EQR.","David Santee ","I would say that I know there are some people that are giving modest concessions. But it\u2019s \u2013 they are not widespread. I mean, the \u2013 all of the new developments for the most part are giving kind of at a minimum one if not two months free on every lease. But we have \u2013 we have not seen widespread upfront move-in concessions across, you know, existing product in San Francisco.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Great. Thank you. And just a question on, on your redevelopment CapEx, kind of rehab work that you\u2019re doing, I think you\u2019re targeting $50 million. Is there any \u2013 I\u2019m not sure what returns you\u2019re targeting there, but is there any risk that you may not get the returns given the supply competition in the markets where that money is maybe being spent? And how should we think about that?","Mark Parrell","For as our expectations in underwriting goes $11,000 or so per door that we put into kitchen and bath rehabs, we\u2019re getting solid double-digit returns. I mean our returns on that \u2013 in that expenditure. And should we fail to get that reasonable sort of spread in to an un-rehabed, we have the ability to stop the program. So we do monitor that closely. Consistently looking at the returns we\u2019re getting on rehab units and if for whatever reason at any time, if were not getting those premium we can stop that program on a dime.","Unidentified Analyst","Is there a geographic skew to where that spend is going?","Mark Parrell","No. I mean where doing it in any property and any market that we believe can get that sale appropriate mid-teen return.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Mark Parrell","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And next we hear from Ivy Zelman with Zelman and Associates.","Ivy Zelman","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions.","David Neithercut","Good morning. ","Ivy Zelman","With regard looking \u2013 good morning with the turnover if I\u2019m correct is a annualized turnover of 59.2 which was up about 280 basis points I guess versus our expectations for 150. So it was a little more than we had expected and recognizing turnover has been pretty low throughout the last few years. With respect to understanding the expenses, as turnover accelerates, how much are you factoring in our guidance for turn over to be sustained at current levels and how much variability does that have on NOI with respect to turnover accelerating more? And maybe you know maybe in the case it has been in the less several quarters or even last few years?","David Neithercut","Well I guess I would say, a large portion of the increase in the physical turnover is a direct result of more people relocating in the same property for a variety of reasons. They either need more space, less space, lost a roommate \u2013 so in those cases, I mean, the frictional cost are you know, roughly $234 to clean, paint and shampoo an apartment. And you\u2019re not \u2013 you\u2019re not giving up any vacancy costs for that portion of your physical move out so to speak. So you know, like anything \u2013 the largest cost of turnover is vacancy. And when you net out the turnover, you know, it\u2019s not really that material. We have seen an elevated","Ivy Zelman","No, I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s really helpful. I was trying to say on a go forward basis, so you\u2019re assuming sort of the same level of turnover, kind of holding where we are to extrapolate no real change in guidance on turnover. Or in your embedded assumptions for your guidance.","David Neithercut","No. No change.","Ivy Zelman","And then just secondly I think everyone has drilled a lot into San Francisco and New York city and you guys have done a great job in helping us understand the variability and respective volatility you have seen in the highest peak leasing fees. And I\u2019m kind of just thinking about looking at the ratio of you know, 2014 and 2015 urban multi-family permits as a percent of stock and Boston is screening the high second-highest after New York. And you obviously have exposure there as well Seattle and LA. Just thinking about how do you today extrapolate in, especially\u2019s Seattle you said is accelerating and recognizing that you are seeing improvement and really haven\u2019t seen same type of volatility in DC even if also screening not as badly as New York, let\u2019s say Boston. When you\u2019re giving us guidance, are you extrapolating the current trend like you had been in the guidance earlier in the year. And unfortunately so that volatility. Or are you being more conservative now because the supply hasn\u2019t become automatic or created volatility in the downside. You know have learned from that and you are saying we are going to more cautious even if those markets are extrapolating, we could extrapolate positively?","David Santee","Yes. So, there\u2019s a lot of questions there.","Ivy Zelman","Sorry.","David Santee","Let me just use Boston as an example. So we know that, you know 2016 as an example we\u2019re delivering 2,300 units in Boston. The good news is, is that a lot of those units are now in the suburbs. And I think on our last call we said that we have, you know this 12 to 18 month window where, you know 2017 deliveries kind of moved back into the urban core, the Seaport, what have you \u2013 so that\u2019s why were seeing better revenue growth in Boston. You know, even though we delivered 5,000 units in 2015 in the urban core. We were still able to hold occupancy at 96%, new lease rents were flat. And we were still able to get renewal increases. And you know, that\u2019s kind of the \u2013 what we\u2019ve experienced, you know over the years is that, you know, even though these you know, the markets that were in today, you can still deliver product, hold the occupancy, but feel the rate pressure. ","And then when \u2013 the new deliveries move away from you, you start to get pricing power back. And I think, you know, that\u2019s \u2013 I think were just kind of in the middle or the beginning stages of getting to that \u2013 that point in San Francisco and New York. You know, but again, it\u2019s kind of the mix of jobs and where the deliveries are. So you mentioned Seattle, I mean Seattle is delivering \u2013I think they delivered 6,000 units \u2013 5,000 units last year. So we have to get deliveries in 2014, the occupancy continues to hold, we\u2019ve continued to be able to push rents. You know we expected in Seattle that we would see, pricing pressure in Belltown, central business district, Capitol Hill but now we\u2019re seeing, revenue actually accelerate in those markets as we begin to absorb. So it\u2019s just the combination of jobs, level of absorption, and the relative location of the new supply.","Ivy Zelman","That\u2019s extremely helpful. I guess just to summarize if I may respectfully, so then with the current footprint with the exception of New York and San Francisco, you would argue that you are still optimistic with respect to the go forward deliveries and utilizing what you see today currently in the guidance you given us. You haven\u2019t cut those markets despite them being \u2013 may be much better even than you had been modeling. So you\u2019re utilizing the similar pattern to expect that those markets will continue to be where they are today.","David Santee","No.","Ivy Zelman","Okay, okay.","David Santee","Look, right. And I think we\u2019ve said to previously, that you know, all these markets are generally on track. They are either you know, a tick below or a tick above. But there\u2019s nothing material in these other markets that would cause us to be you know overly optimistic or overly pessimistic. They are what they are. They are right on track and we\u2019ve kind of left them there for the rest of the year.","Ivy Zelman","That\u2019s very helpful. If I could sneak in one more and again thank you so much for taking my question. The last one relates to just where cap rates are and I think David Neithercut you talked about the tightness of the transaction market despite the fundamentals that might be in the margin starting to moderate. If you think about where I guess directionally if you think cap rates are going to go, assuming rates are holding constant, do you expect the fundamental to start writing out, seeing more opportunities especially at the capital market, may not be or the banks are pulling back and being more stringent. What\u2019s your thought and outlook on cap rate?","David Neithercut","Well it is not just cap rates, it is results and valuations too, right \u2013 ultimate valuations. I mean one of the things we done as we\u2019ve seen this new supply coming is to reduce our own construction upstarts. Well we are delivering a lot of product now but we\u2019ve got very little of anything kind of behind that. And it is very possible that we might see and I\u2019ll use the term loosely, opportunities to acquire assets in these markets. We think valuations are pretty solid. Depending on what happens to interest rates and global interest rates and demand for yield. We know where cap rates might go on extremely good quality, well located assets in the kind gateway cities that we\u2019re in.","One reason we reduced our development business is because where we saw yields going and we saw new supply and we thought it may be a better deal for us to maybe buy completed assets rather than build our own just given the amount of supply that was coming. But it remains to be seen where cap rates certain and where values are headed.","Ivy Zelman","Great, good luck, guys. Thank you.","David Neithercut","Thanks very much Ivy.","Operator","And now we\u2019ll hear from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao","Hey everyone. Just going back to San Francisco and New York for a second. We\u2019ve talked a lot about them obviously. But as far as the decline in the outlook for those two markets, we talked about rate after August not being as big a factor of occupancy and concession is bigger. But I guess San Francisco not seeing concession today. Are you building in any increase or is that just the assumption that concession levels will stay similar and that in New York same thing you are seeing concessions there. But are you projecting any change in the level of concessions over the back half.","David Santee","We\u2019re not forecasting any concessions in the back half. I guess what I would say is that we, we\u2019ve accounted in San Francisco, we\u2019ve accounted for that with 100 basis point spread in occupancy. So if occupancy comes down far enough, then we would \u2013 or if we see occupancy going in the wrong direction, we would use concessions to boost occupancy up. And that higher occupancy kind of would offset any concessions that we would \u2013 that we would need to offer. But we\u2019ve really just factored the net effective new lease pricing for the balance of the year in San Francisco.","Vincent Chao","Okay. And then net effect will be similar to what you are seeing in July and August I guess?","David Santee","If not a little lower.","Vincent Chao","Okay, thanks.","David Santee","You are welcome.","Operator","And now we\u2019ll take a question from Tom Lesnick with Capital One Securities.","Tom Lesnick","Thanks for taking my questions. First on development and peers like you guys moved up to stabilization dates on a lot of your developments this and 99 in particular over the last quarter. Is that due to the concessions you are offering right now. It feels kind of counterintuitive to the narrative that the Bay Area development leasing is slowing?","David Santee","Actually we said nothing close to lease up in development long. Our absorption and our transactions in San Francisco have exceeded our expectations and we have significantly moved up the stabilization [indiscernible] because our absorption there was almost doubled what our real expectations were. And we were looking at 20 or so a month and we have been doing almost 26 a month. No one thought that would necessarily continue which is why it took us so long to change that stabilization date. But were moving right along there and I\u2019ll tell you that we been doing that with concessions of two weeks to one month. And again at rent stand above our pro forma expectations but maybe modestly below what we might have hope we would do at the beginning of this year.","So the absorption of our San Francisco transactions have been strong and the lease rates have \u2013 exceeded our regional expectations and so the deals were stabilized at yields ahead of what we had originally underwritten.","Tom Lesnick","Okay. Thanks for that insight. And then getting away from New York and San Francisco for a moment. Let me\u2026","David Santee ","Thank you.","Tom Lesnick","Feel like right now is the right time for 100 K Street. There has been a lot of development in there lately what do you feel like right now is the time to strike?","David Santee","Well because we\u2019re delivering 18 and stabilize in 19. And we\u2019re seeing improvements in the market. That product has been absorbed. David talked about it maybe modestly performing better above we had hoped. And we think, you know, who knows what 18 and 19 will bring? But we think there\u2019s not a lot starting now and that will be a fine time in that marketplace to deliver new product.","Tom Lesnick","All right. Thanks, guys.","David Santee","And again at $88 million deposits not going to either one way or the other Tom.","Tom Lesnick","Makes sense. Thanks again.","David Santee","You bet.","Operator","Now we\u2019ll hear from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Market.","Wes Golladay","Good morning, guys. When we talk about Northern California what do you see in the various submarket there. I imagine, Berkeley, Michigan Bay are probably the hardest hit. Give your high level do you have ever work in the region, anything hanging in there?","David Santee","Yes. So I\u2019ll just kind of go major submarket in San Francisco. And talk about kind of where rents are today relative to same week last year. We have Berkeley, which is more student driven, it was only down 0.5%. Obviously San Francisco, proper is down 5.4%, which is actually bolstered by one property when you look at Geary Courtyard, SoMa, those are kind of ground zero where the new deliveries are. Those are down 11.5%, 8% on rents. East Bay is still flat. East Bay continues to hold up relatively well. The Peninsula, we have some new deliveries there that are more attractive to Millennials. Those rents are down about 5% and then South Bay, which is really put a lot of new deliveries behind it, is down 2%.","Wes Golladay","Okay, and thanks a lot for that, excellent color. And then looking at the fast leasing pace for your San Francisco development, how does that \u2013 you mentioned [indiscernible]. Are just pulling from other communities based on what you\u2019re seeing from the application of new renters?","David Santee","Yes, I think \u2013 what David had commented earlier, we\u2019ve got the ability people to sort of move from older products \u2013 the first wave of new supply that\u2019s been delivered in San Francisco in years. And people have the ability to move across into newer product, that you know if not modestly more around the same they were paying for lesser quality products. So we just sort of seeing \u2013 our tenant base have had more options than we been seeing them move to our properties from elsewhere in the area.","Wes Golladay","Okay and would you characterize that as coming from maybe the other cities or the East Bay or is it mainly within the 3 mile to 5 mile radius where you\u2019re getting most of the movements from?","David Santee","Do know the answer to that question David? We\u2019d certainly would have that but in the system but we don\u2019t have that at our fingertips.","Wes Golladay","Okay. I\u2019ll follow-up with you. Thanks a lot for taking the question.","David Santee","Thanks, thank you.","Operator","And now we\u2019ll take some follow-up questions. One from David Bragg, Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","David Bragg","Thanks again. Just to review your market level, revenue growth expectations. It would be helpful to hear about the other markets. I think you said you\u2019re currently expecting 6.5% same-store revenue growth from San Francisco, 1.5% in New York. I assume that these figures underpin the midpoint of your revenue growth guidance and if that\u2019s correct if you could just run through the other markets.","David Santee","Yes. Boston 2.8%, New York, we said 1.5%, Washington D.C 1.2%, Seattle 6.1%, Orange County 5.8%, San Diego 5.7%.","David Bragg","Thank you, for that. And then next, in the second quarter for the entire portfolio, what were the gains on renewals and what were the gains on new move-ins, ideally lease-over-lease?","David Santee","Okay, lease-over-lease renewal pricing for Q2 was 5.9%. Lease-over-lease on new move-ins was 1.5% and then combined, was 3.7%.","David Bragg","Okay. And then can you tell us what you\u2019re expecting for the portfolio on those two metrics for 3Q and 4Q?","David Santee","Yes, I would have to give you ranges. But you know I see renewals moderating down to call it, four to five. And then new lease \u2013 new move-ins, I mean obviously new move-ins, because of the seasonality they just automatically compress. So as an example, Q1 of 2015, we did 40 basis points. So I would imagine in Q4 of 2015, we did minus 40 basis points. So it\u2019s just the natural cycle, I would expect them to fall off the balance of the year. To what degree is really just a function of, again going back to that who moved, which resident moves out and at what property.","David Bragg","Okay so no specific range on new move-ins. But the renewals is 4% to 5% range and that compares to what looks like about 6.5% on renewals in the second half of last year? Is that correct?","David Santee","Renewals, yes, 15 renewals were 6.8% and Q4 renewals were 6.4%.","David Bragg","Okay. One last one for you David Santee, on this topic, you\u2019ve experienced a dramatic widening in the spread between new move-ins and renewals in San Francisco, how long can that persist, especially in this day and age when there\u2019s such great visibility on where new units are being priced in the market?","David Santee","Let me answer your question this way. San Francisco, in July, we achieved an 8%. We are issuing new renewals kind of in the October range at a 5.8%. So we issued in July 11.1%. In October we are issuing a 5.8% if that kind of gives you what you need.","David Neithercut","And we achieved 9% in the first half of the year.","David Santee","Right, right.","David Bragg","Okay. So the renewal gains are declining or decelerating in [indiscernible] more or less with new move-ins. The spread is remaining somewhat the same sounds like.","David Santee","Well I guess what I would say is that, obviously, we are at a juncture where we need to, it\u2019s in our best interest to retain every resident possible. Because we have a 40% chance that we could take a 15% drop on the new rent, every time one of those residents move out. So we\u2019re consciously being conservative on our issuance of renewal increases from this point forward.","So hopefully, I mean the spread has gone from the typical 180 up to 350, 400 basis points. Hopefully, as we issue more market friendly renewal increases, that the spreads will compress back down to 180 if not lower.","David Bragg","All right, thank you again.","David Santee","You bet Dave.","Operator","And Nick Joseph, Citigroup. Go ahead, please.","Nick Joseph","Thanks, one last quick one. Given your experience this year and the more uncertain operating environment that we\u2019ve been talking about, are you planning on providing preliminary 2017 same-store revenue growth guidance with Q3 results?","David Santee","Well, we haven\u2019t made any decision about that, Nick. My guess is the experience we\u2019ve had this past year, I\u2019m sure most people here would not like to do that. Just given the volatility. If we feel like we could give a number that we believe is valid and helpful, we\u2019ll certainly consider it. But I think with this, given the level of volatility we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re not sure that would be in anyone\u2019s best interest at the present time but no decision has been made.","Nick Joseph","Thanks.","Operator","And now we\u2019ll take the question from Richard Hill, Morgan Stanley. And Mr. Hill your line is open please un-mute it if you have muted. I\u2019m hearing no response from that line. I will turn the call back over to your host for any closing or additional remarks.","David Neithercut","Thank you. Thank you all for your time today. I hope you all have great remaining part of the summer and we look forward to seeing many of you in September.","Operator","And with that, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your call for today.

The Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to David Neithercut.","David Neithercut","Thanks, Marty. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us for today\u2019s call.","We\u2019re extremely pleased with the Company\u2019s operating performance to date as we move towards the tail end of our primary leasing season. Because continued strong demand across the board for rental housing and the relentless attention to customer service delivered each and every day by our outstanding property management teams, combined maintained very high levels of occupancy and record setting resident retention that have enabled us to now expect to deliver growth in same-store revenue towards the high end of our original expectations.","With elevated levels of new supply across our markets this year, we had prepared ourselves for modest reductions in occupancy and weaker growth, but it was going to be a -- because it was going to be a very competitive marketplace for new prospective residents and our existing residents, we have a lot of options from which to choose when their lease would come up for renewal. Yet very deep and resilient demand for apartment living in our urban and highly walkable suburban markets continues to be the story.","And here, to take you into greater detail is our recently promoted Chief Operating Officer, Michael Manelis.","Michael Manelis","Thank you, David.","So, similar to the trend we discussed on the last call, the overall demand for our product remains strong through the leasing, despite the elevated supply. Our team\u2019s ability to execute along with continued job growth has put us in a position to exceed expected revenue results for this quarter and increase our full year revenue growth expectations to 2.1%. New York and San Francisco are driving the majority of the overall guidance increase. For the second quarter, we reported 96.2% occupancy. Our new lease change was up 1.4%, and achieved renewal increases were up 4.7%. All three of these metrics were above our original expectations.","I\u2019d like to take a minute and recognize our on-site teams. Renewing our residents in the pace of elevated supply has been the team\u2019s number one goal. Not only did they deliver a 4.7% achieved increase on renewal, but they also managed to reduce turnover again to 13.4% for the quarter, while increasing our overall resident satisfaction, the highest levels we have seen in the history of our Company.","In addition to being the lowest turnover percent that we have ever reported in the second quarter, when you net out on-site transfers that is residents who are moving to a new unit within the same community, this number drops another 150 basis points to 11.9%. Their ability to deliver remarkable service to our residents is an inspiration to all of us here, and I can\u2019t tell you how proud I\u2019m of all of them.","So, now, onto the markets. Let\u2019s start with Boston. Gains and occupancy, 20 basis-point revenue boost from parking income and a continued ability of the market to absorb the new supply has given us the confidence to increase our full-year revenue guidance midpoint for this market by 50 basis points to 2.1%. Our occupancy for the quarter was 96.3% in Boston, which was 50 basis points higher than our original expectations and 60 basis points better than Q2 of \u201817. As of this morning, our Boston base rents are up 2.7% as compared to the same week last year and renewal performance remains strong with 4.8% achieved increases in the second quarter. July is trending to a 5.1% and August is projected to be 5.2%.","Moving over to New York. Consistency in operations and disciplined market pricing are the highlights for this quarter. 96.8% occupancy for the quarter was 70 basis points better than both expectations and that of the second quarter of 2017. Achieved increases on renewals were 30 basis points better than expected at 2.8%. Our use of concessions in New York remains very limited and strategic. Our second quarter concessions were 37% lower than that of the second quarter of 2017. And for the past several months, we have only had approximately 5% to 10% of our weekly applications receive some form of moving concessions. We remain focused on competitive net effective pricing and the use of confessions at our stabilized assets will remain targeted, but it is expected to increase in the softer demand period, later in the year.","Full-year revenue guidance for New York is being increased by almost 100 basis points from negative 75 basis points to a positive 20 basis points. Today, our occupancy in New York is 96.7%, which is 70 basis points higher than the same week last year. Base rents are up 2.9% year-over-year, and this week is the 14th consecutive week of base rents being positive on a year-over-year basis and the 5th consecutive week being above 2%. Achieved increases on renewals remain strong with 3.2% expected in July and 3.4% for August.","So, strong demand and disciplined market pricing in New York positioned us well for the peak leasing season. This provided us the opportunity to both, raise rate and grow occupancy. That being said, we are not out of the woods yet as the third quarter is the peak delivery quarter for New York . Now, these deliveries are concentrated in Long Island City and Brooklyn were to date, we have not seen a significant impact to our operations. Our New York team has performed extremely well through the leasing season, and we like our position here heading into a softer period of activity.","Main headline for Washington DC continues to be positive economic conditions have aided in the absorption of new supply, but the overall DC continues to be a market with minimal pricing power. That being said, this is a market that\u2019s going to continue to deliver almost 3,000 units per quarter through the end of 2019. Pricing power will remain pressured until we either see a decrease in supply or an increase in jobs above the 40,000 per year level.","Our second quarter revenue growth in DC was slightly better than our original expectations, primarily driven by 96.3% occupancy, which was 60 basis points better than expectations and 80 basis points better than Q2 of \u201817. Renewals were 30 basis points below expectations with an achieved increase of 4.1% for the quarter. Today, our occupancy in DC is at 96.3%, which is 10 basis points higher than the same week last year, and our base rents are 3.4% up year-over-year. We expect to achieve a 4.5% increase on renewals in July and 4.7% increase for August. We have revised our full-year revenue projection for Washington DC for 1.2%, which is a 20 basis-point increase from our original expectation at the beginning of the year.","Moving over to the West Coast. Our overall second quarter revenue results in Seattle were slightly below our original expectations. On our last call, we told you that we were experiencing continued moderation and that our ability to grow rate was less than expected. That trend has continued through the second quarter, and we are not seeing signs of pricing power improvement, typically observed during the peak leasing season. Occupancy for the second quarter was 95.8%, which mirrored Q2 of \u201817 and was 10 basis points less than our expectations. Achieved renewal increases for Seattle averaged 5.9% for the quarter, which was also 10 basis points less than what we expected. The Seattle job market remains strong, which has helped in the absorption of the new units, but we expect continued rate pressure from the new supply through the remainder of the year. The good news on the supply front is that the 2019 supply is less concentrated in any one submarket, which should allow modest pricing power to return to our portfolio.","Today, our occupancy in Seattle is 95.6%, which is 30 basis points lower than the same week last year and our base rents are down 1.7% year-over-year. We expect our achieved renewal increase to be 6.3% for July and August is trending towards 5.5%. We have adjusted our Seattle\u2019s full-year revenue growth projection down 25 basis point to 3% to reflect lower-than-expected base rent growth.","Moving down to San Francisco. Pricing power and occupancy gains fueled by strong demand has resulted in another quarter of outperformance versus our original expectations. We have said in the past that market had the indicators that it could outperform the high-end of our guidance range. We now expect our full-year same-store revenue growth for San Francisco to be 2.9%. San Francisco\u2019s occupancy average 96.2% for the quarter, which was 40 basis points better than expected and 50 basis points better than Q2 of \u201817. Achieved increases on renewals were up 5.2%, which was 100 basis points better than we expected. Job growth remains strong in the Bay Area, 2.1%, and is really fueling the demand and aiding in the absorption of the new supply. Our own newly developed community 855 Brannan in downtown San Francisco is a great example of the strength of this market. This community is expected to destabilize approximately six months earlier than we initially thought. Today, 855 Brannan is at 95% occupancy, and we just renewed 54% of all of our June and July expirations with an achieved increase of 4.2%.","Overall, the new deliveries in downtown San Francisco will be limited in the third and fourth quarters. The bulk of our competing products is already delivered and is currently in lease up. Another example of the strength of this market is the fact that our own performance in the Peninsula with 28% of our Bay Area NOI, remained strong in the pace of steady year-to-date supply delivery. We estimate that the Peninsula deliveries will decline by 70% in 2019, which should provide a favorable tailwind to already strong performance.","Today, we are 95.9% occupied in San Francisco, identical to where we were the same week last year. Our base rents are up 6.1% year-over-year. Our achieved renewal increases for July are at 5.5% and we project 5.4% increase for August.","Moving further down the West Coast, I am pleased to report that Los Angeles, which accounts for almost 30% of our portfolio-wide revenue growth, produced second quarter results, slightly ahead of our expectations. We mentioned on previous calls that we had a strategy to increase occupancy early in the year to not only position us to raise rates but as a defensive move against the elevated supply in this market. For the quarter, we had 96.0% occupancy, which was 20 basis points higher than our original expectations and 30 basis points higher than the second quarter of \u201817. Achieved renewal increases for the quarter in LA were up 6.2%.","In the past, we\u2019ve been asked a lot of questions about delays in deliveries impacting our results. We have explained our process and outlined how from an operation standpoint we also focus on when first units begin leasing. Our response has been consistent and that we were not seeing delays beyond the typical 10% to 15% moves between quarters.","Specific to LA, this quarter marks the first time we are seeing above-average shift in the timing of deliveries. It is hard to quantify the exact benefits of this shift as we still had over 4,000 units begin leasing activity in the first half of \u201818 but we do recognize that our performance during the first half of the year was impacted in a positive manner since the delivery pressure was not as an intense as expected. Our occupancy in LA today 96.6%, which is 10 basis points lower than the same week last year. Our base rents are up 5.6% year-over-year, and we expect 6.5% increase on renewals for both July and August.","Based on modest gains in occupancy, stronger pricing power above our original expectations, along with increased potential pressure in the second half of the year due to the supply shift, we have revised our full-year revenue projection to 3.4%. This would have been a 3.5% increase, but as we\u2019ve disclosed in the release, during the second quarter, we had a onetime write-off from the retail tenant vacancy that will impact the full-year results in this market by 10 basis points.","Moving to Orange County. Second quarter results were below expectations, primarily due to lower occupancy and lack of pricing power from lease-up pressure in the quarter. Occupancy for the quarter was 95.9%, which was 40 basis points lower than both expectations and that of the second quarter of \u201817. Achieved renewal increases for the quarter were 5.4%, which was 80 basis points lower than what we expected. Today, we continue to see moderate pressure on pricing in Orange County but our occupancy has recovered to 96.6%, which is 40 basis points higher than the same week last year. Our base rents are up 1.9% year-over-year, and achieved increases on renewals are up 5.9% for July and trending to 5.6% for August.","Given the lack of pricing power experienced year-to-date along with revised expectations going forward, we have adjusted our Orange County full-year revenue growth projection down 50 basis points to 3.5%. While this was not as robust of a leasing season in Orange County as we have hoped, this market will still produce our second strongest results in the portfolio for 2018.","And last but not least, San Diego. Our results for the quarter were in line with expectations. Occupancy was 96.4%, which is exactly what we anticipated. And achieved renewal increases for the quarter were 6.3%, which was slightly better than our expectations. Today, our San Diego occupancy is 96.7%, which is 60 basis points lower than the same week last year. However, it\u2019s still in line with our guidance expectations.","Our base rents are up 1.6% as compared to the same week last year. And we expect achieved renewable increases for July and August at 6.3%. There is no change to our full-year revenue growth expectation of 4% for San Diego.","In closing, we are more than halfway through our peak leasing season, and we continue to see strong demand for our products. New supply is being absorbed at a rate greater than we expected and pricing of those units remains rational.","New York and San Francisco drove the majority of our 50 basis-point positive guidance provision. Seattle and Orange County, two of our smaller markets, continue to be a bit behind our original midpoint expectations. And Boston is ahead of our expectations. And the rest of our market DC, LA, San Diego are basically on track and performing slightly better within 10 basis points to 20 basis points of our original expectations.","A sincere thank you to the entire Equity team. Peak leasing season is exhilarating and exhausting at the same time. Your efforts and results year-to-date are beyond appreciated. Your relentless focus on delivering remarkable experiences to our residents is clearly paying off. Keep it up. Thank you.","Mark Parrell","Thank you, Michael, and good morning.","Michael has just discussed our markets and the upward revision to our same-store revenue guidance, and I want to take a couple of minutes here to talk about our revisions to our same-store expense guidance and to our full-year normalized FFO guidance.","First, for same-store expenses, we have lowered the midpoint of our full-year same-store expense guidance to 3.75% from 4%. This is primarily driven by our expectation of modestly lower property tax expense growth and for lower on-site payroll expense growth. As a reminder, these two expense line items together constitute approximately 65% of our same-store operating expenses. Year-to-date, we have produced expense growth of 3.5%. We don\u2019t expect a big change in the growth rate of our expenses in the second half of the year.","Now, I\u2019ll give you a bit more color. You saw us produce 4.5% growth in property taxes through the first six months of 2018. We now expect our full-year property tax expenses to grow in the range of 4% to 4.5%, and that\u2019s down from the 4.75% to 5.75% prior range. This is due to both significantly better than expected appeal activity, as well as our expectation of a reduction in the growth rate of our taxes upon the sale of a same-store asset that David Neithercut will discuss in a moment. Also, we have lowered our expectation for on-site payroll expense growth to a range of 3% to 4%, and that\u2019s down from 5% before.","At the beginning of the year, our budget assumed continued pressure on on-site payroll, especially compensation for our maintenance personnel. While we are still feeling wage pressure, especially on the maintenance side, our on-site payroll expense growth has been positively impacted year-to-date by a reduction in our estimate of medical reserve expenses. Year-to-date growth of 2% in on-site payroll means that payroll expense growth will be higher in the back half of the year than it has been year-to-date but that is mostly due to a harder 2017 comparable period in the second half of the year than any real change in trend.","Now, moving over to normalized FFO. In our earnings release, we raised the midpoint of our full-year same-store revenue guidance to 2.1% from 1.6%, driven by the strong renewals, low turnover and high occupancy in our portfolio that Michael just discussed. I just went over our expectation of a decrease in same-store expenses which collectively allow us to raise the midpoint of our same-store NOI guidance to 1.4% from 0.75%. On the normalized FFO side, we are picking up about $0.03 per share from higher same-store NOI and another penny or so from our 2018 transaction activity due to our narrowing of our reinvestment spread and the timing of our acquisition and disposition activity. These positives are partially offset by a one penny per share increase in interest expense, primarily due to the increase and timing of the same transaction activity and its impact on our intra-period borrowing. The result is a modest increase to our normalized FFO guidance from $3.22 per share to $3.25 per share. All-in-all, revenues improved, expense is slightly lower, normalized FFO slightly improved.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to David.","David Neithercut","Thanks, Mark.","On the transaction front, second quarter was pretty quiet with only one acquisition occurring and no dispositions. That acquisition being a 240-unit mid-rise property built in 1999 located in Hoboken, New Jersey.","Now, as noted in last night\u2019s press release, through the first half of the year, we have acquired two assets for $200 million and sold four assets for $290 million at an accretive spread of 10 basis points. Also noted in the press release is a revised assumption for the year of $700 million of acquisitions and an equal amount of dispositions, which obviously will require a fair amount of activity in the second half of the year. Included in that activity are several acquisitions under contract and in the due diligence process totaling nearly $500 million, which includes a couple of recently built properties in close-in, highly walkable neighborhoods of Denver. As we said repeatedly, our exit there was not market-related but rather portfolio-related. We\u2019ve continued to carefully watch Denver, because it possess many of the characteristics we look for in one of our markets that being a highly educated workforce, strong growth and high paying jobs and relatively high cost to single family housing as a multiple of income. And we think that with the new supply that has recently been and will soon be brought on line in Denver, there will be additional attractive opportunities to acquire assets that meet our investment criteria, as we rebuild a critical mass in the market.","Our second half transaction activity will also include the disposition of an asset on Manhattan\u2019s West Side that is currently under contract at a price in excess of $400 million, and at a very attractive disposition unit. This sale is expected to close late this quarter with all contingencies currently waived and subject at this time to only normal closing conditions. This disposition will be discussed in more detail following closing, but it does represent an opportunity for us to reduce our exposure to the West Side where we have a significant portfolio of assets, as well as an opportunity to address the negative impact on our New York City growth rates by reducing our exposure to properties with expiring 421-a real estate tax benefits.","In fact, going back to Mark\u2019s comments just a moment ago, on the expected improvement in our 2018 same-store operating expenses, this sale will reduce our portfolio-wide growth and same-store real estate taxes by 30 basis points.","Turning to development. During the quarter, we started work on our tower in Boston to West End neighborhood that we discussed on our most recent call. This is a 469-unit project that will be delivered in 2021 at a cost of $410 million. We were also very pleased to note in last night\u2019s release that we now expect to stabilize three development deals on the West Coast two to three quarters sooner than expected. More clear example is the continued strong demand for high-quality, multifamily properties across our markets.","So, I\u2019d like to close with just a few comments on Proposition 10 that\u2019s being the California ballot initiative to overturn Costa-Hawkins. For those of you unaware of the situation, municipalities in California have for many years been able to implement rent control. However, it would be subject to certain limitations, as a result of the Costa-Hawkins Law. One, it can only be imposed on properties built before 1995; and two, properties are subject to rent control must be allowed to move their rents to market upon vacancy, which is known as vacancy decontrol. Preposition 10, which will be on the ballot in California this November, seeks to repeal Costa-Hawkins, which would remove these limitations on rent control for those jurisdictions opting to implement rent control, which of course not all actually do.","Now, our EQR has joined the California Apartment Association, public and private landlords across the state, numerous trade organizations, affordable housing groups, state and local chambers of commerce, veterans and minority groups, nationally recognized independent research organizations, among many others to create a coalition to defeat this proposal. This will not be an easy fight because on the surface who isn\u2019t supportive of affordable housing. However, when made aware of the negative impact the rent control has on the existing housing stock and of the disincentive it creates to build more housing, which is truly the only way to address the shortage of housing, many people come to understand how bad rent control can be for the neighbors, neighborhoods and communities.","So, we will fight Proposition 10 at a cost to EQR of $1.6 million to-date. And regardless of the outcome, we will continue to fight attempts at the local level to enact rent control. Because this is bad housing policy, plain and simple. There is a reason that it has made no headway in the legislature and why the current Governor and both gubernatorial candidates have come out against it. And that is because it is widely understood that rent control creates a disincentive to invest in the existing rental housing stock and a disincentive to build more rental housing and is therefore the worst possible action that could be taken to address the shortage of affordable housing, because rather than address the problems, it exacerbates it.","The answer is to build more housing. And there is not one solution that will work everywhere there is a housing shortage. But, the basket of solutions includes inclusionary zoning, looking hard at some of the regulatory requirements can add significant costs to new development projects, increasing federal low income housing tax credit program, and addressing the nimbyism that exists in many of the areas where the current housing shortage is the most acute.","Now, there is no question that we have a serious housing issue across our nation which needs to be addressed. And while the answer may not be easy, solutions do exist. And it has been proven time and time again that rent control is not one of them.","So, Kathy, we will be happy to open the call now to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America.","Juan Sanabria","Hi. Good morning. I was just hoping for the latest portfolio-wide color on 2019 supply and the expected delta versus \u201818. And if you could maybe just highlight which markets are seeing the biggest deceleration, if any and are you seeing an unexpected increase?","Michael Manelis","Yes, sure. This is Michael. So, I guess, I would say, at the highest level, we have rolled up about 71,000 units for 2018, going down to 57,000 units in 2019. And when you go across the markets, the market that probably has the most pronounced reduction is New York, dropping from 19,400 units down to 8,500 units. The rest of them are moving, I mean slightly, but it\u2019s not as material of a decline as what we see in New York.","Juan Sanabria","And with the latest cut of the numbers, has there been any material move from \u201818 into \u201819 outside of the LA market which you highlighted in your prepared remarks?","Michael Manelis","No, no material change moving between here outside of what we saw on our LA.","Juan Sanabria","And thank you for the color on the renewals by market. Would you mind providing the new lease spreads by market, as well as the portfolio-wide spot occupancy?","Michael Manelis","Yes. So, I want to just say on the new lease and I kind of -- I think I said this on the last call, so I think it\u2019s important that I reiterate. We don\u2019t believe that looking at these results for any single one quarter is the best way to think about this metric at a market level. I\u2019m just going to tell you that we just went through the process of updating all of our full-year expectations when we went through the guidance revision process. And on our full-year basis, our assumption changes were as follows. So, New York was in increased by a 100 basis points in our expectations for new lease change, San Francisco was increased by 50 basis points, and Seattle and Orange County were both reduced by a 100 basis points. The rest of our markets were either on track or had marginal moves in either directions.","Juan Sanabria","Okay. But, can you provide the second quarter figures for the new leases?","Michael Manelis","Yes, sure. So, Boston was positive 30 basis points; New York was negative 1.2% or 120 basis points; Washington DC was negative 0.9%; San Francisco was up 5.1%; Seattle was up 0.7%; LA was up 2.6%; Orange County up 0.4%; San Diego up 3.7%, putting the entire portfolio up 1.4% as we disclosed in the release.","Operator","We\u2019ll now hear from Nick Joseph with Citi. ","Nick Joseph","On reentering to Denver, how many assets or what percentage of NOI do you need to own to reach an acceptable scale?","Michael Manelis","That\u2019s a good question, Nick. As we look at, we think that we can get an appropriate sort of critical mass with, call it 14, 15, 16 assets. That\u2019s probably around a 1.5 billion or about 5% of our sort of NAV allocation, if you will. And these two assets we\u2019re underwriting, get us 20% of the way there.","Nick Joseph","Okay. So, do you expect to reach that level over the next two to three years or is it more of a next cycle target?","Michael Manelis","I think, it\u2019s hard to say. A lot of it will just be -- we can find opportunities to trade out of other markets, sort of what we are doing here and trading out in New York, and reallocating that capital in Denver. If there are opportunities that might be faster, but I think it would be hard pressed to sort of put a specific timeline on it, but one that we will be -- really have our eye on and try and get there as soon as appropriately possible and what we think about allocating capital.","Nick Joseph","And then, you\u2019ve done a great job with renewals and drive internal but lower. Is there an opportunity to drive it further, or do you think you are close to frictional turnover level?","Michael Manelis","I guess, I would just say tell you, I think our expectation is that we\u2019re going to continue to see the results that we\u2019ve seen play out for the first half for the balance of the year. I mean, the teams are focused on this. How much more improvement are we going to see than these 100 basis points declines that were post in each quarter, I don\u2019t know. I mean, I think we\u2019re probably getting down towards where we will post kind of the lowest turnover, but we will see kind of where we go from there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.","Steve Sakwa","David, I just wanted to make sure I head you correctly. I think, in your opening comments, you said you were maybe trending towards the high end of the expectations. I just wanted to make sure, given that you\u2019ve done 2.2 revenue growth in the first half, the 1.9 at the low end would kind of imply a 1.6 second half. So, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re not assuming there\u2019s a big deceleration. I mean, is it fair to assume you\u2019re kind of in that 2.1 to 2.3 range right now?","Michael Manelis","So, Steve, this is Michael. I guess, I would say, yes. So, we have a lot of confidence in the 2.1% midpoint that we just put out there. I do want to say that it doesn\u2019t take much to move our revenue by 10 basis points in the portfolio, winds up coming down to $2.4 million. And the 40 basis points range that we just communicated in the release is really just the result of a sensitivity analysis that we complete for each market that kind of looks at best likely and worst. And I said, right now, we\u2019ve got a lot of confidence in the 2.1. We have a pretty difficult comp period coming up in front of us from an occupancy standpoint and several of our markets have peak deliveries occurring in the third quarter.","So, as far as the bottom end of that range, the 1.9, there is a couple of different ways to get there, but it basically is going to come down to our ability to hold occupancy at 96.1% for the second half of the year. And a 30 basis-point decline in occupancy in the second half, which we do not see happening at this point, but that would result in revenue towards the bottom end of our range. But on the opposite end of the spectrum, continued improvement in retention and demand, which we are seeing, will accelerate rate growth and push occupancy higher, and that in turn would result in the higher end of our revenue range.","Steve Sakwa","And then, I guess, I want to just how you guys address maybe construction costs. I know, you don\u2019t have that many new projects starting other than the new one in Boston. But maybe David or somebody else could just sort of address what you\u2019re seeing in import costs and things like steel and wood, and how that\u2019s impacting maybe underwriting today for new deals?","David Neithercut","Well, it\u2019s hard and hard, Steve, particularly as these construction costs go up more quickly than rental levels. We thought -- in 2017, across our markets we saw 4% to 8% increase in hard costs and we\u2019re expecting an underwriting same sort of expected growth this year, even though that we are not bidding anything ourselves. But as our guys track those costs, that\u2019s what they are seeing, again this year. And that is before any inclusion of any kind of impact of tariffs. I have had just -- my construction guys tell me, I think steel, because of the results of the tariffs are up at least 25%. And I know Mark has had some conversations with others that might -- has some color for you as well.","Mark Parrell","Yes. I mean, Steve, attending some industry events and hearing a large general contractor speak to a room full of developers, so, I\u2019ll tell you, had rapt attention on this point. What they are seeing with -- and this was before the steel tariffs, but just the general threat of it, plus the lumber tariffs that already exist with Canada that all of that was pushing our cost up 4% to 8%. And indeed, it was also adding a cost to a lot of construction contracts that created real uncertainty where the general contractor and the subs weren\u2019t willing to take risk on some of these items, which really puts a lot of pressure on the developer and on their contingency.","Steve Sakwa","So, I guess, it\u2019s fair to assume -- or I mean, can you point to or do you expect then that to just really lead to kind of a drop off in new supply here over the next kind of say 6 to 12 months?","David Neithercut","Well, we\u2019ve certainly -- we\u2019ve said that for some time. Certainly, there is product in the pipeline that would be unaffected by this. Our deal when we started in Boston is unaffected by any of this, but that contractor sort of locked down. But certainly, we hear anecdotally all the time, Alan George, our investment guys share all the time about projects that are being pushed aside, equity capital that unwilling go forward, in deals that are looking for new capital sources specifically as a result of this. So, I see no reason why this won\u2019t have a significant impact on the number of starts going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.","John Pawlowski","There has been some news articles out there about pop-up hotel at your 100K Apartments in DC. I was wondering if you could provide the economics, average rents, margin, CapEx reserve on that building now that will be a more of a short-term lodging type focus versus if there was a 100% traditional apartments.","Mark Parrell","I don\u2019t have that compared to what it would be, John. But we have cut a deal with this entity called WhyHotel where they are chasing down 95 units for nine months in our property that will soon be delivered. We get a base rent from them as well as a participation over some thresholds. These are apartment experienced guys. So, they\u2019ve been very easy to work with, very compatible to work with. We think it\u2019s a great opportunity to deliver some income in vacant units that would otherwise remain vacant over that nine-month period.","Michael Manelis","And John, they provide all of the goods. They are providing -- they are furnishing the units. There is no additional capital on our part. And they are providing the staffing to address any concerns that their hotel residents, so to speak, have. So, there isn\u2019t like a cost impact effectively on us. ","John Pawlowski","Okay. Can you share a stabilized yield projection?","Mark Parrell","I beg your pardon?","John Pawlowski","Could you share a stabilized NOI yield projection on the development?","Mark Parrell","On that particular property, 100K? We think that deal will stabilize in the mid-5s.","John Pawlowski","And then, turning back to Denver -- sorry, if I cut off you there.","Michael Manelis","No. Just to be clear, the hotel part will go away. When lease is up, David\u2019s projection is strictly a residential apartment execution\u2026","David Neithercut","That\u2019s the 12 months forward return on a fully stabilized apartment product. The existence of the WhyHotel will just provide some income in advance of that calculation.","John Pawlowski","Okay. Turning back to Denver, when you are underwriting that market, again, obviously, I know, it wasn\u2019t end market exit, but when you are underwriting Denver and long-term NOI growth in Denver versus your existing portfolio, how is that market ranked against your existing markets?","David Neithercut","Well, we think that Denver will be not particularly strong performer in the current and in next year because of the new supply that\u2019s being delivered. We do believe supply will reduce considerably in 2019 and that it should probably -- perform most likely in the upper half of the market in which we currently operate.","John Pawlowski","And one last one if I may. To get the $500 million, will -- what other markets will be source of funds to grow or $1.5 billion, I\u2019m sorry -- to get to the $1.5 billion, current environment, what other markets will be source of funds to fund Denver?","David Neithercut","Well, I guess, it\u2019s possible all of them could. Again, this is just a relative trade process. I think it\u2019s possible we will continue to look at other New York assets that are subject to the 421-a tax burn off, but that\u2019s not a requirement. So, as we look at across all of our properties on a regular basis, and we have sold out of all of our markets from time to time, and it will just be depend on what we think the best opportunity is at the time.","Operator","We will continue on to Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.","Rich Hill","One, I guess, macro question and then a little bit more micro. Talking about the New York -- the New York market for a moment. Obviously, it seems like, for lack of a better term, the worst case scenario has been taken off the table. And you are a lot more optimistic about New York City than you were previously. But, I\u2019m sort of thinking about the future, and is this less than 1% of revenue growth, sort of a new steady state, just given the supply versus demand technicals? And while it\u2019s not going to be nearly as bad as maybe some fear? Is it fair to say that we are not getting back up to the 2% plus revenue growth that we have seen in the past the like other markets? So, I guess, what I\u2019m trying to get your view on is supply versus demand technicals. And if supply ebbs over the next couple of years, are we expecting to see a reacceleration in same-store revenue or is it just more muddling along in this zero to 50 basis-point range?","Michael Manelis","So, this is Michael. I guess, I\u2019m not going to speak too specifically about \u201819 or into \u201820, but I guess I\u2019d tell you, just given where we are in the trajectory that we have and the ability for this market to absorb the units that they seem to date in a rational way, I\u2019d suggest that we will start to see modest pricing power start to return. And it may be neighborhood by neighborhood, submarket by submarket, but I think we will be in a position to get back to what you just described as more normal growth, 2% and 2.5%, something like that. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s going to happen immediately in \u201819 but I think clearly you are going to see some of that momentum start to emerge.","Rich Hill","And then, back to the micro question. It looks like a retail move out in LA might have been just a little bit of a topline headwind. I\u2019m sorry, if you mentioned this, but it looks like just back of the envelop that was maybe 10 basis points off the topline, or am I thinking about that correctly?","Mark Parrell","Right. So, for Los Angeles, we had one -- we had two retail centers vacated, single asset was about $500,000 in straight line rent that we reversed. So, by the end of the year, it will have no effect on the entire portfolio. And I would say to you right now, it had a very minimal rounding effect on the 2.2 we reported for the entire portfolio. For LA, you saw the footnote, there was an impact and that\u2019s why we footnoted it. By the end of the year, as Michael mentioned in his script for Los Angeles, it might be a 10 basis-point negative, but not much.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","Just to follow up on that retail vacancy. Was this an unexpected vacancy? And do you see this occurring in other markets, just given the tough retail environment?","Michael Manelis","Sure. Just to give context, about 2% of our total rental income is from retail. We have a very small retail portfolio. We run it mostly as an amenity for our residents in our buildings, so coffee shops and like are very common tenants. So, no, this is uncommon, it\u2019s lumpy, it\u2019s -- I wouldn\u2019t -- we don\u2019t see this as a repeating event.","John Kim","Couple of questions on Denver. One, do you expect to develop in this market, or just growth of acquisitions? And two, one of the arguments about being in this market was new supply, and what makes you comfortable about overcoming this characteristic?","David Neithercut","We currently will reenter that market through acquisitions. We will certainly consider some joint venture development, the opportunities that they present themselves, and that is the way we got into the development business back in 1990s. And if appropriate, we believe there is capacity to develop ourselves there, we will certainly consider that.","Just with respect to the market, I\u2019ve said and we\u2019ve said for quite some time that this was not a market related exit, but it was a portfolio related exit when we sold the last time. And as -- when we did so, we saw this new supply coming and knew that it would have an impact on the marketplace. But we also thought that new supply would likely represent opportunities for us down the road, if and when we decided to reenter the market. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening right now. So, as I said previously, we\u2019re not expecting to get terribly robust revenue growth, maybe in the first or second year in Denver. But, we think we\u2019re buying it at a great assets, at a very good basis that will perform very well, as we get into 2019 and we begin -- we see that new supply begin to abate.","Operator","We\u2019ll continue on to Michael Lewis with SunTrust.","Michael Lewis","You guys talked a bit about the low turnover and rightly it sounds like a lot of that is due to what you guys have been able to achieve. I was just wondering, if there is anything more macro out of your control that you think is causing the wind to be at your back on the turnover. Maybe it\u2019s -- in your markets maybe SALT deduction is causing people to move out from ownership or maybe it\u2019s some other factor that\u2019s either continue to help you or turn against you on that front?","Michael Manelis","I think, there is a lot of reasons why this reduction is occurring. I think, the efforts of our onsite folks is just kind of the icing on cake that\u2019s brining us down. But, you\u2019ve got momentum in people deferring life decisions, marrying later, having children later, not rushing out to buy homes. I mean, buying home is the move up has declined in every single one of our market this last quarter outside of Orange County. So, I think, there is clearly other factors that are contributing to this decline, but I think our relentless focus on renewing our residents is clearly helping this as well.","Michael Lewis","Maybe a part B to that next question and the demographics are interesting. The oldest millennials are 38 this year. Have you seen anything on the margin there with movement, maybe an increased move toward homeownership?","Michael Manelis","No.","David Neithercut","I mean, as noted, we\u2019ve seen percentage of our move-outs to buy single family homes reduce. And we operate in the markets that have got very expensive costs of single family homeownerships such that we would expect our residents to remain renters for significantly longer, and that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening.","Michael Lewis","Thanks. You had that 2.2% year-over-year same-store revenue growth actually in each of the past four quarters, and the quarter before that was 2.1%, and the midpoint of the guidance this year was 2.1%. So, it\u2019s really kind of steady now in this range. And I\u2019m sure your cost, talking about 2019, but given this kind of steadiness and it looks like maybe supply is going to ease a little bit. I mean, do you think 2019, since the revenue growth is going to be higher or lower than \u201818 or do you think -- this is kind of where we are at right now as far as kind of a balanced market.","Mark Parrell","We can\u2019t go into 2019 revenue growth at this time. We\u2019ve sort of given you all the facts we see them. And at least for this juncture, you\u2019ll have to come up with your own conclusion to that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.","Rich Anderson","So, the way you are approaching Denver, which is to buy now, even though the market isn\u2019t great is interesting. And I\u2019m wondering if that can be extrapolated to the New York City metro area, despite the fact that you got a $400 million asset for sale. Do you think there\u2019s any opportunity to buy at this point where it isn\u2019t great, but maybe will get great eventually again?","David Neithercut","Well, I think that you are generally on to the thought process there, Rich, and that is, this is a trade. Right? We are trading capital from one market into another market. And as we look at what\u2019s happening in New York and the low growth we\u2019ve had there and the expectation for lower growth as -- in some of these assets as a result of the 421-a tax burn-off, it may make sense to rotate some capital into some other markets.","Now, I do want to note that the asset we acquired this past quarter, it happened to be in the New York metropolitan area. So, it\u2019s not as though that we are selling or exiting New York. We were just rotating some capital out of some New York assets into another New York based asset as well as into Denver at this time.","Rich Anderson","And then, if I could just ask the other recent question little bit differently. I\u2019m not going to look for 2019 guidance, I know you are not going to give me that. But maybe you can give 2021 guidance. And the way I\u2019m thinking about it is, do you feel like this is a tight turning kind of situation with regard to your new guidance? I can appreciate, it\u2019s going better for you in this current year. But having experienced cycles in multifamily for many, many years, not to dig you, I\u2019m curious where do you think we stand right now in terms of how it\u2019s playing out versus history? In other words, revenue of 2.2 last year, maybe you are getting close to that this year. Are we at the bottom or at least nearing the bottom from your perspective, particularly when you consider the decline in deliveries that you\u2019re seeing in your markets?","David Neithercut","Well, there is all sorts of things that will influence performance in 2020 and 2021. But, I think that you did touch on some important issues there. Michael just talked about what improved pricing power expected in New York soon as a result of this reduction in the new supply. There is a significant fall off of new supply coming in, in 2019. And as discussed earlier, to one of the questions, we are expecting supply to remain sort of in check, if you will, among other reasons, for the increase of construction costs and now the tariffs, and to Mark\u2019s comments, the uncertainty of costs as a result of the tariffs. So, we look at supply being reasonably in check, beginning 2019. In general, there are some markets where like DC we are expecting it about the same on a year-over-year basis but just across the portfolio. So, absent any other sort of external sort of geopolitical sort of shocks or economic sort of shocks, we certainly expect with the current demand we are seeing and the retention that we are seeing and the expectation that our residents will be unable to afford single family housing or will opt to remain in rental housing for whatever reason, we think that the supply-demand fundamentals and the dynamics will improve from here.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Drew Babin with Baird.","Drew Babin","A question, kind of taking supply out of the picture, lots of questions on supply. I guess, which markets would you see that on a seasonally adjusted basis you are seeing the strongest pick-ups in demand, both from an employment growth standpoint and a wage growth standpoint, which market do you feel are the most exciting and I guess which markets are kind of the most sluggish at this stage of the year?","David Neithercut","Well, I mean, San Francisco clearly kind of tops the list right now, with the most momentum -- I don\u2019t know how you can look at this stuff without thinking about the supply and the ability of the market to absorb the supply that\u2019s coming to the market. But that market I think we\u2019ve said now for a while, has been having these indicators of showing strength. And I gave you kind of great two great examples, not only for our own portfolio, the Peninsula from our own lease-up of that market just to kind of put that into context.","From a sluggish standpoint, it has to be the two markets that aren\u2019t kind of meeting the expectations that we laid out originally, which would be the Seattle and Orange County. And I think both of those to me are short-term because of the impact to supply, they still have diverse job occurring. And I think we just need to see. We just haven\u2019t found equilibrium in those markets, which is the ability to consecutively raise rate and keep velocity at a place we need, which tells me that we\u2019ve got to work our way through the supply for those two markets.","Drew Babin","I guess, said differently, are there any markets where you are seeing employment growth or wage growth reaccelerate or accelerate in a way that\u2019s been surprising? It sounds like that has occurred in the Bay Area but in other markets.","Michael Manelis","No, I don\u2019t think so. I mean, I think they are kind of all within check of what the original expectations were from job growth and where the job growth is coming from.","Drew Babin","And then, on kind of segmenting the New York performance from a Manhattan but the New Jersey, Hudson waterfront properties. Can you talk a little bit about that area? I know there has been a little bit of supply there, and just talk about whether you are seeing concessions and any glimpse of pricing power in the near term there?","David Neithercut","So, no concession. I mean, if there is concessions because they are nominal, they are targeted, they are strategic from a marketing standpoint. I mean just to put into perspective the kind of that Hudson waterfront area, it\u2019s doing the best out of all of the submarkets that we have in New York on a year-to-date basis, posting kind of 1.3% revenue growth. So, I guess, at this point, I would say the trajectory looks good. I mean, I think, come Q4, like I said, in the slower periods, we will see what we need to do from a concessionary environment. But, the absorption of the supply there and our ability to kind of raise rates and maintain occupancy has been strong.","Drew Babin","And one more for me. I was hoping if you could talk about the stabilized yield expectations on West End tower in Boston. And I guess kind of classify that as a spread through some of the acquisitions that you\u2019ve made and are going to make in the duration of this year. I guess, most specifically kind of newer properties, obviously Denver is a much different market than Boston, but some of the recent developments you\u2019ve been acquiring. I guess, what is that spread, and do you feel that that\u2019s enough spread to compensate your further development risk in the Boston case?","Michael Manelis","Well, we think that our yield on that Boston deal at current rents will be in the low to mid-5s and will likely stabilize somewhere with the six-handle. We think that\u2019s a terrific yield in a marketplace where that asset would probably trade today, maybe with a high-3 cap rate. So, we think we\u2019re getting appropriately compensated for the 10 years worth of blood, sweat and tears that\u2019s gone into to try and get that deal. Plus, it\u2019s Mark, we think Boston is a great long-term market. There is a lot of exciting things going on in Boston and in Cambridge. And this will be a perfect asset for us own and operate for a long time.","Operator","John Guinee with Stifel has our next question.","John Guinee","Focusing on page 20 and building off the last question. It looks like you\u2019re all-in development is about 874,000 a unit for West End tower, but you have only spent about 63,000 a unit so far. Does that imply that the land cost was less than 63,00 a unit? And if so, what your hard cost and soft cost per unit get up to a total development of 874,000 per unit?","Mark Parrell","I don\u2019t have that level of specificity here. We had a land base -- essentially we\u2019ve own that -- the property on which that tower is being built for 20 years or so. We had a land basis of about $20 million in that property. So, that represents a lot of what we\u2019ve done. We\u2019re incurring some demolition cost today of the existing garage, and that\u2019s all that\u2019s really been in there today, that land basis and some demolition costs as well as the capitalized costs that we\u2019ve incurred in terms of architectural and engineering and all those sort of things. So, there is not a great deal of hard cost in there yet and I don\u2019t have the breakdown at finger tips of that transaction.","John Guinee","Okay. Looking at your completed but not stabilized 724 million, it looks like your second quarter \u201818 number is about an annualized 3.5 yield on cost. What do you think these three completed, not stabilized assets will stabilize at 855 Brannan and the two Seattle deals? You are about 3.5 now at 90% occupied on average.","Mark Parrell","855 Brannan, we expect to stabilize at a high 4, the Helios deal at a about 5, and the Cascade deal at about 6.3, those are the three deals. And the Cascade deal went about 6.3.","John Guinee","That\u2019s a long way\u2026","Mark Parrell","But when you use the numbers in the release, that\u2019s wherever these properties were at that particular moment. So, this is going back in time and looking at these numbers. So, having $6 million as this thing is ramping up, that\u2019s not the right way to do, that\u2019s not the correct math. That\u2019s not going to get to a number that\u2019s going to make any sense.","John Guinee","But the 3.5 second quarter number can ramp up into the mid-5s on stabilized?","Mark Parrell","Well, I guess by definition. Right? But whatever yields we are receiving today, will grow to the yields that I just told you on those transactions, as we lease and occupy those properties and get them stabilized.","John Guinee","And then, the last question on the -- I guess using maybe your Manhattan west asset as an example. What\u2019s the yield impact on the 421-a tax burn-off? For example, let\u2019s say your trailing cap rate is X and the buyers stabilized cap rate post 421 burn-off is Y, how much yield erosion is there as those tax abatements burn off.","Mark Parrell","Well, it also depends on what one is underwriting on the top line as well. But bottom line growth will be negatively impacted as those roll off. And depending on what property is that roll off and between two and three to five or six years from now.","The cap rate on -- the valuation on those buildings will not change as that occurs because the cap rate will reduce as the income is negatively impacted by that, and those deals will ultimately trade on a fully tax basis in the -- somewhere in the 3s most likely.","John Guinee","So, if you hold to your tax -- if you hold your top line constant, what\u2019s the yield erosion over the burn off period, or is that impossible number to give us?","Mark Parrell","It\u2019s an asset by asset determination. We have assets that are subject to 421-a that haven\u2019t yet begun the burn-off period. We have assets that are done and we have assets that are in the middle and some assets are in different schedules than others. So, really, it\u2019s kind of a custom calculation, asset by asset.","Operator","Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill, please go ahead.","Alexander Goldfarb","Just three really quick ones, so I\u2019ll just go quick. First on Denver, David. Are you guys sort of just thinking like Cherry Creek area or how broadly are you defining your target, Denver MSA portfolio?","David Neithercut","Well, the two assets we have under contract now are both in the sort of uptown, downtown area, if you will, not in Cherry Creek. So, we will continue to look for downtown, highly walkable sort of locations. We would certainly consider Cherry Creek but the two assets that we\u2019ve have in our contract today are not in Cherry Creek.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. But, are you looking broader in the greater MSA, or you really want to be more Denver proper?","David Neithercut","Well, again, we\u2019re looking for higher density, walkable sort of properties. So, I guess, I\u2019d -- by that it seems that we would not be in distant suburbs but we will look at properties that have got a transportation components, or certainly walkability to -- probably that have got high walk scores.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then, on the acquisition disposition guidance, both have increased the spread between acquisitions, and disposition has decreased, has narrowed. How has that impacted your IRRs that you are looking for both on what you are selling and what you are buying?","David Neithercut","Well, those spreads don\u2019t impact IRRs. So, I\u2019m not sure I understand the question. That\u2019s just the first year yield comparison between what we\u2019re buying and what we\u2019re selling. So, the IRRs on what we\u2019re selling have been very good, plus 10% generally. And what we think we are buying in today\u2019s marketplace, we think we\u2019re buying probably in the 7s by and large.","Alexander Goldfarb","So, I guess if I could rephrase it. As far as the impact to EQR\u2019s earnings, if that spread is narrowing, do you view that that is decreasing the growth benefit of what you are buying versus what you are selling, or you are viewing that there is no difference to the growth profile of the assets that you are trading to EQR, based on that spread narrow?","David Neithercut","Again, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not picking up the question. I mean, certainly, it is in our benefit to have that spread be as narrow as possible or positive, right, to be selling lower yields and buying higher yields, provided you believe you\u2019re -- we are strategically investing capital long-term strategically appropriately. So, it\u2019s not as we are going to be selling New York and reinvesting in light spread assets. But if we can invest in our core markets and kind of assets we want to own long-term, the benefit of the Company and the business for that spread to be as narrow as possible if not positive, which will be highly unlikely that it would be positive.","Alexander Goldfarb","And then, just finally, appreciate your comments on the Costa-Hawkins. From your people on the ground and everyone that you speak with, is there a sense that the local communities understand how vacancy decontrol impacts the market or is there a view that people just aren\u2019t really aware of that, and what damage that could cause if that is removed?","David Neithercut","Look, I think people\u2019s feelings about this, Alex, are all over the board. There are some groups who will not listen to that side of the story. You just believe that it\u2019s incredibly important to make rents affordable to the populace today and are unwilling or unable to sort of understand what the long-term impact in the housing market of that will be. Our belief is that while -- when people are initially asked about rent control and affordable housing, they are generally in favor of such. But when one describes what the long-term impact is on the existing housing stock and the negative impact on valuations of the housing stock and of single-family housing, at all, they will generally realize that perhaps it\u2019s not the right thing to do. But, people have opinions all over the board on the matter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Tayo Okusanya","When we first had the change, the tax reform issue, there was all this concern about big disadvantage for states that have high bid on local taxes. I was just kind of curious, now that it\u2019s kind of been around for a couple of months, are you seeing that impacting demand for your assets or is that kind of just nothing -- you just have the zero impact or zero effect on demand in many of your key markets?","David Neithercut","I think, in the short-term, any impact we\u2019ve seen has been very positive, based upon the business communities, very positive reaction to the tax law change. And with capital expenditures, we now see them taking place in the hiring and the increase in wages as a result. So, very short-term impact has generally been very positive.","Tayo Okusanya","Any concern about any longer term negative impact though, or no?","David Neithercut","Well, I think there are a lot of questions about the impact on some of these communities as a result of the limitations on SALT, on the state and local tax expenses and therefore the increased tax burden on people in some of these higher tax states. But as we have discussed I think on the last call, these continue to be extremely important economic centers of our country, and all continue to be -- seem to prospering extremely well as a result of lots of different things, including the new tax bill. And we will sort of see what happens. But right now I mean New York and California are two very high state -- tax burdened states, things seem to be going pretty well.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay","I just want to go back to the Prop 10. Do you think that this will have any impact on development starts over the near-term? And then, conversely, a bigger picture outlook on supply. Could we get a contraction a few years out, as maybe some owners go to a condo, convert their apartments to a condo, and have Equity Residential contemplated doing such action.","David Neithercut","Well, we\u2019ve kind of not contemplated any specific reaction to this just yet. So, we\u2019re -- I think there is -- one of the concerns that many have about rent control is the fact that it could take existing housing stock and turn it into for sale stock and remove it from the rental stock, which would obviously be a negative. With respect to new construction, I think that\u2019s mostly impacted today by costs. It seems to me that whatever happens with rent control, there will be some limitation as to on what year product is built. So, the product likely built today, would not be negatively impacted by any changes in rent control as a result of the repeal of Costa-Hawkins. But all that remains to be seen. ","Wes Golladay","Okay. And then, going with the costs, can you remind us what the allocation of steel is to the overall construction cost of call it maybe a high-rise in a major city?","David Neithercut","Yes. On our property in Boston where my development guys are suggesting that the cost of steel would be about 25% greater today than what was priced when we did our deal, represents about 1% of the total cost of the project.","Operator","And with no additional questions, I will turn the...","David Neithercut","I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s a 4% cost, which is an effect of 1% on total cost. So, it\u2019s 44 -- steel is about -- is 4% of the total cost.","Okay. So, with that, thank you, Catherine. This Equity Residential, we\u2019re really -- we\u2019re pleased to celebrate our 25th anniversary as a public company on August the 12th. Who knew back in the summer of 1993 what our 22,000-unit apartment company with an enterprise value of $800 million would become. We are extremely grateful for this support of so many in investment community over that time for the dedication of our Board of Trustees, both past and present, and for the many thousands of hardworking professionals that have built this company its very special and enduring culture. So, many thanks to you all, best wishes to you all for an enjoyable summer, and we\u2019ll see you in September.","Operator","Thank you.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead.","Marty McKenna","Good morning and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's fourth quarter and full year 2019 results and outlook for 2020. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer.","Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.","Now, I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell.","Mark Parrell","Thank you, Marty. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm going to start by giving a quick overview of our business and investment activities. And then I will turn the call over to Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer for a discussion of our 2019 operating results, and 2020 revenue guidance, as well as giving you some detail on the exciting operational initiatives that we are pursuing. Then we'll pass the call over to Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer who will give you color on 2020 expense and normalized funds from operations guidance and a bit about our balance sheet activities.","2019 was a very good year for Equity Residential. We saw continued strong demand delivering our well-located urban and dense suburban properties in the nine metros in which we do business. And our excellent customer service led to record levels of customer satisfaction and resident retention. A big thank you to all my colleagues at Equity Residential for delighting our customers every day and for working together as one team.","As we predicted the fourth quarter 2019 reverted to the normal lower seasonal demand that is common at the end of each year. Slightly weaker conditions than projected led us to slightly underperform on same-store revenue versus our October guidance, but still perform at the top end of our expectations from the beginning of 2019. And we saw our normalized funds from operations increase in 2019 by an impressive 7.4% exceeding our expectations as we continue to produce strong reliable growth.","2020 looks to us to be more of the same, a slow but consistently growing economy and continuing positive demographics leading to good demand and to steady revenue growth albeit at a somewhat lower overall level than in 2019.","We expect the East Coast markets to continue to improve on a relative basis and overall, we expect the average revenue performance difference between the East Coast and West Coast markets to be only about 25 basis points in 2020.","Except for New York, we see supply is similar to or slightly higher in our markets in 2020 versus 2019. In New York, supply across the area in which we operate has been declining in the last two years and we would expect it to fall by a further 40% in 2020.","In fact in Manhattan, where we have 70% of our New York metro revenue, we see fewer than 1,000 market rate units being delivered in 2020. Also as we discussed on prior calls, we will be facing a headwind of 20 basis points or so from new rent control regulations in California and in New York.","On the innovation front, we're very excited about the benefits to revenue and expense as well as the customer satisfaction that can be gained from the continued rollout of the various initiatives that Michael will discuss. These benefits will be modest in 2020 but we believe will accelerate and compound over time.","Switching to investments, we had a busy 2019. As we have stated previously, increased demand for our apartment assets has led to cap rate compression between newer and older properties. This led us in turn to accelerate the sale of some of our older lower return properties and to reinvest that capital in newer properties that we think will provide considerably better long-term returns.","We were particularly successful at doing this in 2019. We have reallocated $1.1 billion of capital from assets that were on average 35 years old to assets that were on average two years old and incurred no cap rate dilution in doing so.","We think owning these newer higher growth assets will benefit our NFFO growth and because we expect much lower capital spending at these newer assets the level of our capitalized expenditures which is already much lower as a percentage of revenues compared to most of our peers should be lower and our unlevered IRRs higher going forward.","The fourth quarter was a microcosm of this as we sold two older suburban Washington D.C. assets that averaged 41 years old for total proceeds of $374 million at a 4.8% cap rate and acquired $370 million in newer assets one in Central Seattle one in suburban Seattle and one in suburban Washington D.C. that were on average one-year-old at a 4.8% cap rate.","We also acquired more than we sold in 2019 and have guided for the same outcome in 2020. While cap rates and IRRs are certainly lower than historical averages so is our cost of capital. The spread between the unlevered IRR we can achieve on new deals we see for sale versus our weighted average cost of capital is relatively high.","We intend to finance this increase in our assets with a combination of new debt and net cash flow. Our strong balance sheet gives us ample capacity to do so, but as always, we'll be prudent in managing our balance sheet.","Switching to new development, the equity capital availability story since early 2019 has somewhat improved for large established developers while smaller, local, and regional developers continue to work hard to put their equity capital stacks together.","We have been pursuing a few of these opportunities with smaller developers as joint ventures. And believe that investing our capital in shovel-ready deals with sound deal structures that provide some protection to our capital is a good way to source new properties while managing the risk inherent in development.","You should expect us to announce new joint venture development activity in 2020, as well as new wholly owned development deals including some lucrative density plays, where we are taking down a low density portion of an existing property and replacing it with higher density housing.","We expect 2020 development starts of $500 million, $650 million, depending on construction timing and development spending in 2020 of about $300 million. We continue to believe that development makes sense in selective locations in our markets where acquiring new properties is difficult and where our existing properties trade materially over replacement cost.","We have no imperative to start a certain amount of development per year. And we will always compare development opportunities to the market to acquire existing assets. And look for the best risk-adjusted return opportunity for our capital.","We will also seek to keep the amount of capital we expect to spend on development in any one year, roughly equal to our annual net cash flow and expected new debt capacity.","Finally, let me finish by talking about our dividend. We believe one good way to use our growing cash flow to reward our shareholders. In 2020, we plan to increase our common share dividend by 6.2%.","Now I'll hand the call over to Michael Manelis.","Michael Manelis","Thanks Mark. So today I'm going to provide a quick recap of 2019 performance, share insights into our 2020 same-store revenue guidance, discuss what we are seeing today across our markets. And end with updates on our current operating initiative.","Let me start by acknowledging the dedication and hard work of our employees in 2019. For the full year, we reported 3.2% same-store revenue growth. Highlights for the year include 96.4% occupancy, which was 20 basis points higher than 2018.","Every market except for San Francisco was able to grow occupancy, on a year-over-year basis. Strong achieved renewal rate increases of 4.9% for the year, which was the same as 2018.","Turnover declined by nearly 200 basis points to 49.5% for the year, which is the lowest full year reported turnover in the history of our company. Strong absorption of elevated supply in many of our markets delivered slightly more pricing power than we originally expected at the beginning of 2019 and resulted in 0.3% new lease change for the year, which was a 50 basis point improvement from 2018. ","And finally, in addition to the areas just mentioned, the company continued its trend of record-breaking customer satisfaction and online reputation scores. This strong positive feedback from our customer and the progress being made on innovation, we shared in the release, demonstrates that we have some of the best employees in the industry, who are passionate about meeting the ever-changing needs of our prospects and residents.","Looking back, it is clear that the fourth quarter of 2019 reflected a return to seasonal softness, which in some markets was greater than expected. And this was very different than the upward acceleration felt in the fourth quarter of 2018.","The good news is that the portfolio demonstrated resilience. And we are starting 2020, well positioned to achieve our revenue expectation. Moving into 2020, our same-store revenue growth guidance range is between 2.3% and 3.3%. At the midpoint of 2.8%, we are 40 basis points lower than our 2019 actual results.","This guidance assumes a similar occupancy of 96.4%, an improvement in new lease change of 30 basis points to a positive 0.6% for the year. And anticipated renewal rates achieved of 4.7%, which is 20 basis points less than 2019. Recall that these renewal rates will be impacted by recent rent regulations that we have discussed on prior calls.","In 2020 supply will be down considerably in New York, up in Boston and L.A. and mostly comparable in our other market, year-over-year. We expect consistent demand that should aid in the absorption of this new supply.","By market, New York, D.C. and Seattle are expected to deliver better revenue growth this year, while Boston, San Francisco and Southern California markets will be worse. So let me take a minute to reconcile the 40 basis point decline at the midpoint and the expected same-store revenue growth for 2020.","As stated in our last call, rent control in both the California and New York markets is expected to negatively impact our overall same-store revenue results, by approximately 20 basis points this year.","The remaining 20 basis points comes mostly from the incremental impact from competitive supply in our market and a view that it will be difficult in 2020 to replicate the occupancy gains we had in 2019, given the current high occupancy of the portfolio.","Attaining the upper end of our guidance range of 3.3% will be mostly dependent on rate, meaning that in order to achieve this outcome we will need to have strong pricing power on new leases early in the year and through the peak leasing season.","The bottom end of our revenue guidance range of 2.3% would likely result from declines in occupancy, due to softening in overall demand. Sitting here today the portfolio is 96.3% occupied the same as what it was at this time last year.","Achieved renewal increases for January and February are expected to be around 4.2%.","So now, let's move on to the individual markets beginning with Boston. So Boston continues to be a power center of the knowledge economy. Overall demand drivers are strong and the long-term outlook for this market remains positive. Our 2019 results of 4.0% revenue growth, includes gains in occupancy of 30 basis points, and strong growth from other income, mainly parking that will be difficult to repeat this year.","Boston is expected to deliver more units as we are tracking close to 6,000 new units in 2020 compared to 1,700 in 2019. These new units will be concentrated in the CBD and Seaport and are likely to have more of a direct impact on our portfolio performance. Our expectations for the market is about 3% revenue growth, and assume occupancy remains flat at 96.2%. We anticipate less growth from renewals and new leases given the increased levels of competitive new supply. And we expect the first half of the year performance to be stronger than the second half given the strong embedded growth that we have entering the year.","New York had a busy year-end with plenty of press surrounding growing tech expansion in the market and significant office leasing. This activity is fueling continued diversification of the local economy, which we view as a long-term positive. As 2019 progressed, operating fundamentals continued to improve in this market. We finished the fourth quarter with seasonal softness that resulted in a concessionary environment that was greater than we expected. However, during the month of January, operating fundamentals have improved each consecutive week, reducing concession use and improving occupants.","For 2020, we are forecasting better revenue growth, which should be a little north of 2.5%. Our guidance assumes slight improvements in occupancy and renewal rates achieved, but the majority of growth is expected to come from gains in new leases as pricing power returns to the market given the almost complete lack of new supply that Mark mentioned earlier.","Overall, demand for our product remained strong with foot traffic or tours in January being up year-over-year. The portfolio is 96.7% occupied today, and we are well positioned to seize improving market condition.","Washington D.C. continued to demonstrate strength in operating performance despite the 12,000 plus deliveries that we have become accustomed to in this market. Last year, at this time, we were discussing the longest government shutdown on record. But today both Congress and the President have signed a spending bill, which includes over $50 billion in new spending. This budget clarity and increased spending is expected to positively impact the region and continue to aid the absorption of 12,000 plus additional units expected in 2020.","Northern Virginia continues to be the economic driver for the region, having captured seven out of every 10 jobs created in the last 12 months in the area. Our portfolio results in D.C. validate this as same-store revenue growth in the district, which was near 1% while the Northern Virginia submarkets with approximately 50% of our revenue averaged above 3% growth in the year.","Overall, the market delivered 2.3% revenue growth in 2019. Our forecast for 2020 is a little better than 2.5% revenue growth with improved results mostly driven by stronger embedded growth starting the year as operating assumptions for occupancy, new lease change and achieved renewal increases are expected to be relatively flat year-over-year.","Moving over to the West Coast. Seattle finished 2019 strong with 3.4% full year revenue growth driven by 70 basis point gain in occupancy and consistent improvement in pricing power and revenue results throughout the year. We did experience concentrated supply pressure on the east side that we expect to continue into the first half of this year.","Supply in the CBD, which was not particularly impactful in 2019 will return in 2020 during the back half of the year. This provides an opportunity to establish rate growth early in the year and through the peak leasing season. It's also possible that some of these units get pushed into 2021. If this were to happen, it could strengthen our anticipated results this year.","Overall, we expect 2020 to deliver better revenue growth of around 4% and with similar occupancy, slight improvements to achieved renewal rates, and the majority of growth coming from gains in new leases as we capitalize on the current and near-term pricing power in the portfolio.","San Francisco delivered 3.7% revenue growth in 2019, which was driven by gains made early in the year offset by declining occupancy in the second half of the year that resulted in a full year occupancy of 95.9%. As we discussed on the last call, we saw a deceleration in this market as the year progressed and that trend continued through the fourth quarter.","The East Bay with approximately 40% of our 2019 new supply and approximately 20% of our San Francisco revenue was our lowest performing submarket in both the quarter and full year with revenue growth below 2%. All of our other submarkets produced growth above 3% for both the quarter and full year.","New supply in 2020 will be relatively flat year-over-year with the concentration of competitive supply impacting the downtown San Francisco SoMa and South Bay submarkets the most. Overall, we expect 2020 to have lower revenue growth of around 3% as we continue to work through the impact of supply and the impact of new rent regulation. Our guidance begins with around 50 basis points of lower embedded growth than last year; occupancy at 96.4%, which is a 50 basis point improvement over 2019; similar new lease change; and a decline in achieved renewal increase.","As we sit here today, leasing velocity in San Francisco is good. Rates are growing, foot traffic is up and occupancy has recovered to 96.4%, which is the same place we were at last year at this time. This market has the critical mass of tech talent. And while we expect some softness when supply is concentrated around us, the long-term drivers for this market remain very strong.","Los Angeles finished the year with 3.7% revenue growth, which was driven by strong performance in the first half of the year. As noted on our prior call, deceleration occurred in the second half of the year as deliveries came online and put pricing pressure on a number of our core submarkets.","For 2020, we expect Los Angeles to be our most challenged market as we continue to deal with the elevated new supply, implementations of new rent regulation and restrictions on short-term lease pricing put in place as a result of the wildfires. We expect to deliver lower same-store revenue growth in 2020 of around 2.5% with slightly lower occupancy, modest gains in new lease change that are back half-loaded and a decline in achieved renewal rate growth.","As we sit here today, we are 96.2% occupied in L.A. And while our foot traffic is on par with last year, we feel pricing pressure. One of the bright spots continues to be West L.A., which is home to the changing dynamics of Los Angeles as Silicon Beach flourishes and online media content takes hold in the entertainment sector, leading to good absorption of the new product in this submarket.","Our other Southern California markets, both Orange County and San Diego, are expected to deliver strong but lower same-store revenue growth in 2020, averaging around 3% with similar occupancy, slight gains in new lease change that are back half-loaded given the anticipated pricing pressure early in the year and a decline in overall renewal rate growth based on the impact of new rent regulation.","In both Irvine and Downtown San Diego, we expect to feel the impacts from new supply delivered in areas that will be very competitive to our community. With both markets sitting at 97% occupancy, we are well positioned heading into a competitive environment.","Moving on to operating initiatives, as you know, we have long been focused on running a best-in-class operating platform, which included development of some of the original, pricing, renewal and online leasing tool widely used in the business today.","As our industry undergoes another phase of significant change, we continue to identify opportunities to utilize new technology that will shape how we interact with our customers and manage our day-to-day operations going forward. Our focus is to harvest technology that best serves our customers, provides enhanced career opportunities for our employees and creates efficiencies in our platform.","We are currently in the process of executing a number of initiatives that fall into three primary areas: smart home technology, sales-focused improvements, and service enhancement. And while there are many opportunities in the industry to roll out new system, we are taking a methodical approach to implement only the tools and processes that we believe will create the best long-term benefit and value in our portfolio.","So let's review some of the initiatives in these three areas. So, first smart home technology. We have already installed over 2,100 units, and thus far have had success in generating a rent premium of $30 per month on these units. During 2020, we plan to install smart home technology in an additional 10,000 apartment units at an average cost of approximately $1,000 per unit.","We are focusing on properties where we think this technology will yield the greatest immediate result. This technology includes smart lock, a thermostat, a light switch, water leak sensors, and a hub that connects it all.","Moving to sales, our focus continues to be on improving the customer experience by leveraging technology, automation and centralization to meet their ever changing needs. We currently have deployed Ella, our AI-enabled sales tool to over 200 communities and we will be fully deployed by the end of March.","We have over 60 communities offering self-guided tours and have been receiving very positive feedback from both our customers and our employees on this new process. During 2020, we will continue to roll out the self-guided tour option for the majority of our communities, and we will be deploying a new mobile customer relationship management platform to improve efficiencies in the sales process and provide flexibility to our sales team.","Finally on the service side of the business, we are now fully deployed on our new mobile service platform, which means our service teams now use a mobile app to manage all of their work in real time. This allows us to use shared resources across assets and improve service personnel utilization by having specialists become focused on being subject matter experts.","This will deliver operating expense savings through less dependence on overtime and contractor use as well as improve the customer experience through real-time notification and resolution of maintenance requests.","Overall, the impact of these initiatives, are expected to deliver approximately $15 million in annual NOI contribution once fully deployed. It will take into 2021 to fully realize that contribution, but we have included approximately $5 million of net NOI benefit in our 2020 guidance. We believe these early stage initiatives will provide a foundation upon, which to continue to build our platform.","Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer.","Bob Garechana","Thanks Michael. This morning I'll discuss our 2020 guidance assumptions for same-store expenses and normalized FFO along with a couple of brief remarks on our balance sheet and capital markets activities.","First a couple of quick highlights on 2019. Our same-store revenue grew 3.2%, expenses grew 3.7% and NOI grew 3%, which is mostly in line with our expectations from the third quarter call. For normalized FFO, we delivered $0.91 per share in the quarter, which is $0.03 higher than the midpoint of our expectation. This outperformance was primarily driven by higher than anticipated NOI from higher than expected acquisition activity during the quarter, lower than anticipated overhead stemming from lower than expected employee benefit costs that also impacted same-store payroll expenses described on page 16 of the release and better than forecasted interest expense.","Michael provided color on 2019 same-store revenues, so let me briefly touch upon 2019 same-store expenses. Full year same-store expenses grew 3.7% in 2019 compared to our forecast of 3.8%. Notably, real estate taxes ended the year higher than anticipated at 4.3% as we had fewer successful deals conclude during the fourth quarter than we had expected. This was offset by lower anticipated payroll expense, which grew only 80 basis points for the full year. This outperformance was due to the significant improvements in employee benefit costs like the ones impacting overhead that I just discussed.","Now moving to 2020 guidance. For the full year 2020, we expect same-store expense growth between 3% and 4%. This forecast incorporates the anticipated 2020 savings from the initiatives that Michael outlined earlier.","Let me walk you through the major categories and drivers of our forecasted growth. At a little over 40% of overall same-store expenses, property taxes drive a significant portion of expense growth. We currently anticipate growth between 3.75% and 4.75%, driven by the continued burn-off of the 421a tax abatements in some of our New York properties, a slight decline in forecasted year-over-year appeals activity and a relatively healthy increase anticipated in Seattle.","For the full year 2019, same-store property taxes declined in Seattle as the state legislature took on more of the educational funding burden from local municipality. We've not incorporated this recurring in 2020 for our guidance.","In on-site payroll, our next largest category we anticipate growth between 2.25% and 3.25% for 2020. This expense really consists of two key drivers; direct salaries, bonus and commissions for our on-site staff and employee benefit costs like medical insurance. We expect to see a benefit in this first driver from the operating efficiencies that Michael and his team are working on. This will mute total payroll growth for the year. As a result, nearly all of the 2.75% expected growth in payroll is coming from anticipated increases in medical insurance and other employee benefits.","Finally, our last two major categories, utilities and repairs and maintenance. Each of these line items individually contributes about 13% to total expense. Each is also expected to grow between 2.5% and 3.5% in 2020. Drivers of utility growth are expected to remain the same in 2020 as they were in 2019. While we continue to benefit from relatively low commodity prices and efficient usage given our sustainability investments, we see price pressure in the service-related categories like trash and sewer particularly on the West Coast, which we expect to continue.","On repairs and maintenance, we expect to see another relatively modest growth year. This line item has seen significant pressure from increases in minimum wages across nearly all the states we operate in driving up costs for contract labor.","However, improvements in the utilization of our workforce, stemming from service mobility and other initiatives Michael discussed are offsetting this growth. Our guidance range for normalized FFO in 2020 is $3.59 per share to $3.69 per share. Major drivers for the change between our 2019 normalized FFO of $3.49 per share and the midpoint of $3.64 from our 2020 guidance include an $0.11 contribution from same-store NOI and our same-store properties based on the revenue and expense assumptions that Michael and I just outlined; a $0.01 year-over-year contribution from lease-up NOI with our lease-up properties generating $10 million in NOI for 2020; a $0.07 contribution from lower anticipated interest expense predominantly driven by the favorable refinancing activity we undertook in 2019 that I'll discuss in a moment; offset by $0.01 per share related to higher anticipated overhead, which we define as G&A and property management expense; and finally an additional $0.03 offset related to other items net, which mostly consists of other individually immaterial items like interest and other income.","A final note on the balance sheet. Our financial position remains the strongest in the company's history and one of the strongest in the REIT industry. 2019 was a busy year on the balance sheet front having issued nearly $1.5 billion in debt including the lowest yielding 10-year unsecured bond in REIT's history; upsized and extended our revolving credit facility with incredible support from our banking partners and with market-leading terms; and finally increased the size of our commercial paper program to $1 billion.","We also paid off approximately $1.8 billion in debt during the year including the early redemption of the 2020 maturity described in last night's release. These favorable financing activities are the drivers in year-over-year interest savings I discussed earlier.","For 2020, we anticipate issuing between $600 million and $1 billion in debt capital terming out debt that is currently on our commercial paper program or revolving line of credit. These outstandings are mostly the results of our net investment activity in 2019 and our early retirement of 2020 maturity. We have very manageable development spend that we would anticipate being funded from free cash flow.","With that I'll turn it back to the operator for the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America.","Jeff Spector","Good morning. Congratulations on a great 2019. Just one or two questions on 2020 and 2020 comments. Can you talk about the latest concession environment, I guess, in markets like San Francisco or other markets where you described some heavier supply in the first half of the year? Because I'm trying to connect -- I heard a comment that the first half should be better than the second half, but I didn't know if that was just in general. But it seems like at the same time there were some comments that supply is currently pressuring or there's some heavy supply pressure in select markets in the first half?","Michael Manelis","Yes, sure. Jeff, good morning. This is Michael. So I guess first I'll just say at the top of the house so concessions for us in our portfolio we tend to be more of a net effective shop. So even though I described the concessionary environment and it did cause us to use a little bit more concessions than we expected, on the quarter we were talking about $500,000 -- $600,000 in total concession used across the portfolio with the large majority of that kind of still centered in the New York market.","So I think when we think about markets like San Francisco or anywhere that we have this concentration of new supply we expect to see concessions in the new supply typically offering between anywhere between four and six weeks. And we monitor those concessions that they're offering in the marketplace as an indicator of their own velocity. So when we see concessions on new supply in San Francisco start picking up to eight weeks or they start going longer that's an indication that overall their velocity is kind of feeling some pressure. And that's what we're kind of -- we're responding to in the fourth quarter.","As I think about the first half of the year what we've seen is a lot of the concessions that we saw in pockets of New York and some pockets of San Francisco on the East Bay start to abate, meaning it's still present at those lease-up properties, but the stabilized assets around them are starting to use less and less concessions. And I've seen this now for the last four weeks we've been monitoring this as we progress through 2020.","So I think what you're going to see as demand continues to grow throughout the year like it normally does in a seasonal year, you should expect to see less and less concessions. And our portfolio for the full year we would expect concession use to be very comparable to 2019. And I think just given what we just saw in fourth quarter probably will be more front half-loaded than back half-loaded.","Jeff Spector","Okay great. That's helpful. It sounds like some positive news on the concessions at least so far this year. Can you talked about strength in foot traffic demand remained strong. Can you talk a little bit more about move-outs and anything new move-outs to home buying?","Michael Manelis","Sure. So I would just -- I guess I would say with turnover being down almost 200 basis points for the year the absolute number of move-outs is less on a year-over-year basis. But when you start to look at those that did move out and the reasons they cite for move out we really saw no change across any of the reasons. Home buying runs roughly about 12.5% of the reasons cited for those people that are moving out to buy home. And we saw no change across any of the markets that we're operating in.","Jeff Spector","Okay great. Because we noticed that some of the homebuilders have cited success with entry-level homes. And just confirm if you're seeing any change? It sounds like not. Great. Thanks for your comments today.","Michael Manelis","Thank you. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. How does the $5 million net benefit to same-store NOI in 2020 from the operating initiatives break down between the revenue benefit and the expense savings? And then what's the impact on both same-store growth rates this year?","Bob Garechana","Joe, I guess, I would tell you it's about probably a 50-50 split when you look at the $5 million between revenue and expense. And on the revenue side it's probably going to equate to roughly 10 basis points of improvement across the various markets that we're doing those operating initiatives in.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. And then Mark you talked about the cap rate compression between older and younger assets. What percentage of your portfolio or GAV would you consider older and that you could ultimately trade for newer assets if the opportunity exists?","Mark Parrell","Yes, Nick, thanks for that question. We don't have any more in the portfolio a lot of must-sell, if any must-sell assets. And some of the older assets are some of our best assets in places like New York and Boston. So it isn't always age but I did use that in my remarks as an indicator of quality to some extent.","I don't think there's a grand reservoir we have of capital. There are a few assets in every market when you have a $40 billion portfolio that have become less competitive and we'll look to sell those, especially when cap rates are this close between value-add and brand new product and we'll look to trade out to the new products.","So I don't have an exact percentage but it's a low single-digit sort of number. And then it's \u2013 for us it's just opportunistic. When we see cap rates like this so close together we're going to take advantage.","Nick Joseph","Excellent. Thank you.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. So just going back to the guidance, appreciate all the building blocks you gave on \u2013 to explain why there's a modest slowdown in same-store revenue growth. Yes, I think you said, you're assuming better new lease pricing and stable occupancy. So to me that seems like a kind of bullish indicator for the business that would suggest you guys could even push pricing even more.","So I guess what I'm wondering is, are you just being conservative in how you're forecasting your pricing this year? Or is there something else that's creating this dynamic that's not allowing you to push pricing even more?","Michael Manelis","Well, I guess \u2013 this is Michael. So I guess I would just start by saying I think the 30 basis point expectation in growth and new lease change is demonstrating that we're experiencing or we expect to experience growth. It's really just coming off of the deceleration in the back half of 2019 and the fact that now we're expecting kind of to recover and looking at where the supply is on us we think some of that recovery is going to be more back half-loaded.","So I think when you think about our guidance you've got to look at the full range that we have out there and understand that. Sure in markets like New York, if we continue to see pricing power return to us quickly and in front of the leasing season, we'll outperform that expectation. But I don't think it's prudent for us to sit here and think about all of the markets with all of the supply that we have coming at us to think that we're going to outperform those expectations early in the year.","Nick Yulico","Okay. That's helpful. I guess just following up on that. I mean, if I look at the track record of the company in the last three years you gave initial guidance on the same-store revenue that you ended up hitting pretty much close to the top end for three years in a row.","And so I guess what I'm wondering is what dynamic is different this year, as we think about the starting point versus prior years? I think last year you got \u2013 you and a lot of the industry got an occupancy benefit. This year it sounds like it's more of a better pricing dynamic? And I guess I'm just wondering what's \u2013 is one more difficult than the other to achieve?","Mark Parrell","Well, Nick it's Mark. Each year it's kind of a different year and stands alone. I mean our process this year in 2020 wasn't very different than 2019 or 2018. We asked the field for specific feedback on what they see maybe there's a lease-up right next door or they have renovations in the property and we'll get a little boost there. We also look at the top and think about macroeconomic conditions.","As Michael said, this year again we feel well positioned going into the year. We worry about the supply, particularly in some of our bigger markets. We did see some weakness as we've said in New York, late in 2019. So that positions us where we ended up going out with guidance. Could we do better? We certainly hope so. But looking at it, we try to balance things out and don't assume that everything will go perfectly well.","Nick Yulico","All right. Thanks, Mark.","Mark Parrell","Thanks, Nick.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.","John Pawlowski","Thank you. Maybe just a quick follow-up to the first question. Michael, did I hear it right that concessions in the Bay Area on lease-ups pushed to eight weeks free in the fourth quarter. I'm curious, if they've gotten any better or worse in January?","Michael Manelis","Yes. So I mean, I think they've stayed pretty consistent and stable. When I say weeks that's on longer-term leases. So we saw them kind of move around with the four to six on just conventional terms. And then they started offering some longer terms. And kind of we're just monitoring that.","I mean, primarily now you got Oakland where you've got more assets coming online. So it's a great kind of pocket of assets for us to watch the concessionary environment and it's been fairly stable. They have not been volatile in what they've been doing but they clearly started going long and offering a little bit higher concession rates for those longer term leases and that's what we've been watching.","John Pawlowski","Okay. And then turning to New York. Curious from your lens, how the kind of organic operating backdrop is going to be different these next few years after the rent control package was implemented or the rent control laws change. I'm curious if you're seeing anything right now in terms of market turnover your game plan on marketing expenses kind of vacancy and any early indicators that could play out in the next two or three years in New York that you're seeing happen today?","Mark Parrell","John before I let Michael launch into giving you that detail which is very important I think the overall comment about New York and what we've all read about just increased demand that's coming all of these tech relocations into New York, particularly in the west side of New York, where we have a lot of assets is very encouraging to us.","Now when they announce something it doesn't happen right that moment that they hire. But we see that. And in fact, our research is indicating research, we've seen is indicating there's actually more tech jobs in the New York metro area than there is in the Bay Area now. So, we're excited to be involved in that. And again, you're right we have to adjust to these rules. But the overall demand drivers in New York in the next few years feel really good to us.","Michael Manelis","Yes. And I'd say, right now, we have not noticed any material change from the -- looking at the rent stay properties versus kind of the market rate units or market rate buildings. So, we're not seeing any differentiation on turnover. We're not seeing kind of from an operation standpoint, anything yet that has manifested itself where we're going to be running those buildings differently.","Mark Parrell","Yes, and I was suggesting John I think on prior calls and our meetings that, we thought turnover might start to decline in New York because, with lower renewal increases, there'd be more reason for people to stay. Obviously, we only have a couple of quarter's sample size. We really haven't seen that yet. We're looking more carefully at our capital spending in New York, but we have a high-end clientele, so continue to maintain those assets well. So, I don't have anything to add there in terms of -- again it seems to us intuitive that turnover should get even lower and the term of our residents should get even longer, but we haven't quite seen that yet.","John Pawlowski","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks. I guess two questions. When you sort of think about New York, how does sort of the Jersey kind of Gold Coast play into sort of your outlook in terms of the rent growth that you've got in that part of the region versus maybe the city?","Mark Parrell","Yes. So, I mean for '19, it was pretty comparable, right, when you just think about the various submarkets between Manhattan, Brooklyn as well as the Hudson Waterfront. And I think going forward, we would expect kind of hopefully start to see pricing power return to Manhattan and see some market rate growth that could accelerate that beyond what we're going to see kind of from the Hudson Waterfront. But right now, they're pretty packed like really close together from a result standpoint and our expectations. But I think, you will see Manhattan start to differentiate itself over time.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. And then I guess second question. Maybe Mark, as you think about new development, it looked like you were able to buy some relatively new assets and call it the high 4s. And you're thinking about some new development starts. Where are those yields on the new starts? And how has that spread contracted and how narrow would it need to be for you sort of not to pursue new developments?","Mark Parrell","Yes, that's a great question. So, we are just constantly Steve comparing -- because, we are not committed to being either a developer or an acquirer. We can do either or both. And we constantly compare the two to see if it's sort of on a risk-adjusted basis, you'd rather just buy the asset. Even if it's at a slight premium to replacement cost because there's a fair amount of risk in development.","As we look at our development pipe now, you heard me say, we're going to refill it. Some of those are special events like we own the land already and we have an apartment building on it. We're doing a density play and so those sorts of things especially because on a GAAP basis, you have a very low basis in the land. You bought it many years ago. Those returns look great. And even when you market to market, they look really good. So, I'd tell you, in some cases for us, we're building all the way down the yields in the middle 4s.","There's a tower we're thinking of building on the West Coast that's more in that range. And our thought process is its just terrific product. We like the per unit cost. We like the location and because we're not a merchant builder where we have to hit the cycle perfect. And if we don't hit it when we get the CFO in a year or two, we can get pushed out of the deal. I mean, we can kind of build for the long run. So, I think I'd tell you, I don't worry about spreads altogether. I worry about just are we getting the right location, do we have exposure in that submarket, can I buy in that submarket, those sorts of things and then do I like the propound kind of cost and how are we funding it?","Steve Sakwa","Well, maybe to be a little more specific on the -- I think you said, you were going to start a couple of hundred million dollars in 2020?","Mark Parrell","Sure. So we've got about 500 or 600 maybe 650 will start, Steve. And so, I would say, when you talk about these JV deals that we've spoken about, those deals tend to have yields around 5% on current rents, so current construction costs and current rents. The tower I'm talking about is, call it a 4.6% yield on current. And again, we're still in the underwriting process, so that may change a little bit. But we feel again that we like the location and we like how that feels. And then you've got a few of these other density plays that we're doing that I would say, when you mark the land to market, feel like 5% plays or so on current rents. So that gives you a general feel.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley.","Richard Hill","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my call. A quick question. Look, it resonates with me about maybe occupancy being stable. And so, I think that new and renewal leases and the disclosure that you gave on leasing pricing statistics are increasingly important in 2020. So, I'm wondering if you can maybe give us a little bit of color. Do you -- as revenue growth maybe decelerates a little bit compared to last year, do you think that's equally from new and renewal leases? Are you seeing more strength in new or -- and\/or renewal leases or vice versa?","Michael Manelis","Well, I guess I would say we gave the top level guidance that would suggest that renewals are going to grow 20 basis points lower than the industry down to 4.7% versus the 4.9% and we're improving new lease change in the overall guidance.","So it's our expectation that you're going to continue to see this kind of convergence between new lease rate and renewal, so our expectation is we should start to demonstrate better new lease rate growth and kind of take the impact on the renewal mostly from the rent regulation.","Richard Hill","Got it. Understood. That's helpful. And look 4Q 2019 seemed weak relative to the other quarters. You obviously noted that that was a return to seasonality. We had also heard some color that that was a broad trend. Do you expect 4Q is going forward to be equally as weak? Or I guess what really drove that weakness compared to the strength that you saw in 2018?","Michael Manelis","Yeah. I guess, I don't know if I would say that it is weak. I look back almost like in 2017, we've gone back over multiple years to understand just rent seasonality, demand seasonality. And really what we saw in 2019 is it kind of just returned back to the norm.","And 2018 was the anomaly where you just had that strengthening of demand in that kind of later part of the year that allowed you to accelerate when otherwise you wouldn't expect to. So I think embedded in our normal guidance process right now for 2019 is normal seasonal declines in the fourth quarter -- for 2020 normal seasonal declines for that quarter.","Richard Hill","Got it. Okay. That's helpful guys. That's it for me.","Operator","Our next question comes from Hardik Goel with Zelman & Associates.","Hardik Goel","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question today. Bob, if you could talk about a little bit the expense guidance, how those ranges work and maybe talk about the big components like real estate taxes, and what you guys are underwriting in your guidance for that?","Bob Garechana","Yeah. So I mentioned in my prepared remarks there's really four large categories and real estate taxes is by far the largest. So that's at 40%. At the moment we're expecting 3.75% growth to 4.75% growth, so very similar year at the midpoint relative to 2019. The drivers of that continue to be a lot of the same conversation.","So that's the 421a tax abatement growth that we're experiencing in New York. But also what's unique in 2020 relative to 2019 and you've heard other companies talk about this in 2019 is that we saw a good meaningful benefit in Seattle, wherein Seattle absolute real estate tax growth was actually negative in 2019, and we're not expecting that or forecasting that to be the case in 2020.","On payroll, it's -- which is the next largest category, it's 2.25% to 3.25%. I talked in the prepared remarks about some of the drivers there. It really is mostly the medical benefit piece. The initiatives that Michael is putting in place is really helping us curtail some of that salary growth that we would otherwise have expected.","And then finally on the third piece, which is really -- or the third and fourth piece, which is utilities and repairs and maintenance we're expecting normal growth 2.5% to 3.5%.","Hardik Goel","Got it. And just one quick follow-up. If you could share kind of the blended rent growth you're getting in early in the first quarter relative to last year that would be really helpful.","Bob Garechana","So I don't have that. I have for the renewals that we're kind of expecting to be around 4.2%. I'd tell you from a new lease change standpoint, we kind of wait until quarter-end is to really look at that. But just based on where rents are moving each and every week in our asking rents, I could tell that we're seeing improvement in those stats as well.","Hardik Goel","Well, I guess, how about just January-over-January the new lease rate, because I know you mentioned every week was improving. So I'm just trying to get a sense for how much the improvement is?","Bob Garechana","Sure. Just from a base rent or amenitized rent standpoint, our rents today are up 2.5% over the exact same time -- exact same week last year. And they've been improving each and every week.","Hardik Goel","That's great.","Bob Garechana","Yeah.","Hardik Goel","Okay. That's really helpful.","Operator","Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.","Haendel St. Juste","Hey, good morning. So, I guess, the call wouldn't be complete if there weren't any questions on the regulatory environment. So I guess I could help on that front. My question specifically is on SB 50, the California law that would allow for denser apartment buildup around public transportation areas in the state. I guess, I'm curious first of all if you expect that to be ratified on January 31. And if so how might that impact your viewer plans for California development?","Mark Parrell","Hey, Haendel, it's Mark. Thanks for continuing the tradition. We appreciate that. Comment on SB 50, I think you described it pretty accurately. We're not sure of its prospects. We certainly are a big supporters of it both the company and the industry. I think having additional density near transit hubs and having that state-mandated is a good idea. I know the sponsor that measures made some changes to try and get support.","And having talked just recently to our experts on this, I can tell you we hope it passes. We aren't sure it will get through the state House. And we're sort of waiting to see what will happen in the next few days as you said, but certainly think it's a good idea. We don't think it will add to the road traffic much by putting it near transit hubs.","And if you want to make an impact, and you want to have three million or 3.5 million more housing units in New York as a lot of policymakers have said in that state, you need to start somewhere and starting with putting more density near transit hubs is a good idea.","Haendel St. Juste","Appreciate that. Thank you.","Bob Garechana","Thank you.","Haendel St. Juste","One more. I appreciate the comments earlier on your portfolio recycling plans selling older and buying younger. But curious perhaps where you're looking at -- and I know it might be a bit unfair on you, but just curious about the opportunity set in front of you and how much of the volume that you're contemplating this year that could come from new markets. You talked about perhaps Austin a quarter or so ago? And then maybe some comments on how the underwriting in some of those newer non-coastal markets would compare from an initial cap rate and IRR perspective versus your coastal markets? Thanks.","Bob Garechana","All right. A lot of questions bundled up into there. But -- so our average age of our assets is about 18 years old. So the portfolio is relatively young. And then again there is some SKU in some of our markets like Boston, New York where we own some great assets, but they're older properties. So I would -- like I said to the prior question say there's always a handful of assets that probably should be sold and we do have a handful of those. And especially when you get the opportunity to do that in a non-diluted basis, you should do that. And we hit the gas on that and we hope to do more of the same.","Based on what we heard coming out of National Multi Housing conference last week there seems to be a lot of demand. Some of the deals we're talking about are deals where the buyer may have a value-add thought process so we'll push that. In terms of just moving capital around a little, which I'll take is the middle part of your question we've talked in prior calls about having a little bit less exposure in Washington D.C. maybe shifting some of that capital to Denver. That's really a reaction to what has been consistent high levels of supply in Washington D.C.","That said, we're both a buyer and developer in that market and have announced both in 2019 and expect to do the same next year. We'll keep freshening up the portfolio there. But it is an area where we think the supply is pretty continuous. We'd like to own more in Boston and Seattle and we've said that on the call and maybe you'll see us lighten our load a little in California that fund those. In terms of new markets, we do like Austin. There has to be an entry point that makes sense.","Obviously when you do an investment pro forma, you start with your price at the beginning. And the price at the beginning for Austin is quite dear. There are assets that are we understand to be trading inside a four cap rate on current rents. That's pretty tight for us to buy into a new market. So there's a lot of markets, several markets that we're monitoring. And I guess I'd say in terms of how the underwriting will differ, well there's probably if you're being really honest some additional property management costs and running an asset away from your main platform. And we often take that into account.","And then the rest of it's market specific, how do you feel about cap rates, how do you feel about values, how do you feel about growth rates. We had an advantage with Denver because we knew it so well from being in the market for most of our existence. But these other markets Austin included we were in as well and have a recollection of how that market cycles. So I'll pause there. I don't know if I addressed what you wanted to address.","Haendel St. Juste","No, it's very helpful. But I guess ultimately I'm curious what type of IRR spread would you be willing to accept understanding that some of those markets might have in the case of Austin a lower initial yield, but perhaps operating efficiencies, maybe even better growth given some of the overall in migration job growth et cetera. So just curious how you think about the acceptable IRR spread perhaps versus the coast.","Mark Parrell","Yes, great question. So in our investor materials this heat map we've had for a long time which tends to be on page 16 of our materials for some reason every year has all the factors we take into account. I don't know that a market needs to have a higher IRR or a much higher IRR just for us to move into it. Maybe it has other benefits regulatory and diversification benefits for example. So I guess I'd say you've got to underwrite your starting point. And Austin is a pretty expensive starting point.","And then maybe to your point, you make it up because you think growth there is better than some of your other markets. Then you've got to think about how is it going to feel in 10 years with the amount of supply in market like that gets. So again, I wish I could be absolutely clear about what that margin needs to be. But there are markets we go into that don't need to do a lot better on an IRR basis, they just need to provide some benefits overall in terms of diversification of risk and their IRRs can be comparable to those in our main markets.","Haendel St. Juste","Got it. Got it. All right. Thank you, Mark.","Mark Parrell","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.","Alexander Goldfarb","Thank you. Thank you, and good morning out there. So just following up from Haendel actually on two fronts. So first Mark, just continuing on the markets, if you look across -- I mean a lot of the markets have converged around similar NOIs and similar cap rates, you guys obviously a number of years ago made an effort to focus on certain key gateway markets. And now you're sort of going back and looking at -- you invested in Denver, you talked about Austin.","Do you feel that this convergence that we're seeing is going to sustain where your -- the idea to go to the certain gateway coastal markets may not be appropriate for the next decade? Or you think this convergence is just temporary and the markets ultimately will go back to the ones that you guys have really focused on over the past number of years?","Mark Parrell","I get -- that is just an outstanding question and something we think can talk about a lot. You should always be thoughtful about your markets, while you were there before, while you're there now. So I appreciate the question. I think one of the things we think about is you've got such a wall of money going into the apartment industry is it distorting perceptions of returns and risk? Are there markets that are frankly overvalued relative to what they normally and probably should trade for on a go-forward basis?","So we look at the nine metros we're in now and say we like our customer, we like our CapEx spending, we like in most cycles the supply picture in these markets and nothing there has changed for us. To me, it's more like are there other new markets, where we can find our customer in abundance, someone Alex who is relatively affluent, renter by choice, who wants to live in an urban-dense suburban setting with a lot of walk-to amenities. Where we find those people, we will go to them if the competition makes sense, the supply and demand picture makes sense.","So I guess that's the way I think about it is are there cities that are sort of being promoted into the ranks or the markets in which we do business as opposed to saying all markets are equal. I think some markets are definitively not equal. And what's going on is just the wall of capital is moving cap rates and stuff to a convergence point and I don't necessarily believe that's permanent.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then the next question is on the regulatory front, yes switching coasts here in New York. I'm sure you guys have seen the press that Albany wants to go back even tighten the CapEx restrictions on rent control units even more to talk of a market-wide CPI plus cap.","I think I read 1.5, I don't know where. Ultimately they have it. But given what happened lessons learned from 2018, how are you guys thinking about approaching this year's Albany session which I think expires in -- or ends in June?","Mark Parrell","Yes. Well, I think in terms of recent good news the Governor and the State of the State Address didn't mention affordable housing. Our sense from what we've heard from some of our context is that, many in the legislature would like to see these new rules play out a bit and see what the impact is, before adding even more to it. We'd hope that would be the case.","And obviously it's difficult for us whether you're in New York or you're here in Chicago to predict the action of politicians. But we're working hard through our trade association. I think they've got real new energy and focus on this issue and having the right kinds of conversations to just educate people because this is going to do and already is doing the exact opposite of what they intend, it's going to cause disinvestment in housing, less supply and make the city less of the energetic place we all want it to be.","And that's just what's going to happen and is happening. And I just would say I think the trade association is even better positioned this year than they were before. But what exactly happens, it remains to be seen.","Alexander Goldfarb","Thanks Mark.","Mark Parrell","Thanks Alex.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Stevenson with Janney.","Rob Stevenson","Good morning guys. So turnover was 49.5% I think in 2019. What's the expectation for 2020? And how much of the 200 or so basis point decline that you guys talked about earlier what's the benefit to earnings from that given those spread between new and renewal leases?","Michael Manelis","So this is Michael. I'll start by saying I think our expectations for the year is very similar. We're not expecting it to continue to go down. But we don't anticipate kind of some reversal in the trend and all of a sudden see a spike in turnover.","As far as the contribution goes, clearly if renewals were producing a 49% and you had some subset of your resident -- more residents renewing with you that contribution was boosting the revenue lift for the year versus replacing them and absorbing the vacancy as well as kind of the new lease change at 30 bps. I don't have a quantified number, but I do know that lower turnover at higher renewal rates is a positive.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And then what's driving the gap between NAREIT and normalized FFO guidance? I think it's like $0.02?","Bob Garechana","Yes. So there's -- you can kind of see that on Page 30 of the release there's two items that are forecasted. There's $0.01 associated with write-off of pursuit costs. And then there's another $0.01 of other miscellaneous items that includes advocacy costs which we had in historical periods etcetera. So those are the two main drivers.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Bob Garechana","Okay. Thanks. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from John Guinee with Stifel.","John Guinee","John Guinee. Thank you. Big picture question. It looks like at the midpoint almost half of your FFO growth is coming from interest savings $0.07 a share $27 million in interest cost reduction. Should this make us nervous, one? And two the end result is you basically are getting about 2.3% FFO growth from everything else while your midpoint of your same-store NOI growth is 2.5%, which seems a little unusual -- that 2.5% same-store NOI growth translates to a 2.3% FFO growth ex the interest cost savings. Any thoughts?","Mark Parrell","Yes. John, I'm going to start, it's Mark. What happened in the prior year 2019 influences the numbers in 2020. So in 2019 we acquired things early in the year and we sold late. This year you're going to see -- we have a number of assets lined up for disposition that are going to occur relatively early in the year. So even though we're a net buyer and that is going to fuel FFO growth in future years this year some of that -- like the math you're doing is absolutely right. There should be a bigger -- your fundamental growth on NOI is in that 2.5% right? Your numbers should be higher on NFFO, but you're getting a little dilution from transactions.","And I think we pointed that out in the release you're getting a little bit of a headwind from transactions that is going to offset some of that benefit. The interest benefit I'll tell you just -- we continue to be able to borrow cheaper. I mean that's all very real. And I'm not sure why that's concerning in any regard. I mean the company's balance sheet is really strong and the percentage fixed the float is sensible and we have great access to all forms of capital. So I'm not $0.07 to me is good money and it's something we've executed on before.","Michael Manelis","So the vast majority of that $0.07 too John just so you know is -- so we're not changing the profile of the overall credit metrics. We'd expect the credit metrics at the end of 2020 to be very similar to 2019 on kind of all regards. So very healthy very strong. And the bulk of that gain if you will is already locked in by having paid off debt that was in -- five nano coupons with new long-term debt that's in the 2.5% to 3% range.","John Guinee","No, thank you. The obvious issue is that you're benefiting a lot from paying off above market debt and borrowing at market. So my question really is how much longer can that last? Is there still a lot of -- debt that on the balance sheet?","Michael Manelis","Yes. So if you look at page 18 there -- we disclosed for you in each of the maturity buckets what our weighted average coupons are. And you can see in kind of 2021 4.64% as an example. To give you a point of reference, if we were to issue a 10-year unsecured bond today I would expect that to be at 2.5% or lower. So there is still a fair bit of runway going forward.","Certainly, a longer runway than we had anticipated a few years ago because we didn't anticipate rates continuing to be this low for this long, but there is still some favorable refinancing opportunities which we've taken advantage of in the past and we would expect to take advantage of in the future.","John Guinee","Great. Thank you very much. Thank you. ","Michael Manelis","Hey. Thanks, John.","Operator","I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mark Parrell for closing remarks.","Mark Parrell","Thank you all for your time today and your interest in Equity Residential. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect."]}}
